<p>I made a change to the introduction, which initially described the blackface makeup as a "racist archetype". I changed the word to "racial" for a couple of reasons. Although blackface is considered racist today, it was not always considered so as the article indicates. Plus there are numerous examples of actors wearing black face make-up in either innocence or in tribute without racist intent - an example being <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Powell_4deb.html" title="Eleanor Powell">Eleanor Powell</a> in <i><a href="../../../h/o/n/Honolulu_%281939_film%29.html" title="Honolulu (1939 film)">Honolulu (1939 film)</a></i> in which she wore the make-up in tribute to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Robinson_85b1.html" title="Bill Robinson">Bill Robinson</a> (Bojangles). I also felt the use of the word in the introduction was a bit too POV for that placement. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:43, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the change. Even if the actors who wore the blackface makeup did not have malicious intent, they were still part of the general culture of the time, which <i>was</i> intrinsically racist. The wording has stood for many, many months without problem. Just a prediction, but I imagine someone will revert it very soon . . . . — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 04:38, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I guess no one else is monitoring this article, or people are in agreement? The subject is a complex one. Lott and Cockrell both argue that <i>early</i> blackface was about class more than racism. It was a fool's mask used by dancers and singers to mock the failings of a changing society. However, as Cockrell states, "Dialect blackface had become [by the mid-1840s] more a form of gross mockery — of blacks, of women, of the powerful too, to be sure — but a mockery that circumscribed . . ." (147). I don't have Lott's book, but he also talks about the racism of minstrelsy. See <a href="../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlackface_Lott_b5ea.html" title="Talk:Blackface/Lott">Talk:Blackface/Lott</a> for <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel's</a> notes from <i>Love and Theft</i>. Bacially, we've got 15-20 years of blackface as a class thing, followed by 150 years of blackface as a racist thing. The fact that Eleanor Powell dressed up in blackface in tribute to Bill Robinson is beside the point; that she was able to do so without public outcry says someting about the racism of the culture at large. So I advocate a change back to "racist". — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 17:00, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Brian, I'm monitoring, but I'm lagging by several days on my watchlist. I think "racist" is basically correct. (BTW, I haven't seen the film 23skidoo is alluding to, but I'll guess that the blackface in that film was not the full, exaggerated racial caricature of the 19th century and early 20th century minstrel show. My guess could be wrong, though. 23skidoo, could you weigh in on that?) Even in the early years where racism was perhaps not the central focus of blackface, it was based on racist stereotypes: the lazy and/or happy slave, the black dandy with airs beyond his station, the mammy, the sexually loose young negress. This racism was probably often unconscious, but it was racism. And it's not only in retrospect that the racist aspects are visible (although I believe that the actual word "racism" didn't yet exist). Frederick Douglass was writing about this in the 1840s. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:49, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do sign on to Wikipedia from time to time and monitor the piece. Of course, I am in complete agreement with the terms "racism" and "racist." (I wrote the language). By the time I got around to checking the piece, the passage already had been reverted to the proper terminology. (Thanks.) I think "racial" is merely a mealy-mouthed cop-out and is an inadequate (and virtually meaningless) characterization. The fact is racism was <i>always</i> racism, and blackface was most certainly racist. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:15, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlackface_1e4b.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Laundry list&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Laundry list"</span></h2>
<p>On two occasions I've added Bing Crosby to the short list of performers who have performed in blackface, and both times it has been removed with an admonition that it's not a "laundry list." I agree that the list, in that context, shouldn't attempt to be a complete list of performers who worked in blackface, but I think Bing Crosby should be added for a specific reason: not out of any animus towards Crosby (I like him just fine), but because of the inclusion of the comedy blackface number in the film "Holiday Inn."</p>
<p>"Holiday Inn" is still quite a popular film, frequently shown on Turner Classic Movies, especially around Christmas time (it includes the song "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas") -- which means that for a significant number of people, this blackface performance may be one of the few they ever actually see. Since the performance is integral to the plot of the film as made, it cannot be shown without the blackface number, so as long as it continues to be aired, people will continue to see blackface only in this context. (I'm not suggesting that the film, which is very entertaining and quite good, not be shown, but I do cringe when the blackface number comes up.)</p>
<p>For me, the question is not whether Bing Crosby should be included in the list, but on what grounds he should be excluded, given the probable fact that a sizable number of people will intimately associate him with blackface because of "Holiday Inn."</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this argument.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the pointer to the list, which I was aware of. As I said, I'm in agreement about the "laundry list" problem, but some criteria must have been used to select the three performers referenced (Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, and Bob Hope), and while I see the point of the first two, I'm not sure, given the influence of "Holiday Inn," why Bob Hope is a better choice for inclusion than Bing Crosby -- who was, before the Beatles, the recording artist who had the most Top Ten hits in history. Crosby and Hope were roughly contemporaries, although Hope lived longer, and they performed together frequently as a team (with Hope as the junior partner, since Bing was the more popular of the two), one would seem to be equally as powerful a choice as the other, except for "Holiday Inn."</dd>

<dd>Yes, it could be that I an overstating the influence of that film, but I don't think so.</dd>

<dd>(Correction to my original comment, not relevant to the point under discussion -- the Christmas song in "Holiday Inn" was "White Christmas." "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" is from "Meet Me In St. Louis.") <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">unfutz</a> 09:50, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't have a problem with removing Hope and adding Crosby. My main objective has been to keep the list to no more than three entries; as Jmabel points out above, there is a real problem here in allowing everyone to add their favorite or most hated blackface performer to the list. But, like I said, you make a good case for Crosby. Unless someone can make a stronger one for Hope, I say go ahead and swap the names. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 14:10, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, given how closely Hope and Crosby were associated with one another in the public mind of their generation, if they both did blackface we should probably mention both. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:26, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Blackface</b> is a style of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">theatrical</a> <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmetics.html" title="Cosmetics">makeup</a> that originated in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and was used to affect the countenance of an <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">iconic</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archetype.html" title="Archetype">archetype</a>, that of the "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">darky</a>" or "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html" title="List of ethnic slurs">coon</a>".</p>

<p>Since the words <i>darky</i> and <i>coon</i> are not direct quotes, should they not be italicised? If so, this article is full of non-quotes in quotation marks. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenBaker_d5ac.html" title="User:DarrenBaker">DarrenBaker</a> 05:14, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Darren. The problem is that many quoted sections in the article <i>are</i> direct quotes, song titles, or <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scare_quotes.html" title="Scare quotes">scare quotes</a>, hence my revert. You're right, though, that certain terms that are currently quoted probably shouldn't be, particularly those that discuss "words as words" (as the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a> puts it). I'd reckon that the following may need to be converted to italics, as you suggest: <i>pattin' Juba</i>, <i>corking up</i>, <i>blacking up</i>, <i>melodrama</i>, <i>Conguito</i>. One instance of <i>coon</i> should be in italics: "The term <i>coon</i> has been appropriated . . . ." Potentially, all uses of "darky" and "coon" should as well. But it's my guess that these pejorative terms are supposed to be in scare quotes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Names of people, even made-up ones or stage names, should probably not be in quotes <i>or</i> itallics: Jim Crow, Daddy Jim Crow, Toby, Golly x 2, Black Peter, Zwarte Pieten, Aukland City Dukes, Shirley Q.

<p>I recently turned the incoherent "the genre it thought to have played a role in shaping perceptions" to "the genre played a role…". I'm guessing that the person meant to write "the genre is thought to have played a role" but I find the qualification of this absurd. <i>Of course</i> it played a role. One can argue whether it was the predominant role, but I cannot imagine a good faith argument that the period's major theatrical representation of African Americans played no role in shaping perceptions of African Americans. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:06, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Similarly, I am restoring the phrase "blatantly racist" to the description of the kind of material to which we contrast Stephen Foster's work. This doesn't say that everyone in this genre wrote "blatantly racist" material: it says that some did, and that Foster's work stands as a contrast to that.</p>
<p>I have made several other similar restorations of material cut in the last two months; I won't comment here on them one by one. This seems to have been a pattern in the recent course of the article.</p>
<p>I will say one thing that makes me doubt that this has simply been the result of good-faith editing: at the same time this kind of thing was being qualified all to hell, the description of the actions of some white students as "presumably innocent" was turned into simply "innocent".</p>

<p>My son is white and has chosen Tupac Shakur as his subject for the 7th grade wax museum. He researched Tupac and wrote a short report about him. He is supposed to dress as Tupac for the museum and his teacher suggested he darken his skin for that purpose (with face paint). I am opposed to this as I feel it is insensitive to blacks. Am I over reacting? (Posted by someone using IP 71.120.129.96).</p>

<p>My first reaction is tell him, "Don't do it!" But, on second thought, it <i>is</i> for a "wax museum," and some kid with pale skin wouldn't <i>begin</i> to look like Tupac. I'd say it depends on what your son is planning to use to darken his skin and whether it can look realistic or just nasty/tacky/silly. If he <i>does</i> decide to darken his skin, make sure it's a fairly uniform shade of brown (not black and not streaky or smeared) that approximates Tupac's skin tone, that his lips, neck and hands are also darkened. Streaky or black pigment and naturally pink lips will ensure that your son's Tupac drag will be interpreted as blackface -- and there'll likely be hell to pay. Blackface is about a <i>stylistic</i> portrayal of black people. After all, back in the day, comedienne Lily Tomlin pulled off darkening her skin as a hip, afro-wearing preacher. Her drag was so authentic, it raised nary an eyebrow.</p>
<p>If you son <i>does</i> decide to go with darkening his skin, make sure he reads this article first. He has a right to understand what he may be getting himself into. One more caution: tell him <i>NOT</i> to attempt <a href="../../../a/a/v/AAVE_1b6c.html" title="AAVE">AAVE</a> while in character. Few white folks can carry it off, and it may sound like parody/ridicule.</p>
<p>Yep. No doubt this is sensitive territory. If you have any doubts about your son's personal discipline/understanding of the nuances involved and his ability to pull this off, I'd advise him to go paleface. Otherwise, your next best bet is to make sure he's accompanied by a couple of big, burly bodyguards and can fight like hell. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Minstrelsy was an industry entirely conceived by whites and entirely aimed at whites. It was an elaboration of various grotesque stereotypes which whites had about blacks, and mockery of black dialect. Some African Americans participated later on as composers and performers but that isn't really relevant. It has absolutely nothing to do with black culture. Contrary what Deeceevoice says, no-one is claiming that it would have existed without African Americans. But it was not inspired by African American culture and it is certainly not part of African American culture. It had zero impact on the African American community other than insulting them.

<dd>I don't see what you mean about similarities in the harmonies, care to elaborate? Minstrel show songs draw mainly on European musical motifs, and the later ones from the (white American) parlor ballad. Every genre of popular music from every nation has elements which are performed with gaiety, that doesnt mean they derive from each other. I don't think spirituals are universally or even mainly performed with gaiety.. ever heard of <i>Nobody knows the trouble I see</i>? (There are lots like that). <i>Black and White Minstrel show</i> is hardly classic minstrelsy.. Minstrel shows had already made way for Vaudeville almost 40 years earlier. B&amp;W was looking through rose-tinted glasses. It's true that later in the 20th century, some showbiz people tried to rehabilitate the Minstrel show in a way that they hoped would be more acceptable to modern sentiments by introducing real African-American music, and no doubt it was entertaining just as some original minstrelsy may have been.. but there is no cultural relationship. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 11:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Not so. Further, the various sources used in this article state otherwise, and it has survived months of editing pretty much intact and, as well, has been given featured article status. The African-American influence on minstrel songs of the period is clear -- down to the use of the banjo, which is an African-American musical instrument. And there's no <i>way</i> you can tell me "pattin' juba" and the cakewalking and buck dancing, etc., weren't African/African-American in origin. Further, Sterling Stuckey in his work <i>Slave Culture: Nationalist Theory and the Foundations of Black America</i> makes a compelling argument w/regard to the pervasiveness of African/African-American influence in the fiddle music of the day, which I've long intended to include in the article, but haven't yet gotten around to it. And then there's the ersatz AAVE dialect. There's no way anyone reasonably can make the claim, as you did in your edit note, that, "Minstrel shows had almost nothing to do with African american culture." The very idea is absurd. If you have sources to back up your, IMO, utterly groundless contentions, then produce them so that they may be considered. However, what you may "think" has no weight here. Wikipedia articles are not a venue for the expressions of what people <i>believe</i> to be the case. Unless and until you produce scholarly corroboration, the article returns to its previous version.

<dd>Again you are putting words in my mouth. No-one is making the straw-man claims you hyperbolically state, <i>re</i> the origin of the banjo, cakewalking, buckdancing, fiddle music or dialect, and it is silly of you to demand that I provide sources to refute these things when I basically agree with them. The point is, blackface shows around the world, including American minstrel shows, were overwhelmingly produced and written by whites for a white audience. That a small number of blacks were also involved doesn't change it. This is what I mean by <i>they have nothing to do with African American culture</i>. And whatever you may think of the phrasing of my edit note, the topic for discussion is whether or not blackface should be categorized as African American culture, a point you seem reluctant to address.. I hope that, before you summarily and unjustifiably revert, you will condescend to actually consider the question you are reverting. African American culture means what African Americans did and passed on to their kids, not what whites did to portray them. It does not include blackface by the furthest stretch of the imagination. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 12:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zargulon, I agree with you that something should be passed on within the African American community to count as African American culture. It's not enough that something be <i>borrowed</i> or <i>appropriated</i> from a culture for the resulting hodge-podge to still be considered a part of the culture of origin. However, blackface does indeed meet this definition. Blackface minstrelsy was popular with both whites <i>and</i> blacks for quite a <i>long</i> period of time. In short, it was the primary form of public entertainment for urban blacks, and it was the primary outlet for urban black performers. You seem to believe that the numbers of blacks involved in minstrelsy were small, but they really weren't. Black minstrelsy replaced white minstrelsy as the most popular form by the late 19th century. Read <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel_show.html#Black_minstrelsy" title="Minstrel show">Minstrel show#Black minstrelsy</a> for a more detailed synopsis. Furthermore, the tropes and stereotypes invented in blackface minstrelsy altered the path that black entertainment would take.

<dd>Ok, a sensible reply. I disagree somewhat about the level of involvement by blacks (I think 'replaced' is an overstatement) but this is not something I can prove immediately. We agree that the African American Culture category doesn't do justice to the fact that whites were the originators, or that the consumers of the entertainment were basically white right up until minstrelsy went out of fashion at the beginning of the 20th century (we can disagree about the proportion of composers and performers but I don't think it matters) or that the genre was at best a mockery of African American culture and drew on it only very superficially.

<dd>That's just it: I don't think we have a problem that requires a creative solution. Minstrelsy was <i>the</i> primary form of entertainment for urban blacks in the United States through much of the 19th century, and the form they most preferred was the form presented by other African Americans. The amount of "authentic" African American music and dance in minstrelsy is still debated, but the consensus seems to be that the dance was more black than the music <i>until</i> the addition of spirituals in the late 19th century; these are almost universally considered "authentically" black. Like I said, the article fits in both categories, so maybe we should just add it to both and leave it at that. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 15:00, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think blacks participated in the audience, at least not until the very late 19th century, before which the vast majority of blacks lived in the countryside anyway. But I defer on that issue for now. I would also like to suggest that, given that this article is about blackface rather than specifically minstrelsy, we might agree that outside of minstrelsy there isn't even a question of blackface in general being African American culture. Given the opinions expressed here, the solution of putting it in both categories seems reasonable.. but there is a problem, which is that African American Culture is a subcat of American Culture and technically articles shouldn't be in both a cat and its subcat. And yet the blackface of most of the 19th century definitely belongs in a cultural cat that is not African-American. You seem to be more experienced in WP than I am.. is there a way of getting round this?

Just by the way, isn't it generally accepted that (white) Vaudeville is a descendant of the minstrel show, whereas Jazz, the main form of black musical expression from the same era, does not draw on the minstrel show at all? I feel that underlines the case that the minstrel show naturally fits more comfortably into the white cultural timeline than the black one. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 15:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Brian Smithson is correct on all counts. (And I actually <i>do</i> remember Stepin Fetchit from old movies on TV -- before it was frowned upon to air them.) If you read the article, blackface minstrelsy was the primary outlet for black singers, dancers, actors and musicians for a very long time -- and the songs and dances they performed, as well as their humor, were authentic expressions of African-American culture. I don't know where you got the notion that minstrel music was so thoroughly European in origin or that African-Americans participated only marginally in the minstrel tradition. The article certainly does not state that, and there is ample information in the literature about black participation in the form. Finally, I didn't put words in your mouth; I quoted you <i>directly</i>.

<dd>I've just read your, IMO, faulty reasoning. Blackface minstrelsy had virtually <i>everything</i> to do with African American culture. And when I said Smithson was correct, I was referring to his commentary about black participation in the form. It has nothing to do with whether the blackface performanc etradtion was "passed on" within the African-American community (which it, indeed, was). Your contention with which I took issue was that blackface minstrelsy had nothing to do with African-American culture -- which is absurd. Blackface minstrelsy was a blatant rip-off of AA culture and clearly derivative. That's like saying white rock has absolutely nothing to do with black music. The contention is ridiculous on its face. They are both rooted in AA cultural expression. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:12, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, this is correct depending on what era we're talking about. The earliest stuff ("<a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_Jim_Crow_4615.html" title="Jump Jim Crow">Jump Jim Crow</a>" <s>and stuff by <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Sweeney_05e0.html" title="Joel Sweeney">Joel Sweeney</a></s>) seems to be deliberately based on black musical traditions at least in part. When you introduce <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_Dixon_c819.html" title="George Washington Dixon">George Washington Dixon</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Emmett_60fd.html" title="Dan Emmett">Dan Emmett</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Foster_7a97.html" title="Stephen Foster">Stephen Foster</a> into the mix, they are basically writing or singing songs in the Celtic-English tradition, only played on instruments taken from black folk traditions. However, fast-forward a few years, and we introduce jubilee/spirituals, and we're back to being mostly authentic again. The degree of authenticity in the music of minstrelsy is debated to this day, but this is the current consensus I've been able to gather. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 16:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're focusing solely on music. Even there, however, the banjo, an African-American instrument, was used throughout. Minstrel shows were more than music. They were humor, banter (in fake dialect or true AAVE), African American dance, and pattin' Juba; and the skits purported to mirror plantation/black life. There is no doubt that African American culture was at the heart of blackface minstrelsy. And to contend that it "had absolutely nothing to do with black culture" and "was not inspired by African American culture" is absurd on its face. The very fact that the song and dance "Jump Jim Crow" are African-American in origin and that the music is <i>syncopated</i> are clear testaments to the seminal influence of African American culture on the form from the very beginning. Finally, the contention that it has "zero impact on the African community other than insulting them" is another erroneous contention. As the article so clearly states, the minstrel show circuit gave birth to generations of black performers who they, themselves, or their successors went on to other performance traditions. <i>And</i>, as the article also states, the groundbreaking acceptance, appropriation and assimilation of AA culture that occurred with blackface minstrelsy is with us today on a far more amplified scale, and has shaped not only African American culture, but world popular culture. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 08:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, I'm agreeing with you. I'm just trying to clarify that it wasn't <i>solely</i> a ripoff of black culture, as there was at least an equal mix of Anglo-Celtic tradition in there.

<p>Actually, that <i>isn't</i> what the cited statement says -- nor is it what the article says. It says the appropriation of AA culture that occurred with blackface was a <i>prologue</i> ("an introductory or preceding event or development" - Merriam-Webster) to the later widespread, aggressive cultural appropriation of subsequent years. The article makes no specific claim whatsoever about the impact of blackface on "the current view of Blacks in pop culture." Rather, it speaks to the contribution of blackface to a stable of black archetypes/stereotypes and an iconography which remain today part of the American psyche and which endure worldwide, and of the precedent of aggressive appropriation/assimilation of elements of African American culture that shaped, and continues to shape, American and world popular culture. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 08:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Deeceevoice has monopolized this page, especially the confusing use of "affect." The sentence needs to be changed or a different word needs to be used in order to make the article much easier to read and understand. Deeceevoice is being ridiculous at the expense of a majority of readers. In past discussions he has been one of the few in favor of keeping the word, yet because of his persistence change has been unable to take place.

<p>Of all the hits this article receives, there are apparently from time to time one or two people who have a problem with the use of "affect." And, no. The word is perfectly appropriate. There's nothing wrong with <i>literate</i> use of the language. The next thing you know people will be carping about the use of "countenance". Not everything must be dumbed down to "Dick and Jane" language in order to be acceptable. And, no. There is no comprehension problem here -- merely the misguided notion on the part of some that they're making a correction, when there is none to be made. And when they are corrected, they get snippy. Skinmeister is a perfect example. It's not even worth debating. The language is appropriate. The passage is perfectly comprehensible. As with <i>most</i> possibly unfamiliar uses of vocabulary, the context imparts sufficient meaning so as not to hinder understanding. And if people need to pull out a dictionary once in a while to learn a new usage for a familiar word, or pause and consider what they've read, then all the better.

<p>Re Skinmeister's most recent edit: I'm open to a compromise, but "imitate the appearance" doesn't make sense. You can "imitate" something or "affect the appearance" of something, but "imitate the appearance"? <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 13:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, the new wording preferred by Skinmeister is apparently "create the appearance". As Deeceevoice pointed out in an edit summary, this doesn't parse well either. "Affect" is a much clearer word, I feel, and "imitate" and "create" really aren't true synonyms. I'm writing this in hopes that Skinmeister will choose to discuss this here instead of continuing to revert. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 14:42, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While some may think otherwise, I didn't simply revert Skinmeister's (and others') language out of some sense of ownership. I've read each suggested change <i>several</i> times and carefully considered each one, even leaving it alone and coming back to it later to make sure my judgments have not been hasty -- just as I carefully considered and revised my original language before settling upon the disputed wording. Nothing so far is an improvement. Unless and until someone comes up with something as accurate, I think people need to get over their insistence on "see Spot run" language and leave it be. Yes, people have become less and less literate, but that's no reason to dumb down Wikipedia to certain levels of ignorance. <i>No</i> publication worth its salt does that. Besides, as I pointed out, while there may be a slight cognitive trip for some, the context makes the meaning quite clear. The problem is not one of comprehension, but of some who <i>think</i> there needs to be a correction made when, in fact, the syntax is solid. And it's written that way because it works; it says what it needs to say. But, again, if someone can offer improved language, I'm open to it. After all, nothing's perfect. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 07:59, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For what it's worth, I'm firmly in favour of the "affect" wording - everything else that I've seen suggested reads very poorly. Just because a few people find a word difficult doesn't mean we should stop using it; rather those who find it difficult should (gasp!) look it up. 82.163.58.66 15:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Further, Powers, I would argue that even "affect the appearance" isn't quite on the mark. Affectation in this sense is tantamount to taking on a persona, <i>wearing</i> it. One doesn't wear an appearance of something; one assumes that identity, as one takes on/wears a countenance, a face. One can affect an accent, but not the <i>sound</i> of an accent. One can affect (or feign) a limp, but not the <i>appearance</i> of a limp. So, one does not "affect the appearance" of something or someone; affectation is more direct; it is a kind of appropriation; it is <i>becoming</i> or assuming that something or someone. One does not "affect the appearance of ... a darky"; however, one can "affect a countenance of" -- in effect, "assume the identity of." <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the characterization here of deeceevoice "owning" the article is little more than an <i>ad hominem</i> attack. Several of us (certainly myself and, I would venture to say, BrianSmithson) have been in consensus with her on every significant matter (and most insignificant matters). (I'd also venture to say that we are among the few people working on the page who have actually read multiple books on the topic, etc.) She happens to look in on this page more often than we do, so she generally responds first. It doesn't mean we are particularly deferring to her, it means we generally agree with her and don't usually bother chiming in "me too, me toooo" after each thing she says. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:50, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can understand the article citing this information once in the intro; WP is not censored when there is valid and notable information to convey.

<p>Note to deecee: "If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it." It's obvious that the use of "affect" is particularly confusing in this context. It doesn't matter if it may be correct because there are other options that are much easier to understand for readers. It needs to be revised, and the revision war needs to end. Deecee, please stop acting like this is your article: it's not, and you cannot continue to put your words in when everyone else wants something different. <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApplesnsauce_7a93.html" title="User:Applesnsauce">Applesnsauce</a> 14:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It sounds stilted to me. That phrasing makes it sound like we're contorting just to avoid saying the word "countenance". Dictionary.com defines "visage" (in part) as "countenance", but "countenance" is defined completely, without reference to "visage". That implies, to me, that "countenance" is the more commonly used word. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 01:42, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Both "countenance" and "visage" can be found as synonyms of a much more widely used word, "face"; Merriam-Webster does indeed define "countenace" with "visage." Visage brings up 21,300,000 hits on google; countenance brings up 7,910,000. 72.197.29.42 04:46, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Standing alone, "visage," I think, is actually preferable to "countenance," but I still don't like "simulate." It's inferior to "affect", and I think it's wrong to substitute an imperfect word simply because <i>some</i> people may not be literate enough to immediately grasp the use. Again, the meaning is clear in context. I made the change just to see it there for a while and see if it grows on me at all. But after reading the commentary here, I like it less and less. Still, for me, "affect the countenance" is the phrase that works. "Affect the visage" somehow does not. And, gee. Doesn't <i>anyone</i> find it the least bit strange that <i>no one</i> -- absolutely <i>no one</i> -- has objected to the <i>second</i> use of "affect" in the very same paragrah? It can't be <i>that</i> confusing, if no one has even noticed it. Again, this is merely about a few people wanting to quibble about perfectly appropriate syntax that reads just fine if you're reasonably literate with a decent vocabulary. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 08:19, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Endless amounts of people complaind about "affect"; a ton of people came in and changed it to "effect." People didn't notice the later use simply because they didn't read on after being so annoyed. The previous discussion points were about "visage" and not "simulate." Also, the original word I wanted was IMITATE, not simulate; you changed it to simulate. <a href="../../../a/p/p/User%7EApplesnsauce_7a93.html" title="User:Applesnsauce">Applesnsauce</a> 15:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm genuinely shocked by this attitude... "Imitate" isn't bad, but there's simply nothing wrong with "affect". 82.163.58.66 15:56, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The people who changed it to "effect" were clearly doing so out of a misunderstanding of the two words. It's obvious to you, I presume, that "effect" is certainly not an accurate word to use in that sense, right? That numerous people changed the word to "effect" simply tells me that they were unfamiliar with the uses of both words, not that they were complaining about proper use of "affect". <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 19:53, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Notwithstanding my remark above, I guess it is sometimes necessary for me to say <i>explicitly</i> that I agree with deeceevoice.

<p>I've always thought that the Blues Brothers--and I'm thinking specifically of the first movie--were a latter-day version of minstrel-show endmen: Jake and Elwood Blues as Mr. Tambo and Mr. Bones. If I'm not wrong (and please correct me if I am), don't their faces show up somewhat tinted in the movie? In the episode set in a black church, where James Brown is preaching and the black gospel choir is swaying and emoting, Belushi "gets da beat," so to speak; his burlesquing contortions are vividly reminiscent of the old Virginia Minstrels posters and the "good fun" that Eric Lott speaks about white men having when aping black cultural expression. The matching sunglasses and suits serve as a latter-day version of minstrel or "darky" rags, of the sort that Thomas Dartmouth Rice is reputed to have borrowed from the lame older African American man from whom he appropriated the "Jump Jim Crow."</p>

<dd>I don't remember much about the specifics of certain scenes in the film, but this reads like an über intellectualization of two white bwois into black music. There was nothing buffonish about the BBs; if anything, they were camp-serious -- two guys ("on a mission from God"). Further, the shades are an imitation of black cool (what Thompson refers to as "the mask of the cool," which is an African tradition, filtered through the African-American experience, commonly used by black jazzmen) and have nothing whatsoever to do with minstrelsy. Finally, if the BBs <i>did</i> appear with darkened faces, it is not the same as blackface, which -- <i>again</i> -- is a particular <i>style</i> of makeup. The BBs are no more blackface than the (now deleted) reference to a Japanese band who darken their faces and play R&amp;B music, or the Border Morris. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 08:10, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The statement "There was nothing buffo[o]nish about the BBs" is remarkable. When did you last screen the movie? The scene set in the African American church w/JB presiding represents Belushi, in particular, as the epitome of buffoonishness, the very incarnation of the term. Do "black folks have rhythm"? the scene implicitly asks. Well then, when white folks get da beat (as Savion would put it) it, they flip, jerk, do endless handsprings, mock what they crave, engage in helpless love and craven theft, burlesquing all the while. Your phrase "camp-serious" aptly describes one of the various modes through which contemporary blackface burlesque performs itself. The shades may, as you say, derive from black cool-pose, but here, too, you're off track, I think. The Ackroyd character, with his white (Canadian!) politesse and crisp uptight pronunciations, is the epitome of un-cool; Ras the Destroyer or Mezz he is not. In this he's a great foil to Belushi, who is somewhat more in the freethinking Mezz vein. The Blues Brothers are intriguing because they burlesque "black rhythm" AND "white uptightness." Yet even this claim is tricky, since Belushi himself holds down both poles of the dialectic. Nothing could be LESS in keeping with what Chernoff, RFT, and others tell us about African-sourced cool than Belushi's Jake Blues so overpowered with Da Beat and JB's preaching that he turns endless inane handsprings. Rent the movie again. You might find yourself agreeing with me. KudzuRunner 15:38, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it certainly seems as if you've given this a great deal (perhaps inordinately so) of thought. And, no. It's been a very long time since I've seen the movie, and, as I wrote earlier, I don't remember much about specific scenes. I could write a number of things about your commentary, but I think, again, you're overintellectualizing a funny enough movie with a silly premise. I mean "... Belushi holds down both poles of the dialectic"? lol And, no. I won't rent the movie <i>once</i>, if you please. Whatever you may <i>think</i> I wrote about the duo, and whatever you think about the film, while interesting, I suppose, if you're really into the film, really isn't important. As another editor pointed out, it's strictly your opinion, hence, original research. And, unless you can find some scholarly reference to corroborate your personal musings on the matter, on Wikipedia, that's a no-no. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 04:49, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm surprised at you, Deecee. Judging from your comments elsewhere on this talk page--not to mention your initial authorship (if I'm not wrong) of this article, I assumed that you relished intelligent debate. Yet when a "reasonably literate [person] with a decent vocabulary" asks you to actually look at the evidence, you refuse to. As I'm sure you're aware, many people in this big bad world think that blackface and minstrelsy are simply "funny" and "silly," and would dismiss most of what we're doing here as pointless overintellectualization. So let's put that aside and get back to business that we both agree is important. You're certainly right that my own personal musings are irrelevant here without scholarly corroboration. I'm not sure I can give you a citation for an article in PMLA, Popular Music Studies, or Semiotexte, but I've found four citations, all slightly-to-moderately sub-scholarly, but all making more or less the point I made. Here there, starting with the least sub-scholarly:</p>

<dd>"Worst of all, the Blues Brothers are continuing their domination of beth AM and FM, and never let it be said that because an audience is enthusiastic it isn't passive. Incessant airplay has long since drained the Blues Brothers' humor of its dubious charms, and turned their music into an oppressive, moneyed parody of the parody they started out with. The result is the same old American black-face minstrel show. When I saw Bo Diddley recently, his best lick was greeted with the cry, "Play it, Elwood!" Way back when, we would have called such a response racist, but we're all beyond that now."</dd>

<dd>"By now, though, there's something more than a little disquieting about the way the film wheels out its roots-music pantheon (Junior Wells, Wilson Pickett, Eddie Floyd, etc.) as if they were noble exhibits in some African-American wax museum. Blues Brothers 2000 parades its reverence for black music in an unctuous, self-congratulatory way -- it's an act of retro fetishism, an aging-yuppie minstrel show. The joke of the movie, of course, is that Elwood, in style and attitude, is really the whitest man in history. He just can't help himself -- he loves those blues. The joke, though, makes sense only in a universe where black music and white audiences exist on friendly but distant planets. That universe is long gone now (something we can all be thankful for), and it would be nice if this routine had died with it. "</dd>

<dd>"As far back as the 1830s lower-class white men (mostly Irish at the time) began to stage minstrel shows that featured plantation songs and dancing and rascist comedy routines that played off stereotypes. Of course the performers all "blacked-up" for the performance. Critics evaluated these shows based on how closely they mimicked actual African-Americans. Minstrelsy becomes the most poular form of American entertainment. Later after the Civil War, when Black performers joined some of these shows they also had to black up so they would look like the white performers.....Minstrelsy is always in the background of American popular music and culture. The first talking movie The Jazz Singer featured Al Jolson in blackface. Watch the Blues Brothers the next time they are on TBS. Akroyd and Belushi know that blackface is totally off limits so thay make everything but their faces black. Shoes, socks, pants, jacket, tie, fedora and sunglasses. The Blues Brothers are classic color-line crossers."</dd>

<p>Bottom line, there's no reliable reference that's been presented that makes the slightest reference to the Blues Brothers darkening their faces. This article is about <i>blackface</i>, using some form of makeup (cork, bootblack, greasepaint, etc.) in a very particular <i>style</i>; it is not about blackface minstrelsy, <i>per se</i>. The observations and debate about the Blues Brothers and blackface minstrelsy more properly belong in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">minstrel show</a>, because, clearly, unless and until someone can document where the BBs appeared in blackface, this discussion has no place in the article. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:04, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>The current phrasing (as of this comment) is "assume the visage". It just doesn't sound right to me. It's not an assumption, it's an affectation, and none of the proposed synonyms really have the same connotation. Maybe we could reword it so the sentence can use the noun "affectation" (an unambiguous word) instead of the verb "affect"? <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 00:10, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>I agree with the inadequacy of "assume." One doesn't "assume" a visage. It is entirely inappropriate to use an inferior, less accurate (and, frankly, in this context, incorrect) word simply because some people may be unfamiliar with the usage of the more accurate term. "Affect" should stay unless and until someone comes up with something better. And, as the string of synonyms for "feign" clearly states, the use of "affect" is completely correct -- which is where this discussion all started in the first place. So, are we to avoid using correct grammar/syntax in favor of a vaguely, kinda-sorta relevant term to pander to ignorance? No. Given that "affect" doesn't have so many other weird or off-point, possible connotations as "feign" or "assume," it remains the better choice.<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 08:22, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>This is certainly true. Africans in America had their own style of fiddle playing, more percussive than the European style.

<p>SM (and possibly a sockpuppet or two) has targeted this article because I'm associated with it. He has a habit of following me around the website making silly, unsubstantiated changes to articles just for the hell of it and then habitually reverting changes. (E.g., repeatedly upper casing "bell hooks" in two, separate articles elsewhere, and silly, groundless objections sources provided here.) Two or three entities have weighed in against the original wording of "affect the countenance" with various alternative phrases -- not because the original verbiage is inaccurate, but because they are unfamiliar with the use of "affect." They maintain it is confusing, which it is not. The only confusion is among those who <i>think</i> it is grammatically incorrect, when the syntax is perfectly sound. All subsequent suggestions (so far) of alternative verbiage have been considered, and there has been no agreement reached about any of them. I've reverted the language back to the original version -- because its meaning is precise and the syntax is accurate -- unless and until someone comes up with something better that raises no objections w/regard to accuracy/meaning. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 01:15, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The language is sound and, importantly, more on-point/accurate than anything anyone else has offered to date. Skinmeister's edits here make about as much sense as his shenanigans elsewhere. Frankly, it's quite clear that Skinmeister has not been acting in good faith here (or elsewhere). His pattern of stalking me around Wikipedia, of abusive language, personal attacks and of generally disruptive behavior are in plain sight.

<p>Is it just me, or is <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html#Blackface_minstrelsy_and_world_popular_culture" title="Blackface">Blackface#Blackface minstrelsy and world popular culture</a> chock full of very biased writing? It appears to be giving credit for all kinds of things to "African-American culture", often with no obvious tie-in to blackface. Certainly it's true (and well documented, I think) the tremendous influence that black americans had on jazz, blues, rock and roll, etc, but I thought this article was about Blackface, not African-American culture in general, and the language borders on hagiographic. Example sentences to illustrate the problem I'm talking about include <i>Virtually every major, new genre of popular music in the United States from the twilight of the 19th century to the dawn of the 21st century—from the tight harmonies of barbershop quartets to ragtime, to blues, to jazz and swing, to rhythm and blues and rock and roll, to funk and classic rock, to hip hop and neo soul— is a product or byproduct of African-American innovation.</i> and also <i>For more than a century, when white performers have wanted to appear sexy, (like Elvis); or streetwise, (like Eminem); or hip, (like Mezz Mezzrow); or cool, (like actor John Travolta's Chili Palmer, Johnny Cash, and ZZ Top); or urbane, (like Frank Sinatra), they often have turned to African-American performance styles, stage presence and personas.</i> Some of this probably needs to be simply removed, some of it may be arguable in a different article, but I'm struggling to understand what it's doing here. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:38, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first quotation is amply sourced. Have you even bothered to click the links? Further, that the performers listed adopted elements of black performance isn't in question, either. So, just what <i>precisely</i> is your objection? The point is simply that they are further examples of the ongoing appropriation/assimilation of African American culture as part of American pop culture -- a phenomenon that started with blackface minstrelsy. Again, what precisely is your objection? <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, for example, Chili Palmer- he's acting like an Italian loan shark. How does this equate to acting Black? The "stereotypical Italian" of that ilk would be prejudice against Blacks, not trying to emulate them. But, let's not replace the original research in the article with my own- is there a source for Chili Palmer acting Black? I don't see it in the article. The closest source to that was talking about Madonna. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:01, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually, there is -- the text of a "Today Show" interview w/Travolta. He was asked very pointedly by Bryant Gumbel, "Do you know how <i>black</i> that [Chili Palmer's persona] is?" to which Travolta admits he probably picked up the character's demeanor from the cool of black guys in his hometown high school. And, no. That isn't sourced. (At the time, I had intentions of obtaining a transcript of the intvu, but decided it wasn't important enough to me to go through the hassle.) If you like, we can simply replace Travolta with another actor. That's done easily enough, when I (or others) have some time. I'm assuming you've checked the links and your first objection is withdrawn.

<dd>Friday does have a point regarding the presence of that data in this article. It seems extraneous to this particular article, unless perhaps it can be tied in a bit better with the main topic. It does touch on it here and there, but a lot of it seems tangential. I have a feeling you're going to ask for specifics, though, so here's a few:
<ul>
<li>The sentence that begins "Virtually every major, new genre of popular music in the United States" seems out of place. I'm not questioning its accuracy, but what does the black influence on those musical genres have to do with blackface? If the intent is to draw a parallel between the white affectation of a black countenance in blackface and the white affectation of black musical styles a la rock and roll and R&amp;B, I think that's significant original research and really really needs to be sourced.</li>
<li>The paragraph that starts "Country music and humor, too, were deeply influenced by blackface minstrelsy" seems out of place, since the article is not about minstrel shows. We have <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">a different article</a> about that. Obviously the two concepts (Minstrel shows and blackface) are nearly inseparable, but "country music and humor" have much less to do with a particular style of makeup than they do with the musical and dramatic format of the minstrelsy.</li>
<li>"The precedent set by blackface, of aggressive white exploitation and appropriation of black culture, is alive today in, for example, the anointed, white, so-called "royalty" of essentially African-American music forms:" This sentence seems astoundingly biased to me, especially so without references. "So-called 'royalty'"? "Aggressive white exploitation"? This sentence badly needs to be re-written for NPOV and referenced.</li>
<li>"Pop culture referencing and cultural appropriation of African-American performance and stylistic traditions—often resulting in tremendous profit—is a tradition with origins in blackface minstrelsy." Again, this needs a reference, along with editing for POV (why the snide remark about profit, unless one is trying to make a point about white exploitation of blacks?).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There are some to start. This section is so rife with POV and unsourced statements I'm tempted to start a discussion on withdrawing the FA status of this article. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 22:15, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You raise a lot of issues, which I think -- forgive me -- strike me as essentially without merit. The article on minstrelsy addresses the format and content of the theatrical form of minstrel shows, which had pretty much died out by the first decade of the 20th century. This article examines blackface as a theatrical device and cultural phenomenon with far-reaching and enduring influence on American and world culture. The article addresses the issues of cultural appropriation, because it is part and parcel of blackface itself. Blackface <i>is</i> an appropriation -- of a "black" identity. As such, it was also a vehicle of cultural appropriation (and collaboration, which is also mentioned in the article). And what may seem like POV or bias are merely facts of history. If you simply google "black music white exploitation" or something similar, you'll get thousands and thousands of hits. (If memory serves, this point was addressed and resolved on the discussion page quite a while back. I believe I, in fact, provided links. I won't hunt up others, but such information is easily enough come by on the WWW with minimal effort.) And the fact that the exploitation was about tremendous profit is also another, salient fact. That was, after all, the whole point! It's simply part of the nation's cultural history. Not to equate the two in terms of their impact or callousness/depravity, but I wonder if you would you object to an article on slavery and a mention of the huge profits reaped from the trans-Atlantic slave trade as "snide" for the same reasons? Do you have some objection to stating objective fact? Precisely what is wrong or "POV" with "[making] a point about [or simply stating the obvious and incontestible fact of] white exploitation of blacks"? I don't get it, but perhaps you can explain.</p>
<p>I'm crunching some major deadlines this week and don't expect to be around for much of the next, but I'll be happy to address your concerns upon my return. In the interim, there may be other contributors to the framing of the article -- and other editors, as well -- who'd like to comment. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 12:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well that's just it, deeceevoice. The article can't say that white exploitation of blacks is obvious and incontestible without referencing some sort of source. And telling me to go Google it is pointless because the question is not whether I believe it or not, it's whether the article's points are verifiable with reliable sources. And right now, the reader of that section of the article has no way to verify that claim, nor the claim that blackface is at all related. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 14:42, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Okay. I (and others) am likely guilty of assuming too much when it comes to knowledge on the part of the reader and, as a consequence, not putting in sufficent references. But, uh, excuse me. Don't twist my meaning. I mentioned googling the point, because you seemed to think it "astoundingly biased" and "POV," or somehow trumped up. What you also wrote was that it "need[ed] editing for POV (<i>why the snide remark about profit, unless one is trying to make a point about white exploitation of blacks?)</i>." I assume you're dropping that particular objection -- that mention of the fact is somehow gratuitous/superfluous -- and the mischaracterization of the information as "snide"? <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The section I called "astoundingly biased" referred to "white exploitation and appropriation of black culture". What's biased about it is a) the assertion that it's "aggressive"; b) the assertion that it's "alive today"; c) the implied assertion that swing, jazz, rock-and-roll, and blues are "essentially African-American" (I'll concede the last but not the first three); d) the description of particular white performers of said music forms as "anointed" (by whom?) and "so-called 'royalty'"; and e) the assertion that blackface, as a performance style, influenced this later appropriation. They're biased because the language is needlessly antagonistic and the opposing views -- that white people contributed equally to the development of rock-and-roll, as one example -- are not even mentioned, while the views that are mentioned aren't referenced. The aside about profit is biased because it implies that profit was the main motivation behind the appropriation without providing a reference or an alternative. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 17:53, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I wrote the particular language you're referring to, and I admittedly tend to view these as African-American genres, because they are innovations of African American artistic genius. I suppose the language can be tweaked to characterize them in that way. And "so-called 'royalty'" only because they aren't <i>actual</i> royalty; it's strictly a naming convention. Further, I don't know that it's necessary to say by whom, whether by agents, fans, critics, or (as in the case of Paul Whiteman) self-referentially. I didn't add attributions, because I didn't deem it important and, further, such information isn't always clear. And, while some <i>may</i> argue that white people have contributed equally to rock 'n' roll, the trendsetters and innovators in all the named forms overwhelmingly have been African American, as these forms are indigenous, if often somewhat syncretic, expressions of African American culture. And of <i>course</i> profit was certainly a, if not <i>the</i>, motivating factor -- in blackface minstrelsy itself, as well as the often outright ruthless exploitation of black musical genius. It's got nothing to do with bias. Songs being "covered" by white artists, with artistically inferior versions promoted over the originals; white musicians in front-row seats in jazz clubs, transcribing jam sessions and riffs of African-American musicians -- music that later would show up on recordings that garnered huge profits for industry moguls; the one-sided recording contracts made with composers and performers. Again, it's all a well-known, well-documented fact of American music history. And, yes. When I have time, I'll provide a couple of brief citations. But, no. To include the information is neither "snide" nor "POV"/"biased." It's merely factual.</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, I had to cancel my trip. (Bummer.) I thought I explained this sufficiently in my edit notes. This isn't the first time someone has entered Darky Toothpaste in error as an example of darky iconography or as relevant to blackface. The article you consulted on Wikipedia was incorrect (no surprise there). I am a collector of what is loosely termed "black americana" and am in possession of a tube of Darkie Toothpaste. I'm familiar with its history. It is <i>not</i> a depiction of a white man in blackface; it is a depiction of a black man. (See the corrections I've made to the article.) Furthermore, the depiction of the black man is <i>not</i> done in the darky iconographical style; it isn't even stereotypical, so it does not apply here. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 15:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

An IP editor has added references to the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darlie.html" title="Darlie">Darlie</a> article that certainly indicate that the iconography was seen as 'darkie' or 'blackface', if not molding to the exact definitions. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 15:55, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You made a reference to the Wikipedia article, and it erroneously said the box was the image of a white man in blackface -- which was later contradicted in the same article. ("The package showed a smiling image of a man in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">blackface</a> who looked like <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jolson_c543.html" title="Al Jolson">Al Jolson</a>.") Thanks for calling my attention to it, because I've corrected the misinformation.</p>
<p>And I <i>have</i> a box of the older toothpaste. Blackface is blackface. Either the image has artificially enlarged big, white (pink or red lips) lips and artificially blackened skin and abnormally large, round eyes or it doesn't. The image of the black man on the box is a realistic one -- and <i>not</i> darky iconography. It doesn't belong in the article. In fact, if the toothpaste were named "Shine Toothpaste," we wouldn't even be having this discussion. It's not blackface; it is <i>not</i> darky iconography. And this is not an article about the term "darky" -- where such a reference would be more appropriate. If you have any further questions or objections, I'd appreciate a continuation of the discussion here, rather than another, inappropriate revert. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 05:54, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The only one making repeated reversions is you, Deeceevoice. I reverted you once and then brought the discussion here. Anyway, as I'm sure you're aware, black people can wear blackface as well as white people can; that the man on the box "looked like Al Jolson" doesn't necessarily mean it was supposed to be a white man in blackface. The image on the Darkie box, as far as I can see, does indeed have large, round eyes (not abnormally so, as in the illustrated examples, but it is on a scale with the real-life blackface performers pictured elsewhere in the article). The abnormally large, light-colored lips are indeed missing, but the box is trying to highlight the teeth; light-colored lips would have gotten in the way, and the bright white teeth are enough to trigger the same associations in the mind. Of course, this reasoning is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> of the highest order on my part, but I've found a few <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to back up the claim that Darkie's logo was "blackface" -- <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520213807&amp;id=ll0muUld_I8C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;sig=HjYb3P_-yp-mQQEJB3PLov1Eg88" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520213807&amp;id=ll0muUld_I8C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;sig=HjYb3P_-yp-mQQEJB3PLov1Eg88" rel="nofollow"><i>Blackface, White Noise</i> by Michael Rogin</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0030006597&amp;id=CVhEe-0IbhUC&amp;q=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;dq=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;pgis=1" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0030006597&amp;id=CVhEe-0IbhUC&amp;q=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;dq=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;pgis=1" rel="nofollow"><i>Global Busniess</i> by Michael R Czinkota and Ilkka A Ronkainen</a>. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 13:11, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The man on the box is doing a "Satchmo" -- the wide grin, the wide eyes. It's not a caricature. It's not stereotypical. It's nowhere <i>near</i> darky iconography. In fact, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that that is what it is. The first article merely states the logo was conceived after someone saw a performance by Al Jolson. The association must have been that of the "darky" (all too often in those days, an off-hand and commonly accepted slur for black people) -- not blackface, <i>per se</i> -- because that early image is <i>clearly</i> that of a black man, not a white man in blackface. It is a common association. Toothpaste makes one's teeth as white as those of a darky. Gold Dust Twins detergent gets things that are soiled black as their skin white and clean. Nowhere does the first article state that the first depiction is that of Al Jolsen in blackface, because it clearly isn't.</p>
<p>The second source states the product is "packaged in a box that features a likeness of Al Jolson in blackface." There appears to be no substantiation for this claim -- merely an assumption, based on the earlier contention that the first image was Jolson-inspired. Further, it makes no sense. The purpose of the use of a Louis Armstrong look-alike on the first box is the clear implication that, as is mentioned in the mockumentary CSA, "Darkie toothpaste will make your teeth as white as a jigaboo's." (It was a common, tasteless joke/slur directed at black people at night to "smile, boy, so we can see you," or, "so we can see where we're goin'."</p>
<p>And at least one source, the website of the Museum of Public Relations, flat-out contradicts the Al Jolson look-alike claim <a href="http://www.prmuseum.com/kendrix/abroad.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prmuseum.com/kendrix/abroad.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and appears to have been the basis for the information presented in the Wikipedia article. As the article states -- and stated before I came to it -- the clearly black image was changed to one of a less stereotypical-looking black person -- but <i>not</i> to an image of Al Jolson, which -- again -- would make no sense. If they were going to use Al Jolson, they would have done so with the <i>first</i> logo. But, again, the advertising message directed at people was if they wanted their smiles "jigaboo (or "darky") white," to use Darkie Toothpaste. The new image was toned down and made more contemporary, following the general trend of other products, like Aunt Jemima -- an image which has changed startlingly over the decades.</p>
<p>Given the conflicts in information on the record about the history and nature of this image -- with the distinct likelihood that it has <i>absolutely nothing</i> all all to do with blackface -- and the fact that it is not at all critical to the article (we don't need a laundry list of examples, after all), I'd say leave it out. It's unnecessary, simply causes undue controversy/conflict and, most importantly, possibly introduces misinformation. We can do without it. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I agree that it's not strictly necessary, although "undue controversy/conflict" seems an odd justification, considering you're the only one who's objected to it so far. Anyway, I simply cannot accept that it has <i>absolutely nothing</i> at all do with "blackface", simply because nearly every reference I've found has described it as a blackface image. Obviously, it's not Al Jolson himself; that'd be a copyright violation. But it was apparently inspired by Al Jolson, or a similar blackface performer, and its similarities to darky iconography of the day is unmistakeable to this layman (especially when compared to the updated logo, which still depicts a black man but without the characterstics deemed objectionable from the old one). Still, all that said, you're right that we ought to go with definite examples moreso than ones to which a reasonable objection can be raised. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 19:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Powers, the image of the black man is just that -- an image of a black man. If the same image had appeared on a Louis Armstrong album (it looks a good deal like the man), no one would have winced. Armstrong had bulgy eyes when he opened them wide and grinned broadly; it was part of his shtick. For my money, the image was that of Louis Armstrong. So, you're saying any black man with dark skin and prominent eyes looks like a darky icon? I don't think so. The depiction is that of a perfectly normal-looking black man, but one depicted in a somewhat unflattering and stereotypical (the cheesin' grinnin &amp; skinnin' black) manner. Thanks for your interest in the article, though. And I appreciate your understanding that the allusion should simply not be included in the article. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:38, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>JFAS, the point in calling attention to the apparent lack of substantiation for the claim is that there is no verification of the source of the inspiration. Too, the Jolson account is <i>also contradicted</i> by at least one other written report -- that of a website purporting to specialize in public relations/PR/advertising-related matters. Furthermore, it is <i>quite clear</i> -- and I've said as much -- that the image on the package is that of a blackman -- a "darky/darkie" in the racist parlance of the times. <i>But,</i> <b>again</b><i>, the name of the product is not the issue here. The issue is whether it is of a man in blackface.</i> There's no indication the first black man is in blackface. In fact, it makes no sense that he would be -- as I've explained above. And the later image, that of a lighter-skinned black man is <i>clearly</i> not blackface. And even if one accepts the specious and completely counterintuitive misapprehension that the second image is of Al Jolson, he also very clearly is not in blackface. So, what's the relevance to the article?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given the fact that whether or not Darkie Toothpaste is mentioned in the article is pretty irrelevant to the coherence and quality of the piece, and that accuracy of information is important, it is best to leave the disputed matter of the image completely out of the article. Again, there is absolutely no need to do a laundry list of products that utilized darky iconography (and this one clearly doesn't). If, however, the other editors feel there is a compelling need to include one more product in the article as an example, I will happily take a look at my collection for an incontestible example and insert it. But I, frankly, do not believe it is necessary. <i>Again</i>, the article is perfectly fine without it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>IMO, clearly, a few of the same old actors have descended upon the article intent upon screwing with it. And that's fine. I couldn't care less.

<dd>This article devotes itself, by virtue of the description in the opening paragraphs, to the specific phenomenon of blackface as a very specific style of racial caricature, that of the darky, or coon. This article does <i>not</i> treat the various and sundry techniques used by thespians and others over time to darken their skins to portray a particular character. The fact that other authors have chosen to do so for a particular book, essay or other work has nothing to do with the structure and content of this particular article, the focus of which is <i>clearly</i> a very specific tradition with its origins in the U.S.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you wish to deal with the phenomenon of skin darkening, generally, as a technique of theatrical makeup, then I suggest another article and/or a mention of the matter, as with Ganguro, in the "Compare" section. (Frankly, I don't see the point, but it's on you. To follow your thinking, one could include in the "blackface" article something on white folks spray tanning, or tanorexia here -- which is absurd.) This piece is already very lengthy and, again, very specific in nature. Inclusion of extraneous, unrelated forms of skin darkening would only detract from the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the list of performers mentioned was a collaborative process. And their "some kind of connection to blackface" is stated in the first paragraph. If you wish to question the inclusion of specific people in that list, then do so here, and those of us who contributed to the article will respond. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 07:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It almost sounds like you're trying to have it both ways, Deeceevoice. You dismiss the Blues Brothers references because there are no "reliable reference that's been presented that makes the slightest reference to the Blues Brothers darkening their faces." Yet you want to include the references to Goodman, Elvis, and the like despite the complete and utter absence of blackface makeup.

<dd>Sorry, Powers. Not so. The section treating those people is all about how blackface was a precedent-setting phenomenon of appropriation/collaboration. The people mentioned are artists along that continuum. The Blues Brothers aren't serious artists in the traditional sense of the term and not sufficiently illustrative of the depth and breadth of the phenomenon in terms of fame or virtuosity/artistry. They're an SNL act that got extended into a movie with a one- or two-joke premise (like most of the movies that are spinoffs from SNL). If anything, they're a <i>parody</i> of the phenomenon, rather than the phenomenon itself. As I said earlier, it's been <i>ages</i> since I've seen the movie, and, while it was amusing enough, I've no real desire to subject my senses to it again to try to see it in another light. Again, the allusions to blackface minstrelsy vis-a-vis the Blues Brothers are purely about the shtick, the running gag of two, lame white-bwois doing black music -- not about them blackening their faces, not about serious, prominent artists who have appropriated (or, if you prefer, "borrowed" or "adopted", or "assimilated") black performance and stylistic innovations into their work. Therefore, they do not merit inclusion here. However -- again -- if one wished to include mention of them in the article on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">minstrel show</a>, then that might make sense, given the interesting (though still irrelevant to this article) citations provided here in the discussion. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 14:54, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All I'm saying is that your stated objection to the Blues Brothers mention was that they never used blackface makeup. Under that metric, the entire "Blackface minstrelsy and world popular culture" section needs to go. Now, I'm not saying that's necessarily the direction we need to go with it, but that's what your words implied. If you intend that section to be about the results of the blackface precedent of appropriation and collaboration, then the section really needs to be rewritten to discuss that, rather than its current tone of focusing mainly on minstrelsy's legacy, and generic appropriation of black style (as opposed to specifically that of minstrelsy or blackface). <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 18:18, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In 1985 when Colgate-Palmolive bought Darkie Toothpaste from Hong Kong's Hazel &amp; Hawley Chemical Co., the new owner inherited not only a leading brand but also a racist name and logo featuring a grinning caricature in blackface and a top hat.<a href="http://www.pokezam.com/newsletter/issue3.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pokezam.com/newsletter/issue3.php" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Darkie brand's Al Jolson-inspired logo, a grinning caricature in blackface and a top hat, was as offensive as its name. <a href="http://www.toothpasteworld.com/specials.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toothpasteworld.com/specials.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>

<p>Colgate-Palmolive Co. has announced that it will rename Darkie, a popular toothpaste that it sells in Asia, and redesign its logo, a ministrel in blackface. The Darkie name and logo were conceived in the 1920's after Hawley and Hazel's chief executive visited the United States and saw the singer Al Jolson. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520213807&amp;id=ll0muUld_I8C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;sig=HjYb3P_-yp-mQQEJB3PLov1Eg88" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520213807&amp;id=ll0muUld_I8C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=darkie+toothpaste+blackface&amp;sig=HjYb3P_-yp-mQQEJB3PLov1Eg88" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></p>

<p>The connection between the Blues Brothers, Othello and Blackface is backed up by a number of reliable sources as well, yet you insist on the exclusion of this information based on some subjective and self-contradictory reasoning only. Furthermore, not even one source you added to the article draws a connection between ZZ Top/Elvis/Eminem/etc. and the blackface tradition. Cultural appropriation? Yes. Blackface? Nope. Unless you can provide a source which clearly states that cultural appropriation per se has it's origin in blackface, these passages need to be removed and moved to the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_appropriation.html" title="Cultural appropriation">cultural appropriation</a> article.</p>

<dd>CoYep, you've presented absolutely no new information. The image may be stereotypical, but it is <i>still</i> not darky iconography; it doesn't merit inclusion.

<p>Hey, folks. I haven't been able to follow this debate thoroughly, but I would like to pipe in on the notion of blackface precursors. Dale Cockrell in his <i>Demons of Disorder</i> does spend a good deal of time investigating roots of blackface in <i>Othello</i>, <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumming.html" title="Mumming">mumming</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border_Morris_51f4.html" title="Border Morris">border Morris</a>, and other blackened-face traditions. Hans Nathan does some of this in his <i>Dan Emmett and the Rise of Early Negro Minstrelsy</i> as well. Deeceevoice has a good point in that these earlier blackened-face traditions are not so much about ridicule as the later blackface is, but it might be worth at least a cursory mention of them as being possible precursors. The Cockrell book is currently somewhere in the Pacific Ocean on its way to me, so I unfortunately cannot provide more specific information at this time. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 00:59, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, all this was discussed earlier in the evolution of the article. All of these face-darkening traditions you've mentioned are Western/European in origin. What about in India? Indonesia? China? Elsewhere? Wikipedia is international in scope, so including information about Western cultural traditions unrelated to blackface but merely similar (as those already mentioned in the "Compare" section, Ganguro and Border Morris among them) would demand mention of an ever-growing list of those from other cultural tradtions, as well. And because <i>none</i> of that information is essential to the article and is clearly defined out of it by the lead paragraph, it was decided to simply not deal with them at all in an already lengthy article. You want an ever-growing list of this and that practice in which people darken/have darkened their faces as part of cultural traditions that are completely unrelated to blackface? Fine. This article is already 42 kb long, over the recommended average by 10 kb. Such added information, is wholly unnecessary and, IMO, unwise. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 09:23, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's just it: Cockrell, Nathan, and presumably others have argued that Morris dancing, mumming, and <i>Othello</i> <i>are</i> related to blackface. No one to my knowledge has argued the same about <i>ganguro</i> and the like. In the end, though, I'm only saying that a line about this relationship might satisfy all parties. I'll propose something when the book arrives. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 10:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's why ganguro isn't under "See also," but compare -- as a form of skin darkening, but one which isn't related to blackface as a cultural phenomenon. If the connection can be proven, then obviously I would have no objection, but based on what has been presented, I'd say they don't belong. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 22:39, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally I think the cartoon caricature warrants its own article, since it's a distinct (albeit related) phenomena from the theatrical makeup. Also, I think it's interesting that the caricature is often not considered as extreme outside US as in the US itself. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 15:48, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The cartoon caricature warrants mention, because it's blackface-inspired darky iconography animated. There are separate articles on subjects like Mr. Popo and Coal Black and the Seven Dwarfs, but not, as far as I know, a separate article dealing with darky iconography in animation. "Darky iconography" redirects here. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 03:26, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps it should be. I could upload some images of a German plumbing company(?) with a logo of a darky in strapped pants and cap cleaning up an elephant's trunk, and another from the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franco-Belgian_comics_e626.html" title="Franco-Belgian comics">Franco-Belgian comic book</a> series <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marsupilami.html" title="Marsupilami">Marsupilami</a> from the 90's, with a darky character in the fictional South African country Palombia, if anyone's interested. In the comic book series, it's just considered another way of caricature, just like most of the white people have enormous noses, so do most black people have enormous lips, basically. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 06:34, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Wrong. Most black people do <i>not</i> "have enormous lips, basically." I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of people I've seen who even <i>begin</i> to approximate the extremeness of the darky caricature. "Most black folks" have full, voluptuous, sexy, sensuous lips -- in comparison to many white folks and others who have relatively thin or virtually nonexistent lips (like lots of white males, who tend to lose their top lips over the age of 60). We have the kind of lips people pay cash money to get. They do ridiculous crap beyond topical "limp plumping" nostrums, like getting fat implants and collagen injections. (Ouch!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, the article makes that point -- that darky iconography is considered simply another form of caricature in lots of other countries. The cultural sensibilities regarding race and racism are completely different from those of people in the U.S.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, there is a section in the article on <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sambo_%28ethnic_slur%29.html" title="Sambo (ethnic slur)">Sambo (ethnic slur)</a> that deals with what it calls "sambo imagery." Someone has inserted one of those merge tags, suggesting that the information be incorporated here. I haven't read the discussion on the matter and don't have an opinion one way or the other on it at the moment. It may be that there should be a separate article on "darky iconography" in which the information from various articles/sources could be merged. However, at this point, I think it is more useful to include a discussion of the phenomenon in its historical and cultural context, which this article on blackface, which treats the subject as a cultural phenomenon.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Photos are great, but we resisted the urge to clutter the article with a bunch of images. There is such a thing as a photo gallery, though, where a series of images can be presented. However, given the sensitive nature of this subject, I think it best to keep the images to an instructive minimum. I don't think it wise that dealing with the subject be made an opportunity/excuse for the wholesale dumping of racist, offensive images, possibly by entities with questionable agendas in mind. Unless you have an image/images that is/are particularly or uniquely illustrative, I'm not certain additions of that sort would improve the article. Instead, they possibly could simply lead to criticism and unnecessary and heated conflict. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 13:42, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a>. The point is that it is (or possibly was) considered as a good-natured caricature, not an attempt to ridicule racial features. As a comparision, most white people in real life don't have noses and ears taking up half the face, like <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gaston_Lagaffe_f080.html" title="Gaston Lagaffe">Gaston Lagaffe</a> (another popular Franco-Belgian character created by <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andr%C3%A9_Franquin_36e0.html" title="André Franquin">André Franquin</a>). It's an issue of different sensitivities, as was noted before. The merge tag was added by me, by the way, because the matter of the section was basically the same, just giving it another name. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 19:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But in the end does it really have any bearing on the article? I don't think so. The fact that in some cultures (not in the U.S.) the caricature was not originally intended as offensive already has been mentioned. And, still, there are today virulently anti-black racist elements in Japanese society, and that fact does not mitigate the racist implications of the images the Japanese continue to produce, innocently or not. The genesis of darky iconography has not, and may would argue should not, escape the connectedness with its racist beginnings -- "lest we forget." <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 21:24, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I get the point, then. Regardless, I'd still feel that the section about darky iconography should be broken out into its own article, as a distinct phenomena. Also, the section about Japan should be merged into this article, where it's better suited. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 22:18, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly oppose any breaking out of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darky_iconography.html" title="Darky iconography">darky iconography</a> into its own article. Blackface is darky iconography is blackface. If it were broken out, there would be little reason to keep this article separate from <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">minstrel show</a>, and I rather like the way these two articles discuss related but <i>different</i> subject matter. The fact that something is a cartoon charicature makes little difference. The tropes in <i><a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrub_Me_Mama_with_a_Boogie_Beat_e6b7.html" title="Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat">Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat</a></i> are direct descendants, even directly derived from, blackface minstrel traditions. You may have a point about making an article on darky iconography in Europe (like <i>Tin Tin in the Congo</i> and <i>Marsupalami</i>), but I don't see why that can't stay here for now. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 22:50, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a sidenote, the difference between "Tintin in Congo" and "Marsupilami" could describe the differences between a perceived "racist caricature" and "racial caricature". In Tintin in Congo, except for the darky iconography, the african population is described with a lot of negative traits throughout the book, (childishness, stupidity, primitivity etc.) in "Marsupilami", the african character is darky, but otherwise not too negatively described. If you'd like, I guess his lack of any particular personality would be better described as a <a href="../../../t/o/k/Token_character.html" title="Token character">token character</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 23:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, the same. One involves a white man dressing up as a black man. The other involves a white man drawing a black man. Aside from the medium of expression, what's the difference? The current article does a good job of covering darky iconography wherever it occurs, from theatre to print cartoons. I still fail to see a reason to separate things out. (I <i>do</i> bellieve that Wikipedia needs an article on racism in animation and racism in comics. Currently, all we've really got is an article on the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censored_11.html" title="Censored 11">Censored 11</a> and on a specific cartoon here and there.) — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 08:47, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Smithson (obviously). The purpose in framing this article the way it is was precisely to examine the phenomenon of blackface as a cultural force -- how it has enabled/driven cultural appropriation/assimilation/collaboration, how it has driven racist and racial stereotypes regarding people of African descent -- how we are perceived, interpreted, reinterpreted in the public eye (advertising, comics, artifacts, public performance, etc.). I think it would be a mistake to divorce darky iconography from its roots in blackface by excising that information from this piece and sticking it somewhere else out of its historical/cultural socio-political context. I'm with Brian. I like the way this article works with <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">minstrel show</a>, which devotes itself primarily to the theatrical phenomenon itself. Further, an article devoted to the topic of racism and ethnic stereotyping in cartoons and comics would be really interesting/useful. The added space of a separate article would allow for a cross-cultural examination of the topic, appropriate to a project such as Wikipedia. There's certainly ample information for a stand-alone piece. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 10:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

By the way, a good book for anyone who wants to do racism in animation would be <i>That's Enough Folks: Black Images in Animated Cartoons, 1900-1960</i> by Henry T. Sampson. He gives a good overview and then fills the rest of the pages with primary-source material, mostly in-theater advertising and promotional copy written by the studios to sell their shorts to theaters. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 22:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Powers is great. I just thought it was strange that he quoted a comment on the talk page to make a point about the article. Personally, I think the end of the preface and the end of the section "Blackface minstrelsy and world popular culture" is slightly dubious. It's presented more or less as a descendant, while it is just different manifestations of a vaguely defined fascination for black americans connected with popular culture. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 22:28, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, the article lacks information about how the stereotype has been used differently, it was often used accompanied by other blatant stereotypes (such as the spear-wielding, bast skirt-wearing cannibal or the childlike and ignorant big baby) but sometimes seemed to be more used just as a cartoon depiction of a black person. The article mostly fails to make clear that distinction. I think that's interesting. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 12:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, that could include other stereotyping, such as the depiction of Japanese during World War II. Unlike blacks, Japanese were USA's enemies and were generally hated and perceived as cowardly after the Pearl Harbor attack. Anyway, I am interested in cartoon culture, and I see the issue mainly from that point of view, not primarily in relation to minstrel shows. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 12:27, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IMO, the information that is presented is perfectly fine where it is. That does not, however, preclude a separate article on racism in animation -- which would be a welcome addition to the project. The other "blatant stereotypes" you mention belong there -- not here. And, as I noted earlier, "The added space of a separate article would allow for a cross-cultural examination of the topic, appropriate to a project such as Wikipedia. There's certainly ample information for a stand-alone piece." <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 17:09, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just an aside on the discussion in this long talk section: encyclopedias (and encyclopedists) can be either "lumpers" or "splitters". Wikipedia has a strong tendency toward the "splitter" side, probably driven by the fact that everyone is welcome to start an article on any "valid" topic, partly by a strong tendency of a lot of us to say of certain material "that's not quite exactly on the topic suggested by the title," and partly by the effort to keep articles relatively small. I think that, if anything, we could do with a bit more lumping. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:22, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The cited <i>Guardian</i> article says that Kate Moss was "made up to look like a black woman", not that she was in blackface. Presumably, she was made up to look like a more or less realistic black woman, not an exaggerated racial stereotype, hence not really blackface. I would suggest removing this from the article, or at least making this distinction explicit. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:52, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then, it doesn't belong in the article. The article states very explicitly at the outset that blackface involves a very particular kind of racial caricature.

<p>"The international imprint of African-American culture is pronounced in its depth and breadth, in indigenous expressions, as well as in myriad, blatantly mimetic and subtler, more attenuated forms."</p>
<p>Requesting a citation for this statement is, IMO, patently absurd. The statement is already supported by much of the preceding information. Further, the statement is an obvious one: gospel, jazz (in all its forms), hip-hop, Motown, R&amp;B, blues -- virtually forms of popular music, dance -- hip-hop culture, slang/language, dress -- and that's just for starters. That's about the worldwide popluarity of African-American culture. With regard to mimetic and attenuated forms, the "white Negroes" of Mailer's day are with us now. And there's no question about how white rock, blues and pop artists have appropriated modes of black expression of all kinds. Again, all that has been addressed before -- and properly cited. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 18:06, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I know, obviousness does not obviate the need for references.

<p>No. It's not analysis -- even though there's nothing wrong with analysis when properly done. Information/good writing is more than just regurgitating facts. Good writing is assimilation and objective analysis and interpretation of raw data/facts. But what you're refering to has nothing to do with either analysis or "original research."

<p>The main issue I have with this article is the comment "or as part of an acknowledged climate of racism and intolerance on campus". First, there is no "acknowledged climate of racism" in college climates. If anything, the colleges ruthlessly hunt down any form of perceived intolerance and silence them(free speech issues aside). Second, the cite lists the Southern Poverty Law Center as a source for this. This is not a NPOV source, it is a source with an agenda and a history of making up/distorting the facts. Furthermore...the cite links to a SEARCH function on the page...not even an article that makes the claim of an "acknowledge climate". I propose to change the sentence to this:</p>
<p>"or steming from ignorance of the history of blackface" and link it to this article</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=885" class="external free" title="http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=885" rel="nofollow">http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=885</a></p>
<p>The link actually has isolated incidents of people doing blackface, and an actual discussion of the concern over this issue instead of just a search function. I have chosen to still use the SPLC as a cite to this (even though it shouldn't be) to both a) prevent any claims that I'm "racist" and b) because the article is actually pretty good.</p>
<p>I plan on making this change tomorrow sometime unless someone has an objection.</p>

<dd>"First, there is no 'acknowledged climate of racism' in college climates." This is a blanket, naive and absurd statement--one contradicted by your later assertion, "If anything, the colleges ruthlessly hunt down any form of perceived intolerance and silence them(free speech issues aside)." If it didn't exist, then there would be no need for action on the part of college administrators -- would there? Of <i>course</i> there are campuses where racism is known to exist.<a href="http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=312" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=312" rel="nofollow">[19]</a><a href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/309" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/309" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/racialintolerance/statement_3-21.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/racialintolerance/statement_3-21.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a><a href="http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=312" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=312" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> And in the case of blackface episodes, students have come forward attesting to the fact. Finally, there is an ongoing debate about such incidents and free speech rights and, in some quarters, like at Kentucky, the university has sided with "free speech" and refused to impose sanctions as a result of such racist activity.</dd>

<dd>I don't agree with everything the SPLC prints, but unless you can cite an authoritative source discrediting the Southern Poverty Law Center's information on campus incidents, then your objection has no merit.

<p>First, I don't disagree at all with your statement about the high frequency of racist incidents on the campuses. What I DO disagree with is the way the sentence was phrased giving the impression that ALL colleges are racist and that this is facilitated by a racist administration.</p>
<p>Second, my statement about "hunting down perceived intolerance" went completely over your head. The key word there is "perceived". We all know that campus administrations are very quick to punish any form of perceived intolerance. If you haven't witnessed this then you haven't gone to college. Also...just because there is a hunt for something, doesn't mean it exists (Joe McCarthy anyone??). And, correct me if I'm wrong, but...this is the US, shouldn't we hold Constitutional ideals higher than offending someone? Who said that famous line about..you know it, "defending till I'm blue in the face"...something like that? Where is that mentality anymore? So what if ONE college out of thousands sided with free speech...shouldn't we be encouraging this instead of using this ONE example as grounds to say that ALL college ADMINISTRATIONS are racists?</p>
<p>Finally, I can post just as much negative press about the SPLC as you can post awards (I believe Dees was once quoted as saying something like "I'll take advantage of all these people till the money comes flowing in"). You know as well as I do that most of those awards are politically motivated and ammount to nothing more than person A taking position B on issue C (fill in the blanks and you get an award). The most neutral one is the trial lawyers award...and that has nothing to do at all with what he, or the SPLC does. Furthermore, as you will notice in my previous post, I said that my main complaint with the SPLC link was that it linked to a search function, NOT to an actual article. The link I proposed using links to an actual article with a nice break down of some of the more famous and recent "blackface" episodes on campuses; AND it has a nice editorial on it. I plan on replacing on 10/18/06 if there are no further, reasonable objections. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairman_Meow_ce27.html" title="User:Chairman Meow">Chairman Meow</a> 20:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, I appreciate your willingness to discuss your objections/concerns on the talk page before making changes in the text -- but, please, don't tell me what I know. What you stated -- flat-out -- was, "First, there is no 'acknowledged climate of racism' in college climates." That is obviously untrue. Further, the article does not say anything about the "high frequency" of racist incidents. What it does say is completely accurate and indisputable: "In recent years, there have been several inflammatory blackface 'incidents' where white college students donned blackface as part of possibly innocent, but insensitive, gags, or as part of an acknowledged climate of racism and intolerance on campus." If you have an objection to the link, that's another matter. If you'd like to replace it with something more to your liking, that's fine. However, in the interest of objectivity, I think it best to stick to a source that simply reports the phenomenon without commenting on it. This isn't an editorial piece, and it doesn't take sides with regard to blackface on college campuses, so there's no need for the linked material to editorialize on the matter. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 04:07, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're missing the point. I am in no way, shape, or form claiming that in any manner WHAT-SO-EVER that there are not racist incidents on campus. What I am disputing is the way the sentence characterizes the campus climate. I submit, once again, that the sentence characterizes EVERY single college campus as being RAMPANT with racists people who at the drop of a hat will engage in any type of offensive behavior. Once again, this "acknowledged climate of racism" was taken from the SPLC, a hardly neutral site. I'm am very sure that if I went to Greenpeace's site and read their Nuclear Technology report that I wouldn't get a very NPOV analysis of the situation. To say that an entity with such an obvious agenda as the SPLC has could ever produce an NPOV report is laughable. And to defend a cite to their reports as NPOV is even more laughable. If I even ATTEMPTED to link to this site "<a href="http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/</a>" I have no doubt that you'd be on me like stink on a monkey claiming that that site is way too POV. Why then can an equally POV site get added in an article when we're supposed to take a NPOV stance? I again will not object to using the SPLC cite...as long as the sentence is rephrased to remove the over-generalization of its statement. Again, remember that the SPLC makes a living off of facilitating a climate of racism. Why would you even assume that their reporting would be NPOV? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairman_Meow_ce27.html" title="User:Chairman Meow">Chairman Meow</a> 15:58, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From what I recall, many of the incidents reported on the SPLC website are corroborated by accounts elsewhere, so there's every reason to assume they're accurate. Uh, the paragraph doesn't say anything about "rampant" anything. It's quite clear what it says -- which, presumably, is why you reverted the deletion by another editor. Thanks. Do you still have an issue with the paragraph? If so, let me know. I'm crunching some deadlines for a couple of clients, but when I have time, I'll look for another, non SPLC link (I'm sure it won't be difficult to find one) dealing with blackface incidents on college campuses. In fact, with Halloween coming up, I'm sure there -- unfortunately -- will be even more in a few weeks.

<dd>I understand the concerns of the anonymous editor. However, I am an African-American and am pretty much responsible for the article's structure and overall content. I also contributed the majority of the images on the page. The images are useful in illustrating just what darky iconography is and how it very clearly evolved from blackface. In the editing of this article, however, I urged that the article <i>not</i> be cluttered with such images, possibly providing someone with a racist axe to grind an opportunity to gratuitously assault the reader with a pointless montage of potentially offensive depictions of black people. I think as it is, the article strikes an acceptable balance in this regard.

There are also numeruos external jumps that should be converted to ref form. This would not pass a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">WP:GA</a> now.

<p>I certainly strenuously disagree, but if you feel that strongly about it, there must be an avenue to reconsider an article's feature status. Have at it. If the piece can be improved as a result, then all the better. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 12:23, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article predates our current high standards for inline citation. Yes, it would be great for someone to go through and add inline citations, but I believe that the material is extremely accurate as it stands. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:34, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am so impressed by the thoroughness of this article. Since the topic overlap, would any of you knowledgeable editors here like to contribute to the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_stereotypes_156e.html" title="African-American stereotypes">African-American stereotypes</a> article, which is currently an utter wreck? It would be much appreciated. -<a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmiellaiendiay_0236.html" title="User:Emiellaiendiay">Emiellaiendiay</a> 05:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the compliment. I visited the "stereotypes" article, and I agree. See my comments here.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:African-American_stereotypes#Abysmally_uninformed_and_uninformative_list_cruft" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:African-American_stereotypes#Abysmally_uninformed_and_uninformative_list_cruft" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been seeing these images popping up in forums everywhere, and a lot of idiots are finding it funny, be it because they're in fact racist or just completely ignorant of what the images are portraying.</p>
<p>Many examples here: <a href="http://www.shoopdawhoop.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.shoopdawhoop.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shoopdawhoop.org/</a></p>
<p><br />
Isn't this worthy of mention in this article? There have been a lot of stupid internet memes, and most of them are relatively harmless. This one, however, is based wholly upon racism. Instead of just spreading stupidity, it's spreading stupidity, hate, and bigotry. (Gatero 01:08, 7 April 2007 (UTC))</p>
