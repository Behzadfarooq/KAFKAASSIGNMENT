<p>If the character's still running around in current publications, I think it's pretty safe to assume she's not dead. Clearly.</p>
<p>It's occured to me her attitude has always left open the implication Felicia's not above experimenting.</p>
<p>What I'd like removed is other character's names from "Affiliations." That should be for team associations, not personal associations. If we were to list every character she interacted with... it's absurd. The same goes for previous affiliations. I think it's misleading.</p>
<p>When did Black Cat associate with Nightcrawler? I think whomever added that is confused by the cover of Evil Men Do #5 (which has the two together.) However, it should be noted the two never even meet during the story. I sincerely hope that's not where that information came from. I'm just going to take that out. --CovertSomnophore 23:28, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just bought Peter Parker: Spectacular Spider-Man #74 and 75. She's shot and stabbed at the beginning of 75, (not 72, which was the issue there before.) The rest of the issue concerns her hospitalization and Peter's concern. --CovertSomnophore 01:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
ok... she IS still alive. She was in the last issue of Sensational SM and is a recurring character there now — ChocolateRoses <sup><a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChocolateRoses_0ac5.html" title="User talk:ChocolateRoses">talk</a></sup></p>

<dd>The Black Cat has never died and has been a recurring character in Spider-Man's titles ever since she was introduced. She's currently working with the Heroes For Hire in their own series that takes places during the on-going Civil War. No one should be under the impression she is dead. Period.

<p>Explain to me why Claws is worth putting in the noteable stories section, as opposed to any other issue Black Cat appeared in. I believe the section should be devoted to important moments in Black Cat's history. Teaming up with Wolverine doesn't quite fit the bill, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I haven't seen Felicia display any excessive admiration for herself or arrogance in her abilities. I don't think she belongs in that category.</p>

<p>The previous edit claimed Black-Cat's tone when using "Spider" was "usually seductive." I must point out tone is completely unknown when reading the panels of a comic. From the ones I've collected, "Spider" is Felicia's pet-name for Spidey, but not purely a flirtatious one.</p>
<p>If the semi-recent Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil Men Do miniseries is to be taken canonically, then the two share a genuine attraction towards each other, but Peter's foremost feelings are with Mary Jane, and thus refrains from flirting much with Felicia. In the much more recent Claws, Spider-Man was literally chasing Felicia around trying to kiss her, very out-of-character. Even more so was Felicia brushing him off, something she'd never done before. This leaves the nature of their current relationship in question.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would reason it more that the writer of CLAWS was simply ignoring established characterization in order to tell the story he wanted to tell.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>Feeling a wall of secrets growing between them, Spider-Man broke up with Felicia. He soon realized something was amiss with his own luck and enlisted the aid of Doctor Strange to remove the "hex" on him. But doing so altered the hex's source and changed the Black Cat's powers in the process. She soon found a heightened strength, agility, balance, vision, and retractable claws.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe she didn't had her powers changed, but lost; sometime after, she got the mentioned powers, but as far as I can remember, they were "artificial" powers, i.e., the retractable claws were something she wear, not her own claws, the vision was some sort of special contact lenses, the balance was made out of high-tech earrings that improved her balance, and I do not remember about her last enhancements in strenght or agility, but in a different ocasion these were also enhanced artificially, financed by King Pin, if I recall, but that was somewhat early before she got all these gadjets, which she got from that alien disguised in a human aged man, or perhaps from the guy who created all those spider-killer robots for J. Jameson.--<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtremophile_092c.html" title="User:Extremophile">Extremophile</a> 00:17, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
