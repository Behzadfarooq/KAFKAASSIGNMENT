<p>Thanks for uploading Image:Tbozzio1.jpg. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>
<p>For more information on using images, see the following pages:</p>

<p>Hello <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Metal_eefe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Metal">WikiProject Metal</a> member.<br />
WikiProject Metal music is important in expanding encyclopedic coverage of the metal. It brings attention to the lesser-known bands, and significantly improves the quality of the famous ones. Five Featured articles and two formers is proof of that.<br />
This is the stuff I wish to achieve with the somewhat recently resurrected <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/WP%7EROCK_79c1.html" title="WP:ROCK">WikiProject Rock music</a></b>. I hope to also attract attention to <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a> articles of all sorts, and hopefully change some to GA or FA status. I invite you to come join us, and embrace the links between metal and rock music in general.<br />
<i><b>Rock on.</b></i><br />

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:BenMoody.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Dbraithwaite.jpg</b>. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.</p>
<p>As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already.
