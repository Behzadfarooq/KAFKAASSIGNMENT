<p>This article has no real history in it that a person doing a research project for college or high school could use. And it leaves out the fact the on the 2005 BET Awards on June 28th Bob Johnson annoused that he was handing the CEO Title to A Woman by the name of&#160;?Lisa...?; the woman then came out and gave a speach. This article also does not foucus on the immense popularity of the channel and its mainstream appeal. The article fails to show its high rating, and appeal to much more that black people touching the lives of many. The article should also go into more depth about the channel and shows like "106 $ Park" (which is so successful and popular). It needs fixing, and should be much longer! Thank you...</p>

<dd>I found a few sources, and linked them. I didn't link <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boondocks_9b6d.html" title="The Boondocks">The Boondocks</a></i>, for the simple reason that there most have been <i>at least</i> thirty <i>Boondocks</i> strips that parodied BET or made light of its poor programming. BET's programming is a major source of controversy within the entertainment industry, but I removed the point about "some people don't think it should even exist", for what should be obvious reasons (that is, the unfounded and ridiculous argument "why isn't there 'White Entertainment Television'?"), which has no place in a encyclopedia article.--<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 22:35, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no position on the controversy. But any opinions that are not supported with references are not useful to the encyclopedia. Thank you for providing the links that you did. It is a good start. The other unsourced "critics arguments" remain in danger of removal if they are not referenced, but I am in no hurry. The point is to encourage accurately sourced articles, not to annoy other hard-working editors. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 23:41, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Information that I put into the criticism section was deleted, though I'm not sure why, as it is a widely-enough-held criticism of the channel to warrant significance.

<p>I find it very difficult to credit the first paragraph of this article as being encyclopaedic. IMO, the first sentence of the "25 years of BET" paragraph doesn't belong or should be revised, and Im guessing that this is not a unique view. The author's speculation about how "someone" twenty five years ago would have responded to the idea of BET doesn't add any real value to this article. 68.237.98.55 22:58, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>After looking on the official site for a more in-depth look at the history of BET, I've revised the history of BET and placed an outside link to the corporate section of the main site, which has an in-depth timeline. I also added some details about some of BET's non-television properties, including its (now-defunct) magazines and the Arabesque book line, and the "Rap It Up" HIV/AIDS campaign.

<dd>I strongly agree BET is not racist merely because of the name. It profiles racially, as it is intended for blacks, and not whites, and is racist in it's programming, showcasing black actors, musicians, etc, and not whites. This practice is racist, and I challenge you to claim otherwise. They make their decisions solely on race, with no other factors.

<dd>POV weasel words have no place on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>). To call BET "racist" falls into that category. Showcasing black talent there is no different than showcasing gay talent on Logo, or women on Lifetime. From a marketing standpoint, they serve a niche category. There is certainly significant money to be made within categories of that sort (witness the earnings of Oxygen over its first decade of existence - they certainly helped make Oprah Winfrey a billionaire). The term does not belong in the article. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 13:29, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In a purely abstract and technical sense, BET could be called "racist", because among the definitions of that word is "discriminating on the basis of race." However, as noted above, BET "discriminates" only in the same sense that Spanish-language channels discriminate against non-Spanish-speakers, and the same way that cooking shows "discriminate" against people who don't like to cook. Furthermore, "racist" is not a word that is used in an abstract and technical way; it is used for inflammatory and derogatory purposes <b>only</b>. As such, including it would be blatent and extreme POV. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 15:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please sign your comments by typing 4 tildes: ~~~~. I didn't say Spanish language networks are racist, I said that, in a nonsensical way, they could be called "discriminatory." The notion that BET promotes racism is a point of view, and an irrational one, in my opinion. However, you make a good point by saying "to avoid POV we must examine all sides." If you can find a notable <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">source</a> who has said that BET is racist, then it wouldn't be a violation of WP rules to quote that person in the article.

<dd>I pose a very simple question: Why would a White Entertainment Channel be racist, whereas a black one is not? I am not attempting to incite an argument, but am genuinely curious as to what one's reasoning behind this would be.</dd>

<dd>White Entertainment Television is normal television. If you didn't know that well then you're perhaps a little naive (no offense). Why do you think a multiracial country such as America has so many "specialist" channels instead of catering evenly to all groups and races? Of course to me it's all the same because the 'Black' In BET is an insult to self-respecting blacks everywhere. Do your worst Willy. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajik43_072c.html" title="User:Majik43">Majik43</a> 23:55, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everything aside, the level of criticism is far too rampant and gets more coverage than it deserves right now. Criticism must be notable and come from reliable sources. Currently, it seems like the article tries to pinpoint every single piece of controversy ever regarding BET. All we need is quasi-generalized statements about what the criticism against BET is. We don't need a list of incidents. This is an encyclopedia, not an endless repository of information.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 22:30, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been asked to give a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_opinion_ae73.html" title="Wikipedia:Third opinion">third opinion</a> on this issue. Frankly, I think it's irrelevant whether BET is racist or not, because the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <i>verifiability, not truth</i>. We could argue back and forth here and come to a consensus about whether BET is racist or not, but that would violate <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. As things stand, we cannot say that BET is racist without violating <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, however, <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.135.161.74.html" title="User:74.135.161.74">74.135.161.74</a>, if you can find a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable source</a> that says BET is accused of being racist, please put it forwards. It can then be put in the article in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> manner. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 16:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Finding a <b>notable source</b> that confirms that would satisfy me, but only in terms of noting the criticism; likewise, any descriptor in that vein should not be included within the lead description of the network. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 16:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>My third opinion</b>: Inclusion of the word "racist" to describe BET is only appropriate in the context of citing a notable critic. Also see the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> article before debating further — if anyone has demonstrated that BET consistently exhibits the belief or doctrine that inherent biological differences determine achievement or superiority, then it would be valid to characterize BET as racist. However, one must be careful that the analysis is verifiable, and avoid violating the policy of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">no original research</a>. Like it or not, blacks <i>do</i> have a unique cultural niche in America, and BET is simply catering to that cultural niche; doing so isn't racist, it's merely demographic targeting. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 16:37, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Addendum: I note that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Boondocks_9b6d.html" title="The Boondocks">The Boondocks</a> comic strip recently featured Huey complaining to BET that he wasn't seeing any blacks in the programming any more. If this is true, that further weakens any claims of racism. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 16:46, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
