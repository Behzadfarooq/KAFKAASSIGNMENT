After rewriting the article on the architect <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wyman_4254.html" title="George Wyman">George Wyman</a>, most of the meat of the story (and its a good story) has ended up there. The <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradbury_Building_4ee0.html" title="Bradbury Building">Bradbury Building</a> article could do with expanding using some of this material without too much direct repetition. There is also a good photo from pdphoto.org at <a href="http://pdphoto.org/PictureDetail.php?mat=pdef&amp;pg=8107" class="external autonumber" title="http://pdphoto.org/PictureDetail.php?mat=pdef&amp;pg=8107" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which I uploaded it to the Wikimedia Commons before noticing that this isn't actually a public domain photo.

<dd>The photo's licence bars use on Wikipedia, unfortunately. The catch is the "no commercial use" stipulation - although Wikipedia is not itself a commercial wossname, its own license allows for the possibility that parts of it may be used in commercial wossnames in future. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_A_a8ca.html" title="User:Paul A">Paul A</a> 03:26, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I wasn't clear - I've already marked the image for deletion on the WikiCommons. However, if you dig a little deeper on the Pdphoto.org site, it looks like it is only marked with a non-commercial license due to concerns that the building's interior may be copyright. From what I can determine, it is fairly clear that copyright on this building would have expired, although there may be other reasons in US law which would still prevent a free license. I've left a note to that effect on the image page Pdphoto in the hope that Jon might alter the license, but so far there is no sign that he has noticed it. The other way to go would be to find an alternative free image. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 08:21, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neat, I didn't know it was a real location. I always thought it was a subtle homage to Ray Bradbury as a science fiction author by the movie's screenwriters (and maybe Philip K Dick himself, but I don't know if the Bradbury Building is in the original <i>Do Androids Dream...</i> novel, as I haven't read it yet). I would be surprised if Mr. Dick and Mr. Bradbury never met each other at least once, although they do seem to be from different "worlds" of American culture despite having shared the same profession. --69.234.182.210 04:32, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">It's all about eyes</span></h2>
<p>I could probably go find some old Usenet postings of mine and use those as references, but I thought I'd ask first if anyone has seen anyone other than me talking about how the movie is so obsessed with eyes? The V-K test focusses on the subject's eye. The owl's eyes flash. Closeups of everyone's eyes (though this is camouflaged by decades of overuse of the shot by moviemakers). "I just do eyes." And the kicker is that you can tell that Tyrell is the king of this world because he's wearing trifocals: he has <i>eight eyes</i>. And then, how does Roy kill him? By pushing his thumbs through his eyes.</p>
<p>I'll figure a way to work something about this into the article some day. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlair_P._Houghton_f78f.html" title="User:Blair P. Houghton">Blair P. Houghton</a> 02:51, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On a different (but eye related matter) I believe that it's possible that PKDick mentions eyes and empathy because he became addicted to amphetamines which were initially used to treat an illness. Wide pupils (besides matters of light level) are symptomatic of a high degree of arousal whether this be an autonomic response to physical attraction or a drug induced stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. PKD eventually died of kidney and liver damage and nervous exhaustion worn out by his addiction. As an amphetamine addict he may have experienced intense fluctuations in emotion and psychotic episodes. These symptoms, along with the social stigma associated with drug addiction, may have driven him to seek out other people with similar habits and it is my belief that the idea of empathy and pupilar dilation may have been influenced by this concern, i.e. "Do you understand amphetamines and what it's like to be trapped like this? = "do you understand me".<a href="../../../u/1/0/User%7EU10ajf_51f1.html" title="User:U10ajf">Andrew F.</a> 23:11, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Anome: Environment</span></h2>
<p>I see where you are going with the editing there, but are you sure the writer of the original script didn't know about global warming? Originally I wrote the entry in the Today issues section, and I would like to still emphasize the current environment / political / corporate interferance of the issue today; which Blade Runner, I think, comments on and predicts. You've made it strictly within the narrative, but I think there should be wiggle room given the Genetic engineering / cloning sections comments on current circumstances being reflected in Blade Runner; regardless of if they were known for a fact... which I happen to know they weren't for genetics; it was simply luck the writer picked out a valid critique. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">RoyBoy</a> [<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy">â</a>] 20:22, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Failed FAC</span></h2>
<p>It's not the kiss of death -- we can put it up for featured article again -- but the very few voters panned it. Why? Criticism of the structure, yes. And that can be fixed. But I've seen looser articles pass.</p>
<p>I think the biggest point against this article is the length and intensity of the "Deckard: Human or Replicant" debate. Frankly, I think the matter is a <b>tempest in a teapot</b>. The movie raises the <i>question</i>, and that's enough. Deckard is not <i>really</i> <b>anything</b> except a character, a few lines in a script and some frames of whatever passes for celluloid these days. Harrison Ford is, to some extent, human, I suppose. There <i>is no</i> movie reality; Deckard and Rachel do not walk off the elevator and into some sequel.</p>
<p>In all the film, nothing absolutely reveals to us Deckard's identity. He does <i>not</i> get the test; he does <i>not</i> stick his hand in a beaker of boiling water; we do <i>not</i> meet his Mom. <i>Nothing is decided</i>, and that's how it should be.</p>
<p>If we were all Chinese, we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's only Westerners who are so uncomfortable with ambiguity.</p>
<p>So, here's what I suggest: <i>Basta</i> the debate. Not only has enough been said; too much has been said. Not one more single solitary word needs to be written, even here in Talk, on this question. <i>Finis</i>. Really.</p>
<p>Number two, <i>cut</i> all mention of the debate to about 1/3 of it's current length, maybe 1/5. State the case for both sides as fast as possible; state the case for the director's <i>intention</i> that the question remain unanswerable; and move on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop some of the other characters. Link to other WP articles that bear on the film. Contact the studio and beg for some licensed shots. Such a visual film deserves a more visual treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of all, expend energy on <i>anything else</i> -- other than "who is Deckard". â <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXiong_2293.html" title="User:Xiong">Xiong</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiong_c362.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiong"><font color="#997749">ç</font></a><a href="../../../x/i/o/User_talk%7EXiong_bb60.html" title="User talk:Xiong">talk</a> 03:05, 2005 Apr 23 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Female stereotypes</span></h2>
<p>I just recently tweaked the following paragraph to make it read a little more smoothly, but it still bothers me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Arguably, the use of women as victims is meant to elicit sympathy from the audience (a Voight-Kampff test), and moreover can be read as a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodernism.html" title="Postmodernism">postmodern</a> critique of the film-noir <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archetype.html" title="Archetype">archetype</a>. In this view, <i>Blade Runner</i> exposes the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femme_fatale.html" title="Femme fatale">femme-fatale stereotype</a> as dead. Furthermore, the race of the female replicants impiles a critique of females in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> films. The replicants become representative not of a battle between sexes, but "between that which is human, and that which is non-human, or to put it more simply, that which is real and that which is not real."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_misogyny"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlade_Runner_Archive_1_31e3.html#endnote_misogyny" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/a/Talk%7EBlade_Runner_Archive_1_31e3.html#endnote_misogyny" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is it just my inability to parse the pomo dialectic, or does the quotation not really have anything to do with the subject under discussion? It seems to imply that gender stereotypes are not, actually, the issue the replicants address.</p>
<p>And isn't it odd that this paragraph declares the femme-fatale stereotype "dead", while it was alive and high-heel-kicking a few sentences ago?</p>

<dl>
<dd>The essay in question concludes "female stereotypes" can be interpreted to be a commentary on issues that are broader than gender; yet their use remains clearly defined and fits with the header. As to the femme-fatale, its use in BR does not necessitate its alive and kicking. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:25, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Puzzles and Questions</span></h2>
<p>Bryant says that six replicants are supposed to have rebelled and come to Earth. However, later in the briefing Deckard is told of only four (Roy Beatty, Leon, Pris, Zhora), plus a fifth one who died earlier. Fans have suggested that the sixth replicant is Rachael, or even Deckard himself.</p>
<p>There is no explanation for why replicants can only be identified by psychological testing, instead of blood testing for genetic markers or x-rays or metal detectors to detect artificial implants.</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>The issue of the sixth replicant is addressed in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicant.html" title="Replicant">replicant</a> article. As to testing, Blade Runner does not specify a replicant can only be detected through the VK; but its likely the easiest and less obvious way to detect a replicant. A blood test could alert a replicant they are under suspicion. Anyway, its speculative and doesn't belong in the article. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 15:12, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Granted, but if replicants are indeed biologically manufactured; then their DNA would be on record and could theoretically be matched with the Tyrell database. Of course when BR was made quick sequencing wasn't really on the horizon. So virtually human or not the DNA doesn't lie; unless of course you come across a chimera.

<li>I think the entire synopsis falls flat. It tells us a lot about the minutiae of the action, but it totally fails to capture the pace of the film or the duration of a given scene. For instance, <i>"Just as he is about to kill Deckard, Rachael shoots Leon and they go back to Deckard's apartment and fall in love."</i>, with "fall in love" indicating a very lengthy sequence of film and the sentence being rushed and run-on in general. The whole section wreaks of run-on elemetary school English: "he did this, she did that, they went here" and so on.<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Synopsis" doesn't necessarily mean giving away each little detail of the movie. Instead it calls for a concise overview of the action (as in featured article <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca_%28film%29.html" title="Casablanca (film)">Casablanca (film)</a></i>), or often just a paragraph or two setting up the action (as with the minimal plot summaries for featured article TV shows, e.g. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Quatermass_Experiment_7e44.html#Plot" title="The Quatermass Experiment">The Quartermass Experiment</a></i>). It only makes sense to give the level of detail found in the <i>Blade Runner</i> synopsis when the art in question is short, sweet, and easily summarized (e.g. featured article <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>). The plot summary should probably be shorter (and much sweeter <tt>:)</tt> ) than this whole comment! --<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarnas_08a5.html" title="User:Tarnas">Tarnas</a> 03:23, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree, I tried to trim it down, but not knowing what was relevant to the main story made it difficult. It is also poorly written. One thing that I think would help greatly if everything was not explained in the order it happened in the movie. Also what I meant in my comment in Peer Review about describing the charachter, was that their personality should be described, not their phyiscial description. <a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMechBrowman_f6ce.html" title="User:MechBrowman">MechBrowman</a> 03:31, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've rewritten the synopsis section; abreviating plot elements and elaborating on characters and key scenes (re: Roy's death, Deckard and Rachael falling in love). I know its not precisely what you're looking for as it still is largely linear in style and mentions minor scenes like Chew's interrogation; but I think it passable and it is shorter... by 5 words. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:19, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is a much better synopsis, the pace is better and the awkward details are gone!

I understand and agree my style ain't the best for the first two "drafts"&#160;:') (this synopsis is my third draft, although because it was a rewrite it was grammatically poor; thanks for the corrections BTW), however no one else has stepped up to the plate (with the exception of vaceituno) and there is little I can do about that except contribute and let others improve it incrementally. Which I contend is exactly what I have been doing since day one; but I won't stand by and wait for the article to slowly reach featured status by 2019!'D - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:07, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you Tarnas, RoyBoy contributions have greatly enhanced the article, but I find it interesting that a whole chunk had to be moved out to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Themes_in_Blade_Runner_8147.html" title="Themes in Blade Runner">Themes in Blade Runner</a>. I wonder how many other articles have a meta-article. Too much time is spent defending particular contributions. It took to me several weeks to contribute to 'is deckard is human or a replicant' and it is still not good enough. I wonder if RoyBoy may consider let other people improve it until it gets to FAC quality with his supervision, but without his direct contribution, and let someone else propose it as featured article. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVaceituno_62ac.html" title="User:Vaceituno">vaceituno</a> 09:26, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I apologise if I gave you the impression your section was "not good enough", since it was the best and largest section in the article when I showed up. You are understandably being defensive about something you put a lot of time in, but were not challenged on until I came along. And I don't find it <b>interesting</b> Themes was moved since it became a very large section that was bloating the article; someone mentioned that (and yes, a few POV issues) and <b>I</b> moved it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tears in rain</span></h2>
<p>Can we, at least, tie together the themes of eyes, rain and "Tears in rain"? I feel that this line is the artistic climax of the film and as important, if not more important than "time to die", which could be viewed as merely afterthough. Surely, we have been beaten over the head with the idea that they will die, and the vast majority of them do for us all to see in living color. How about tying together the rain and eyes more firmly, especially in case it never occurred to the viewer at all (a distinct possibilty in my opinion)? <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">Amorrow</a> 01:29, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How else can I emphasize this? On Ash Wednesday, as a Catholic (well, when I was a child), I wold go to Church, the priest would put his ashy thumbprint on my forehead and say: "Remember Man that Thou art dust, and unto Dust Thou shalt return.". I am talking now about art, not religions. Tears in rain. All that you are, will return to the Earth either through the soil or the water. That is the take-home message. I just finished a new article here Dies_Irae_Word_By_Word. Look at how <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_of_Celano_83ed.html" title="Thomas of Celano">Thomas of Celano</a> uses the Latin word "favilla". Again, ignoring the religion stuff, and focusing on the philosophical stuff; that is the theme. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">Amorrow</a> 19:07, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am so sorry to do this on a public channel, but what can I do with this Wikipedia stuff? I said it on <a href="../../../e/l/i/Talk%7EElizabeth_Morgan_bdaf.html" title="Talk:Elizabeth Morgan">Talk:Elizabeth_Morgan</a> and I have to move it here so that you can never say I talked about it behind your back. You simply got it wrong.</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<p>Royboy, you spent a long time on that Blade Runner page and you misssed the fact that "tears in rain" is the point of "Blade Runner", unless you are so juvenile that you cannot get beyond the shoot 'em ups or that the whole idea of dying is, like, so totally cool man, that.. that that's really awesome. If you do not realize that the director probably STARTED with "tears in rain" and built the whole thing up from there, then it IS just another sexy shoot 'em up.</p>

</ul>
<pre>
The title theme is also an arresting piece of music, 
and its appearance in "Tears in Rain" is one of 
the most moving you are likely to hear in a movie theater.

<p>Just like <a href="../../../r/e/q/Requiem_%28Mozart%29_cf0b.html" title="Requiem (Mozart)">Requiem (Mozart)</a>, or more specifically, the supplementary page <i>I</i> created Dies_Irae_Word_By_Word. Of course, if you never SUNG the thing, you would probably never notice where the artistic value is anyway.</p>
<p>I do not do this to be mean. I truly belive this. Blade Runner has operated on my mind for 20 years. I have perspective on it. <small>(preceding unsigned comment by <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">Amorrow</a> 01:37, August 8, 2005) by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">Steven McCrary</a> 18:34, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>You don't know what you are talking about. Roy Batty's entire soliloquy was written by Hauer at the time the scene was being shot, and "Tears in Rain", as I understand it (but I could be wrong) was created with the rest of the soundtrack after principle photography was done and it was given to Vangelis for scoring. I agree it (the soliloquy) is the climax (artistic and action) of the film; and as such we can note the praise given to it by critics in the Criticism section... and if you want to elaborate on "Tears in Rain" go right ahead in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_%28soundtracks%29_6cec.html" title="Blade Runner (soundtracks)">Blade Runner (soundtracks)</a> article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And if I didn't mention it before, I appreciate your interest in the article. I've been doing a lot on my own and its good to have another perspective to fill in pieces I might have overlooked or missed. But lets get something straight, don't try to hypothesize on what the director did or what my appreciation of the film is, because I can assure you I'm well versed on Blade Runner. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:16, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Point taken. However, I did not assert if "tears in rain" was synthetic (basis for starting) or analytic (Hauer saw patterns and created finale to fit the patterns). You are right in that I do not know the history, but the patterns are obvious. Hauer saw the vital question was: are the clones human or not. Did he shed a tear before he die (they do not really say, but could be). Are their emotions real? Basically, something like, when a little puppy whines, is the sadness it feels that same sadness that we feel. Very arty stuff. Is a Black Man a real human being or, like the US Constitution used to tell us, is he only three fifths of a human being? <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmorrow_1f6d.html" title="User:Amorrow">Amorrow</a> 22:21, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, you feel a central theme regarding the humanity of the replicants isn't examined sufficiently in the article. In the summarization and expansion of the themes (and article at large) that has taken a backseat. (Another reason is I'm a little burned out over it, because I've talked, debated and discussed it so much in the past.) I will work on a paragraph for the themes section (and some other minor additions alluding to that in other sections). But I usually broaden the issue to be about what it means to be human; and I agree a possible tear in rain would be the ideal place to end up when discussing the issue. For now I will wikify a paragraph you tried to add a while back; and I'll remind you just because something is removed... it might be how, rather than what is being said, that is unencyclopedic. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 23:36, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I totally agree with RoyBoy. It is not about "tears in rain" being right or wrong. It is just unencyclopedic. Wikipedia is not the place for analysis or expose assertions, but to synthetise significant fact what mainstream others have said about the subject matter. RoyBoy knows well all debates about BR, and this seems to me like a spurious BR theme that is not a main interest even among BR fans. <a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVaceituno_62ac.html" title="User:Vaceituno">vaceituno</a> 00:00, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe several of the broad brush statements (see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms</a>) need to be explained. Why did it gain "such great popularity" as a video rental? Why has it "been widely hailed as a modern classic?" Why does it deserve praise for being so "influential ?"

<dd>I'll run some by you, but I'm wary of adding much to the lead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rental: It was a popular video rental because it was a good film people were discovering/rediscovering, and Blade Runner rewarded repeated viewing as well, also there was no misleading hype setting up incorrect expectations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Modern classic: I think that's explained in the article, but if I were to tack on something in the lead... ummmm... It has been widely hailed as a modern classic for its immersive special effects and prefiguring dominant themes and concerns of the 21st century... in league etc. Also it has a BFI book about it, so that doesn't hurt. :"D</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Influential: Not sure how to answer that. As I understand it many a film maker and film critic gives a nod to Blade Runner as being a visual benchmark. As it was so dark, beautiful and original.</dd>

<p>I think the influences - music section could be updated as I believe there are many more references in popular music. One example is "Tyrell" by Hoodlum Priest - the movie is the central theme and there are several prominent samples, most notably "time to die." I have also heard samples in several other pieces I can't recall offhand - I would be interested in a more extensive catalog.</p>

<p>-- "Blade Runner depicts a future whose fictional distance from present reality has grown sharply smaller as 2019 approaches" - from the plot summary. Maybe I don't get the point of this sentence, but shouldn't this be sharply <i>larger</i>? As far as I know, humans only populate Earth right now, etc... -- jason_catlin</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the sentence is supposed to mean that the world of Bladerunner seems less unfamiliar in 200X than it did in 1982. Looking at the sentence though, I can't see why it is here. 1) Clearly, it is an opinion. 2) I don't see anything in the paragraph that supports the claim. 3) It reads like a fan-article, not like an encyclopedia. (the whole article still suffers from this, unfortunatly, even after the work to make it feature-article worthy.) I'm removing this line. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 00:56, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-- In the first line of the synopsis it says Holden was shot whilst conducting a Voight-Kampff test on Leon. Not true, there are extra unused scenes floating around on fan sites of Deckard visiting Holden, and it is a much older man, older than Deckard. Besides, the script says Tyrell was advised to screen his own new employees himself. So, the man is a Tyrell employee, not Holden. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.217.1.234 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.217.1.234_379c.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.217.1.234">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Since it is a deleted scene it has no bearing on the synopsis; and the man Deckard visits in the hospital is the same one that is shot, Holden. Deckard's boss clarifies Holden is in hospital when Deckard suggested him as a Blade Runner to handle the situation. Tyrell was advised by someone to screen employees, and a Blade Runner would conduct it as they are specifically trained and experienced to detect replicants. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 17:47, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The actor in the unused scene in question seems pretty clearly to be Morgan Paull, the same actor who is questioning Leon in the opening scenes. He does not appear to be an older individual -- his head is simply wrapped in medical equiptment. It's Holden himself who says, in the deleted scene, he was conducting the tests at Tyrell.

<dd>Annnnd... reviewing the film itself, Leon specficially addresses the test administrator in the first scene: "Do you make up these questions Mr. Holden, or do they write them down for you?" <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 18:29, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not only does the film make it explicitly clear that the interviewer is indeed Bladerunner Holden it is obvious in the deleted scene that it is the same actor.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Voice over?</span></h2>
<p>I've read somewhere (sorry that I don't recall where) that Harrison Ford claiming to have done the VO poorly is just a rumor. Is there any verification for either claim?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've heard that as well, but I don't know where to verify it. Ask <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">RoyBoy</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wookieepedian_b64c.html" title="User:The Wookieepedian">The Wookieepedian</a> 05:09, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I admit its a possibility; however I've heard it mentioned by people involved in the production in documentaries. And looking at the BR Bible page 298, Katy Haber was present at the studio where they recorded the third VO recording attempt, which was ultimately used in the film. Her opinion is Ford did it poorly since he didn't like the VO's from the get go and was "sick of the whole movie anyway". - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:30, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>But I'll definitely tweak it, since I can't recall where I hear Ford said it himself:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It has been rumored for years that Harrison Ford purposefully gave a bad reading of the voiceover narration added during post production in hopes that the studio wouldn't use it. Ford has denied this vehemently, stating that he gave the voice over six different readings and neither version came out sounding right and that the narration didn't work simply because the film wasn't originally made to have one."</dd>

<dd>despite that its not his favorite movie, Harrison Ford cant deny the fact that the movie is a modern classic. I saw him in this show, the directors, he talked about the movie, but not in bad terms, talked about how he felt that the voice over was unnecesary, and didnt denied that he in fact never liked the movie (but ended up saying "blade runner could had been the highpoint of his career, but ridley has directed a number of interesting movies after blade runner")--Kessingler 00:37, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Themes paragraph</span></h2>
<p>Removed this new paragraph from themes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The coined phrase from the Tyrell coorporation for it's product as replicants being " more human than human" as a sales intiative is proven on a much deeper level when Roy Batty, "the leader" before the replicant dies, saves Deckard with Deckard proclaiming "maybe it valued life not just it's own life but any life" The replicant says "time to die". Roy Batty seems accepting of this fact at this time with a smile where an ordinary person would not and dies peacefully in front of Deckard. Therefore ultimate empathy did lie with the replicants. the Blade Runner Rick Deckard takes this with him. Which leads us to question " How human are we?"</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason(s) as stipulated in the edit summary are: repeats previous points, slightly pov "ordinary person would not", "ultimate empathy" and too specific for overview style [of the themes section]. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 06:36, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that there should be a reference or references for the alleged details of Ridley Scott's delayed "definitive" director's cut. As it stands, the article gives the details of the future release, without giving a reliable source for these claims.

<dd>The problem with this is that the DVD of this definitive cut has been scheduled for release several times in the past but as the release date has gotten nearer Warner Brothers have always pulled it.

<p>The producers of the film arranged for a screening of some rough cuts for Philip K. Dick shortly before he died in early 1982. Despite the fact that the movie deviated significantly from his book and his well known skepticism of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> in principle, he became quite enthusiatic about the film.
