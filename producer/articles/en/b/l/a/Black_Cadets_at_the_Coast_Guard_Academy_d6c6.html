In 1973 there were 28 Black cadets sworn into the Class of 1977, and in 1974 there were 20 Black cadets admitted as part of the Class of 1978. These two years alone quickly raised the percentage of minority cadets at the Academy. The entering class is usually between 300 and 400 cadets, with the entire four class student body consists of no more than about 2000 cadets at any one time.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Cadets_at_the_Coast_Guard_Academy_d6c6.html" title="Edit section: The first African-American cadets">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The first African-American cadets</span></h2>
<p>The Coast Guard Academy admitted its first Black, Jarvis L. Wright, into the Corps of Cadets in 1955. He soon later resigned for medical reasons. Since there is not a lot of data on Jarvis Wright, he is typically left out of most historical references to the Coast Guard Academy.</p>
<p>In June 1962, Merle James Smith was the second (most commonly sited as the first) African-American student to be admitted to the Academy. He graduated in June 1966. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>No other Black cadet was admitted until 1964 when <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Steverson_baab.html" title="London Steverson">London Steverson</a> from <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millington%2C_Tennessee_6552.html" title="Millington, Tennessee">Millington, Tennessee</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Boyd_73af.html" title="Kenneth Boyd">Kenneth Boyd</a> from <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonia%2C_New_Jersey_c8cb.html" title="Leonia, New Jersey">Leonia, New Jersey</a> were admitted as part of the Class of 1968. This was a small step for the Coast Guard Academy, but it was a giant step for African-Americans in the armed forces. It did not however amount to integration. Two or three Black cadets out of a student body of about two thousand was not full integration. The presence of these token Black cadets did not effect the historical normal operations of the Coast Guard at all. These tokens were treated as honorary white cadets. At all social events, mixers, and athletic parties, the Social Hostess, Miss Judy Sinton, never provided any Black females. The Black cadets were allowed, even required, to choose escorts from the girls provided.</p>
<p>The physical appearance of these cadets was not immediately an indicator of their ethnic origins. Because all cadets wore shaved heads and dressed identically, an outside observer to the Academy's weekly full dress parade of the cadet corps, would be left with the impression that there were no Black cadets at the Academy. The Black community of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_London%2C_Connecticut_2c51.html" title="New London, Connecticut">New London</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groton%2C_Connecticut_e43d.html" title="Groton, Connecticut">Groton, Connecticut</a> was amused when it was rumored that there were Black cadets in the corps. Merle Smith could "pass" for Caucasian. His parents were fair skinned and had fine patrician features. When Black spectators came to watch the entire corps of cadets march in parade, they frequently mistook Anthony Carbone and Donnie Winchester as the possible Black cadet. Carbone was an <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian</a>, and Winchester was a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a>. They both were considerably darker than Merle Smith.</p>
<p>Attrition rates for entering cadets were high, and the Class of 1968 was no exception. Of the 400 cadets entering in July 1964 as the Class of 1968, only 152 graduated. Both Steverson and Boyd, the two Black cadets in this class, completed the four years of indoctrination and graduated.</p>
<p>Because the orders to recruit the first Black cadets came down the Chain-Of-Command from President John F. Kennedy, the Commander-in-Chief, the first Black cadets were treated like sacred cows. There was zero attrition of Black cadets between 1962 and 1972. Every Black cadet who entered graduated. In 1964 the Coast Guard Officer Corps was 99.44 percent white.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Less than one-half of one percent of the officer corps was comprised of Black enlisted men who had been promoted to chief warrant officers. In 1973 the percentage of Black officers was still below one percent,<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> but progress had been made. Also, President Kennedy was no longer Commander-in-Chief. With the large influx of Black cadets in 1973 and 1974 upper-class cadets were given the green light to weed out and to eliminate the less qualified Black entering cadets. The attrition rate for Black cadets reached astronomical levels. Up to 70 percent of the Black cadets entering were forced to resign before graduation.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>At the Academy they had not been prepared for what awaited them out in the field. The all white officer corps was not prepared to accept the Black officers into the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Room_e446.html" title="Ward Room">Ward Room</a> with all the rights and privileges of white officers. Most of the white officers, both Northerners and Southerners, had never been to school with Black students and were not ready to live and work with them on ships and bases. The senior officers proved to be especially hostile to the new breed of officer.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Kenny Boyd did not survive his first duty station, the USCGC Dallas, at <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governors_Island%2C_New_York_06db.html" title="Governors Island, New York">Governors Island, New York</a>. He received such adverse fitness reports from his senior officers that he had to be removed from the ship. An Academy graduate is required to serve 5 years of obligated service before he can resign his commission. Kenny Boyd was not allowed complete his obligated service.</p>
<p>Merle Smith was forced to resign his regular commission prior to the earliest date he could have retired. He was given a commission in the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_reserves.html" title="Army reserves">Reserves</a> to accumulate retirement points. He did not retire in 1986 with his Academy class. He retired in 1988.</p>
<p>London Steverson was promoted to (0-4), <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_commander.html" title="Lieutenant commander">lieutenant commander</a> in 1978, but he did not receive a promotion during the last ten years of his career. In 6 years he was passed over 5 times for promotion to (0-5), <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander.html" title="Commander">Commander</a>. By an Act of Congress an officer attaining the rank of 0-4 is allowed to remain on active duty until the earliest date that he is eligible for retirement. Lcdr Steverson was forced to retire in July 1988 with 20 years of active service.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> His last two years of active duty at Governors Island, New York were very aggravating. After completing a tour of duty at the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS), he was relieved of all responsibilities. He was required to report for work every morning, but he had no official position.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The one thing that he was required to do was to appear for drug tests once per month.

<p>In July 1972 <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> London Steverson was reassigned from <a href="../../../j/u/n/Juneau%2C_Alaska_49c2.html" title="Juneau, Alaska">Juneau, Alaska</a> to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. He became the Chief of the newly formed Minority Recruiting Section (G-PMR-3), Office of Personnel, Coast Guard Headquarters, 400 D Street, SW, Washington, D.C., 20591 in the John Volpe Building under the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Transportation_3f3e.html" title="Department of Transportation">Department of Transportation</a>.</p>
<p>As the Chief of the Minority Recruiting Section he desegregated the all-white United States Coast Guard Academy by recruiting more than 50 minority cadets in a two year period from 1973 to 1974.</p>
<p>From 1876 until 1962 the Academy had not admitted any African-American cadets. Given a free hand, open traveling orders, and a budget Lt. Steverson was able to reach out to the parents of the best and the brightest in the Black community across the nation. He attended the National Conventions of the <a href="../../../n/a/a/NAACP_cd86.html" title="NAACP">NAACP</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_PUSH_a51b.html" title="Operation PUSH">Operation PUSH</a>, and the Black American Law Students. He established a Sponsor Program where an active duty officer was given the name, address, and telephone number of the most promising applicants to maintain their interest in the Academy. He sponsored familiarization trips to the Academy for the applicants and their parents for all finalist who were interested in seeing the Academy grounds. The first year on the job he was able to deliver 28 bodies to the steps of Chase Halls on Admissions Day to take the Oath of a Cadet.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The second year, using the same programs, he was able to deliver another 20 African-American high school graduates to be sworn in as freshman cadets.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> It was from these African-American high school students that the Coast Guard's first officers of flag rank were to come in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>; officers such as, Captain <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Jones_d612.html" title="Joseph Jones">Joseph Jones</a>, Admiral Erroll Brown and Admiral Manson K. Brown. Admiral Manson K. Brown was personally recruited from Saint John's Prep Academy in Washington, DC.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lieutenant Steverson was charged first and foremost with recruiting cadets for the Academy because that is where the bulk of the career officers would come from. However, he was also requested to find minority college graduates who would receive direct commissions as lawyers and as aviators. He recruited several one Vanderbilt Law School. Ms. Deborah Nash Dupruis was one such officer. These officers were college graduates and had no need to attend the four year Academy. They received a three month orientation course at the Coast Guard Officer Training Center at <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorktown%2C_Virginia_4d15.html" title="Yorktown, Virginia">Yorktown, Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard Academy Corps of Cadets is comprised of more than 900 men and women from the United States, Europe, Middle East and the Caribbean, each pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree and a commission in the U.S. Coast Guard or their host country's military service. Significantly, the Corps of Cadets is run by the cadets themselves.<br /></p>

The Corps of Cadets is organized into eight companies (Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf and Hotel) forming one regiment. Cadets run the Corps through their regimental chain of command.<br />

<p>A four class system was strictly enforced at the Coast Guard Academy. The 4/c cadets were at the bottom of the <a href="../../../p/e/c/Pecking_order.html" title="Pecking order">pecking order</a>. They had no rights and no privileges. They could only talk to other 4/c cadets. They were only allowed to relax inside their rooms. They were required to run at top speed everywhere they went outside their rooms, including the corridors of Chase Hall and every place on the Academy grounds. They were required to run to class carrying their books while maintaining a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_formation.html" title="Military formation">military formation</a>. They had to maintain a rigid attention posture with chin in, chest out, shoulder back, back straight, stomach sucked in, arms straight, and thumbs along the seams of their trousers. They were to maintain this posture during meals while seated on no more than three inches of their chair.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The rooms for 4/c cadets were sparsely <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furnishings.html" title="Furnishings">furnished</a>. They were not allowed <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">televisions</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereo.html" title="Stereo">stereos</a>, or <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radios</a>.

<p>The life of a 3/c cadet was a little better. They were allowed radios, but no stereos in their rooms, and they were not required to run everywhere while outside their rooms. They were allowed limited conversation with 2/c and 1/c cadets.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The 2/c cadets were allowed radios and stereos but no <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">cars</a>. They were in charge of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indoctrination.html" title="Indoctrination">indoctrination</a> the 4/c cadets. They taught the 4/c cadets military <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discipline.html" title="Discipline">discipline</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/i/Etiquette.html" title="Etiquette">etiquette</a>, and how to march. <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazing.html" title="Hazing">Hazing</a> and an imaginative array of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal_punishment.html" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a> was at their disposal. Group punishment was administered for individual infractions. The 4/c cadets were at their mercy. A 2/c or a 1/c cadet could almost make a <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave.html" title="Slave">slave</a> of a 4/c cadet. Upper-class cadets have been know to require swabs to sweep their rooms, empty their trash bucket, fetch their laundry, or a host of other personal services. The power was infinite and absolute.

<p>The 1/c cadet were allowed almost anything their hearts desired including cars. This four class system developed discipline, initiative, and individual reliance on self.

<p>There is a Student Organization called the <b>Genesis Club</b>. This is a multi-cultural organization that increases cultural awareness at the Academy through many special events including <b>Eclipse Weekend</b>, a keynote event that brings together cadets, officers and members of the community to celebrate diversity. This club also provides a support system and network to its members, which includes academic support and social activities.<a href="http://www.uscga.edu/cadetlife/activities_fellowship_genesis.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uscga.edu/cadetlife/activities_fellowship_genesis.aspx" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><br />

<p><b>Programs targeting African-American Prospective Students</b><br />
<br />
<b>Eclipse Diversity Weekend</b><br />
High school sophomores &amp; juniors, as well as seniors with appointment offers-- join Academy graduates and cadets for this annual celebration of diversity! This two-day event brings African-American alumni home to renew friendships and professional ties, and to mentor current and future cadets. Eclipse kicks off Friday afternoon with a cadet parade and ends Saturday afternoon with a talent show. Guests are paired with cadet escorts and stay overnight in the cadet barracks (dorms). Parents are welcome to attend but should plan to lodge off campus. Appointees attending Eclipse may combine their Spring Cadet-for-a-Day visit for an extended stay.<br />
<br />
<b>Super Saturday</b><br />
Designed with the interests and perspectives of underrepresented students and their families in mind, this six-hour Saturday program is offered three times a year and is limited in size to allow greater personal contact with cadets, Admissions staff, faculty members and graduates. Guests attend a slide show and Q&amp;A session, receive a tour of campus, and enjoy lunch in the Cadet Wardroom. Decide if a Coast Guard Academy education is right for you, and depart understanding “the Coast Guard family". <a href="http://admissions.uscga.edu/i2e/Scheduler/campus_events.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://admissions.uscga.edu/i2e/Scheduler/campus_events.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
