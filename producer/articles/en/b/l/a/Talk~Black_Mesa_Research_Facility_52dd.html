<p>The Apache helicopter seen taking off in the beginning might have been the administrator ( Dr.Breen ) escaping the facility and thus saving his own skin knowing what's about to happen.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Practically speaking, the character Dr. Breen probably had not been envisioned by Mark Laidlaw at the time that map was made during Half-Life 1's development.
<dl>
<dd>You're wrong. The games mentions a lot an "Administrator" - although probably Laidlaw hadn't imagined Dr. Breen, he knew there was a "big boss", who at the time was kept mysterious. Some even believed the G-Man was the Administrator.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>I'm adding a bit about the Military Base in Black Mesa. Throughout the game, and in Opposing Force, its pretty clear that there is some kind of military installation a short while away from the complex. Heck, even the signs in the original game actually say "Black Mesa Military Installation"</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the record, I disagree with the "soldiers storm the complex within minutes" evidence. The soldiers' first appearance is a scripted event dependent upon the player reaching a certain point. An inexperienced player (or one simply taking the time to explore or look for hidden areas) might not see soldiers for hours after starting a game. -<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynSkeet_3c0b.html" title="User:DynSkeet">DynSkeet</a> <a href="../../../d/y/n/User_talk%7EDynSkeet_b41f.html" title="User talk:DynSkeet">(talk)</a> 12:28, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>you could be right. but with how big of a complex it is it could take them a wile to get deep enough inside to see you.(just something to think about) (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardrc_615f.html" title="User:Chardrc">Chardrc</a> 21:47, 15 August 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<p>also the rail system is still used or it is hinted that it is sence in the traning for securitygards in blue shift they teach you how to use the trains. not sure if we should make note of this or not so can someone conferm.(<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardrc_615f.html" title="User:Chardrc">Chardrc</a> 21:51, 15 August 2005 (UTC))</p>

<li>At the risk of sounding like a nerd, I'm removing the references to <i>Half-Life:Decay</i>, as it isnt part of the <b>official</b> story <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty2005_26a8.html" title="User:Rusty2005">Rusty2005</a> 21:00, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why remove the references to Half Life: Decay, as you say they are not apart of the official storyline. What do you mean by that. Is it becuase it is on a different port, Playstation 2. If it's not apart of the official storyline, tell me this. Why was Dr. Gina Cross seen carrying the Xenite Sample GG-3883 on the security cameras in Half Life: Blue Shift. Why did no more Xen life-forms materialse in Black Mesa, after the events of the Resonance Reversal. You also once said "how do we know that that is the transit hub". It says so in the game iself. "This train is inbound from the area 8 Topside dormitories to the central transit hub in area 9". As far as i remember a sign above the security station also stated this. All of the events in Half Life: Decay corresponds to that of the other 3 games. Rosenberg was placed in that container in the Freigt Yard, and was seen here again in Blue: Shift. You also removed, the information on the Rocket Test Labs, Advanced Biological Research Laboratory &amp; the Gamma Complex, why, the first two i mentioned, were the main parts of the Facility seen in the Half Life chapters: On A Rail &amp; Questionable Ethics. You once removed the information on the Level 1 Main Facility Entrance, because "it was not seen in Blue Shift". However i think i can remember correctly that you added info on the Area 7 Recreational Facilities and you stated yourself that "it was not seen in the game", so why delete someone elses work, when you added the same sort of information yourself. The article is on the Black Mesa Research Facility, and about the Facility itself, not about the games or the official storyline. This means that any information that is regarded as cannon should be allowed to be placed on the article and Half Life: Decay is cannon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Ok, calm down. Sorry for my mistake, I was under the impression that <i>Decay</i> was a user-created mod and not an official game from Valve. Thanks for correcting me on that. My mistake, sorry! Won't happen again &#160;:-) While we're on the subject, I don't suppose you could capture a couple screenshots from Decay for the page?

<p>I have reverted the addition of the section only seen in Redemption because, although bundled with a certain <i>Half-Life</i> pack, it is unlikely to be considered canon by Valve in relation to the storyline of <i>Half-Life</i>. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 00:42, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, just because it's not in the offical storyline, which is only the part seen in Half-Life as all others are made by differnet developers, doesn't mean that it shouldn't be included in the article. Someone may want to devide the information into "Official" for games released by Valve and "Unofficial" for fan-made mods.
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that most sections in fan-made mods are not notable; Wikipedia fiction details what is canon in a work, and leaves out fan fiction (in this case, a fan-created storyline involving sections of Black Mesa). <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 03:46, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone know why there are health machines, presumably designed to interface to HEV suits, prominently dispersed through office areas (there's a prominent example in the 2nd screenshot in the screenshot section) and elsewhere, not just the labs? Aside from the obvious (gameplay). Or maybe the office workers, in their underground warrens and watched over 24/7 by armed guards, need some serious pharmaceuticals ... or maybe those papercuts are <i>real</i> nasty?</p>

<li>What I don't undersantd is, why don't Barneys and scientists use said first aid kits? If they can't, then there's no excuse for them being there because there are medkits such as the kind you find in crates scattered about.

<li>Actually, one of the Barneys is seen attempting to save himself by using the said kit. Unfortunately, he dies before he reaches it (after the Resonance Cascade, at the airlock to the cooling sector).<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikael_GRizzly_708b.html" title="User:Mikael GRizzly">Mikael GRizzly</a> 13:22, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Been considering including several more screenshots from both the <i>Opposing Force</i> and <i>Blue Shift</i>, as there are several more unique locales, namely, the following:</p>
<p><i><b>Opposing Force</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Large Biodome observation area</li>
<li>Modernized Hydrofauna Studies Laboratories</li>
<li>A heavily damaged cargo area</li>
<li>Large underground furnaces</li>
<li>Office space embedded within cave, with an old rail line at the side/Meeting room</li>
<li>Level 4 Storage Unit (images are very dark)</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Blue Shift</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Drainage Canal</li>
<li>Freight Warehouse</li>
<li>Train Yards (turntable area)</li>
<li>Section A-17 Prototype Laboratories</li>
<li>Older models of the HEV charger and first aid station in the Prototype Laboratories</li>

<li>Shooting range</li>
<li><i>The Mesa Times</i> newspaper, indicating that the research facility has its own newspaper</li>
<li>Map of tram routes, providing a list of facility names</li>

<p>I removed a sentence from the article saying that the military was able to storm the Black Mesa facility "within minutes of the resonance cascade" as this is not correct. There's an entire level in Half-Life: Decay dedicated to reaching the surface and then bringing Dr. Rosenberg to a radio to contact the military. Shortly after that, there's a dramatic scene where dozens of apaches fly overhead, assumingly storming Black Mesa <i>then</i>. Depending on how fast you play Decay, this could take a variable amount of time from when the resonance cascade occurs and when the military finally arrives. However, the time it takes for them to arrive is far from a few minutes after the disaster. They even had to be contacted by radio first before they came. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 02:11, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps a more complete picture of Black Mesa could be formed by combining all of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and Blueshift's maps of Black Mesa together?</p>
<p>Of course, there always exists the problem that map sections overlap or don't join together properly.</p>
<p>With todays' multi-gigabyte workstations and powerful GPUs, would it even be possible to have all of the maps in memory (in something like 3DS) at the same time and generate a render of the Black Mesa facility?</p>

<p>I've compiled an overview of Black Mesa, but only from Half-Life. You were right about the overlapping sections&#160;:P Unfortunately I don't have any time to create maps from OP4 and BS so somebody else has to do that.</p>
<p>I put it under the Size section.</p>

<p>Just to add my two cents, I edited the entry on the aforementioned facility due to it's inconsistency with the games. The OF ordnance storage facility is located near the Lambda Sector - right. But there is another one located not far away from the entrance to the Lambda Complex, one in which Gordon navigates through the explodorynth. Given the fact, that Half-Life is the first game in the series, this might cause confusion as to which is which. Additionally, the reference to the Black Ops "cleaning it out" was also removed. I don't think a black op team of commandos would clear out a facility full of ordnance (and there is no evidence there was any within), as there is no sane reason to do so.</p>
<p>Additionally, the truck within the facility in OF was, at least for me, unloaded, not loaded with missile parts. Besides, missiles in storage are not outfitted with nuclear warheads, to the best of my knowledge. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikael_GRizzly_708b.html" title="User:Mikael GRizzly">Mikael GRizzly</a> 13:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> has removed several images from the article claiming that they do not meet <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>. I <i>highly</i> disagree with this. I <i>do</i> understand the concern of keeping a limited number of images in any one page, but to arbitrarily remove <i>everything</i> from the bottom half of the article (And then immediately add the "orphaned fair use" template on all of them to boot) is probably the worst way to go about doing that. These images are clearly depicting very significant areas seen in the games, which is part of the fair use criteria. I believe that the images should be reinstated for now, at which point a consensus of which images are the most necessary to be kept can be made. Specifically, the test chamber and the hydroelectric dam are both substantially important locations (The images of both of which have been removed by Geni). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 02:19, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>After reading <a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERusty2005_8b00.html#Black_Mesa" title="User talk:Rusty2005">Rusty's talk page</a>, it seems that Geni removed all the images without any consideration whatsoever to the value they added to the article, declaring all of them "decorative" without much reasoning to support that assertion. Again, I realize that the article did have a lot of images, but it would definitely be a bit more proper to consider the importance of each image beforehand instead of simply wiping half of them away in one fell swoop. To delete the image of the test chamber, quite possibly the most crucial locale within the entire game series (Being the place where the catalyst that started the entire disaster and sequence of events in games to come originates), shows that the person obviously isn't very familiar with the topic. The decision on what images to remove should be done far less haphazardly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 02:32, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The removal of the "Additional screenshots" section was completely justified, it's a gallery of fair use images and it's using "fair use" far too excessively. no more than a few images should be used in "featured areas", as the section is quite large. Space them out a little. The most significant images that contribute would be the Test chamber before, the dam, and the Lambda core. Stick in the after shot of the test chamber if you want, and place the images next to each respective section. - <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero1328_e3a0.html" title="User:Zero1328">Zero1328</a> <sub><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero1328_f3d3.html" title="User talk:Zero1328">Talk?</a></sub> 04:20, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said before, I am very aware that there were many images in the article. However, I am quite annoyed by the fact that over half of them were indiscriminately removed without even the slightest hint of warning. I don't think there's much justification for such an action. To claim that this is justified would be assuming that the regular editors of this article must be far too thick-headed to come up with their own decisions as to which images should be kept and which can be deleted. I, personally, would be <i>plenty</i> happy to oblige to such a request that the number of images in this article should lessened severely, along with removing the gallery entirely. Of course, it would far more courteous to discuss this other editors so a collective consensus can be made. However, the removed images are prone to deletion <i>right now</i>. According to the orphaned fair use template, they have about six days left until deletion. I'm not about to test this limit, though. I believe that Geni has seriously compromised the integrity of the article and has now unceremoniously dropped the burden of salvaging it onto the regular editors, and along with a time limit just to make things that more difficult. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 18:08, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The gallary has been there for the whole of this year so you've had plently of time to discuss it's removal. Now there are currently seven images in the article.

Now you can't copyright facts. But you can copyright fiction.

<dd>The concern has <i>never</i> been brought up before. Of course there could have been a discussion <i>if</i> someone had actually brought it up before this time. I have no idea why you are citing <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> unless you are referring to yourself. I am not claiming ownership of this article, but I am not sure on how knowledgeable you are on this topic. The Black Mesa Research Facility is a vital location to the Half-Life series, being the primary place of action for the first game, three expansion packs, and it continues to be referenced in the sequels. It's not surprising that a lot of images came about simply due to the vastness of the subject. Saying that seven images is "unreasonably high" is a matter of opinion. There is nothing according to the official policy that states there is a maximum number of images that can be used. Again, I completely understand the policy on keeping the number of images low, but this is not a simple subject, nor is it a small or short article by any means. As of now, it looks like the article has been vandalized with half of the media missing. I'm also not sure why you are bringing up the first sentence and saying that it is "fair use text". It is definitely not "fair use text" since Valve has never used any such statement to describe the ingame location at all. If you're claiming plagiarism or possibly copyright violations on any of the text in this article, you'd be quite mistaken. Anyway, if you believe there are weaknesses with the article, let's please deal with them one at a time. I am now mainly concerned about the images, which should now have about five days left to live, more or less. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 02:12, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>moveing on to "fair use text". This is a slightly less well known area of law and a bit tricky to explain but Valve own the half-life universe. Perhaps some partical examples. You could not use Black Mesa as the setting in a film without permission from valve. Valve could sue anyone writeing fan fiction involveing Black Mesa. Following on from that Valve could sue anyone writeing fan description of Black Mesa. Now assumeing you don't own a major media company you are now thinking something along the lines of "that's crazy". Perhaps it is. Fortenetly for the future of wikipedia and not getting sued for dreaming there is.

I think these images (Under "Keep", I mean) do a very fair job of sufficiently representing the facility from all the games (Minus <i>Decay</i>) and is a quite reasonable amount in respect to the length of this article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 03:04, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>11 is unaceptably high. if you want that many take it too <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EFair_use_5c7e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fair use">Wikipedia talk:Fair use</a>.

<dd>Eleven is "unacceptably high"? According to who? Where is this rule stated? Looking at <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a></i>, a featured article, it contains ten fair use images. Although slightly longer, I don't see anyone complaining that ten images is "unacceptably high". Eleven isn't that much of a jump. Also, there are no differences in what the levels in <i>Half-Life</i> look like with and without the high definition pack. Edit: I have now cut down to what I believe should be kept to only nine images. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 04:19, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose a reduction of images for the reasons given is justified, and redundancies are a definite no-no. The <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use policy</a> states that fair use images should be used in a limited number, but with an sufficient amount that can improve the article optimally; these images were added at a time when I believed galleries of fair use images were still OK. But the recent purges of excessive fair use images based on this fair use policy, has me with second thoughts. As much as I don't like to hamper the reading experience of readers who lack imagination (specifically, those who can't translate words to pictures), guidelines are guidelines. I say we stick to a 8-or-less images regiment, distributing all situations in the game into this number; nothing more. ╫ <b><a href="../../../z/s/_/User%7EZS_3578.html" title="User:ZS">２５</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/s/_/User_talk%7EZS_8bf1.html" title="User talk:ZS"><font color="green">◀RingADing▶</font></a></sup></b> 10:10, 12 November 2006 (UTC) ╫</dd>

<dd>Yesterday's featured article, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_43d7.html" title="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</a>, contains eight fair use images. Today's featured article, on <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Scout_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29_7680.html" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Scouts</a>, contains over twenty fair use images. Nine video game screenshots, especially for an article this size, is far within the acceptable limits. All individual images meet the proper requirements for fair use.

<dd>No you haven't, you've just that "11 is unacceptably high" and keep pointing us to the Fair Use Policy page, which doesn't seem to outline <i>any</i> restrictions on how many images can be used. Obviously, one of these screenshots is within the copyright and legal boundaries, so surely they <i>all</i> are.

<dd>"Obviously, one of these screenshots is within the copyright and legal boundaries, so surely they <i>all</i> are." no that directly conflicts with the third principle of US fair use law. The reason no hard limit is set in policy is that we know that certian people would take the view that they had a right to that number of images. "wiped out images that were clearly fair use" example please? Incerdentaly Rusty2005 you appear to be a subject of the crown? And yet you are uploading images and claiming "fair use". Problem is that no such principle exists under any of the UK's legal systems. The closest would be "Fair dealing" which is far more restricitve.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 14:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very well Geni, if you wish to be obstuctive about this, then do so. If you wish to make pompous remarks about my nationality, while hiding behind pages of legal jargon, then do so. Your goal on Wikipedia appears to consist solely of deleting images and razing articles which people have made a real effort to improve. If you wish to do so, go ahead. I am nevertheless pursuing a complaint about your actions, I think that you are totally out of line and that your interpretation of Wikipedia's <b>international</b> boundaries is far too harsh. I still would like to know though, <i>where in law does it state that 11 images is unacceptably high</i>? And additionally, I don't believe you are that familiar with British law. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty2005_26a8.html" title="User:Rusty2005">Rusty2005</a> 00:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I live in the UK some I am somewhat familiar with the various legal systems although not so much with the Scottish one (however I don’t think there is much difference when it comes to copyright law). Courts have always been a bit hesitant to draw lines in the sand when it comes to amount of material you are allowed to use (this gives them what might generaly be known as job security). The amount allowed generaly depends on the context of use and the material's importance to the overal work (and sometimes it appears how luck you are with the judge).<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 01:02, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're not in a court of law. And I don't believe that you are any more familiar with our country's law than I am. But anyway, that's not the issue. No-one has complained about these images until you suddenly binned the lot, without consulting any of us. Why are you so committed to deleting images all over the encyclopedia? No-one has complained about the images, but from what I can see, a lo of people have complained about your habit of deleting without any notice. I uploaded these images in order to improve the quality of the article, and <i>no-one</i> complained before. The least you could have done would have been to initiate a discussion, but you didn't even bother to do that. You seem to have little purpose here besides deleting images which we believe fall within the remit of Fair Use. Why is this? Our interpretation of Fair Use is just as valid as yours. And yet you haven't given a single good reason as to why this number of images is "unacceptable". <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty2005_26a8.html" title="User:Rusty2005">Rusty2005</a> 01:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>People did complain a little. That is how I found out about the page. While I have don't know how good your knowlage of english and welsh law is I suspect I may have an edge on copyright but no matter. Surfice to say that going by Lewis v King you may wish to keep UK law in mind when editing. Or not it really rather depends on how solid you think that judgement is.</dd>
<dd>Anyway now we have the FUD out the way lets move on to the issue of image deletion. In short I'm committed to free content. So is wikipedia. Fair use conflicts with this. On the other hand fair use is imposible to avoid. so the aim is to keep it to a mininium.</dd>
<dd>I do more than deleting images I upload them as well. I also write articles about canals.</dd>

<p>The section of the article describing the main locations was kind-of messy and had some unnecessary speculation. I grouped the big locations by the sector in which they appear in the games to make the list easier to navigate, and removed some of the POV stuff.</p>

<p>I don't have evidence to back this up, so I didn't want to add it into the article, but I have a strong belief that the facility was based off of White Sands Missile Range (Formerly White Sands Proving Grounds) <a href="http://www.wsmr.army.mil/" class="external free" title="http://www.wsmr.army.mil/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsmr.army.mil/</a> If anyone can find a concrete link, feel free to add it in.
