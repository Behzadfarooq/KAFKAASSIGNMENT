<p>How the heck do you get that Amy hates Blaze. I played through the entire game, and I didn't find anything about that.</p>
<p>I didn't do or add any information to this article!<br />
That is why I said this article needs double checking!</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps...since <b>you</b> have played the game. You can add some information to it! That's what Wiki is all about, and why anyone can edit any article</p>

And also, there was recent vandilism, that nearly 10 edits missed to correct! <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a> 23:35, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed, there's no information on whether or not the relationship between Blaze and Silver is merely <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonic.html" title="Platonic">platonic</a>, and yet already a bunch of shippers think that something deep is going on.

<dd>I know, to be honest, these characters are about exactly <i>how</i> old? 6-20 at the most. I doubt they'll be, or should be, getting jiggy right now. Also, I'm sure Sega/Sonic Team are smarter than to have characters having it. But I don't think shippers want the chars to have sex, they want them to be "together". Although, it's highly unlikely. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a> 15:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First off, could you point out said vandalism? I must have missed it. Also, do you know nothing about teenagers? I can tell you from first hand experience, there are few who are <i>not</i> having sex even as young as 13-15 (age of charcters in question). However, it has been said that Blaze/Silver's relationship is the brother/sister type with Blaze being the older sibling. (JPN Blaze's profile says this)</dd>

<dd>That's because sex has been <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_circus.html" title="Media circus">glorified by the media</a> to terrifying levels. What with parents' relaxing attitudes towards child-rearing, children are learning about sex from all the wrong places, like their peers, or from television, or magazines like Cosmopotolian. This leads to a skewed view of sexuality that, if not recognized and corrected, can easily lead to irresponsible sexual conduct, or, if the poor kid is <i>really</i> misinformed, it might become <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_deadly_sins.html#Lust" title="Seven deadly sins">horniness</a>. So, the sexual lunacy in our society could be stopped easily if parents actually <i>took the time</i> to <i><b>raise their kids properly</b></i>. Seeing as that's not happening too frequently for this generation, it's up to us to make sure that the <i>next</i> generation isn't <i><b>even more</b></i> screwed up. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 00:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We can't blame the parents entirely, I mean, first off, it's akward (or at least I'd think it would be) to teach your child about sex. That's why they hope their children don't bring it up. But, if they don't know, they just might find out the wrong way. But still, I agree that it's their responsibility to teach the child about sex and morals and stuff, but it's also the kid's responsibility not the go around doing it for the sake of the feeling. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a> 21:33, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, it turns out that Blaze and Silver <i>do</i> have romantic feelings for each other, but neither one wants to admit it. Go figure... Of course, SEGA has never actually displayed sexual intercourse in its games, not even using some sort of veil (e. g. bedsheets, curtains, off-screen, etc...)

<p>Spent the last few days watching the cutscenes for the new game. Now, I haven't been actually able to play the game but from what I can see Blaze doesn't seem to have any reaction to Sonic. Is any explanation given for this? --HellCat86 00:13, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps Sonic the Hedgehog takes place chronologically before Sonic Rush. Then, since Solaris is erased from history, the events of the game never happen, meaning that Blaze no longer knows or is affiliated with Sonic, and thus did not sacrifice herself to destroy Iblis. That's just my take on the matter though, and since I haven't actually played the game, my theory might have some problems, but it's as good as any, I suppose. Cyberlink420 19:41, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For the reasons stated above, I'm going to erase the line in question, since it's not really clear in the first place. Until then, we must assume that Sonic Rush takes place before "Sonic 2006". Brittany Ka 12:55, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Rush does take place before 2006, because Blaze gets all annoyed at the characters talking about Sonic Sonic Sonic.

<p>Well, when Solaris is erased, the events of Sonic 2006 get <i>totally</i> negated, with the exception that Sonic and Elise have faint memories of each other.

"Every night I will save you"= In his dreams, Silver is constantly seeking to undo her death and save her life.--HellCat86 04:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't seen that artwork of her before, so it may be possible they're using her in a new game.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Artwork shown also appeared in <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Rivals_bcf6.html" title="Sonic Rivals">Sonic Rivals</a> - just a note. Also, good analysis of the song. Everytime both other users and I try adding parts of that to interpret the song on Silver's page, it gets removed for some reason. But, personally, I think it's possible that, somehow, she'll re-appear. That would be weird though if she appeared in Secret Rings... well for me anyway...<a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnuckles_sonic8_7940.html" title="User:Knuckles sonic8">Knuckles sonic8</a> 13:52, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow! Turned out to be right after all! I'm actually more surprised Rouge hasn't been confirmed for multiplayer, actually.. Maybe there's more than 8 hopefully but I doubt it (in reminiscence to Shuffle highly). We'll have to wait and see if she appears in Story; I HIGHLY think she will make an appearance. I don't know if she'll have a "role" per se as does Tails, Knuckles and Eggman. But we'll see... I'm glad the date was moved back so I can get this game even sooner. ^_^ <a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnuckles_sonic8_7940.html" title="User:Knuckles sonic8">Knuckles sonic8</a> 23:18, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it possible to edit this? In Sonic 2006, Blaze seems to be using variants of some of her moves from Rush. Blaze even seems to do Homing Attacks in the game.

<p>what is true and what is false, in sonic rush she came from an alternate world and in sonic the hedgehog she came from the future, but what is real ìm so confused.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm starting to think we're either seeing a translation flub or retcon. In Sonic 06, it's made clear that Silver and Blaze come from a possible future. Rivals makes the same distinction with Eggman Nega--HellCat86 16:07, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just like Blaze was a princess in Rush and a queen in 06, the alternate dimesion thing probably got retconned. Silver and Blaze come from an possible future that existed when Ilbis was released and mananged to destroy the world. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathGodDragon_EDGE_edef.html" title="User:DeathGodDragon EDGE">DeathGodDragon EDGE</a> 01:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Blaze didn't die at the end of Silver's story, she sealed herself [and Iblis] away in a parallel dimension. It's within this alternate universe where she assumed the role of the protector of the Sol Emeralds, henceforth leading to the events of Sonic Rush. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 00:03, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Blaze did die in 06, but because Solaris (and Mephiles and Iblis along with it) was wiped out, it wouldn't matter if she died or lived in an alternate universe after sealing Iblis within her. Due to the story, all the events of 06 didn't happen. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathGodDragon_EDGE_edef.html" title="User:DeathGodDragon EDGE">DeathGodDragon EDGE</a> 03:10, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sega have gone and created a major plot hole. The script writers have gone off their rocker, leaving fans to speculate. Quite clever actually...

<p>The whole Blaze sealing herself and iblis in the other dimension would have explained the Rush incident except Rivals had to ruin it by having Eggman Nega come from the future. Unless there are two Eggman nega's. the only solution to this plothole is to that Sonic next gen(or Sonic Rush) is not canon. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelsait_3f80.html" title="User:Delsait">Delsait</a> 03:59, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The question is, was it Chaos Control, or just mundane teleportation? I'm guessing it was Chaos Control, because I don't think Blaze is able to teleport, and, besides, ordinary teleportation probably couldn't get you to another dimension.

<p>Okay heres my theory. Basically Blaze is born in the dimension in Rush with royal parents. At some point in time Mephiles power or Mephiles himself in a different form somehow warps a very young Blaze(think like Creams age) to the future of Sonic's dimension separating her from her parents. An orphaned Blaze is an outcast in Silvers future due to her strange powers and her claim that she is a princess. Eventually she meets Silver and they become fast friends. She also learns to keep her cool explaining her change from a hothead in Rush to a calmhead in Sonic Next gen.</p>
<p>However due to Solaris(and Mephiles being erased as well) being erased from time. Blaze never dies or gets transported to the future of Sonic’s dimension. While Blaze gets respect due to being princess she unfortunately doesn’t never meets Silver(though they might still have faint memories of eachother) or makes any friends explaining her highly anti social attitude in Sonic rush.</p>
<p>As for Nega,after Rivals he somehow manages to escape from the card and get into Blaze’s dimension. Immediately finding out he is feared not laughed at because no one remembers his ancestry. Nega decides to start over, forget the past and become a new mad scientist. He makes a new archenemy in Blaze the cat. As for his relationship with Eggman,he decides to let bygones be bygones,that they are incredibly similar,and realizes the destructive power they would have if they teamed up,he forgives Eggman. Eggman never one to turn down a partnership agrees and the events of Sonic rush start. As only Shadow and Silver found out Eggman was really Eggman nega in Rivals,this is Sonic’s first real meeting with Eggman Nega. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelsait_3f80.html" title="User:Delsait">Delsait</a> 01:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This states that Blaze is self-conscious about her chest size and she becomes upset if someone teases her about it. It's from Concept-Mobius.
