<dd>This complaint itself is racist. That anything titled "black" is racially based is very narrow-minded. The term "black humor" supersedes racial barriers and refers to something that has been around for longer than the terms "black" and "white" for race. The automatic assumption that anything with either color term must relate to race is a sign of one's own polarization and oversensitivity, which has become far to common in today's society. Black humor is a universal term to all English speakers as this article defines. Learn to think deeper next time before you start a racial debate where one never existed. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarnet_avi_f41c.html" title="User:Garnet avi">Garnet avi</a> 11:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a problem with saying that Black Comedy being like "dead baby jokes". I don't think they are in any way like each other, Black Comedy satirize important topics, not to trivialise them but to emphasise their importance. Dead baby jokes are just jokes in really bad taste. Thomas.mcmahon 13 September 2005</p>

<p>I'm going to have to agree with that; the "dead baby jokes" example really takes it a bit too far, especially so close to the beginning of the article. Perhaps that could be modified to provide a better explanation of the concept behind black humor. <a href="../../../e/c/c/User%7EEccomi_25d6.html" title="User:Eccomi">Eccomi</a> 06:53, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragicomedy.html" title="Tragicomedy">tragicomedy</a> claims to be also about black comedy. I think the two terms are related but different, and need to be differentiated. 66.167.253.16 07:14, 22 October 2005 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's tragicomedy unless the audience actually sympathizes with and is moved by the "tragic" part. For example, <i>Weekend at Bernie's'</i>s central joke is the slapstick humor of two guys abusing Bernie's corpse (as well as a commentary on the egotism of the 1980s, but that's another story). It would be a tragicomedy if we had a connection with Bernie and felt that dragging his body behind a speeding motor boat were cruel or disrepectful of his remains. But the movie establishes at the very beginning how much of a jerk Bernie was when he was alive. Consequently, we don't feel sorry for him--and we don't take his degradation seriously. It's a dark comedy. That's my take on it. <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkamaeleon_b2c2.html" title="User:Ckamaeleon">Ckamaeleon</a> 18:18, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is that really considered black humour?.. I love the film myself, but hardly see it as being of that genre. Satires in general are not all black comedies. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorWho42_7447.html" title="User:DoctorWho42">DrWho42</a> 22:56, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>There are ton of titles left in the movie section that just don't make sense as black comedies. The Evil Dead series are horror comedy, and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy aren't comedies at all. It seems like people are adding movies just because there might be a humorous scene in it. Having a scene or two that makes you laugh doesn't make a movie a comedy.</li>

<p>Is the Cable Guy really a Black Comedy? I've never seen it but just the trailers I remember, and the people I know who liked it, it seems more schlapstick. There's alot of films on here that do not seem like Black Comedy to me. Also, would early John Waters (Mondo Trasho-Polyester) films be Black Comedies?</p>
<p>I believe that Fun with Dick and Jane is Black Comedy and was wondering if it belongs on the list.</p>

<p>Some of the people on the list do not try to be funny, only black. Some people try to be funny, not black. Get rid of people on the list who do not try to be funny, and get rid of people whose humor is not Black. Also, I think that the list should include people or works that are more exclusively black humor. Seinfeld may have had possibly one black humor joke, but most of the humor was more lively. Charles Adams had most of his cartoons mock death or ghoulish things, so that is black comedy. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Hugger_b37a.html" title="User:Tree Hugger">Tree Hugger</a> 01:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
