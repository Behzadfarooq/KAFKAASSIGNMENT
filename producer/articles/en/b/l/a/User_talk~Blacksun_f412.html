<p>Hi blacksun, nice work defending the FA status of India against users who were out for revenge like Naus and obviously biased and ignorant users like Bob. I feel that if users like them are allowed to triumph, Wikipedia will never achieve its full potential. Wikipedia is not the place for political statements and if users want to discuss, they should do so somewhere else.</p>

<p>Hi! Nice works on Kolkata. Thanks a lot. Please see if any further shrtening of the article is possible. I am hunting for good images! Bye.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 08:06, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I differ with you in one poine, the restriction of number of images. Somebody said (I cannot, as usual, remember who&#160;:)) an image speaks more than a hundred words&#160;! Please see <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>, where the number of images used is less, but some sections have more than 2 images. However, if we get better images, we can easily delete the earlier poorer images. I will be hunting for a tram. The article has more glitzy images of Kolkata]], rather than some images presenting daily life. I am looking foe some such kind of photos. Bye.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 08:49, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Please also see <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangtok.html" title="Gangtok">Gangtok</a> for the peculiar way they have placed the images, sometimes irrespective of sections. <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> has a nice collection of umages that quite captures the mood of the city! Bye.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 08:54, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh&#160;! When I am seeing in my browser, the 4 photos on transport section appears in the same section i.e. transport. This may be a browser/ settings problem, I have faced similar problems earlier.I use Mozilla firefox. Anyway, I do not mind removing that old horse carriage photo, but a traffic jam photo should be there. If necessary, you can put your arguments in the talk page of Kolkata , so that other wikipedia users also can see the problem and decide ehat to do, rather than just 2 of us. I am copying this message to Kolkata talk page, please answae there. Bye.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 09:01, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See! I do not have any problrm with the Armenian Jew image in my computer&#160;!!! This is peculiar. I think we can do one thing. The images I am adding, (you can remove those that are unnecessary like the old hore carriages one), let those be there. And talk regarding this isuue in the Kolkata talk page. Other users will know the proble. Let's see how they are seeing it.Especially some administrators / veteran users can be of great help. I will inform some veteran users I know of. Lets decide in a democratic way&#160;!!! Bye, (P.S. you can sign your message by clicking the third button from the right on the panel above the edit box). Thanks.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 09:12, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hi&#160;! Yes I know about the gallery system.<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimla.html" title="Shimla">Shimla</a> also have a similar style. I once used that style in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_festivals.html" title="Hindu festivals">Hindu festivals</a>, though not much beautifully! In fact, I was thinking to make such a section in Kolkata where some good images can be put, irrespective of sections. In the gallery, we can put dissimilar kind of images. I am giving this proposal to Kolkata talk page. Let's see how others respond.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>BTW, to make it a FA, we have to put our energy in other parts apart from images. For example, FAs usually have great references, Kolkata lacks that. Just yesterday I put some references, before that no proper citing was there! Then, the red links. A featured article should have as less red links as possible. Hope we will be able to improve <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>.

<p>Hi&#160;! The sections "Colonial architecture" and "Modern Kolkata" seem extra in <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, as <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> have pointed out in the talk page of Kolkata. Though it is not necessary to build the article just like other city articles, yet we should try to conform the article to a general rule which has been followed in Wikipedia. We should try to absorb these two sections elsewhere, may be in "Geography", "Administration" etc. Regarding images, we should create a central repository in <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata_image_gallery.html" title="Kolkata image gallery">Kolkata image gallery</a> and use images from there as appropriate , as <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshk_9519.html" title="User:Ganeshk">Ganeshk</a> nicely adviced. However, we should concentrate now on the text, so that the text is good, informative, grammtically correct, and properly resourced. Thanks for all the work you are doing. Please see the <a href="../../../k/o/l/Template%7EKolkata_related_topics_b759.html" title="Template:Kolkata related topics">template</a> I've added in "See also" section. You can add more Kolkata-related articles to the template, I could not incorporate all articles.

<dd>Hi&#160;! Please see <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>. There the geography section consists of geography proper, "climate" and the "urban structure", while a separate section of "Infrastructure" contains health, transport and utilities! <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> also does the same. We can solve the problem of "modern Kolkata" and "architecture" etc by following this pattern, and absorbing the contents of these would-be-deleted sections within "urban structure". <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> is still a moderate article, just about 35 KB. Many F.A.s are 45 KB. So no problem regarding size. Bye.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 14:12, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi! You know, this "city growth" - does not look good. It sounds a bit peculiar. "Urban structure" , as I said to you, could sound better.In that section, we can discuss CBD as well as new growth patterns, and also a bit of colonial architectures.

<p>Hi! Your plan sounds nice and looks cool. But still, I think the "Media" part should be seperated because, that is the usual norm for Indian city article. Now the norm is not hard and fast, but shoul;d be followed as far as possible. Your plans to break up the city culture inti People and customs, Film, Sports, Festivals are good. I've just this objection over media. You can keep it for the moment here, and discuss in the Talk page of <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>.

<dd>The way "city culture" is shaping up (with all those sub-sections of people and customs, films and theatre, oerforming arts, media , sports etc.) I think soon there would be advice to shrink the sulture section in one heading, and shift the seperated contents to the article <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata_culture.html" title="Kolkata culture">Kolkata culture</a>. Think of some rationale to defend your creation in the article when facing questions/ advices&#160;!!

<p>No, I do not think it is ready for review yet. I am doubtfull about the culture section. Let some time pass. Let other users see it. Let us inform users like <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a>, <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">Deeptrivia</a> etc. and also, if possible, by beurocrat like <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a>. Plus, it seems the "Trivia" section has to be removed, we can create a fork article <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata_trivia.html" title="Kolkata trivia">Kolkata trivia</a>. And try ro compare with Indian FA cities like <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gangtok.html" title="Gangtok">Gangtok</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalimpong.html" title="Kalimpong">Kalimpong</a>. I have some points regarding images. It would be fantastic to have an image of a water-logges street, or, still better, a photo of football in the maidan in a rainy day. The cloud-covered skyline and/or the eastern wetlands can be removed. The article is not grammatically full-proof. So I don't thijnk the article is ready for a peer-review. At least, let this week (while <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> is the Indian collaboration of the Week) pass, then we can consider!

<dd>Also, the "urban structure" is not well written. "Transport" may be worked upon. "Economy" needs further addition/modification.

<dd>Hi 1 So ypu are now busy with <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. Please come to <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> for a while! I think the part where colonial architecture has been described under "urban structure" has to be removed. The gist of this part can be absorbed in the "history" where we have a reference to "city of palaces". The image of victoria memorial, in that case, can be placed in the tourism section, as a Kolkata article without an image of the victoria is injcomplete. In fact, the image can be incorporated in the "history" itself, as the section "history" would be quite large if we absorb the colonial section there. Please see the urban structure of modern Kolkata that I rewrote. Bye! --<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 16:51, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, no, I am not abandoning Kolkata. I just thought that it would be useful to wait few days and get input from some more people. In the meantime, I decided to work on Hinduism as it is in danger of losing FA status. Sometimes when you work on one thing too much you can't see what needs to be improved as you are too close to it. So I am stepping back for few days! Also, I do not think that we should add much more to History as it is already quite long. Maybe a separate architecture section or sub-section. Moving the architecture part to tourism might hold promise too. Nor sure. (<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 16:59, 21 March 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>Hi&#160;! I removed the Trivia section, and enlarged history. Please go on with your suggested "name" section. Lets do whatever we can in this week. Later on , if we be able to put the article for peer review, further modifications can be done, as needed. However, before that, the article should be made free of typos and grammatical mistakes as far as possible. And we should search for statistical database of Kolkata, if any. The article seems weak in referencing statistics. Even now, the article as a whole reads like a article written out of love to the city ( so many "oldest", "first" etc.) rather than objective view-point. We need more references.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 06:15, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Blacksun, good work so far on the Hinduism article. I'm glad you took to working on the article — I myself would have liked to continue to contribute, but work has caught up with me. With regards to the reasoning behind one of your recent edits <i>"Support: Their was no such section in original FA"</i>, keep in mind that FA candidacy is considerably harder now than it used to be when Hinduism got featured in 2004. Negative aspects and alternate viewpoints on any subject are required and those reviewing FACs come down pretty hard on such articles. While I feel that the current lenght of the Hindu nationalism is appropriate, this may be something to keep in mind as you continue to make edits to the article. Cheers, and one again, good job! <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreJay_861f.html" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 22:32, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I disagree with you. Please stop getting anoyed at me and please listen. You may have a difference of opinion. Most Hindus, whether they know it or not, have been subconsciously influenced by <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advaita.html" title="Advaita">Advaita</a> philisophy, which views differents forms of God as aspects of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahman.html" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>, which has a <a href="../../../s/a/g/Saguna_Brahman_042a.html" title="Saguna Brahman">Saguna Brahman</a> component. There is a difference. Vaishnavites believe only that Vishnu is the supreme God whon incarnates. (i.e., <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatars.html" title="Avatars">avatars</a>. I agree with you partly. The Christianity analogy may be striken out. I am a Hindu myself as well. Just living in India makes no difference as many Hindus outside India have a far superior knowledge of their bretheren in India. I have been complimented by many users for my contributions such as <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhadani.html" title="Bhadani">Bhadani</a>;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Raj2004&amp;oldid=31831915" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Raj2004&amp;oldid=31831915" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Raj2004&amp;oldid=31831915</a> Please ask him. I have created many articles on Hinduism, such as <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karma_in_Hinduism_d0f2.html" title="Karma in Hinduism">Karma in Hinduism</a> and significantly expanded on others such as <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu_sahasranama.html" title="Vishnu sahasranama">Vishnu sahasranama</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linga.html" title="Linga">Linga</a> <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatar.html" title="Avatar">avatar</a> and many others. Who did most of those Hinduism articles? Me. So please don't preach to me that being an Indian born Hindu has superior knowledge, which from your statement I assume. The masses of Hindus you may know in India may be grossly ignorant of their religion. How many have read the Upanishads, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahma_Sutras_f664.html" title="Brahma Sutras">Brahma Sutras</a>, Bhagavad Gita and numerous 20th century Hindu scholars such as <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swami_Sivananda_846c.html" title="Swami Sivananda">Swami Sivananda</a>?

<p>So, regarding Peer review, the condition of the article is not bad. The culture section , as it seems now, has to get rid of the sub-headings.

<p>Hi! Did you by chance add the religion stats in Demography of Kolkata? If yes, what was the source?

<p>Interestingly, the year of shifting of capital from Kolkata to Delhi is 1912, according to Britannica, whereas other sources say 1911. In fact, the article used to say both in two different sections. I cannot find out the 1911 anymore in the article.</p>
<p>The elevation is another debatable point. While in the infobox, it's 9 metres, NASA states 1.5 to 9 metres (see the reference in cited in the geography section). A table of hierarchy of the Municipal Corporation instead of that Writer's Building pic would have been much better in the "Civic Administration". Also, the article lacks a nice map. Articles like <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennai.html" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> have a kind of map that are probably created by users based on available maps.</p>

<p>Hi! Well, there was some activity on Sunday, when <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> made a review of history and geography. In history, he made some changes and some embedded comments. Only on yesterday, I could address all the points. Now I am waiting for further reviw by him. I am emphasizing so much on <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a>'s reviews because he had been instrumental in almost all the Indian FAs and other FAs as well. I think it is wise to fix the problems pointed out by his reviw and then go for FAC.

<p>LoL. It really sounds confusing. "Palta" is in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_24_Parganas_24aa.html" title="North 24 Parganas">North 24 Parganas</a>, a separate district. However, Palta water treatment plant is within KMDA area. Ganga water is treated in Palta ( I am not really sure who really does this, KMDA or KMC as the websites of both KMDA and KMC claims what they recently did in Palta!!). Then water is sent to KMC area, initially at Tala (a really HUGE tank) <a href="http://www.catchcal.com/kaleidoscope/places_to_visit/tala_tank.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catchcal.com/kaleidoscope/places_to_visit/tala_tank.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and also to some other smaller tanks.

<p>Hi Blacksun - could you please give me a critical evaluation of this article on the talkpage? I don't think another PR is needed, and with your help I can make all the remaining necessary corrections before FAC.

<dd>Hmm. Once it had a swanky IT company pic. But it was removed. Unlike Mumbai, Kolkata lacks any telltale economic icon.(Mumbai has Dalal Street BSE). Port activities would have been better. But getting a pic of the activities in the port is not easy. Plus, the port is not that much imp in Kolkata now.</dd>
<dd>It's really a problem. For the time being, let's keep the flower market.I have a mental pic though which may be most apprpriate. A pic of the River Hooghly with an array of chimneys billowing smoke, preferably shot from the opposite bank, or, for clarity, from a boat in the river!

<p>Hi! Basically I am not sure if I'll put it on FAC now. I am going through some busy times (personal works). I fear I won't be able to dedicate time if some critical issue is raised in FAC. And I will not be able to totally free of works before mid-June. Now, that dos not mean I am taking a total wiki-break, but, still. If you have time, you are welcome to go for an FAC of the article. I shall, of course, be there to help. See Nichalp's comment in my talk page (dated 20 April), see if you can help.

<dd>A peculiar ptoblem, the coordinates! Several sources differing. More or less 22, 32 amd 88, 20 seem to be okish. Whilr the coordinates in the right above corner is different.

<p>Hey Blacksun, hope you don't carry any hard feelings over the Kargil War dispute as I won't. I just want you to know that detailing info on why people are wrong (minus the insults) is generally more persuasive than simply calling people shameful and silly.

(in the initial days, remember!) I think those were your first days in Wikipedia as well. Meanwhile, your efforts especially in Hinduism, India FARC, IIT, Patel (and I do not know where else) were great. Thanks a lot. And also I think you were pretty much bored with the delay. But Nichalp was doing wonderful stuffs with the article. the result was a nearly cleen sweep in FAC. In fact, Nichalp told me he was disappointed with that one oppose! A real perfectionist. Bye.

<dd>I am restoring the original text on Ahmedabad for now. There is no controversy over the fact that the riots happened after the Godhra incident. Also you have added that over a thousand people died without any source. I am changing that text to "claiming the lives of many people" - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 07:48, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was under the impression that the cause of the train deaths was a controversy as a government report claimed that it was an accident. Also, stating many people died sounds like a bad cover up to me. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 03:57, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok. I get your point now. I thought you were saying that the fact that the riots followed the Godhra incident was controversial. My bad. I will try and convey that the cause of fire is controversial soon. Also, I am not trying to cover up the death toll. Am in the process of finding out from some good source the exact toll so that no one can challenge it. Thanks for your concern. BTW, did you notice all the new pics? Makes the article look great. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 05:09, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No problem. I think that you should avoid citing the controversy by making a general statement that does not go into the details of how/why/where it started. Keep all that stuff to the main article. In my opinion it should be just a single sentence on the topic. And ya those new pictures are great, especially the food stalls one. I think their was a good picture of teen darwaza (posted by nichalp in discussion) that you can use instead of the delhi darwaza (which is dark and poor quality). --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 07:31, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Tagore was born in Jorasanko, Kolkata (then Calcutta) in present day India" . I understood what you meant, but this sentence structure looks a bit odd and ambiguous, doesn't it? If I say "x is born in Y in present day Z", doesn't it sound like implying X is born in some time close to the present? I suggest "in what is now India" or something less ambiguous.

<p>1.

<p><b>Reply</b>--&gt;Historians are not sure who Sala was though they have tried to associate the early kings Nripa Kama I or II, but this has not gained popular support. The legend of Sala bacame more popular from around 1117 CE after Vishnuvardhanas victroy over the Cholas after which sculptural and inscriptional depictions started to appear.

<p>Hi, I only just read your posting of earlier today (Jan 5) on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndia_23a2.html" title="Talk:India">Talk:India</a> page, and I took the liberty of putting it in its proper time order (it was getting to be confusing). I agree, I don't see much substantive difference between "occupation" and "colonization," however, I am also aware that in history texts these words have specific meanings and I leave it to experts like John Kenney to tell me what is proper usage these days. Notice that the sentence that appears in the current version of the lead uses <i>neither</i> word (and it has been that way for over a month). My understanding of my interlocutors' view is that because they think the British were "occupiers," they are justified in not mentioning the British <i>at all</i> on the India page; instead they would like to use general words like "foreign occupation" and "non-native expulsion." They see any mention of the British an implicit acknowledgment of "colonization," a word they seem to hate. And apparently words like "overthrew," "expulsion," or "ejected" are also important to them. Their version of the sentence in the lead reads:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">India emerged as a modern democratic nation-state in 1947, after it overthrew foreign occupation by widespread use of nonviolent resistance as a means of social protest.</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>As for my examples of human migrations out of Africa, I was being a little provocative to be sure, but I was making a general point that when an invader occupies a land, it doesn't matter to the occupied people whether the invader is planning to settle or not, their land is gone regardless. I think the reason that the British are seen as occupiers or colonialists in their stint in India has more to do with what stage of history (travel, communication) we are in than with whether their headquarters were in London or not. The <i>Afrikaners</i> after all chose to settle in South Africa, arriving 350 years ago during the time of Shah Jahan (and their name even means "African") however, they are still seen as "occupiers" by many black South Africans. The same with the Israelis—they definitely want to settle (and aren't going back to any place), but the Palestinians think of them as occupiers. The reason why the Moghuls, the Indo-Aryans, the Dravidians (who came from the Middle-East and not Africa), and all the previous human groups who invaded India (going back to the first human migrants <a href="https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html" class="external text" title="https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html" rel="nofollow">out of Africa</a>, 55,000 years ago) are <i>not</i> seen as occupiers, is that the accounts and memories of the occupied—of the trauma they endured—have been lost.</p>
<p>My basic point is that whether you regard the British to be villains or saints, they <i>were</i> in India and they influenced modern-day India in myriad ways down to the language we all use in Wikipedia; they deserve a mention on the India page. As for "occupation" or "colonization," I'm using neither word. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 23:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that the problems in the article were due to the fact that it was rushed to FA. The review it went through was not as thorough and their was a sense of "FA will iron out the kinks" to the candidacy. Regarding the culture, I have to disagree with your comment to some extent. I recall reading many interesting articles about various sub-cultures that exist in present-day Delhi. It can be anything from the increasing night life to the effect of being so close to the power center of India. Their has to be a lot to be said about Delhi that cannot be said about other cities.--<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 22:06, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

So better if you view this issue in a NPOV, strictly. Then the working of wiki users rests upon the intrest he/she had with a topic to write on.

<dd>I ask, for a festival in Meenakshi temple Madurai, the news papers generally, don't call it as "thousands of Saivites participated", but instead as "thousands of Hindus". Similarly in the case of other Vaishnavite temples. But during an Ayyavazhi festival, the news papers, while reporting the news they call as thousands of "Ayyavazhi followers" participapted in. How many such reports I want to cite? from Daily Thanthi,(News Paper, Supposed to be the largest readership in India) Dina Malar Dina Karan etc.</dd>

<dd>I wanted to offer my help in this regard, since he was referring about lot of local newspapers. Since I know Tamil, I thought I can be helpful to evaluate this issue impartially. I found few local newspapers which mentions separately about Ayyavazhi sect. But I am not able to conclude whether these reports are sufficient evidence to say Ayyavazhi sect is separate religion. I will ask for some more evidence and then try to translate few pages in English. Let wiki community decide... Are you comfortable with this arrangement? --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 04:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Some of the citatons given by Paul definitely proves the existence of Ayyavazhi sect. I will translate it once I am back from holidays. Whether it is recognized as separate religion by majority of its followers is disputable. But citaions proves that some section of their population considers it as separate religion. I am not able to assign % on either side. It seems recently Ayyavazhi is removed from many pages. I feel some of those pages deserves mention about Ayyavazhi. It would be better if we avoid mass removal of Ayyavazhi contents from all articles. Of course Ayyavazhi should not have disproportionate amount of contents in each article....(Like it had in Dharmic religin page). Can we desist from removing Ayyavazhi totally from all articles till we come to some understanding based on Tamil newspaper reports. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 04:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It seems like their is no actual evidence then? We already knew that "some" people in Ayyavazhi believe that it is a separate religion because Paul believes so. However, how significant is that some? Their are people in many other Hindu sects that believe their sects are separate religions and I can find far more significant citations for them. Does it mean that we call them separate religions and list them under articles such as <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharmic_religions.html" title="Dharmic religions">Dharmic religions</a>? What about the fact that the current version of <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">Ayyavazhi</a> article leans very heavily towards theory of it being a separate religion? I also wonder how many people of AV sect believe that Hindu gods are insignificant to them now compared to the newest incarnation of God as per AV mythology (at least how it is presented in the AV article)? You have asked MANY good questions to Paul in the discussions you have had with him and I have not seen a single good response to any of those questions put forward by you. Wikipedia is not meant to perform original research but representation of current knowledge. I dare say we are doing lots of original research here in a very nonacademic manner. Their is only so much one can infer from random newspaper clippings of a local newspaper. I personally would never use even New York Times as a primary source. No offense to you and I appreciate your continued assistance. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 12:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that credible evidences are not available to show that majority of Ayyavazhi followers consider themselves as separate religion. I meant "some" not based on Paul or few individuals views. Tamil regional newspapers do mention Ayyavazhi separately.(These reports available mostly in regional editions of regional newspapers meant for specific districts). --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 06:06, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
