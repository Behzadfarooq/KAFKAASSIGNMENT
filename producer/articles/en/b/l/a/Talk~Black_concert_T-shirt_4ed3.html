<p>T-shirt sales are a big part of the concert biz, but as titled, I don't think the article describes something worth treatment separate from <i>Event T-shirt concessions</i> (or something similar), or <i>List of teenage dirtbag fashion statements</i>. Actually, this entire article could be pasted into <a href="../../../t/-/s/T-shirt.html" title="T-shirt">T-shirt</a>.</p>
<p>Yes black was a popular color for "rock" tees, but I don't think the color was linked to live music as a cultural phenomenon or anything — my black band tee (Jimi Hendrix, circa '78) was purchased in a record store, and had no appearance dates. White shirts were sold even then at some concerts, and today concert tees come in a range of colors for some artists.</p>
<p>I'd {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a>}} tag this, but would like to hear others' opinions about why this article exists, at least as titled. — <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarde_393d.html" title="User:Edgarde">edgarde</a> 16:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As creator of the original <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_concert_T-shirt_3cb4.html" title="Black concert T-shirt">Black Concert T-shirt</a> article, my opinion is that the black concert t-shirt is more of a trend/fad or phenomenon than any other type of concert merchandise. It is also more than just a teenage fashion statement. It has become a standard of dress, a uniform of sorts, for concert goers worldwide. When one plans to attend a concert, they think..."hmmm what should I wear, how about this black concert t and some jeans, yeah that is probably good." Granted they are not only worn to concerts, but at concerts they are choice attire. I am sure there are more references in news articles, mentions in books, mentions in song lyrics or stories about the black concert t-shirt, I just havn't been able to find them. The article could easily be beefed up some if more material can be pulled from other sources.</dd>
<dd>As for mentioning in the <a href="../../../t/-/s/T-shirt.html" title="T-shirt">T-shirt</a> article, my opinion is that the black concert t-shirt really only deserves brief mention there rather than a full section, especially if <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_concert_T-shirt_3cb4.html" title="Black concert T-shirt">Black Concert T-shirt</a> can be significantly beefed up. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattarata_b773.html" title="User:Mattarata">Mattarata</a> 03:27, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would if it was a documented and established fad or trend. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is established in a very small way by the one news reference and the image.

<p>My opinion is that you, Edgarde, seem to think that this is not notable, which is obvious from some of your statements ("<i>teenage dirtbag fashion statements</i>", etc.). However, it is a widespread trend, and a lot of non-teens wear concert T-shirts. I myself wear nothing else, and I'm 21. This is a notable clothing article, like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Rock_22be.html" title="New Rock">New Rock</a> boots, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leather_jacket.html" title="Leather jacket">leather jackets</a> (see also <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocker_jacket.html" title="Rocker jacket">rocker jacket</a>), <a href="../../../k/u/t/Kutte.html" title="Kutte">Kutten</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_band.html" title="Spike band">spike bands</a>.</p>
<p>I agree however that the title is a bit strange, and it would probably be a good thing to move it to something like "Concert T-shirt", as there are concert T-shirts that aren't black.</p>
<p>As Mattarata points out, merging this into T-shirt, though a tempting idea, would condemn this material to remain as a small section and never be expanded. There is surely stuff to add, like a history of these clothing articles, their economic significance for bands and organisers of tours, etc. There are plenty of articles about fashion, and there is nothing wrong with that, provided that it is a sufficiantly widespread trend (which is the case) and that there are reliable sources.</p>
<p>If this article was to remain in its present state, then it should be merged. But as I say, it could be expanded, and would then be worthy of its own space. So for the moment I <b>oppose</b> a merge, but if nothing has changed in a couple of months, then it should be merged (it is a fairly young article after all, let's give it some time). <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>Iron</b></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_Esperanza_81b2.html" title="User:IronChris/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>C</b></font></a><a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris"><b>hris</b></a> | <a href="../../../i/r/o/User_talk%7EIronChris_59e6.html" title="User talk:IronChris">(talk)</a> 17:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay I've ticked someone off again. I should work on giving more neutral examples.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Would a rename to <i>Concert T-shirt</i> be acceptable? Might <i>Band T-shirt</i> (or something similar) be even better by virtue of being more inclusive? Plenty of band T-shirts (even black ones) aren't purchased at concert venues. I feel like my Monster Magnet "School Free Drug Zone" T is in the spirit of the article you want. — <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarde_393d.html" title="User:Edgarde">edgarde</a> 19:38, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just wanted to add that initiating the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Category%7EAll_articles_proposed_for_deletion_e97f.html" title="Category:All articles proposed for deletion">AfD</a> process wasn't my idea. For what it's worth, if this article is deleted, but as a section of <i>T-shirt</i> it grows in a healthy fashion, you'll have a case for forking it off into a new article like this one. There's no reason good, verifiable information would be confined to a small, insufficient space. — <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarde_393d.html" title="User:Edgarde">edgarde</a> 20:29, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I admit I'm impressed by <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattarata_b773.html" title="User:Mattarata">Mattarata's</a> references. I think the way to go would be a rename to Band T-shirt, with a section on <i>Black concert T-shirts</i>. If someone can't fashion a reasonably encyclopedic entry on that sub-topic, just a list of terse quotes from Mattarata's references with in-line citations would certainly stand up. Then put a {{<a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">main</a>}} "Main article" link on <a href="../../../t/-/s/T-shirt.html" title="T-shirt">T-shirt</a>.</p>

<p>i'm all for keeping this page, but a rename would be nice. while most people are pushing for a more generalized name in terms of colour, i'm voting for dropping the 'concert' bit. black t-shirts have become a generic term for concert goers in some places... in india for one. unfortunately, i wouldn't have any references for this. i speak purely from experience. it's on the lines of calling people longhairs. in a sentence, 'oi, black t-shirts, shift your moshing away from the stage. you're stepping on my pedals.' --Yufeeko 17:26, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
