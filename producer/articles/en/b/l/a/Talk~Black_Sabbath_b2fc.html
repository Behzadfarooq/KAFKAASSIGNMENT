<p>So, any word yet if Black Sabbath is going to go back into the studio? If they are, they won't be the only band with a 12-year studio hiatus: <a href="../../../d/2E/r/D.R.I._b760.html" title="D.R.I.">D.R.I.</a>'s last album came out in 1995, too. Should Sabbath decide to return to the studio, they need to make sure that it's something that can stand with the rest of their albums. But knowing Sabbath, they won't go back if they're not certain. <a href="../../../u/r/f/User%7EURFG_e971.html" title="User:URFG">URFG</a> 19:25, 7 April 2007 (UTC)URFG</p>

<p>In the article a comment is made to the effect that occult and magic were referred to in their songs 'to the exclusion of other subjects' this is wrong and indeed tantamount to urban myth in relation to the band. Indeed with the exception of the songs on Black Sabbath the album I struggle to think of any others with overt occult references. Take Paranoid and go through the tracks(since this is their 2nd album you would expect it to be an occult-fest if the authors premise is true).Warpigs-as discussed about the vietnam war(yes it actually mentions 'witches at black masses'but only in reference to the evil of politicians).Paranoid;somewhat obvious.Planet Caravan;spacey and mellow scifi/fantasy(no sacrificial goats).Iron man;strong scifi imagery.Hand of Doom;drugs.Fairies wear boots;drugs.Electric funeral;don't know But no sorcery that I am aware of.</p>

<p>The wording of this article doesn't sit well with me. There is too much "Black Sabbath is the *real* heavy metal" for a proper encyclopedia article. Either experts should be referenced giving their opinions about how Black Sabbath compares to Led Zep, et al, or the claims about Sabbath's superiority should be removed. Example: "Even though Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Cream, and Deep Purple had a profound influence on the emergence of hard rock and heavy metal music, Black Sabbath was the first true heavy metal band." --iwakura42</p>
<p>Um i think Black Sabbath were the first heavy rock band, i think judas priest were the first heavy metal band. im not dissin on sabbath but they dont really have any of attributes of being metal, with exception to some songs. (even if they were called so by the press) - paulo</p>

<dd>Remember, you can always make edits you think are appropriate and necessary rather than add tags like this. In any event, take a look at the POV-stripping I just did and, if you think it's close enough, remove the tag. I didn't touch the later history sections which aren't as blantantly POV but could really use some tightening up by someone who is interested. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 13:53, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've changed some bits, out of time now, but really needs more work, I love Black Sabbath, but this is an encyclopedia - not a fan site. If you disagree with any of the changes I made (wasn't logged in - forgot) feel free to change them back, but I simply disagreed with some of them (particularly about influences with modern heavy metal music, I believe what Cream and Led Zeppelin did earlier on had much more of an impact and also the more successful style of them lead to greater influence in that time over Black Sabbath). <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonj2_a1b1.html" title="User:Simonj2">Simonj2</a></dd>

<p>Hi, shouldn't Sabbath be classified as a Hard Rock Band while being one of the prime influences/progenitors behind Heavy Metal? 61.17.68.48 21:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've heard that Tony Iommi invented drop d tuning as a result of a missing or mutilated tuning, not sure if this is true, but if it is, it should definitely be mentioned here. <a href="../../../z/e/l/User%7EZelmerszoetrop_a675.html" title="User:Zelmerszoetrop">Zelmerszoetrop</a> 03:27, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He did use lowered tunings to lessen the strain on the tips of his injured fingers...but he didn't invent it. And, even if he did, that sort of info is better suited to the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Iommi_bd98.html" title="Tony Iommi">Tony Iommi</a> article and not this article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnger22_483f.html" title="User:Anger22">Anger22</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAnger22_263b.html" title="User talk:Anger22">Talk 2 22</a>)</small> 03:55, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I believe the first guitarist to use it was Robby krieger wasn't it? In the song The end, correct me if I'm wrong <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.194.16.5_ab67.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.194.16.5">207.194.16.5</a> (talk) 13:51, 9 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>This probably wasn't invented by a single guitarist, since all it is is detuning the low E string down a whole step. I can think of a couple instances where it was probably used prior to Sabbath's first album. -<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFendersmasher_de4b.html" title="User:Fendersmasher">Fendersmasher</a> 01:41, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Offspring? Malmsteen? Tool? What have you been smoking? Tool's music sounds <i>nothing</i> like Black Sabbath's. The only thing that Sabbath has in common with a lot of these bands is dark imagery and a penchant for loud rock guitar. -- <a href="../../../g/o/a/User%7EGoatasaur_0832.html" title="User:Goatasaur">goatasaur</a></dd>

<p>Sorry bud, but the fact that Offspring, Malmsteen and Tool don't SOUND exactly like Sabbath doesn't mean they weren't influenced by Sabbath. These musical acts have most likely sited Sabbath as an influence themselves. I can definitely point out the obvious influences (with song and bar references) if you like. P.S. Why are Black Sabbath being refered to as a "metal" band? Their music is miles away from metal and they have said themselves many times that they have no connection to metal. I'm sure most of you will agree that they define hard rock/blues.</p>

<p>I apologize for muddling the issue of the origin of the band name. The "Dennis Wheatley novel" story is told in the liner notes for the Rhino Records Black Sabbath box set, as it is in most all web bios of the band, which seemed authoritative enough, but a bit more research does indeed show that there is some dispute about this -- in particular there is an interesting <a href="http://www.zeromag.com/articles/article_view.php?id=90&amp;pi=0" class="external text" title="http://www.zeromag.com/articles/article_view.php?id=90&amp;pi=0" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with Geezer Butler where he discusses the origin of the name of the song without mentioning <i>either</i> the film or the supposed novel. What does seem to be clear (from many many sources including the "official" biography "Black Sabbath" which is excerpted on Amazon) is that Butler was into the occult and in particular a fan of Wheatley, that he wrote the song first, and that the band was named after the song. I've re-drafted to reflect this without repeating the seeming wrong conventional story about a novel that doesn't appear to exist. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 23:01, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arguably the most influential <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal.html" title="Metal">metal</a> band of all time, some have even labeled Black Sabbath as the "fathers of metal". Being the founding force in defining the sound of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a>, the band derived metal from the blues-rock sound of the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960%27s.html" title="1960's">1960's</a>. The original lineup consisted of <a href="../../../o/z/z/Ozzy_Osbourne_4e24.html" title="Ozzy Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, vocals; <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Iommi_bd98.html" title="Tony Iommi">Tony Iommi</a>, guitar; <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_Butler_b3da.html" title="Terence Butler">Terence Butler</a>, bass; and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Ward_c21c.html" title="Bill Ward">Bill Ward</a>, drums. The band was formed by four teenage friends near Aston, Birmingham.

<p>Well, the last thing's wrong, the book might have been written by dennis wheatley, but it was the movie that inspired them; i really don't think they ever read the book.</p>

<p>Black Sabbath was signed onto Phillips Records in 1969. In January 1970, the Phillips subsidiary Fontana released their debut single, "Evil Woman"; the single did not chart. The next month, a different Phillips subsidiary, Vertigo, released Black Sabbath's self-titled debut album. The album was an immediate success in the U.K. topping the top 10 chart almost immediately. In the United States, the album was licensed to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._Records_a338.html" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>. It was released in the United States during May of 1970, three months later reaching the top 40 of American charts; holding that position for a year. Promptly releasing a second album during September 1970, The band had even more success, achieving number three on the U.S. charts. Along with their first album, remaining in the top 40 charts for over a year.</p>
<p>Master of Reality, their third album, was released in August of 1971. Practically sharing the same success as the previous albums. Three albums were released between 1970 and 1971 alone.</p>

<p>The group struggled for the first time in 1974 since it released its first album. Due to managerial disputes the band was stalled until July 1975. They returned with their sixth album, <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage_%28album%29.html" title="Sabotage (album)">Sabotage</a>. Due to a shift of American musical atmosphere, the album struggled. It did, however, reach the top 20 on the American charts. Responding quickly to this change, Black Sabbath released the colossal-selling album, We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'N' Roll.</p>
<p>Disagreement with changing several musical elements in the band was resisted firmly by Osbourne. Eventually several new elements were introduced in their eighth album, <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technical_Ecstasy_342e.html" title="Technical Ecstasy">Technical Ecstasy</a>. The album sold well, but did not live up to the sales of previous albums. This eventually led to Osbourne leaving the band in November of 1977.</p>

<p>The line regarding Ozzy "never getting the attention he deserved" is not only incredibly fanboy, but also wrong. He got an NME award for "godlike genius" in 2004. Not sure how much it counts for, but it is something.</p>

<p>I would agree with this, definitely. Especially in the US, Ozzy is regarded as BEING Black Sabbath and a lot of people only regard the Ozzy-era albums as actual Black Sabbath albums, with the exception of a few people who also like the Dio era. The current "greatest hits live" package trotted out every year at OzzFest is regarded almost as Ozzy and a backing band.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 22:16, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

So, yes, at one time this could have been considered to have been available on "album" because of the audio CD.

<p>The word "psychedelic" does not appear no article, even though it is somewhat natural to see Black Sabbath's early music heavily influenced by psychedelic rock. I guess psychedelic rock (stuff like Doors and Cream's Disraeli Gears and many Hendrix's numbers) was a kind of bridge between the early blues rock and Black Sabbath's music. Adventurous compositions and distorted guitars all come from psychedelic rock, and Black Sabbath develops that thing into something new.</p>

<p>It might be an idea to add the influence Black Sabbath had on the grunge-scene, IMHO. The band didn't only have a profound (?) influence on metal; bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney and other grungebands are (to some degree) influenced by Black Sabbath.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another innovation was the by-product of an accident: Iommi's fretting fingers were injured in an industrial accident during his early tenure with Earth. He was working in a sheet metal factory at the time and the tops of the two middle fingers on his right hand were sliced off. Initially, he forged himself prosthetics from a melted plastic detergent bottle. The injured fingers were understandably tender, so Iommi downtuned his Gibson guitar from standard E to C#. The resultant slackness of the string allowed him to play with less bother to his fingertips. Butler also downtuned his bass guitar to more easily follow Iommi's playing. The lower pitch often seemed "heavier" or more substantive, and Black Sabbath were perhaps the first popular group to downtune. The practice of downtuning is now common — perhaps even standard — among metal groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph is mostly false and misleading. It states Iommi's accident occured when Sabbath was called Earth, which would have been before Sabbath released any albums, obviously. The fact is, Iommi did not downtune his guitar at all the on the first two Black Sabbath albums(Black Sabbath and Paranoid). The first album he tuned to a C# on was Master of Reality. Later albums were downtuned, but not always to a C#.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi. I'd also like to add that Sabbath definitely not the first band to downtune. At least one other band did this before them, and that would be Led Zeppelin, who have some songs tuned down a whole step on their 1969 album Led Zeppelin II</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>I don't believe this is true, but if you think it is you need to at the very least list which songs are allegedly downtuned. As an avid guitar player and Zeppelin fan, I cannot think of a single one that album.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>EDIT: ^What you are saying is false. Led Zeppelin used DADGAD tuning not full step down.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyways, Tony Iommi did loose his fingers when the band was called Earth. He didn't tune a whole step down until 1971(third album). He found it more comfortable fr his fingers. He didn't tune to C# until MUCH later</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah you guys are right, the first two albums i believe are in standard tuning, mor is in c# but after this album they started tuning to eb. i think someone shuld change that on the main page. - Paulo</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me get this straight, Black Sabbath and Paranoid were in standard tuning. Master Of Reality, Vol. 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage were all in C#. That's all I know. All the albums after that I have no clue about.</dd>

<p>Most fans of the band know the story behind Jeff Fenholt and his involvement with "Seventh Star", when he auditioned for Tony Iommi. I worked with a young lady who was an evangelical Christian who told me in 1996 she was going to hear the former singer of Black Sabbath at a Christian service. I wondered who this could be; my first thought was David Donato, until she showed me a flyer advertising the service that had Fenholt's name on it. This was the first I ever heard of Fenholt and I told her he was never in Black Sabbath (I named her all the vocalists from Ozzy to then-vocalist Tony Martin) but she was quite insistent that he was.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 05:30, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I heard something a lot differently about the song. Although it was true that Geezer used to be into occult stuff, he was freaked out when relatives of his started getting real sick. Ozzy suggested he get out of the occult stuff, and contributed to writing the song. Also, their name is from the movie, not the book (that info taken straight form an interview with Ozzy).</p>

<p>"...Sadly, this reunion took over all Sabbath activities, meaning that Tony Martin, etc., were no longer in the band.

The viability and relevance of Black Sabbath has been seriously damaged since 1997."</p>

<p>I want to recommend that Holly Jolly Sabbath be added as an entry to Wikipedia. It is an annual party started in Brooklyn, New York in 2001. It is a simple holiday traditon that involves three simple elements. A Christmas tree with blinking lights, Claree, and all of the Black Sabbath records. It is a simple party to do. One simply needs the above three things and maybe some weed. It takes place on the Sunday before Christmas day after sunset when all participants gather in a dark space lite only by the tree, they consume Claree which is a spiced red wine from Medieval times, and they listen to all the Black Sabbath records in order from the first until the last. It was started in the early seventies by a man named Chuck from Montana. When he moved to Brooklyn he and several friends decided to make it an annual affair. All are encouraged to celebrate this day wherever they might be. Equaltoheaven 04:51, 19 January 2006 (UTC)Wolfy</p>

<p>In the newest addition to the article, there is a section about a new album. Its fairly biased against Ozzy and I think unjustly so.

But after several tries Ozzy (and maybe the others aswell) decided they couldn't make an album worthy of the Sabbath name.

<p>Can someone please take Mike Bordin's name off of the template box at the bottom of each Sabbath album review? He was a session musician just like Rick Wakeman, Adam Wakeman, etc, during Ozzfest 1997 and that's it. It wasn't even a Sabbath tour....it was just Geezer and Tony joining Ozzy onstage at the end of each night for a few Sabbath tunes. Bordin happened to be Ozzy's drummer, and since Bill wasn't involved, they just used Ozzy's drummer. He was never a member of the band and needs to be removed from the template box (which is great, by the way)</p>
