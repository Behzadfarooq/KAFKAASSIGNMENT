<p>The classic blast beat is alternating bass and snare done at a 16th note pace with cymbal synced to the bass hits. 1 and is bass and e and a is snare. Doing full 16ths on snare alone is more of a gravity blast.</p>
<p><br />
many drummers do, in fact, play blasts with 1 foot, unless their playing at ludicrous speeds, like 240 up. so anyway, i'm changing that.</p>

<dd>I think that the wording "torrents of alternating snare and bass" is confusing. If the bass and snare were played alternately, would this not be the 'bomtish' beat that is often played by a wide variety of metal bands (thrash etc. especially). I have always held blastbeat to mean where bass and snare are played simultaneously.</dd>

<dd>I also read in an interview with derek roddy that blastbeats originate in extreme jazz, and many of the players could play the beats far faster than many metal players due to their skill.</dd>

<p>Spearhead has repeatedly removed artists who who "notable artists" (supposedly, I'm not sure, It's not my favorite genre of music). Is this vandalism and personal preferences, or are these drummers actually NOT notable artists. Both Spearhead and users adding artists, such as dbftz, seem to be contributive, productive users. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetalcore424_065c.html" title="User:Metalcore424">Evan Seeds</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMetalcore424_ebe0.html" title="User talk:Metalcore424">(talk)</a> 16:19, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Many drummers are repeatedly added to this list by mostly anonymous users... for many of them I'm not even sure they use blast beats at all.

<dd>Umm, how about instead of randomly removing all drummers, you instead just check out the drummer to see if they actually are a death metal drummer? Just removing all notable artists would be like removing all bands from the list of notable death metal bands, just because they "might not even be death metal."

<p>Ok, I re-added Fenriz of Darkthrone and added Varg Vikernes, the reasons are that both have used blast beats before some bands that appear on the list. Darkthrone is obvious, but before you start asking "why Varg?" Well, listen to his first Album (Burzum), blast beats are used there and that album is older than some bands mentioned on the list, and since Burzum/Darkthrone are considered to be of the most influential Black metal bands, I really think they should be on the list. Cancerbero 8 20:11, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And so I re-removed them. Neither are <b>key artists</b> and Varg isn't even a notable drummer; the fact that they do use blasts doesn't warrant inclusion. Only drummers that added anything substantial to the technique / style should be here on the list, not every drummer that uses blasts. Spearhead 21:28, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your need to keep it so confined and control it (which is ridiculous) makes the list itself seem unnecessary to be included in the article and you'd likely do better to consider splitting it out entirely in a new article just as you suggested above. Especially since you aren't providing adequate reasoning behind your iron-grip on the section in order to keep a majority of the artists that comprise the list currently, aside from Mick Harris, Charlie Benante, Alex Hernandez, Flo Mounier, Pete Sandoval, Max Duhamel and Dave Hollingshead who actually are mentioned in the body of the article. --75.2.60.123 06:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not adding such a list as I doubt that it would be a valid category acocrding to WP policy and I don't see any need for it. But I won't stand in any one's way to create it. Second, like I said before, the list is not intended to be an indefinite list of all drummers that use blast beats, simply for the reason that that would be thousands. What is listed here are drummers that actually contributed to the technique/style - maybe few are more in the category good examples. My reasoning for inclusion is simply - provide actual reasons why the should be included in the list. Putting in "hey drummer X uses blasts" or "band Y is very popular" or "this band is really old and uses blasts" are simply not very good reasons. Like what happened on the similar article <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_grunt.html" title="Death grunt">death grunt</a> we can put up a voting here as for whom to include.

<dd>The name "key artists" causes confusion, because you're saying "only those that contributed to the technique" doesn't mean that those who use blast beats in all of their songs shouldn't be included. I had re-added Fenriz because all of Darkthrone songs have blast beats, since their first album to the newest one, I mean, have you even listened to the Transilvanian Hunger album for example? "Key artists" should be a guide for people to listen to a song by certain band and understand what blast beats are if they don't actually understand the terminology used or don't want to listen to the sample file or whatever, what if they listened to "The pestilence that walketh in darkness" by Cryptopsy because Mounier is mentioned a lot in the article? Darkthrone is not only a popular band, but they have more albums than some of the bands mentioned AND they use blast beats in ALL of the songs; and how have some of the bands there contributed to the technique? If you really want to keep this list only with the artists YOU want, then at least mention in the article that your list includes only those who have helped the technique, not only being pioneers in performing it.

<p>According to the article, a blast beat is solely a beat consisting of alternating bass and snare beats (sort of a reverse polka/punk beat). However, from what I've heard as a drummer, and what seems to be common knowledge among drummers, a blast beat is generally constant eight/sixteenth notes or triplets on the bass drum with a normal back beat pattern on the cymbal and snare, which contradicts the article's definition. Is there any 'official' source of which is which? -- <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetalcore424_065c.html" title="User:Metalcore424">Evan S</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetalcore424_065c.html" title="User:Metalcore424">eds</a> <a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMetalcore424_ebe0.html" title="User talk:Metalcore424">(talk)</a> 05:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The .ogg file posted here definitely has the blast beat backwards. The vast majority of blast beats alternate between the bass drum/cymbal and the snare, with the bass drum/cymbal coming first. It's like a polka beat played at a ludicrous speed. Some drummers play a double bass drum roll underneath the cymbal and snare; others simply hit the bass drum, cymbal, and snare at the same time as fast as humanly possible. I've also seen several drummers switch hands while going into blast beats so that their stronger (usually right) arm will hit the snare at the same time as the bass drum.</p>
<p>Very few, however, play blast beats with the snare/cymbal leading before the kick drum, as it is in the sound sample on this page. Although there are some drummers who play it this way, it's pretty far from being the norm. I think most drummers would agree that, while there are many different ways of playing it, the most common blast beat consists of rapidly alternating kick/cymbal and snare hits-- not the other way around.</p>
<p>there seems to be a lot of confusion about a technical defnition of a blast beat. distinguishing between the euroblast and the u.s.-blast might bring some clarification. as far as I have experienced it, the more european style of blast beat is the one with cymbal and base together and the snare syncopated. the u.s.-stile is base, cymbal and snare toghether. listening samples of euro blast is practically all black metal (emperor, keep of kalessin, etc.), a sample for u.s.-blast would be Arsis or most american, especially tampa bay death metal. to create what has been called a "wall of sound" the u.s.-blastbeat requires more speed (since the sincopated snare of the euro-blast makes it even at 160bpm seem really fast). the term euro-blast and u.s.-blast should not divide the metal/grind scene into two fractions but show the slight differences of the interpretation of what a "wall of sound" is. plus, both styles are used in the u.s. and europe.</p>
<p>the .ogg sample would be a backward euro-blast.</p>
