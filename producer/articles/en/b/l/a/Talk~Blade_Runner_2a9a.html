<p>Its from the 80s, and if im correct, i think the song is called tonight tonight, it features Phil Collins walking to the bradbury theater using the same photography as in blade runner, the video is essentialy the last scene of blade tunner but with Collins walking in it. Should it be added here?? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 201.215.180.73 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.215.180.73_6b18.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.215.180.73">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>no, you added it all wrong, its not a Phil Collins video, its a genesis video.

And the footage its amazingly the same as the one in Blade Runner in the begginning.

<dd>Does he say the words "mishmash of Japanese, Spanish, German," and then something about "Hungarian and French"? Whatever the original author put into quotations or paraphrased needs its original source more clearly cited. If these lines are from the original cut (I've never located a copy) a simple "the film describes it as..." would suffice. If it's from Sammon's book, the article needs to say it's from Sammon's book (and hopefully give a page number).

<p>I question the acuracy of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira being influenced by Blade Runner. The movie was released in 1982, and Akira first appeared also in 1982. While this IS the same year, you don't make a movie or a manga overnight and seems very unlikely that the basis for the plot and stylization was in any way influenced by Blade Runner. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.251.12.145 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.251.12.145_8b8c.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.251.12.145">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>The comic started in 1982, but finished in 1990... that leaves plenty of time for stylistic influences from Blade Runner.

<p>In regards to the novel <i>Blade Runner 2</i>, are "the resurrection of a dead character and a complete reworking of the nature of another" really "inconsistencies with the film"? The novel is a sequel to the film, not a novelization of it. The resurrection of dead characters and changing characteristics are not unheard of in sequels. Also, claiming that "the final result is more of an alternate universe than a direct sequel" is ridiculous. Even if inconsistencies between <i>Blade Runner</i> and <i>Blade Runner 2</i> did exist, this would not affect whether or not <i>Blade Runner 2</i> is a direct sequel. Direct sequels with inconsistencies with the original work are in abundance. <a href="../../../d/t/2/User%7EDT29_b5b1.html" title="User:DT29">DT29</a> 22 May 2006</p>

<dd>Recent additions to the lead have been made with little care for good writing or readability. For instance, the statement of the insufficiency of the DVD is not only awkward but serves as commentary. The term "retrofitted future" was haphazardly thrown in to the lead where it should be specially defined (see <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELead_b989.html#Accessible" title="WP:Lead">WP:Lead#Accessible</a>).

<dd>Although I think it pertinent to note they are led by a commando, I'm not pushing for it (as its a bit of a spoiler) and wasn't added by me.

<p>I know gritty can mean realistic, and I see no problem with it being in the lead. Special effects and the sets were realistic; helping it acquire awards and nominations in that realm; this film did strive for realism, that's the point of hiring Syd Mead to do your designs and Ridley Scott (a very visual director) to direct. The current version goes into too much specifics for my liking, and doesn't seem adequately summarized. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 05:01, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for discussing edits here. I agree that "gritty" should go back in somehow (it did in a way). Realism when used to describe films suggests either a documentary-like quality or naturalistic psychological aspects. When used to describe production design, it suggests a lack of embellishment (hence the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Algiers_129d.html" title="Battle of Algiers">Battle of Algiers</a></i> example) so it would fail as a descriptor for the design of this film. I think the problem with the sentence is it still conveys "November, 2019—37 years in the 'retrofitted future'" which doesn't make sense as the term only describes the approach of the designers, not the world the characters live in (they're not "conscious" about the new being grafted onto the old—they take the contrast between the rickshaws and the spinners for granted). <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_F_5389.html" title="User:Jonathan F">Jonathan F</a> 05:33, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No problemo. Yeah, I agree on it not being "gritty" as a documentary... maybe "gritty atmosphere" would be more accurate? Indeed the characters do take that for granted, I suppose its okay... but "while retaining their industrial grit" needs tweaking. Perhaps "but being covered by pervasive grit" or "while being aged by the gritty atmosphere"... something along those lines, as the grit is constant rather than retained. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, "gritty atmosphere" is good. My call to define the aforementioned design motif in the lead may have been misconceived. Since "retrofitted future" is so pervasive as a visual scheme in other media and as a phrase on the Internet, I feel now that it is sufficient to simply name it in the lead (as you had done originally =S), provided it's in a carefully worded sentence. Then, if needed, the article itself can go into further detail. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_F_5389.html" title="User:Jonathan F">Jonathan F</a> 07:52, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was a rough start; its occurance on the Internet and current sci-fi chatter is becoming commonplace, and that made me forget the broader audience. We do need to flesh it out a bit, not only to clarify BR's flavor of the term, but to explain to a 10 year old or 100 year old what the heck it is.

<p>While indeed that sentence allows for sidequels, "if part of a trilogy or series" that follows it narrows the definition sufficiently already; also "specific film series" is mentioned.

<p>Quite. Look at it the other way, is Peoples in a position of authority to make Soldier part of the Blade Runner universe? No. Three individuals who would be, are Ridley, Fancher and Dick.

<dd>We both agree that Soldier is not an official sidequel, but an unofficial sidequel. The question isn't one of authority. The question is, should Followed by list unofficial sidequels or not? The syntax guide allows is (unofficial sidequels certainly fall into "related film that came out after"), but the style guide could be wrong (and need to be corrected). But, in the end, I think there is no harm and some utility in listing Soldier in the infobox.

Regardless of what the infobox syntax says and how it can be interperated, Soldier is not a real follow up film to Blade Runner. Just because Peoples says Soldier takes place in the same universe does not make it a follow up movie in the sense of a sequel. Since it is unofficial and not part of any Blade Runner franchise, it shouldn't be listed.<br />

<dd>The scene from Soldier that the Spinner appears also has an F117, and part of the ship from Event Horizon and an Aircraft carrier. Add to that references to a Bugs Bunny cartoon, Aliens, the video game Doom, various other films and a number of other Kurt Russell films, it is hard to figure out who's universe this movie actualy takes place in. There are about as many references to other Kurt Russell films as there are to Blade Runner. Though the writer and director both say it is in the Blade Runner universe.<br />

<dd>I think citing the Hungarian and English subtitles might be a good start. But I also think that it needs to be made more distinct from the Cityspeak note -- unless all of Gaff's Cityspeak was Hungarian, which I don't think it was. And even then, perhaps it's time to create a <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cityspeak.html" title="Cityspeak">Cityspeak</a> article (as opposed to just the redirect it is now), and save these details for it. -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 12:29, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Done. With citation and reference. And no, he doesn't speak just Hungarian. It's a mish-mash of Japanese, Chinese, (Mexican) Spanish, Hungarian, French, and German. No-one can actually remember <i>exactly</i> what it translated as but Sammon, in his book, making reference to past notes provides a rough translation. Presumably the sub-titles just fill in with something loosely fitting the narrative requirements.

<p>There's a good analysis of the scene with Gaff <a href="http://scribble.com/uwi/br/br-script.html" class="external text" title="http://scribble.com/uwi/br/br-script.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In case the link ever breaks, I'll reproduce the relevant section here:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Policeman</b>: Hey, idi-wa. [ <i>Korean for: "Come here."</i> ]</dd>
<dd><b>Gaff</b>: Monsier, ada-na kobishin angum bi-te. [ <i>Cityspeak for: "You will be required to accompany me, sir."</i> ]</dd>
<dd><b>Sushi Master</b>: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.</dd>
<dd><b>Deckard</b>: Got the wrong guy, pal.</dd>
<dd><b>Gaff</b>: Lo-faast! Nehod[y] maar! Te vad[y] a Blade... Blade Runner!</dd>
</dl>
<div style="font-style: italic">
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The meaning of Gaff's sentences in Cityspeak (Hungarian):
<ol>
<li>"lo-faast" is a rude expression. Originally is written as "lofaszt" and is a combined word. "lo" means "horse" and "fasz" means "prick", "dick". Together, and with the suffix "-t" [which refers accusative] it's a shortened form of "lofaszt a seggedbe" ["have a horse's dick in your ass"]. In this context it means that Gaff tolerates Deckard's answer as nuts and refuses to be ignored.</li>
<li>"nehod[y] maar", originally "nehogy mar" is an informal spoken formula, shortened from "nehogy mar ugy legyen!" meaning about "wish it wouldn't be that way!". It's enforcing Gaff's expression about Deckard's lame "leave-me-alone-sucker" answer.</li>
<li>"te vad[y]" originally "te vagy" simply means "you are".</li>
<li>"a" means "the"</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>So, a close translation is:
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Gaff</b>: Shit, man, dontcha say, you're the Blade... Blade Runner.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><b>Sushi Master</b>: He say you brade runna.</dd>
<dd><b>Deckard</b>: Tell him I'm eating.</dd>
<dd><b>Gaff</b>: Captain Bryant toka. Meni-o mae-yo. [ <i>Cityspeak for: "Captain Bryant ordered me to bring you in."</i> ]</dd>
<dd><b>Deckard</b>: Bryant, huh?</dd>
<dd><b>Sushi Master</b>: Hai! [ <i>Japanese for: "Yes!"</i> ]</dd>
</dl>
<p>As it stands, the line translated in the article as "Horse dick!" doesn't make much sense without the accompanying explanation; I gather from the above comments that the phrase is a Hungarian idiom or slang. The transcriber seems to have a pretty good idea what's going on linguistically. —&#160;<a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaonon_6201.html" title="User:Xaonon">Xaonon</a> <small>(<a href="../../../x/a/o/User_talk%7EXaonon_bb55.html" title="User talk:Xaonon">Talk</a>)</small> 06:47, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, aparently in the future, "Horse dick!" will be the a common and popular word. But other than that, thats not the only time Cityspeak is used in the movie.

<p>For the longest time I remember Blade Runner, in any version, being really hard to buy because of dvd distrubting arguments or summat. But I noticed today, while in an Australian "Big W" store that it is now for sale, the directors edition. What caused it to be suddenly back in print in a region like Australia? Can we expect the real special edition to come out soon? Will it stay in print? Is it the same as the original Blade Runner DVD, or is it enchanced in a way that modern dvds are? This article wont tell me, if anyone else knows it would be great to reflect that here, as the Blade Runner dvd was one of the first dvds ever and one of the most famous "rare" dvds to find (although I know regions like the UK have had prints of it, it was still a rare find) user:JayKeaton (I am unable to log in at this time) 202.191.106.90 16:14, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I watched Blade Runner for the first time the other day and really enjoied it. But upon reading the main article and the Themes in Blade Runner article, I fail to see how Rachael falls under the "femme fatale" definiton in any way. The Themes of Blade Runner article says, "Her ambiguous part-secretary, part-femme fatale character can be read as being objectified." I don't think she fits the difiniton of femme fatale. She is not using her female "wiles" to gain an advantage or objective. Of course, I think most of Blade Runner could "be read" in various ways and most of the analysis I have read about the movie says the movie <i>is</i> this or that without leaving room for interpretation. <a href="../../../s/2E/_/User%7ES._Randall_814e.html" title="User:S.

<dl>
<dd>A decent point; Blade Runner makes use of the film noir genre without strictly adhering to it. Although Rachael she does not exactly fit into the stereotype; that is her role within the context of the genre. For example she is mysterious, beautiful, seductive and a relationship with her is inherently dangerous. Although it may not have been her conscious intent, she did gain a major advantage in falling in love with the man that was eventually assigned to retire her. The lack of interpretive range is the result of very basic interpretations being selected to go here (main BR article); where there wide acceptance of some basic themes and threads in the film (with the exception of the Deckard debate of course). More ambiguity can be explored in the theme sub-article. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 04:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the reply. Overall, I fell that some of this artcile is just trying too hard to put importance into the movie. Was it a great movie? Oh yeah! Does it, "enfold the philosophy of religion of the increasing human mastery of genetic engineering, within the context of classical Greek drama and its notions of hubris — and linguistically, draw on the poetry of William Blake and the Bible?" I think we might be trying to read more depth into it then might really be there. The movie is important and groundbreaking without pulling a bunch of ambiguous philosophical and moral implications from the plot. Also in the same paragraph from my above quote, it says, "Blade Runner also features a chess game based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851. (The king and queen are interposed on Tyrell's side, a position which a grandmaster would never attempt.)" What does this have to do with themes from the movie? I think it is very interesting and should be in the article, but not under this topic. I'm sure everyone will disagree with me, but I just felt I needed to put it out there. <a href="../../../s/2E/_/User%7ES._Randall_814e.html" title="User:S. Randall">S.

<dd>Sorry, I hadn't realized until now there was a question open. The chess game can be viewed, especially with its title "Immortal Game", as a representation of the replicants (or humanities) struggle for immortality, and in essence challenging Tyrell's (God's) imposed mortality. I've added that to the theme section, so its a good thing you asked the question. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 03:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In short 6hawt29, Blade Runner is high end literature, if you are interested by the themes and ideas it presents then it will invigorate your mind and make you think, and make you want to watch it again and again. If you aren't that kind of person, and <b>expect</b> something else from a Hollywood movie, then you will be bored.

<p>Before I only mentioned brief reasons for my dislke of this film; but now i will go in to more detail. This movie is highly symbolic and there fore people seem to only care about its sybolism and not its plot, acting, or even entertainment. If it were judged by that criteria, people would hate it like i do. For example, if the replicants that must be "retired" are so dangerous then why would the police only send one guy after them? (not to mention a not very motivated guy) By this reasoning, Blade Runner is a bad action movie, cop drama, and sci-fi thriller. It is only a second rate philosophical piece of (boring) garbage. As a side note if you want to see good movie about cyborgs and what it means to be human, watch <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminator_2.html" title="Terminator 2">Terminator 2</a>. Blade Runner is quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time. Shame on all who enjoy it!—The preceding unsigned comment was added by 6hawkt29</p>

<p>Now then. Is it right to take this sentence out from the 'production' section:</p>
<p>"It also sheds light on Scott's directing style, which caused friction with the cast and likely contributed to <b>Harrison Ford's subsequent reluctance to discuss the film.[citation needed]</b></p>
<p>That is the bit about Ford's reluctance to 'discuss the film'. It's not true. It's a myth! He has talked about the film freely in recent times. From my research, i've included these (key quotes) where relevant in the article and fully cited. This contradicts the above (which is not even cited). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhataboutbob_c6fb.html" title="User:Whataboutbob">Whataboutbob</a> (<a href="../../../w/h/a/User_talk%7EWhataboutbob_58b5.html" title="User talk:Whataboutbob">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Whataboutbob_7ffe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Whataboutbob">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Not really. His recent comfort with discussing the film, does not necessarily contradict his reluctance to discuss Blade Runner in the 1980's and 90's.

<p>The current Syopsis reads "Deckard discovers that Tyrell's...young secretary Rachael" It is never mentioned during the scene what her role is. All we know about her at that point is that she introduces Deckard to Tyrell and seems to be present on his whim as a test subject. Later it is revealed that she has been inpmplanted with Tyrell's niece's memories. She therefore probaby thinks at the time of Deckards visit that she IS Tyrell's niece Does anyone know where this labelling of her as a "secretary" has come from. Is it referred to elsewhere in the movie&#160;? I see nothing in the scene to even suggest it. The way she speaks to Tyrell seems to be one of close aquaintence rather than the defference of a low grade employee. The way she asks Deckard "do you like OUR owl" sugests that she is high up in the company or looks upon the business assets as personal posessions, suggesting a family link to the Tyrell corp. I was going to edit this but wanted to make sure i'm not missing some info here. Harani66 17:13, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm new to wikipedia but have reviewed a number of pages before submitting content.</p>
<p>Could someone please explain why my short posting 2007-03-30, concerning Biblical themes found in the film was reverted immediately without discussion or consensus?</p>
<p><i><b>"There are many Biblical themes and symbols throughout the film. Tyrell calls Roy Batty "the Prodigal Son", Roy with a nail pierced hand and white dove in hand, saves Deckard. The kiss of Roy to his creator Tyrell, is reminiscent of Judas' kiss to Jesus. Other noteable scenes include Nuns walking in futuristic LA, a snake, as well as Roy's line when meeting Tyrell, 'It’s not an easy thing to meet your maker.'"</b></i></p>
<p>Is my paragraph inaccurate? Is there a bias against the Bible, God, Jesus, that I should be aware of before posting anything here?</p>
<p><b>Concerning Wikipedia disputes, wikipedia says: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></b></p>

<dd>Looking at your edit, the themes seem insignificant in an article of this size.

<p>Thank you for your quick reply. Concerning citations, I did cite actual movie lines and recalled some actual movie scenes. Especially concerning the Prodigal Son quote in the film, it is a direct and unmistakeable reference to the Bible story that the director / writer wanted to be placed in the film. Are the film quotes not good enough of a citation? Regardless, to paraphrase the citation guidelines <i>citations are not required but recommended and common sense should be used.</i></p>
<p>If I find a website that mentions Biblical themes in Blade Runner would my link be removed? The person that took out my edit said it was because I was opinionated. I think it is more accurate to say that I posted something he didn't like. --PrayEveryDay 21:20, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PED -- please <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_Good_Faith_4328.html" title="WP:Assume Good Faith">Assume Good Faith</a> regarding Ben Bell's removal of your edit. Throwing around accusations does not conduct a good discussion. No one doubts that there are nuns walking down the street or that there is a snake in the film -- but your <i>interpretation</i> of these things is not appropriate for an encyclopedia article. Sometimes a snake is just a snake. If you can cite a source where Scott, Fancher or Peoples talk about the things you list having religious significance in the film, then quoting that source would be appropriate. And, no, finding any old website that mentions Biblical themes in Blade Runner our sources need to be <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_FAQ_f2c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/FAQ">credible and reliable</a>.

<dd>As with many things in Blade Runner there is no straight answer within the context of the film; the front runner is obviously Roy Batty, but that's just a guess. If you mean to ask, who's eye is actually being used, it's a relative of one of the films special effects people.
