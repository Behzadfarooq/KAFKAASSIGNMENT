<p>The <b>Blackwater River</b> of southeastern <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> flows from its source near the city of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petersburg%2C_Virginia_1b62.html" title="Petersburg, Virginia">Petersburg, Virginia</a> for about 105 miles (170 km) through the Inner Coastal Plain region of Virginia (part of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coastal_Plain_736b.html" title="Atlantic Coastal Plain">Atlantic Coastal Plain</a>). The Blackwater joins the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottoway_River_11e6.html" title="Nottoway River">Nottoway River</a> to form the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chowan_River_ccd1.html" title="Chowan River">Chowan River</a>, which empties into <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albemarle_Sound_28a0.html" title="Albemarle Sound">Albemarle Sound</a>. The Blackwater-Nottoway confluence forms the boundary between Virginia and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>.</p>
<p>The Blackwater River is a true <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackwater_river.html" title="Blackwater river">blackwater river</a>. Its water is clear, dark, slightly acidic, and tannin stained. Its <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drainage_basin.html" title="Drainage basin">drainage basin</a> contains many <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp.html" title="Swamp">swamps</a>. The river's <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flood_plain.html" title="Flood plain">flood plain</a> is mostly forested and swampy, including <b><a href="../../../b/a/l/Bald_cypress.html" title="Bald cypress">bald cypress</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupelo.html" title="Tupelo">tupelo</a> swamp forests</b>. The upper Blackwater River is called <b>Blackwater Swamp</b>. In this region of Virginia, many streams are called "swamps" but still function like streams in being long and linear, with water moving from one end to the other and laid out in a normal stream tributary network. In contrast, some of the region's wetlands are not streams, such as the bog-like <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocosin.html" title="Pocosin">pocosins</a> found on the higher land between swamp-stream drainages.</p>
<p>The Blackwater River was a transportation route in the 17th and 18th centuries, connecting the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> settlements with the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albemarle_Settlements_91b5.html" title="Albemarle Settlements">Albemarle Settlements</a>. It was one of the few rivers of colonial Virginia that did not empty into Chesapeake Bay yet lay close to the colony's oldest settlements on the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_River_a894.html" title="James River">James River</a>. Settlements in the Blackwater's drainage basin were founded very early in Virginia's history. As a result, the Blackwater River became one of the early migration routes southward from the James River into the region then called Southside Virginia, and beyond into the Albemarle District of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province_of_Carolina_dd3d.html" title="Province of Carolina">Carolina</a> (later <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>). Today's usual definition of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southside_%28Virginia%29_2ba4.html" title="Southside (Virginia)">Southside</a> differs somewhat from that of colonial times.</p>

<p>The Blackwater River originates just south of the city of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petersburg%2C_Virginia_1b62.html" title="Petersburg, Virginia">Petersburg, Virginia</a> in several swamps. It flows southeast through <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George_County%2C_Virginia_57ea.html" title="Prince George County, Virginia">Prince George County</a>, where it is called <b>Blackwater Swamp</b>. It then forms part of the border between <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surry_County%2C_Virginia_7527.html" title="Surry County, Virginia">Surry County</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_County%2C_Virginia_d7fe.html" title="Sussex County, Virginia">Sussex County</a>, where its name becomes Blackwater River. It collects <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tributaries.html" title="Tributaries">tributaries</a> called Warwick Swamp, Otterdam Swamp, Coppahaunk Swamp, and Cypress Swamp. In southern Surry County, the Blackwater River turns south and forms the border between <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_County%2C_Virginia_6a71.html" title="Isle of Wight County, Virginia">Isle of Wight County</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton_County%2C_Virginia_b59f.html" title="Southampton County, Virginia">Southampton County</a>. It collects tributaries called Terrapin Swamp, Antioch Swamp Seacock Swamp, Corrowaugh Swamp, and Kingsale Swamp.</p>
<p>The city of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin%2C_Virginia_3881.html" title="Franklin, Virginia">Franklin, Virginia</a>, lies on its west bank at the river's <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_navigation.html" title="Head of navigation">head of navigation</a>. While canoes and other small boats plied the Blackwater upstream of Franklin in colonial times (and still do today), in the steamboat era, navigation was restricted to the river downstream of Franklin.</p>
<p>South of Franklin, the Blackwater River forms the border between Southampton County and <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffolk%2C_Virginia_a263.html" title="Suffolk, Virginia">Suffolk, Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>About nine miles (14 km) south of Franklin, on the border between Virginia and North Carolina, the Blackwater River is joined by the Nottoway River, forming the Chowan River, which continues south to Albemarle Sound. The boundary between Virginia and North Carolina runs west from the Atlantic Ocean, striking the Blackwater River about a half mile (1 km) north of the confluence with the Nottoway River. From there the state line follows the Blackwater River south to the confluence, then continues west.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watershed.html" title="Watershed">watershed</a> of the Blackwater River contains a portion of eight counties of Virginia: Franklin (City) County, Isle of Wight County, Petersburg (City) County, Prince George County, Southampton County, Suffolk (City) County, Surry County, and Sussex County.</p>

<p>The Blackwater River is, as its name implies, a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackwater_river.html" title="Blackwater river">blackwater river</a> — its waters are clear, dark, acidic, low in nutrients, and tannin stained. Several environmental factors cause the blackwater condition. The many forested wetlands along the river include Streamhead Pocosins and Bald Cypress and Tupelo Swamps.</p>
<p>The Blackwater is known for its pocosins, including the rare type called streamhead pocosin. The only two streamhead pocosins known in Virginia are on the Blackwater River.</p>
<p>Bald Cypress and Tupelo Swamps occur along many streams of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coastal_Plain_736b.html" title="Atlantic Coastal Plain">Atlantic Coastal Plain</a>. Most were logged, thus old-growth examples are rare. The Blackwater River Preserve protects one of the oldest bald cypress and tupelo swamp forests in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">South</a>, with trees up to 800 years old. Another stand of old-growth bald cypress and tupelo forest, known as Dendron Swamp, was recently designated a Natural Area Preserve by the Virginia Department of Conservation of Recreation.</p>
<p>Another rare type of forest found along the Blackwater River is a type called Longleaf Pine and Mixed Pine Flatwoods. The forests were once common but today are restricted to a few small sites on the east side of the Blackwater River. Near the town of <a href="../../../z/u/n/Zuni%2C_Virginia_2d03.html" title="Zuni, Virginia">Zuni, Virginia</a>, one stand is protected by the Blackwater Ecological Preserve.</p>
<p>The many old forests and wetlands along the Blackwater River have made it popular for recreational canoeing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackwater_River_%28Virginia%29_9a47.html" title="Edit section: Fishing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fishing</span></h2>
<p>The Blackwater originates as a coastal plain swamp in Prince George County. It flows east through braided channels of bald cypress and tupelo in Surry County. The river then turns south into Southampton County where several boat ramps are accessible for anglers, hunters and boaters alike. The Blackwater then joins with the Nottoway to form the Chowan at the Virginia-North Carolina state line. Floating the Blackwater River is best done with a canoe or small jon boat. There is very little or no flow much of the time, so be prepared when traveling between access points. Don't let this deter you if you are a traditional canoeist, the Blackwater boasts some gorgeous float trips through ancient tree lined wetlands. On any one trip you can see whitetail deer, numerous waterfowl, raccoons, squirrels and many unique reptile and amphibian species, not to mention a healthy fish population swimming under the water's surface. The dark, tannin stained waters of the Blackwater River host runs of striped bass, river herring (alewives and blueback), American and hickory shad in the spring. Angling for redbreast sunfish ("red throats" or "red robins") is also quite good in the spring. The river also hosts largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, flier, and chain pickerel populations. Bowfin and gar are common in the lower main stem. Angling for bowfin provides a great opportunity to catch many hard-fighting fish in a short amount of time. The possibility also exists to land a trophy bowfin over ten pounds.</p>

<p>Recreational opportunities are limited to some bridge crossings, state boat ramps, and canoe access areas. No permits are required.</p>
<p>Boat ramps can be found at Routes 611 (Joyner's Bridge Rd) and 603 off Route 258 in Isle of Wight County.</p>
<p>A new double-lane boat ramp with paved parking will be open in the City of Franklin in the spring of 2007.</p>
<p>Canoe access can be found off of Rt. 619 (Burdette), Rt. 189 (S. Quay), and Rt. 620 (Broadwater Br.), but beware of vehicle parking restrictions. If you are putting in at Rt. 620 speak with landowner across the street.</p>

<p>In 1646, after two years of war between the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony_and_Dominion_of_Virginia_f400.html" title="Colony and Dominion of Virginia">Virginia colony</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powhatan.html" title="Powhatan">Powhatan</a> confederation, a peace treaty was agreed to by the leaders of the two sides (Governor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Berkeley_9cdc.html" title="William Berkeley">William Berkeley</a> and Chief Necotowance). The treaty set the southern boundary between Virginia and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Indian</a> lands at the Blackwater River (or Blackwater Swamp).</p>
<p>By the late 17th century, some settlers from Virginia were crossing the Blackwater boundary and settling in territory of Indian tribes such as the Nottoway. The government of Virginia repeatedly ordered such people to return north of the river and would not allow land south of the river to be surveyed for <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_grant.html" title="Land grant">land grants</a>. In 1685, the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Burgesses_8b91.html" title="House of Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> asked Governor Howard for permission to grant some land south of the Blackwater River. The governor denied the request. In 1690, another order was given, demanding all settlers south of the river to return north.</p>
<p>The Indians, however, asked in 1688 for settlers to move south of the Blackwater. The reason for the request is unclear, but may have been because of "precarious economic conditions" and fear of attack and invasion by other tribes. By 1705, the Blackwater boundary law was revoked and settlements south of the river became legal.</p>
<p>Transportation in early colonial Virginia was usually done by water. The many wide <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estuaries.html" title="Estuaries">estuaries</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wetland.html" title="Wetland">wetlands</a> made land transport difficult, especially when moving goods. Migration and settlement patterns thus tended to follow the rivers, most of which flowed from the west and emptied into <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. The Blackwater River was an exception. It flowed south to Albemarle Sound. The Blackwater's headwaters were close to the main settlements along the James River (some within three miles). By the early 1700s, Virginians were living along the upper Blackwater River and using the river for travel and transportation. The political authority of Virginia was centered on Chesapeake Bay. Most of the other rivers used for travel in Virginia at the time emptied into the bay, which helped Virginia's government control the colony's affairs. The settlers using the Blackwater River, however, were drawn away from Chesapeake Bay to the relatively lawless settlements of Albemarle Bay. This played a role in the emerging "southside" society, as the region "south of the James River" became known. As early as 1713 a place called South Quay six ans a half miles downriver from Franklin was becoming an important trade port. By 1777 South Quay was known as the leading interior port to the Tidewater area. Large warehouses were storing tobacco, pork and other goods for export and import. The South Quay venture eventually also became a shipyard and built two ships that helped defend the coast from the British fleet in 1777/78, they were the Caswell and the Washington. Unfortunately on July 16, 1781 English Colonel Banastre Tarleton came from Portsmouth with 700 forces and burned South Quay to the ground. That pretty much ended what today is called Old South Quay’s history of commercial activity.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, the Blackwater River was for a time the dividing line between <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_%28American_Civil_War%29_fad6.html" title="Union (American Civil War)">Union</a>-occupied territory and Confederate Virginia. The boundary was not well defended, allowing thousands of "contrabands" (as the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavery_in_the_United_States_a248.html" title="Slavery in the United States">slaves</a> were called during the war) the chance to flee east out of Southampton County, across the Blackwater River and into freedom.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackwater_River_%28Virginia%29_9a47.html" title="Edit section: Flooding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flooding</span></h2>
<p>Because the Blackwater River drains a large area of southern Virginia east of the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_line.html" title="Fall line">fall line</a>, when heavy rainfall occurs throughout the area, severe flooding occasionally occurs at several points as the large volume of water flows downstream. Critical points of such flooding have been near <a href="../../../z/u/n/Zuni%2C_Virginia_2d03.html" title="Zuni, Virginia">Zuni</a> along <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_460_57ed.html" title="U.S. Route 460">U.S. Route 460</a>, and in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_city.html" title="Independent city">independent city</a> of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin%2C_Virginia_3881.html" title="Franklin, Virginia">Franklin</a>, which boarders Southampton County and Isle of Wight County. Unlike the marshy areas upstream, at these points the river's channel is limited, and flood stages can be reached very quickly. This occurred during <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Floyd_c5a9.html" title="Hurricane Floyd">Hurricane Floyd</a> in 1999, and again in October 2006, after an unnamed <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northeaster.html" title="Northeaster">Nor'-Easter</a> storm dumped 10 inches (25 cm) of rain on the region.</p>
