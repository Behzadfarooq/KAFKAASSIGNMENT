	    <p>This is a list of fictional experiments from the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney.html" title="Disney">Disney</a> animated <i><a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilo_%26_Stitch_7025.html" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></i> franchise, most of them making their first appearances in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Lilo_%26_Stitch%7E_The_Series_1735.html" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></i>. These experiments are <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_engineering.html" title="Genetic engineering">genetically engineered</a> creatures created by Dr. <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumba_Jookiba_0f68.html" title="Jumba Jookiba">Jumba Jookiba</a> in his lab at "Galaxy Defense Industries", with the assistance of <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Jacques_von_H%C3%A4msterviel_1ea9.html" title="Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel">Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel</a> who funded the projects with "shady" business deals. Prior to the events of <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch</i>, every experiment created dehydrated into a small orb called an "experiment pod" and stored in a special container for transport. In <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stitch%21_The_Movie_d8b0.html" title="Stitch! The Movie">Stitch! The Movie</a>, the container was accidentally opened and the pods rained down on the island of <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauai.html" title="Kauai">Kaua<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i</a>. The experiments within the pods are reactivated upon contact in water, a point of concern because many of the experiments are dangerous and Kaua<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i hosts one of the wettest spots on Earth.</p>
<p>Upon encountering each experiment, Stitch's human friend and partner <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilo_Pelekai_7f13.html" title="Lilo Pelekai">Lilo</a> gives the experiment a name just as she gave Stitch his name. The two then attempt to rehabilitate the experiments and find a purpose for them on Earth that suits their specific abilities, referred to as the "one true place" they belong.</p>
<p>Stitch, inspired by Hawaiian terminology, refers to the other experiments as his "cousins" and considers them all a part of his <i><font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>ohana</i>, or "extended family". All of Jumba's original 626 experiments have their names and numbers listed alongside the credits in <i><a href="../../../l/e/r/Leroy_%26_Stitch_9ea1.html" title="Leroy &amp; Stitch">Leroy &amp; Stitch</a></i>.</p>

<p>The first digit of the experiment numbers reflect what series of experiment they belong to. The unofficial series of experiments, as stated by Jess Winfield, one of the executive producers, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>0-Series:</b> Jumba's test batch, including many household helpers.</li>
<li><b>1-Series:</b> Civic disturbances.</li>
<li><b>2-Series:</b> Technological and scientific.</li>
<li><b>3-Series:</b> Psychological.</li>
<li><b>4-Series:</b> Mysterious series of mostly failed experiments.</li>
<li><b>5-Series:</b> Elemental manipulators.</li>
<li><b>6-Series:</b> Battlefield or doomsday experiments with galactic implications.</li>
<li><b>7-Series:</b> Specially enhanced (Currently none made)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, the colors of the experiment pods correspond to the series numbers, however some pods are incorrectly coloured.</p>

However, Felix has a problem with doing these tasks: he throws away anything assuming it's trash and tries to "sterilize" anyone, assuming they are germs. 010 is upgraded to try and be less of a neat-freak but instead it turns into a dirt-maker, so Lilo gives 010 to Gantu. Felix is named after Felix Unger, a character from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Odd_Couple_f29f.html" title="The Odd Couple">The Odd Couple</a>. When 010 is upgraded to 010.2 Lilo says that Felix is more like an Oscar, as it is named after Oscar Madison from the same play. Gantu sent Felix to Hämsterviel, who didn't like him &amp; sent him back. Gantu set him free, and Lilo and Stitch found him. Later, after he was upgraded, they sent him back to Gantu, who sent him back to Hämsterviel, who sent him back to Gantu when Woops almost broke his cover. Felix is rescued later in "Snafu". It should be noted that he can fire lasers from his nose.</td>

Slick was rescued, but Lilo had to give up the contest by giving her last chocolate bar to Gantu as a swap for Slick. Slick is given to a fundraiser, so he works for charity now, not profit.

While worn, when another creature happens to look, Checkers eyes glow a deep purple for a moment, the creature stands up straight, eyes forward, and begins to treat that him/her like a king or queen. The effect is off once Checkers is taken or knocked off. He has no effect on any other experiments. He looks like a yellow centipede. Lilo and Gantu both gained power through Checkers. Lilo's good intentions got many people (a whole list) arrested under the pretext "a troublemaker" when he/she accidentally disobeyed the rules. Gantu was in power until Stitch gathered the rest of the experiments (Reuben, Spooky, Yin, Richter, Holio, Sparky, Elastico, Kixx, and many others) and overthrew him (literally &amp; figuratively).</td>

She sings a song that turns 'good' experiments (i.e. rehabilitated experiments) to 'bad' (i.e. evil). Stitch and Reuben are immune to this, as they were made after her. The spell can be reversed by Angel singing the song in reverse or by playing a recording of it backwards. She also has a beautiful voice and a soft Scottish accent, and as seen in Leroy and Stitch, she is a remarkable fighter (or at least she is when her "buchi-bu" is in trouble). At first, Stitch saw Angel as an angel, so he named her Angel. Angel pretended to like him, but was luring him into a big trap. Upon seeing her, Stitch immediately fell in love, leaving him unable to realize what might have otherwise been guessed -- Angel is working for Gantu. In the end, she falls for Stitch and changes her ways, but is nonetheless captured by Gantu but later rescued in "Snafu" and makes another appearance in "Leroy and Stitch" when Angel wiped out a couple of the Leroy clones; saving Stitch.

<td>A small green Dinosaur like experiment designed to be the prototype to Blandzilla (612) but is to small.

The spores thavel through the air, and are virtualy weightless and tasteless, but have a light sweet/refreshing floral scent. The emition of the spores can be controled by Vito, and can also be used as a powerful irritant. At the will of the experiment, he can emit a second kind of spore that causes runny itchy eyes, sneezing/runny nose, itchy tongue/mouth, and other alergic effects. He also has completly retractable limbs, as well as partially retractible scales. His slow snake-like crawl can become a 90kmph sprint with the use of his dino-like legs. He has a dourable body, and the streingth of 20 full grown E-arth men. However, he's a very lax/layed-back type who will not fight unless he has to. He is called 003 on Stitchfan.com.</td>

It usually falls over her right eye and obscures part of the splatter marking on her forehead. Misery's ability may not seem very destructive on a large scale, but it can be devastating at a personal level. She has very subtle psychic abilities that let her pick up on what you are worrying about, or doubts you might have, and she elevates those fears by the pessimistic things she says. Something you were merely unsure about, she'll assure you that the worst possible thing will happen, and she'll make you beleive her. Just being around her has a depressing effect, and it's not helped by the fact that she's almost constantly happy.</td>

She has a tail long enough to reach to the middle of her back and large, orange, star-shaped patches on her palms followed by small patches of the same shape on the back of her paws. Short claws protrude from the end of each figure in the color of orange. Originally designed to make other people envious of each other's looks with a touch of the star on her palms. The only way to turn them back was by touching both of them with the small stars on the back of her hands.</td>

<td>She has two different versions: Her older, Stitch-like version with three arms, four spikes, and two antennea, and her original design, shown below. She can changed between the two whenever she pleases, but she usually stays with her original design. Designed to take over planets one by one. Has over 40 different functions, but has yet to figure them all out. Known ones: Think 3x faster than a super computer, Spit sticky spit, Shoot rope from her hands, Hold up to 10,000x her weight, Roll in a ball up to 60 miles per hour, Turn invisible, Fix anything broken by licking it with her tongue, Shoot laser beams out of her eyes, See things through other peoples' and experiments' eyes (literally), Start small earthquakes by slamming the ground with her legs and feet, Create and throw projectiles made of electricity, light, and darkness and Able. Water is a large weakness. Whenever she's wet, she cannot fly or use any sort of electric-based power, or she'll shock herself. She can't swim either, and she is thoroughly scared when underwater. Her temper is, technically, a weakness. For example, if she's in a certain situation requiring quiet and/or a tame temper, she's screwed. Something going along in her programming makes her utterly repulsive. She seems to turn away every almost every possible friend with her rudeness, ill-mannered attitude. There's only one experiment that actually dealed with her attitude and flopped it around... for him, anyways. Learning anything new takes time and patience... of which she has practically none of. She's insanely afraid of realtors and mushrooms... it's quite sad, really. But if you ever use it against her... you've been warned. ~INFORMATION ONCE INTENDED TO BE PLACED HERE HAS BEEN WITHELD FOR CERTAIN PIZZA-RELATED REASONS~ to create a purple force field for a limited amount of time, depending on its size.</td>

Two long antennae droop over themselves, pointed downward and filled in with the same shade of orange. Two cylindrical ears also fall down with two orange bands snapped around them. Two arms and legs prodrode out of his body, rounded on the ends with no real hands or feet. He also owns a skinny tail with the same arrow-shaped end on it as his two antennae. His stomach has a large, light blue patch on it, and his head and back markings are shaped like the ends on his tail and antennae, although the one on his head is smaller. He stands at 2 feet 6 inches tall.</td>

They could fly forever if they needed to. The original can only fly for 30min at a time and must rest an hour before he can fly again. The clones give off a very low heat signature, so one way you could find the original is by using those googles the Gantu used in the "Houdini" epi.

However there are times that he makes fun of Stitch and is unable to tolorate his mistakes. He hates Myrtle and thinks Pleakley is annoying. His one true place is living with Lilo and Stitch as their friend, partner and housemate. Because he's superior to him, 627 is Cubert's rival.

There's an interesting story behind this one: Jumba who had found 419 had forgot to turn 119's horseshoe right-side up one morn... and you can guess what happened next. For those who can't, a bowling ball that had just happened to be on the shelf above Jumba’s head fell off. When Jumba lost consiousness, he just happened to fall on top of the "Delete" key, erasing the previous hour's work - which happened to be about 419, whom he had created the night before. When Jumba woke up, he couldn't remember a single thing about 419, apart from the fact that he had created her, and with the experiment files on 419 erased, Jumba couldn't figure out what he had designed her for. He eventually gave up and filed her into the "Failed" catagory. About the only thing we do know about 419 is that she can think faster than most of Jumba's experiments, and rumor has it that she can even calculate faster than Stitch... Jumba has thus far neither confirmed or denied this rumor.</td>

His back legs are somewhat longer to aide in jumping and freeing his burrowing holes from dirt. Has an inflatable air bladder - this allows him to store oxygen for when swimming underwater (allows him to float or sink at will.) This allow gives him floating power for leaping over long distances, as well as makes him lighter to allow him to achieve higher speeds. Has awesome metabolism and a very fast beating heart to support his super-speed.</td>

<td>He's basically a nuclear reactor (designed to be a weapon). He houses several cores (due to constant decay and changing atoms, it's impossible to say at any given time what the cores are made of), and wears two cadmium capsules around his neck which he's required to swallow if he begins to overheat and approach meltdown (cadmium absorbs neutrons and slows nuclear fission, if you didn't already know). Due to the decay, he would emit a great deal of gamma radiation, but, as a safeguard (or additional weapon, however you look at it), he's equipped with a device to lower the frequency of the radiation and guide it through his hands, making him able to alter it to nearly any other form of electromagnetic wave. Hence, he functions not only as a nuclear weapon, but also a flashlight, radar scrambler, and microwave! (among other, less practical things). Unfortunately, he's pitifully weak, and, as a result, was quickly overshadowed by the next experiment created, and forgotten.</td>

His siblings and Pleakly being his biggest targets. Between his younger brother and sister Oki already shows the most independence. He likes to do things by himself and trys to avoid getting help from anyone. Oki is seen by every one as the most reckless, just like Stitch.

How ever she does have a tender side. When she's not wrestling with her Father or Brothers she enjoys helping her Mother or Lilo or even Nani with things around the house. All though she does not share their orderly way of doing things. Like her Brothers she likes to make messes. Thankfully she has better table manners then Oki, Kina or Stitch. But she still wouldn't win any etiquit competition.</td>

She’s not a tomboy but not a sissy girl; she’s in between; one minute she’s giving her mom a makeover and the next minute she’s wrestling with her dad. She likes soft things so she’ll often take her siblings plushies and teddy bears just to pet/hug them. She gets bad mood swings very often; one minute she’s happy, then she’s angry, then she’s sad. She loves attention and loves to get hugs. She can float in water and she loves to swim. Her favorite snack is Doritos but they don’t make her hyper (Cheetos do however as well as chocolate milk).

He wishes he could fly or swim but he can’t fly (obviously) and he sinks like a stone in water. His favorite game is rolling into a ball and bouncing across the room.

She may look like a sissy but she’s a tomboy; she usually roughhouses and play fights with her brother and father. She likes biting on shoes; no one knows why she likes doing that but she does. Despite looking a bit like her mother, Violet has poor singing skills. She’s also the smartest of Stitch’s pups; if she tells her younger siblings that something is going to happen and it comes to pass she always says, “I told you so!” That’s how she got her nickname Karma. (Another reason why she got the nickname Karma is because of the Alicia Key’s music video Karma. In that video Alicia Keys played a purplish/pink piano which is the color of one of her eye rings. Alicia Keys also wore a blue dress in that music video; which is the same color as her other eye ring.) Violet also loves to eat cookies; you see a cookie is to Violet as coffee is to Stitch.

<td>A girl experiment that is designed to kick booty with whips xB Every Jewel on her body is able to shoot out spiked whips (There are 26; Three on each paw, Three on each knee, one on her back, and one on her forhead.) You might think something's wrong with my math, but she is the current only one of my girls that has exra paws; not just one set, but two. Yup. She has an attitude, is angry most of the time, and hates most people's guts. So don't bother her. She's strong. (Like Stitch she can lift 3,000 times her weight...but she's heavier than Stitch.) She can bear a lot of pain and her fur is mildly armour-like. A small amount of spikes cover her knuckles, back of her feet, and back (they are retractable.) Her ear-horn...things are stretchy slightly, and prehensile. She can see in the dark, has a shriek that can shatter the sound barrier (another feat) and has a bite 3 times more powerful than that of a shark (You shark fanatics should know that that's 6,000...somethings.). Yes, she does think like a Super-Computer, a little under Stitch's level though; pretty much all experiments after him do, I think. So, she is basically the combination of the powers of the experiments (more or less) Kixx (extreme fighting capabilities), Yaarp (sound barrier-breaking batttlecry), Spike (Spikes), Splodyhead (aggressiveness), Elastico (stretchyness, but NOT a kidding fun type at all o.o), and Stitch (weight lifting, intellgence, ability to see in dark, heat-resistant fur, only BETTER 'cuz it ain't just heat)...Well...Yup.</td>

His function is that he has all powers of past Experiments and he was built so that he could once and for all destroy 626 and he has unlimited strength. He was suppose to have his own episode but Disney scrapped it due to a copyright issue. His name was going to be: evilest. and there was suppose to be a 629 a yellow version of 627 designed to be the same as 628 but stronger.</td>
