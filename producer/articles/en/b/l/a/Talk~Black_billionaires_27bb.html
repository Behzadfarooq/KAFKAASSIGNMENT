<p>EditingOprah, please discuss your opposition to the changes I made here. Many of them were minor fixes, adding citation notices, and fixing grammatical structure. I understand the problems created by multiple edits within a short time frame and I'll try to avoid doing it again. Contrary to our discussions leading up to this point, I'm not here to wreck your favorite article, but to work on what I can. Since it's apparently sticking around for good, please accept my good faith effort to improve it. Thanks! --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 22:55, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also wanted to note that most of my edits had summaries, contrary to what your reversion summary stated. Please try to be thoughtful when undoing others' work. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 22:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have repeatedly asked you to please address your opposition to the changes I made on the talk page without immediately reverting. You attest about them:</p>
<p><i>His changes are very drastic &amp; I don't have time to correct all his mistakes. He accused someone of alleging racism with a cite, he removed huge sections &amp; Forbes classifies billionaires as selfmade</i></p>
<p>I never 'accused someone of alleging racism with a cite'. Please make your reasons for reversion more clear by discussing them in-depth on the talk page. The article simply states "Racism was also suspected" with regards to Oprah's run-in with Hermes. This is speculation. Who was racism suspected by? Please cite your sources. Since the article was implying that Oprah had alleged such racist conduct, I added a "[citation needed]" tag for this claim. I also removed a phrase which was stolen directly from the Arizona Daily Star which you restored with your revert. I fixed numerous spelling, grammatical, and structural errors. As for "self-made", I believe it's a somewhat loaded term, and it was repeated excessively in the article (5 times in just that subsection). If its absolutely necessary to keep every instance of it, please argue for that here. Just because Forbes uses the word as a type of classification doesn't mean it needs to be repeated 5 times. As a show of good faith, I will attempt to await your detailed reply here and look to integrate some of the changes I think the article needs afterwards. Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 23:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>S0uj1r0 the article goes into graphic detail about all the people who suspected racism when Oprah was not allowed into Hermes (with exact quotes) so I don't understand why you're asking questions like "suspected by who?". Also, you claim a phrase was "stolen". Well I'm not sure if your definition of plagiarism is any more reliable than your definition of "original research" and "future research" but you removed a fascinating part of the discussion. Surely you realize that quoting sources is not plagiarism? And I can understand why you think the term "self-made " is POV, but once again you're taking things too literally. Obviously no man (or woman) is an island, but the term is used only to distinguish those wealthy people who did not inherit a substantial part of their fortune, and used in that sense it's quite objective. CJ Walker has been called the first self-made woman millionaire and became the richest African American, so that fact that Oprah too has become the richest African American and is also classified as self-made (she’s actually more self-made than most since her mother was on welfare) is a parallel worth pursuing. If the term was used too frequently, the last place it needs to be removed is from the photo caption, because those are often the only things people read, so the main points in each section should be summarized there. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 04:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>EditingOprah,</p>
<p>If it helps to understand where I'm coming from, here is the full text from the first point under "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>":</p>
<p><i>Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include 2008 U.S. presidential election, and 2012 Summer Olympics. By comparison, the 2028 U.S. presidential election and 2032 Summer Olympics are not considered appropriate article topics because nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research. A schedule of future events may also be appropriate.</i></p>
<p>Nothing can be said about <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Woods_3ce0.html" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a> becoming a billionaire that is not speculation at this point. The fact that he makes a large amount of money every year and if he continues to do so he will reach one billion dollars is not sufficient to meet the above criteria because it is not <i>almost certain to take place</i> in even close to the same way that the 2008 Election or the 2012 Olympics are. The inclusion of a few given sources that speculate on Tiger's income are not encyclopedic. I can present you with all sorts of similar speculations that find their way to newstands in the form of tabloids that are no more or less encyclopedic than this article. The fact that it's filled with numbers pulled from financial publications doesn't mean it's useful. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate publisher of magazine hype, nor is it a data dump for statistics from <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes.html" title="Forbes">Forbes</a>. You further state:</p>
<p><i>There are all kinds of Black scholars who have all kinds of theories of why ther aren't more Back billionaires. You may call that a POV launch pad but I call it sociological theories, and reporting on theories is what encyclopedia's do. If you feel the theories are too slanted to the political left, then feel free to add right-wing theories. But please stop advocating the deletion of this article because it's my favorite article on wikipedia.</i></p>
<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_publisher_of_original_thought" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought</a>. This includes original research and opinions of current affairs, both of which apply here. Furthermore, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. This isn't about stating both of our opinions and battling it out so that each gets equal airtime in a discordant and conflicting article full of unsound theories. This is about deciding if the article as a whole has sufficient merit to be worth keeping, and I believe I've established that it fails to meet the criteria for such in several areas. As for your last statement, plenty of articles full of vanity and original research are created and deleted every day, and they were all someone's pet project. I will, and ought to, vote for the deletion of any aticle that fails to meet Wikipedia standards, regardless of whose favorite article it is. This is one such article, and I'm in favor of deleting it and merging anything useful in it with <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html#Economic_Status" title="African American">African_American#Economic_Status</a>. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 06:03, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Souj1r0 I already explained to you several times that the article is not about only African-Americans so how could it merged into that article. Do you think America is the only place where Black people live? Anyway the interpretation of all the wikipedia rules you cite are so subjective that I have no interest in debating them because there's no objective right answer. Sure things could be changed, and things should be taken out but the basic data in the article is useful. It may not be important to you but it's survived 4 nomianation so obviously a lot of people find it useful, so why in the world would you want to deny people the opportunity to read it? I don't understand. And if you honestly feel that racial economic disparity at the highest level is not an important subject then we're living on different planets. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 06:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Okay, please <i>read</i> all the policies over again - you're completely misapplying them. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia ain't a crystal ball</a> would prevent us from saying <i>Tiger Woods will become a billionaire</i> (a prediction) but it doesn't prevent people from going <i>Hey look, Tiger Woods is pretty rich (verifiable)</i>. Similarly, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia ain't a publisher o' original thought</a> means you can't use it to publish your opinions - opinions published elsewhere can be repeated here. Maybe it wasn't clear that this means only <i>Wikipedia is not a</i> <b>first</b> <i>publisher of original thought</i> but also everything in here is either original thought or original research by someone at somepoint, published somewhere else, then republished here. That's how encyclopaedias work, and a general requirement of an empirical outlook. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 12:52, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I am thoroughly familiar with the policies I mentioned. My argument about crystal ball statements and original research hinges upon the fact that Tiger woods, according to the article's sources, has a disputed net worth of about a half-billion dollars or less. The article does not simply say "Tiger is rich", but rather "Tiger woods is likely to become a billionaire", and extrapolating on the given data without citing a source that claims he is likely to become a billionaire is a prediction and original research. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 21:58, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That said, there's not much point in debating about it now. The article is still around, and, like all articles, should cite its sources and not offer up original claims. Fortunately, it's pretty good about that right now, but could always become better. I've decided to devote some time to improving the article since, after four AfD nominations, it seems to be around for good. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 22:01, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In other words you hadn't even read the article before advocating its deletion. Please discuss major changes on the talk page, since many of the regulars don't have time to track a rapid fire series of edits.

<p>The only way we can keep this thing somewhat NOPV is by providing Forbes' definition of black, not yours or anyone else's. There will never be an agreement here as to who black is or not, especially with some editors making pronouncements such as "He's Blasian" and "many feel Chinese is the genetic opposite of black". Furthermore, refrain from rumormongering, and leave your own assumptions and conclusions out of the article. This is an encyclopedia not a soapbox. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 21:03, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why did you feel the defintion of black in the article was racist? Everyone agrees that modern humans started in Africa so what's wrong with defining blacks as those with a majority of ancestors that stayed in Africa during the original out of Africa exodus? That's how scientists define it. To me the one drop rule is racist, and also virtually everyone on Earth has at least one drop of black blood. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 23:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article you cite does not define "black", it deals with the subject of human migration out of Africa, and in any case, Oppenheimer's theory, as plainly noted on the linked page, does not reflect general scientific consensus – and actually deals more with the origin of Europeans than what is relevant here. So if you are going to use it in an encyclopedia, you should make it clear that it is not a generally held view. But I beg your pardon for calling the definition racist, I should have called it flawed. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 00:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems good enough for our purpose which is defining black. Yes scientists may disagree on some of the fine points, but there's a basic consensus that modern humans started in Africa, and those that left Africa went on to form the non-black races. Do you honestly disagree with that? Now if later on another study finds it wasn't just one migration but two, or that it wasn't 70,000 years ago but 60,000 years ago, we can always update the definition, but it's more important to define black in a precise and scientific way, just as billionaire has a precise and objective definition. I vote we put it back in. If we don't put it back in people will start adding all sorts of nonsense to the page (i.e. so and so has a great great grandmother who is black and thus he's a black billionaire too). Just as the line defining billionaire is clearly drawn, the line defining black should also be clearly drawn as it is by geneticists who say most of your ancestors have to have stayed in sub-Sahran Africa for a certain amount of time for you to genetically qualify as black. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 00:53, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Defining who is, or is not black cannot be done as easily as defining who is a billionaire or not. Your definition categorically disregards from all non-African people who self identify as black, which is extreme POV. It is not within the scope of this article to make sweeping definitions about something that cannnot be agreed upon. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 01:40, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I consider myself to be fairly educated when it comes to race, and this is the first I've ever heard of non-African people calling themselves black. Obviously there are billions of people in the world, and the term black is going to be used in a lot of different ways, but as an encyclopedia I think we need to stick to scientific conceptions of black. Obviously black can be used in all kinds of informal ways, some of them even metaphorical, like when Toni Morrison called Clinton the first black president. But cultural, social, and metaphorical definitions of black should be given much less weight in an encyclopedia than scientific definitions. Even the definition you wanted to use "African ethnicity" acknowledges the importances of African ancestry, the only problem was it was vaguely defined and insufficiently precise. Keep in mind that "billionaire" is also sometimes used informally by people to describe anyone who is super rich, regardless of whether they actually cross the billion dollar mark, but that doesn't mean an encyclopedia has to stoop to that level of inprecision. The definition of black that was being used is very middle of the road (not the extremes of the one drop rule or the opposite extremes of Brazil). Like your definition it emphasized African herritage, the only difference is that it precisely explained what that means (since all people started in Africa) and also precisely drew the line at how much African ancestry is required (since all humans are mixed to some degree). We have a very precise definition of billionaire. It would be nice if we could also have a very precise definition of black. It will certainly save us headaches from later editors if the definition is clear to everyone from the outset. <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobrakid_4196.html" title="User:Kobrakid">Kobrakid</a> 20:01, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am sure you think you are educated. You can however not pick a definition of "black" that suits your "education" and impose it on others. Not in wikipedia.

<p>Don't be ignorant, Superslum. But there *are* more black billionaires than listed here. Obviously, not a WHOLE bunch more, but a few more... keep in mind, to make the Forbes list or any other list, you have to TELL them about your money, and it has to all be in ONE bank... plenty of billionaires put their money in more than one bank, and thus it wouldn't all be counted. Plus, many billionaires also don't want people to KNOW they're billionaires.</p>
<dl>
<dd>To the above anonymous author, lol do you even know how wealth works? You think the billionaires are billionaires because they have a billion dollars in a single bank account? Please don't be ignorant, almost all billionaires are so because they own stakes in corporations, companies etc, and not cash in bank. And Forbes won't be stupid enough to just look at one bank account of a person to determine his wealth, Forbes takes time and effort to investigate and find out all a person's assets to give a best estimate, usually a close one. --<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangysb_81d1.html" title="User:Orangysb">wil osb</a> 10:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, a reversion war isn't needed (or allowed), so let's try to hash out a version of the article that's acceptable to everyone. I'll bring up a few points</p>
<ul>
<li>The article already links to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> so an in depth discussion of what "makes a person black" isn't needed here. A short mention of the irregularities on this issue is sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As long as the discussion on the first Black guy to make Forbes 400 should make clear that he is not considered a billionaire - but a mention at the end should be fine, for historical context and the like - especially in the context of things like inflation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Agreed. This article is about Black billionaires. It is not about the meaning of "black", the question of who is black, or racial theory. We have plenty of seperate articles for that. Keeping articles on the topic stated in the title helps people find what they are looking for, and helps to keep all the articles in top condition. The best way to keep to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and all those other important principles is to stick to the topic at hand, which is the phenomenom of black billionaires.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 02:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think its fine as it stand save for that last sentence of Black-Asian Billionaire. That's editorializing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is in fact fine if we can attribute it to Black Enterprise magasine (or whomever). As I read things, that's where this opinion comes from - it would be better if we directly attribute it to someone. But since there is a dispute about whether he's black, it's not for use to decide, per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 11:27, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>After reading Wily's comments and re-reading the whole article, it might be best to move Michael Lee-Chin into the billionaires list and out of his own section. After all, if Forbes and Black Enterprise consider him black, who are we to say otherwise? I think we're probably committing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 14:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Is this true? I can't find it, but I was under the impression that Forbes did *not* count hiw as black, and that's where the origin of the whole issue is. Am I mistaken? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:36, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

Lee-Chin only cracked the billion mark in 2001, so maybe he did so after Robert Johnson. I don't know. But yes, it does look like CBS was disputing -- or ignoring -- Lee-Chin, either b/c he's not American or because he's only half-black.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 16:35, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>CBS was not the only one to report the same statistics. USA today had an almost identical story. Both get their data from Forbes, unless you're suggesting that CBS themselves went through the hundreds of billionaires on the list themselves to decide who was Black. Also, in Forbes profile on Bob Johnson they categorically describe him as the first black billionaire even though both Bob Johnson and Michael Lee-Chin appeared on Forbes billionaire list for the first time in 2001. And Forbes only creates its international billionaire list once a year and based on market value on a specific day of the year (in January?), so as far as Forbes is concerned both Michael Lee-Chin and Bob Johnson became billionaires at the same time, yet only Bob Johnson was described as the first black billionaire. This is probably because people of mixed race parents are assigned the race of the non-Caucasian parent, but when both parents are non-Caucasian (i.e. Michael Lee-Chin, Tiger Woods) they are just described as bi-racial....72.1.195.5 23:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's interesting to point out that not only is Lee-Chin only half Jamaican (who are mostly black) but that his other half is the exact opposite of black. Someone posted a genetic chart showing that North East Asians are the opposite of Black, so overall he may be less black than most white billionaires (who are neither Black nor the opposite of Black).

<li>Agreed. I'll add a fourth thing: those edits kept on insisting that NE Asia (which in this context means China, not Siberia) is the coldest and last-colonized place on earth. That's simply not true. The entire Western Hemisphere was colonized after NE Asia, and huge swathes of Europe, Siberia, Canada, Alaska, and Patagonia are much colder than China.

<dd>I think you're confusing the climate today with the climate of ancient times. The North East Asian race had more exposure to the ice ages than any other race, and that's one of the reasons they have their unique features. And genetic evidence suggests they and their cousins (the Native Americans) are the youngest human race, and they split off from the parent population of Caucasians and Caucasians split off from their parent population which are Africans. Thus while Europeans are once removed from Africans (Africans are their parents), North East Asians are twice removed from Africans (Africans are their grand-parents). That means that Blasians are who are a mix of Africans and those twice removed from Africans are on average only once removed from Africans (just like white people). For this reason, on the genetic level, Blasians are genetically no closer to Black people than white people are, so if you're going to call Michael Lee-Chin a black billionaire, then Bill Gates is one too. Are you guys following what I'm trying to say?...72.1.195.5 23:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

The discussion is about whether Lee-Chin is black, and you say it's not germaine to report cutting edge research showing half his ancestors are the most genetically removed from Blacks. It's actually the single most encyclopedic thing in the entire article and it's extremely POV to try to to censor something so relevant to the discussion. It's withholding of information, and it's insulting to Robert Johnson's legacy to give the impression that Lee-Chin could be black (based on some obscure magazine) while withholding much more authoritative data.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 17:04, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know you guys are both great editors, but on this one issue I feel you are not well informed. Cavalli-Sforza's book is over 1000 pages and contains mountains of data showing the genetic distance between different population groups. It's not mentioned in his article because people feel so threatened by the link between genes and race that the second anyone adds it massive editing wars break out. But by withholding the genetic data while citing other sources calling Lee-Chin black, you are not being balanced, and you are leading people to conclude that perhaps Bob Johnson was not the only confirmed billionaire black man in history after all. This is extremely unfair and extremely dishonest when modern genetic data confirms that Lee-Chin is no more Black than Europeans are. If you literally take the mid-point of the genetic distance between Blacks and North East Asians (i.e. Blasians), it's about the same as the genetic distance between Blacks and Europeans, which means that Blasians are no closer to Black than Europeans are. Hence it's EXTREMELY misleading and dishonest to give the impression that Lee-Chin could be black. I'm not trying to go into graphic detail about this topic in the article. I just want it briefly mentioned in the interest of full disclosure. It looks like we might have found a compromise--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 17:32, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, look, here are the important points:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>This may all well be good research, but this simply isn't the place for it. Take it to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">Black people</a> or whatever - the article on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> does not go into a long speil about what is or isn't a country, and the history of countries - it merely wikilinks to an appropriate place for the discussion. That he's multiracial and that this causes some to discount him as black is all that's really appropriate here. We really have no business rehashing the whole argument here.</li>
<li>Even if it turns out that East Asians are farthest from blacks, with whites closer to each, crossing the first two doesn't necessarily equate to the third option, that's original research (that would, for example, be rejected by the adherents of the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-drop_theory.html" title="One-drop theory">one-drop theory</a>, I imagine.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>There are likely more, but these are the most pressing two <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 17:40, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it's outrageous to claim that this is not the right place for the research. This is the only article that discusses a dispute about whether a Blasian is Black, so there is no more relevant a place to discuss this. And I'm not trying to rehash the whole argument. I just want it briefly mentioned. You scaled my edits down and in the interest of compromise I accept that because at least you're letting it be mentioned. And I'm not even trying to reinsert the section about him being genetically no closer to Black than a European is (you don't want that in the article I understand) but it's a mathematical reality that if Europeans are 1 genetic step from Blacks, and North East Asians are 2 genetic steps from Blacks, and Blacks are 0 genetic steps from Blacks (since they are Black) then Blaisians who are an average of Blacks and North East Asians would equate to Europeans in terms of genetic distance from Blacks. But again I'm happy with your recent edit, and have no intention of pushing this any further as long as we can keep it as you left it.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 17:59, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So what are you guys saying, if you're half-Black and half-Asian, you therefore cancel yourself racially? Kinda like matter and anti-matter? This is the stupidest discussion ever. If you're blasian, half of your ancestors came from Africa, half from Asia, therefore you possess both African and Asian genes, therefore you are both. How hard is that to understand?</p>

<p>According to an article published in The Economist, the work of Cavalli-Sforza "challenges the assumption that there are significant genetic differences between human races, and indeed, the idea that 'race' has any useful biological meaning at all."</p>
<p>Has Whatdoyou even bothered to check that little fact? He mentions the work of Cavalli-Sforza as though it’s monumental in pointing out the differences between races, which incidentally has been the excuse for all kinds of human tragedy. That statement really doesn't belong there because its Whatdoyou's opinion -- which is not even a real interpretation of what Cavalli-Sforza thought of his own work.</p>
<p>Pointing out so called genetic differences has lead to sentiments of race superiority which in turn historically has led to: 1. Nazis killing Jews; 2. Slavery of African Americans, poor whites, and even Chinese in South America; 3. Japanese killing Chinese and Koreans; 4. The Rwandan massacre; 5. Modern day racism and oppression of minorities in America; 6. Arabs/Muslims versus Jews and Western Society</p>
<p>And the list goes on and on...that would be some of the points behind NOT putting in this piece of information into this article.</p>
<p>Finally, let's add the fact that there are no really and truly "black" people in the America's. Not many people may have seen it, but Henry Louis Gates recently had a special (DNA heritage among blacks) in which he showed that the majority of Mae Jemison's (first "black" female astronaut) genes were ASIAN. However when one looks at Mae Jemison is that what you see before you? I'm sure many people (including Mae Jemison) would say no. Therefore being black has way more to do with how you self identify rather than so called genetics.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We have to be balanced and show all sides. Tiger Woods does not sel-identify as Black because of his Asian ancestry. And some who self-identify as Black are not percieved that way by others. That's why it's important to look at race from a genetic perspective. If a Blasian were to tell a doctor that he was Black and get medical treatemnet based on Black genetics he would die, so medical text books talk about how important it is to make sure people know what race they are and to look past self-identification and appearance.....72.1.195.5 22:19, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of you on here: Let's look at all the components of a person! Especially if he or she is "black"! They must have some other genes that account for their achievement. All or most so called African Americans or Africans in the Americas have other genes the majority Caucasian genes. So let's follow your ignorant argument that Asians and Caucasians are closest on the tree. That would mean by proxy, as a result of slavery most African American (who have been removed from African for damn near three centuries!) are the FURTHEST thing from African possible, and closer to Asians that you think. That is what makes that chart UNAPPLICABLE!</p>

It does not take into account the mixtures that have happened as a result of chattel slavery and generations of Afro-European mixtures.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're not making any sense. African-Americans are on average 83% African and 17% Caucasian. They are Black because Black is the single largest chunk of their gene pool. No person on Earth is 100% pure so race is defined by the single largest chunck of ones ancestry. It's been pointed out that Michael Lee-Chin is 45% Black, 5% white and 50% Chinese so he's not predominantly Black, and any doctor that gave him medical treatment intented for Blacks would be fired especially since the Chinese gene-pool is the opposite of the Black gene-pool.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 17:55, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Whatyoudo, you're still trying to make the point that whites are somehow "more black" than orientals. This is a pretty controversial claim, one I (frankly) don't see the logic in. Blue light is closer to X-Ray light than Red light is, but a beam of light that's 50% red light and 50% X-Ray light is just as "X-Ray-y" as a beam of light that's 50% blue light and 50% X-Ray light, as both blue and red light are "0% X-Ray-y".</li>

<dd>Willy D it would be like having an article about tall billionaires and including someone as a tall billionaire because half their ancestors are tall, and then withholding from the reader the fact that the other half oth their ancestors are short so it cancels out. That's both misleading and dishonest. Just give the reader all the imfo and let them decide if he's black or part black or multi-racial. We shouldn't censor information, especially first-rate science.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 22:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Alright, here's the point we're making. If we say <i>Half his ancestors were tall, half were short</i>, that's appropriate, just as we now say <i>Half his ancestors are black, half are oriental</i>. It's the attempts to say <i>So it cancels out</i> that everyone is objecting too (or at least, it's the part I find objectionable). That much fails both <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> in terms of elidgibility for inclusion.

<dd>Yes but what some others here are trying to do is say half his ancestors are tall, and the other half comes from this part of the world (without allowing it to be mentioned that that part of the world is short, and thus dishonestly giving the impression that the billionaire is more tall than not). The reason this bothers me is that by withholding the fact that North East Asians are genetically the most distant from Blacks, we're allowing people to believe that Michael Lee-Chin could be Black, when in reality Blasians do no better with Black organ transplants than white people do, and indeed are hardly any more Black than Europeans are at the genetic and biomedical level. The reason this bothers me is because Bob Johnson has earned his place as the first and only Billionaire Black man in the history of capitalism, and people are challenging his title by giving the unscientific impression that Michael Lee-Chin could be Black too. I like the idea of keeping this article nice and precise and mathematically objective. Forbes defines you as a billionaire if you have a net-worth equivalent to at least $1 billion in U.S. dollars (the most universal currency) and not one penny less. Similarly in biology, your Black if your number of ancestors that stayed in Sub-Saharan Africa during the homo S. Sapians original out of Africa migration(s) reaches MAJORITY, and not a single ancestor less. Unfortuantely however we will get all these wishywashy editors who will argue that even though person X's ancestry is less than majority Black, person X is Black because he gets treated like a black man when he tries to catch a taxi. Next we'll have people arguing, even though person X is only worth $600 million, he's a billionaire because he lives the life of a billionaire, socially identifies as a billionaire, and gets treated like a billionaire when he shops at fancy stores.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, but this is just an opinion about what makes someone black - and we don't get to make decisions about what does (or doesn't) make someone black. Plenty of people would disagree. IFF some reputable source starts calling everyone with 500+ million a billionaire, well then it'll be tough shit for us, they'll be included. Similiarly <i>if</i> some reputable source identifies someone as black, we can't decide they're wrong - we can only say something like, <i>others disagree</i>. We can't even try to sneakily make the argument that they're wrong, that still fails policies like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It's fairly obvious that in standard english usage you can be "black" whilst having a minority of black ancestors - you may <i>wish</i> this wasn't true, but Wikipedia is not a soapbox - it's an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It really depends on the time, place, and individual. During the days of the one drop rule, someone who was 1/32th Black was considered Black, but in much of Latin America and Africa, terms like <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulatto.html" title="Mulatto">mulatto</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadroon.html" title="Quadroon">quadroon</a> frequently differentiate those who are part Black from those who are mostly Black. Even within the United States there are a lot of people who are half Black who are not identified as Black. Generally people who are half-white and half something else are defined by their non-white ancestry and that's probably because a lot of white racial traits are genetically recessive and so white ancestry is less visible in mixed race phenotypes. But when 2 non-white races mate, the offspring is more balanced-in someone like Michael Lee-Chin you can really see the Chinese, especially in the first photo, which is probably why it was replaced. Because I understand that different people draw the line in different ways, I redesigned the chart to accomodate those who take a <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_drop_rule.html" title="One drop rule">one drop rule</a> perspective vs. those who define Blacks the way every other race is defined (by preponderance of ancestry). My main point is that the truth about Michael Lee-Chin's ancestry should not be censored. Yes it's POV to say that his North East Asian ancestry cancels out his Black ancestry, but it's important for people who consider mullatoes Black to understand that <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasians.html" title="Blasians">Blasians</a> are genetically much further removed from Blacks than <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulattoes.html" title="Mulattoes">mulattoes</a> are.

<dd>But we're not censoring information about his ancestory - we're moving the parts that aren't about <i>him</i>, but about blacks in general, to a far more appropriate article <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> or something of that ilk. Would you call him black if he was half-white half-black, but not half-chinese, half-black? This seems unlikely (but not impossible, after all under the one drop rule, you can still have a bunch of indian ancestory and be white) - so that's not really on topic here. To not say anything about what his ancestory is would also be inappropriate, but we're delving deep into here for reasons that can't really be justified - there are better articles to do that (hence "see also:") <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 22:47, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson, but I think that the section on him right now is potentially libellous, in that it implies that he actually tried to spread the story that he's a billionaire, when as it came out in the media (and the Slate article demonstrates it), he was just the victim of an idiot reporter. Since everyone's freaking out about any changes to the article, I'm posting this to give 24 hrs notice before I try to rewrite the section again. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 15:45, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Perhaps, though if reliable third party sources are documenting it, then they may be ... in any event, a major news source seems to have taken Jackson seriously enough to investigate it - it's thus reasonable to address the issue - there's no reason to take the Slate article's view that Jackson didn't mean <i>Over a billion</i> any more seriously than 20/20 view that he did. I myself speak neither American nor British English and I would certainly say that Jackson sounds like he's claiming to be a billionaire.

<p>I saw the AfD for this article and decided to give it a look. I made the following comment in the AfD discussion -- a response suggested a <b>Move</b> might be in order and that discussion might be more appropriate for this Talk page. So here's my original comment: <i>If this article were only about billionaires who happen to be black (however you want to define that), it would be fine although the article title should be plural. However, most of the article is about other things: poverty rates, women, racism, rumors, claims, businesses, and people who aren't even on the list yet -- a list which currently has only one person on it. This effort would be better directed as something like Economic Advancement of Black People. Calling it "Billionaires" is too limiting for what the article is trying to achieve.</i> <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalJor_7a59.html" title="User:HalJor">HalJor</a> 20:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't care much for the title, either. But the article is not really about poverty, women, or racism, at all, even though it <i>refers</i> to those subjects. It's more aptly titled "the richest known black people", but that doesn't sound very good, either. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">M</a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMareino_a751.html" title="User talk:Mareino"><font color="orange">@</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">r</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mareino_35ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mareino"><font color="orange">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMareino_45cd.html" title="User:Mareino">ino</a> 20:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That seems to be a far more general topic than what the article is - it really only addresses the issue of black billionaires (of which the current number isn't really important - Wikipedia is more like a history text than a newspaper), and/or richest black people. Of course there's a strong theme of the economic position of black people, which is fairly relevent to the subject. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the title of the article is perfect. The words Black and Billionaire sound good together (both have that B and L sound) and virtually everything in the article relates to Black billionaires or people who may one day become black billionaires. Yes some people discussed in the article are not fully billionaires (P Diddy) and some are not fully Black (Michael Lee-Chin) but the general theme is Black billionaires. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/o/t/User%7EGottoupload_77d5.html" title="User:Gottoupload">Gottoupload</a> (<a href="../../../g/o/t/User_talk%7EGottoupload_ef0e.html" title="User talk:Gottoupload">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gottoupload_7411.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gottoupload">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>First, the "sound" of a title is hardly an adequate criterion for its justification. Second, <b>anyone</b> "may one day" become a billionaire -- it's just a lot easier for those who have a head start (and those people are merely "currently wealthy"). And finally, please sign your comments. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalJor_7a59.html" title="User:HalJor">HalJor</a> 00:15, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think we should change the title since virtually everyone discussed in the article is either a Black billionaire or resembles one (i.e. South Africa's first half-billionaire Black, Michael Lee-Chin is a half-black billionaire, Tiger Woods is a quarter-Black Quarter-Billionaire, Bob Johnson is a former Black Billionaire, Michael Jackson's a self-proclaimed Black billionaire). So Black Billionaire must stay in the title but if it really bothers people we could change the title to "Black Billionaires &amp; centi-millionaires" or go even broader and call it "Black billionaires &amp; millionaires"--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 16:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I really am not sure what the point of this page is - I looked at the AFD debate and I couldn't make up my mind how to vote. But there are a few things to bear in mind
<ul>
<li>Race is based on self-identification. Calling Lee-Chin "half black" doesn't make any sense <i>unless</i> that is how he considers himself. Most African Americans have substantial non-African ancestry, but "quadroon" and "octaroon" are terms that hearken back to the early days of slavery. Classifying people in ways they haven't classified themselves isn't acceptable.</li>
<li>"Black" means different things in different places. It isn't a precise term. Be aware of that.</li>
<li>"Billionaire" is a very US-centric expression - $1,000,000,000 isn't a billion is Britain, and <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaican_dollar.html" title="Jamaican dollar">J$</a>1,000,000,000 is very different from <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>1,000,000,000. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 20:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most African-Americans have about 17% not-African ancestry. Michael Lee-Chin seems to have about 55%. It's equally offensive to describe him as Black because then we're promoting the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_drop_rule.html" title="One drop rule">one drop rule</a> which is based upon the assumption that a drop of Black blood contaminates. The article simply reports the number of Billionaires who have predominantly African ancestry, any known African ancestry, and the total number of billionaires.</p>

<dd>We're not promoting the one drop rule - Chin's ancestory is clearly explained, and then readers are invited to decide whether he's black, partially black, white, or whatever else, based on their personal racial classification system. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:49, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL! No one's 100% African, not even people who live in the most isolated parts of Africa. People from the Caribean are 90% Black 10% White. Half Lee-Chin's ancestors are from the Caribean so to the best of our knowledge he's 45% Black, 55% non-African.
<dl>
<dd>Jamaica is described as being 90% black, not <i>Jamaicans</i>. As for calling him black being insulting - that's your opinion, to which you are entitled, but blood quantum is meaningless. Most African Americans are a lot whiter than most Black Jamaicans (as opposed to mixed Jamaicans - after all, Bob Marley was rejected as a white man early in his career). Regardless, it isn't up to us to decide what constitutes "black enough". Lee-Chin has been described as a black businessman (I have not, on the other hand, heard him described as Chinese, though I'm sure he'd have been called "Chinee" in Jamaica).</dd>
<dd>If you really are insulted by mixed people being passed off as black, there are <i>a lot</i> of African Americans who are a lot less black than Lee-Chin - like Bob Marley.

<dd>No there've been genetic tests on Black Jamaicans and they have 10% European DNA admixture, probably infused into the gene pool during slavery. Also, as we've argued about before, Blasians have a genetic profile very similar to pure whites who are actually 65% East Asian and 35% African on the genetic level because East Asians split off from Europeans who split off from Africans. So a mulatto is more Black than a Blasian. A Blasian is about as Black as a quadroon, and quadroons are not usually considered Black.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 14:56, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Additional reasons why the race of Blasians is ambiguous is because <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypodescent.html" title="Hypodescent">hypodescent</a> was used to assign people to the the race of their non-white parent. Both the parents of Blasians are non-white so hypodescent doesn't work on them. Also a lot of white racial traits are genetically recessive and so white ancestry is hidden in mulattoes causing them to be identified as Black. But Asian racial traits are not genetically recessive so you can actually see the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinoid.html" title="Sinoid">Sinoid</a> features when you look at Blasians.--<a href="../../../w/h/a/User%7EWhatdoyou_3650.html" title="User:Whatdoyou">Whatdoyou</a> 15:13, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yom I already explained to you on the other board that Ethiopians are in between Blacks and Caucasoids, some argue that they're the first Caucasoids, or that Caucasoids are Ethiopoids if you prefer, but for now it doesn't matter since the fact that Forbes (the bible of the financial world) does not list them as billionaires is a reliable source that they are NOT billionaires. Many times people are described as billionaires simply because they own a billion dollar business, and people are incorrectly described as billionaires all the time. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 00:59, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Wait a minute. All over the Black People article, you went on and on about how Black people should be recognized by the classifications of the US Census and what not. Well, they are black Census wise. Another thing you keep overlooking. Being Caucasoid has nothing to do with not being Black. Many Black people in the USA are caucasoid (DNA wise and cranium wise), we are not going to say "you're not black" Shall we go through all the American celebrities whose features are caucasoid or who are of a substantially White/European admixture and say "not black because they are caucasoid"? No. I thought not. We don't want to <b>rob</b> the black race now do we. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphnathpaaneah_6884.html" title="User:Zaphnathpaaneah">Zaphnathpaaneah</a> 07:35, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First the U.S. is unique in that it adhears to the racist one drop rule (countries like Brazil take the opposite perspective). Second, the Caucasoid features in African-Americans comes from race mixing, where the Caucasoid features in Ethiopians may be much more pure (i.e. some speculate they're the first Caucasoids who mutated off of Blacks instead of just a mix of Caucasoids and Blacks). In other words, unless Ethiopians are the product of racial mixing, the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_drop_rule.html" title="One drop rule">one drop rule</a> and <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypodescent.html" title="Hypodescent">hypodescent</a> doesn't apply to them.

<p>Firstly the mention of "negroids" and then the use or the entire sentance worded as it is is inappropriate because it's speaking from an Anthropological perspective, totally uncalled for in this article.

<dd>The word Negroid is used because the reference describing the percent of Blacks worldwide is based on the population of anthropological races so people wont no where the 8% figure is coming from unless we mention the term used in the article.

<p>I had noticed how concerned you were about the recognition of black people in Africa being respected and since it's obvious that this respect is only earned by money, I decided to add a Black African whom surpasses them all. Mobutu Sese Seko. Seeing as how you find it humiliating to recognize black Asians as being truly black, I did you a favor on this article.

<p>Hi Zaph, thanks for your help. I tentatively reverted your edit, only because Forbes was never able to confirm Mobutu's billionaire status, the article you cited claimed he was worth "up to $5 billion" meaning it wasn't for certain, and this article claims he's worth much much less [<a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9706/03/mobutu/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9706/03/mobutu/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEditingoprah_aba6.html" title="User:Editingoprah">Editingoprah</a> 04:56, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You cannot make the argument that someone part black is "black", since techinically that would include everyone since humans evolved from a singular ancestor line. Only thing I can see this wiki working is that all persons in it either have identified **themselves** as being "black" or those who have a verifiable(more or less) greater than 50% admixture of persons of black african ancestory. Aside from that, this needs to be deleted.And this is all completely ignoring the fact that this "list" has a SINGLE black billionaire on it.

<li>This article has survived a bunch of AfDs - concensus is definitely that it doesn't need to be deleted. If you believe either that it does, or that it needs a major overhall, or that an article that documents racist ideas is trash, you don't really get the purpose of Wikipedia.</li>

<li>Who identifies the person as black is not important, as long as we consider them reliable.</li>
<li>Wikipedia endorses one of its three key pillars as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">a neutral point of view</a> - that means that although you might think it's disappointing, we're not here to endorse or condemn racist ideas. Merely to report them, the same as any other idea from reliable sources. <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes.html" title="Forbes">Forbes</a>, for example, is a reliable source.</li>
<li>The article lists at least two black billionaires.

<dd><i>The federal estate tax, which has been in place since 1916, affects only the richest 1.4 percent of the deceased. As the law currently stands, the first $675,000 of net estate value is exempt from tax for individuals ($1.35 million for couples). Because of a 1997 change in the law, this exemption amount will rise steadily until it reaches $1 million for individuals ($2 million for couples) in 2006. Exemptions are even higher for businesses and farms. Since the number of African-Americans who would benefit is infinitesimally small, Bush's goal of eliminating the tax altogether would exacerbate the already growing wealth gap between blacks and whites.</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dd>Ethiopians are not 1/2 caucasian. There is very little Arab blood in Ethiopia according to genetic research, actually. Nazret.com is a newsite first, by the way.

<p>Actually there is 40% Arab blood in Ethiopians according to cited comments made on the other discussion board. The Ethioblog on Nazret.com is NOT a reliable source.

<dd>There isn't, actually. The source is based on outdated autosomal DNA estimations, which cannot find the source of similarities, but only recognizes when two people have similar autosomal DNA mutation patterns. The shared DNA is due to Ethiopians being the direct descendents of the population that first left Africa and populated extra-African territories, not due to back-migrations into Ethiopia. Paternal (Y chromosome) and Maternal (mitochondrial) sex chromosomes are the only way to establish the origins of certain mutations and admixture in populations. These more recent genetic studies have not bore out the old autosomal estimates. Also, it does not accept contributions from readers in that section. There is an <a href="http://nazret.com/blog/index.php?cat=71" class="external text" title="http://nazret.com/blog/index.php?cat=71" rel="nofollow">opinion and commentary section</a> that does, but the other sections are written by Nazret.com authors. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 02:43, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But the cited sources on the other discussion page were based on sex chromosomes and were in agreement with the older autosomal studies. Also I know quite a bit about Ethiopia's history and there was massive interaction with the Arab world. Some Ethiopians look indistinguishable from Arabs. I posted an article on Nazret.com as part of a university project so I know it's not a reliable source. <a href="../../../v/e/x/User%7EVexperiential_66ac.html" title="User:Vexperiential">Vexperiential</a></dd>

<dd>In addition wikipedia clearly outlaws blogs as sources: <b>Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.</b> Blogs are not allowed as regular sources on regular topics so it's absurd to use it as a source for a living person discussion (which must meet higher standards of reliability) especially on a subject as controversial as race. <a href="../../../v/e/x/User%7EVexperiential_66ac.html" title="User:Vexperiential">Vexperiential</a></dd>

<p>and what about CNN? read what you wrote. Anyone, but not anyone can run for control of CNN, only a few own the book houses, the same people that work Africans out of history, not anyone can work for BBC only white people or their puppets, not anyone can disucss slavery except a collection of white people because they have oppertunity and privallage. What about Harverd and Yale Uni, expert what? expert racist. J.D. Fage and Mr Gates what is the difference? So which one is it, anybody or the expert racist? people tried this same madness with the sites i cite <a href="http://www.africanholocaust.net" class="external text" title="http://www.africanholocaust.net" rel="nofollow">www.africanholocaust.net</a> and <a href="http://www.ricenpeas.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ricenpeas.com" rel="nofollow">Rice N Peas</a>, you see if Black people write something the above is true, "anybody can", when white write something it is expert. Racism. Now what makes me laugh is the Wiki quote the Cnn and the CNN quote the likes of Wiki, its a white mans world, Most Ethiopians dont have nice websites to discuss their issues like Arabs and Europeans have so they inherit a disadvantage. then they say the few sites we have are not credible, extream sources etc. its like Malcolm said the fox and the wolf, the rabbit doesnt have a chance.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 03:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia clearly states that blogs are not credible and I think that's wise policy. Blogs are not held to high editorial standards and when dealing with issues as controversial as the race of a living person, we must never be reckless. It may be true that Ethiopians have less access to the global media, but compromising wikipedia's standards (which are already low enough) just creates new problems <a href="../../../v/e/x/User%7EVexperiential_66ac.html" title="User:Vexperiential">Vexperiential</a></dd>

<p>The issues of a few editors have no weight in determining encyclopedic content. The section <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> is the source of the def in this article. thus we cannot invent new terms and definition just because of issues and confusion. Google search shows no concept of part black and hence it is not a valid term in the way it is being used. The correct term would be of African ancestry, Vesperiential has been blocked for his/her inablity to discuss before reverting, lets home this pattern has changed. part-black isnt a valid term, there is no article in wikipedia for a part-black race, it also contradicts the def on black people which it references. if you add it the quality of this article wil get a OR tag and may be deleted, as a editorial construction with no encyclopedic value.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">HalaTruth(ሐላቃህ)</a> 19:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you ever taken a DNA test? I have. sub-Saharan is the term they use when describing black ancestry and they can tell the exact percentage of sub-Saharan ancestry you have. A lot of the black people you think have always lived in North Africa would show up as sub-Saharan on a DNA test. As for the Egyptian who is suing the U.S. government to prove he is black, I read they want a DNA test to show he's of sub-Saharan descent and is not a typical Egyptian <a href="../../../v/e/x/User%7EVexperiential_66ac.html" title="User:Vexperiential">Vexperiential</a></dd>

You have one large POV, raw opinion, how do you know when "black" people got to Algeria?

<dd>You appear to be pushing some sort of Afrocentric agenda. I'm just going by mainstream science.
