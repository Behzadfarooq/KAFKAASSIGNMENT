<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Books_cf3d.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The series revolves around Bernard's misanthropic loathing of the outside world in general and the people who live there in particular, represented mainly by his customers. Bernard displays little enthusiasm for or interest in retail (or, indeed, anything outside drinking, smoking and reading) and refuses to interact with the outside world. Many episodes revolve around Manny and Fran's attempts to force him to do just that, however—as they themselves are remarkably ill-equipped to interact with the world outside the shop—their efforts usually result in chaos, sucking them back into Bernard's <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilistic.html" title="Nihilistic">nihilistic</a> view of everything and everyone.</p>
<p>The series is notable for its surreal and off-beat sense of humour, particularly when regarding the state of the shop; it is frequently depicted to be in an unhealthy state of dirtiness, with sea-water <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mollusc.html" title="Mollusc">molluscs</a> living on the water pipes and, when it is in a particularly bad state, dead <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger.html" title="Badger">badgers</a> blocking the way. The series also uses a great deal of surreal wordplay.</p>

<ol>
<li><b><a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooking_the_books_%28Black_Books_episode%29_d0be.html" title="Cooking the books (Black Books episode)">Cooking the Books</a></b> - After his accountant flees the police, Bernard is faced with the daunting prospect of doing his own <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">taxes</a>, and resorts to pairing his socks, getting drunk with <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> and trying to seriously injure himself since it will allow him to defer his tax return. Manny, an <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accountant.html" title="Accountant">accountant</a>, enters Black Books for the first time in order to buy the Little Book of Calm on his way to work and, against all odds, manages to swallow it. Fran is bedevilled by a weird, unfathomable sphere that isn't actually 'a bald <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furby.html" title="Furby">furby</a>'. Chaos, naturally, ensues. (Guest stars <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Freeman_bf52.html" title="Martin Freeman">Martin Freeman</a> as Manny's doctor and <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Vansittart_d403.html" title="Rupert Vansittart">Rupert Vansittart</a> as the tasteful customer.)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manny%27s_First_Day_21b9.html" title="Manny's First Day">Manny's First Day</a></b> - Bernard wakes up from a night on the booze to discover he's accidentally given Manny a job, and spends the day trying to get rid of him. Manny assists in this by proving to be a charming, sociable and extremely competent employee, apparently unaware that it's 'not that kind of operation'. An offering of wine from Manny and the threat of physical violence from Fran, however, persuade Bernard to keep Manny on board. (Guest stars <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cann_1ea9.html" title="David Cann">David Cann</a> as the roaring customer and co-writer <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Linehan_fb42.html" title="Graham Linehan">Graham Linehan</a>, as the "I Love Books" customer.)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapes_of_Wrath_%28Black_Books_episode%29_1013.html" title="Grapes of Wrath (Black Books episode)">The Grapes of Wrath</a></b> - When the sheer filth of the bookshop becomes too much to handle, Manny calls a creepy cleaner and Bernard reluctantly agrees to housesit a friend's house. Unfortunately, the two manage to drink a very expensive bottle of wine that was due to be presented to the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, and have to figure out a way of either replacing it before he gets home or think of a present better than a box of pencils to compensate for it. Fran, meanwhile, goes on a date with a very nice man which is, unfortunately, nothing short of disastrous. (Guest stars <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Eldon_c1b4.html" title="Kevin Eldon">Kevin Eldon</a> as the Cleaner.)</li>
<li><b>The Blackout</b> - On his birthday, Manny stays up all night watching <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sweeney_42a5.html" title="The Sweeney">The Sweeney</a></i> and drinking <a href="../../../e/s/p/Espresso.html" title="Espresso">espresso</a>. Thinking he's a seventies cop, he manages to go from eyeing old men suspiciously in the bookshop to being trapped at the local police station helping a <i>real</i> detective put the 'good cop, bad cop' routine on a local villain. Bernard explains how going to a party eventually led to a broken arm while Fran describes the steps from seeing her boyfriend having dinner with another woman to being in hospital with a neck injury. (Guest stars Colin McFarlane as the detective.)</li>
<li><b>The Big Lock-Out</b> - After being burgled, Black Books gets a new alarm and security door fitted but Manny fails to listen to the unlock code, distracted by a little <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subbuteo.html" title="Subbuteo">Subbuteo</a> player in the installer's hair ("there was a little man ... in his hair"). This quickly results in Manny being trapped alone inside with only a quickly-emptied bottle of <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absinthe.html" title="Absinthe">Absinthe</a> and dead <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee.html" title="Bee">bees</a> for company and Bernard locked outside with just enough money for <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popcorn.html" title="Popcorn">popcorn</a> and a <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_theatre.html" title="Movie theatre">cinema</a> ticket. Fran, meanwhile, has taken the phone off the hook to listen to silky-voiced Howell Granger read the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipping_forecast.html" title="Shipping forecast">shipping forecast</a> on the radio, leaving Bernard to wander the streets of London penniless, cold and wet, with only an adult video shop and the allure of fast-food employment between him and freezing. (Guest stars <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Frost_a92e.html" title="Nick Frost">Nick Frost</a> as the alarm installer, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Serafinowicz_88fe.html" title="Peter Serafinowicz">Peter Serafinowicz</a> as Howell Granger, writer <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_Linehan_fb42.html" title="Graham Linehan">Graham Linehan</a> as a fast food customer and Tony Way as the fast food chain and cinema employee.)</li>
<li><b>He's Leaving Home</b> - Bernard finally breaks the last straw (well, technically the last yo-yo string) with his constant bullying, and Manny decides to leave home, but doesn't even manage to let Bernard know about this without being attacked by a bee in a telephone box and finding himself on the streets. He is soon picked up by a photographer with a beard fetish and treated to a glamourous life of expensive clothes, silk sheets and crinkle-cut crisps in silver bowls, but such high living comes at a high price. (Guest starring <a href="../../../o/m/i/Omid_Djalili_a90b.html" title="Omid Djalili">Omid Djalili</a> as Trebor the photographer.

<li><b>The Entertainer</b> - Fran decides to learn the piano and enlists the services of an elderly blind foreign tutor. His harsh methods and her inability to master it after five minutes inclines her to quit in short order. Manny discovers he can play the piano purely on instinct, and against all odds Bernard gets a date with an attractive woman. As a result, Fran and Bernard bribe Manny to hide inside the piano, armed with only spoons, in an attempt to make themselves look good.</li>
<li><b>Fever</b> - A heat wave sweeps London, causing Bernard to obsess about beautiful girls and to seek a "Summer Girlfriend", Fran to suffer from insomnia and Manny to panic about his 'Dave's Syndrome', a curious condition that purportedly triggers at 88ºF (31ºC). Naturally, Bernard refuses to believe a word of Manny's "attention seeking nonsense" and tries to get Manny as hot as possible. Fran discovers the walls of her flat are literally closing in as her unscrupulous landlord creates another flat from the stolen space. Bernard pretends to be her lawyer in an attempt to rectify the situation but quickly falls for the new lodger, Summer Girl Alice. And Manny's condition triggers, with disastrous consequences. (Guest starring <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Vegas_64c9.html" title="Johnny Vegas">Johnny Vegas</a> as Fran's landlord and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Keegan_b0e6.html" title="Rose Keegan">Rose Keegan</a> as Fran's neighbour.)</li>
<li><b>The Fixer</b> - Fran is in desperate need of a job, so Manny calls an old friend, Gus—a rather diminutive underworld figure—who agrees to get her a job working for a guy named Nugent in exchange for the bookstore hosting a reading of his nephew Danny's new book. Alas, Fran hasn't a clue what she is supposed to be doing at her new job and Danny is a hulking great <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illiterate.html" title="Illiterate">illiterate</a> whose <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostwriter.html" title="Ghostwriter">ghostwritten</a> autobiography describes the pain he's inflicted on many others in great detail and which he will happily inflict on Bernard and Manny if they can't teach him to read within two days. Fran gets promoted. Bernard worries about his thumbs. (Guest stars <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Grover_c1e4.html" title="Ricky Grover">Ricky Grover</a> as Danny, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Brydon_9588.html" title="Rob Brydon">Rob Brydon</a> as B. Nugent and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Mick_%28actor%29_b76a.html" title="Big Mick (actor)">Big Mick</a> as Gus)</li>
<li><b>Blood</b> - Fran delves into <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy.html" title="Genealogy">genealogy</a> to uncover her Eastern European roots and, in getting to know her newly discovered family, soon wants to get rid of them. Meanwhile Manny and Bernard try to re-invent the shop, firstly as a trendy upmarket café-bookshop (with sofas that swallow you) and then, apocalyptically, as an upscale restaurant. (Guest starring <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Donovan_c094.html" title="Mark Donovan">Mark Donovan</a> as Cousin Gregor.)</li>
<li><b>Hello Sun</b> - Fran takes up <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yoga.html" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> with an old friend (<a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Stevenson_908a.html" title="Jessica Stevenson">Jessica Stevenson</a>), and whilst very good at piously lecturing everyone at how much better she feels, isn't actually that good at controlling her own urges. Bernard, meanwhile, discovers a copy of the complete works of <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud</a> and begins tormenting Manny by diagnosing his various <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurosis.html" title="Neurosis">neuroses</a> - but is unpleasantly surprised when this leads to Manny unexpectedly gaining the confidence to finally stand up to him.</li>
<li><b>A Nice Change</b> - When around-the-clock building commences next door, Bernard, Manny and Fran decide to go on holiday. Manny wants adventure, Fran wants relaxation, and Bernard just wants somewhere exactly like the bookshop. Packed and ready to go, a lapse in Manny's memory means that they are forced to buy cheap tickets, which means that they're about to see a lot of international <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airports</a>.</li>

<ol>
<li><b>Manny Come Home</b> - Fran comes home after a holiday in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> to find that following the introduction of Manny's hand to a <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandwich_toaster.html" title="Sandwich toaster">sandwich toaster</a>, Bernard is living amongst mouldy books and dead <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger.html" title="Badger">badgers</a>, and Manny is working next door at the extremely glossy Goliath Books, where he is decidedly out of place amongst creepy manager Evan and his army of hyper-efficient pastel-shirted followers. Armed with only a "doo-ti-to-doo" card (a card that elicits said sound when inserted into the corresponding slot on a computer) and an endless supply of muffins, Manny manages to resist Fran's rather self-serving attempts to drag him back to Bernard so that she has somewhere to hang out. Bernard's physical condition deteriorates rapidly without Manny's care, but Manny is soon questioning his choice of career as Evan demands an unthinkable sacrifice.

<li><b>Elephants and Hens</b> - Fran leaves for the weekend to go to her friend Becky's <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hen_party.html" title="Hen party">hen party</a> while Bernard and Manny, inspired by their latest children's books event, decide to write and illustrate a book for children. Bernard's first effort comes to over 1,000 pages, covers <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a>, a lens grinder, a broken marriage and a journalist in search of the truth and is possibly a little complex for kids. The subsequent masterpiece <i>The Elephant and the Balloon</i> could however lead them to international fame - and all the problems that come with it. Fran's hen party, meanwhile, is as disastrous as can be expected, thanks to a combination of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bananarama.html" title="Bananarama">Bananarama</a>, a game of truth and bottles of alcohol possessing "a polar bear... bleeding on the label". (Guest starring <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_Davis_84b2.html" title="Lucy Davis">Lucy Davis</a> as Becky)</li>
<li><b>Moo-Ma and Moo-Pa</b> - Manny's extremely irritating parents, 'Moo-Ma' and 'Moo-Pa', unexpectedly drop by to stay after Bernard deletes Manny's answerphone messages. Bernard is immediately infuriated by their mere existence, not to mention their very annoying quirks and songs, but his patience - and Fran's nerves - are about to be tested when it's revealed that Manny's letters home have greatly embellished his actual accomplishments in life. (Guest starring <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annette_Crosbie_93d1.html" title="Annette Crosbie">Annette Crosbie</a> as Moo-Ma, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Kelly_5170.html" title="Sam Kelly">Sam Kelly</a> as Moo-Pa and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Frost_a92e.html" title="Nick Frost">Nick Frost</a> as Paul)</li>
<li><b>A Little Flutter</b> - After a small win on the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_National_28a5.html" title="Grand National">Grand National</a> Bernard quickly gets addicted to gambling, leaving Fran and Manny in a bitter competition to sell as many books as possible. Soon horses aren't enough and Bernard finds himself taking part in an illegal poker game against a group of ruthless, often successful gamblers, including Dave 'Mouse Ear' Smith. Being utterly hopeless at cards, Bernard (now nicknamed <i>The Gold Mine</i>) loses everything, leaving Fran and Manny to hatch a plan to come up with the money before Bernard's debtors take his shop, £20,000, and / or legs. (Guest starring <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Allen_e630.html" title="Keith Allen">Keith Allen</a> as 'Mouse Ear' Smith.)</li>
<li><b>Travel Writer</b> - Manny organises a book launch party at the shop with charismatic-but-smug travel writer Jason, and everyone starts falling for him and his stories of far-away adventure. Bernard, however, has other problems - following the death of his landlord, his building is now owned by a small cat to whom he must pay rent. Driven to destroy the cat's burgeoning real estate empire, he attempts to persuade an animal-loving pest exterminator to turn kitty hitman. (Guest starring <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_Rhind-Tutt_ff80.html" title="Julian Rhind-Tutt">Julian Rhind-Tutt</a> as Jason.)</li>
<li><b>Party</b> - On a slow Friday night, Manny suggests that the gang go to a party which will be attended by Rowena, a girl he likes very much. Instantly jealous, Bernard overcomes his natural reluctance with curiosity to see what kind of so-called person could find Manny attractive, Manny arms himself with an array of items to strategically leave about the house to give him an excuse to call her, and Fran checks her perfect new hairstyle. They return much later armed with a bizarre selection of alcohol, messed up hair, and a desire to dance very badly. An excess of <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beetroot.html" title="Beetroot">beetroot</a> <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liqueur.html" title="Liqueur">liqueur</a> gives Manny the courage to confront Bernard regarding his disdain for Manny's affection for Rowena - this brings forth a shocking revelation from Bernard (which is soon tarnished as Fran tells Manny the truth about Bernard).</li>

<p>A subtle running gag in the series is that inside the bookshop there is a chalkboard, on which is usually written bizarre, contradictory, unintelligible or incomprehensible rules and instructions that, keeping with Bernard's general misanthropy, are generally rather grumpy in nature (such as in one week the instruction simply reading "DON'T"). The writing on the board is usually a near-illegible scrawl, to the point when even Bernard cannot decipher what he has written (as in "Manny's First Day", when Bernard attempts to explain the rules of the shop to Manny, but is stymied by his own handwriting). A list of what was written on the board in each episode follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Black Books</i> is considered by the makers, as stated in the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaun_of_the_Dead_2223.html" title="Shaun of the Dead">Shaun of the Dead</a> audio commentary, to be a sister-show of fellow Channel 4 sitcom <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaced.html" title="Spaced">Spaced</a></i>, which was also produced by <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nira_Park_7c21.html" title="Nira Park">Nira Park</a>. Numerous comic actors have appeared in both series, including <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bailey_b846.html" title="Bill Bailey">Bill Bailey</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Pegg_771c.html" title="Simon Pegg">Simon Pegg</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Frost_a92e.html" title="Nick Frost">Nick Frost</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Stevenson_908a.html" title="Jessica Stevenson">Jessica Stevenson</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Serafinowicz_88fe.html" title="Peter Serafinowicz">Peter Serafinowicz</a>.</li>
<li>The show started as a pilot at a 1998 Channel 4 sitcom festival in <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverside_Studios_5255.html" title="Riverside Studios">Riverside Studios</a>. In this early version, Fran was 'Valerie', a philosophy lecturer, and Manny (whose surname was then Zimmerman - a reference to the original name of musician <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>) was a professional depression-o-gram. The show was also decidedly darker, the pilot revolving around Bernard and later Manny's decision to commit suicide.</li>
<li>The exterior scenes of <i>Black Books</i> were filmed outside a real bookshop, albeit rather a smaller one, called Collinge &amp; Clark. It is situated on Leigh Street between <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomsbury.html" title="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings_Cross%2C_London_0c58.html" title="Kings Cross, London">Kings Cross</a>. To find the shop, head out of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Square_tube_station_827e.html" title="Russell Square tube station">Russell Square tube station</a> along Bernard Street, and cross straight over onto Marchmont Street. Head up Marchmont Street for about 350 yards and turn right onto Leigh Street. The pub that is seen in the earlier episodes is on the left hand side of the street and is now a 'gastropub' restaurant called the Norfolk Arms.</li>
