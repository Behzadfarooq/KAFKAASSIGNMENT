There is an exact date, you idiot - it's january 11th. Now quit deleting what is known to be a fact .. who has made you the ruler of smallville wikipedia season 6???</p>

<dd>Where is your source? And if you personally attack me again, you will be reported. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:23, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My source is <a href="http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillespoilers.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillespoilers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillespoilers.htm</a>. What is reporting me going to do? If you continue to threaten me, I will continue to attack you. Why didn't you ask the source to begin with instead of taking it upon yourself to automatically delete or threaten?? I'm trying to work with you here to make that page the best it can be!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't threatened you, and if you continue to attack I will report. BTW, look at that link..it says "tentative date", which means that if they don't have a break anywhere in there then those would be the date. This means that The CW has not released any dates for anything past December 7. The CW is a source you need to be looking for, because they will release what is called the "official date", and that is what we use. You are using a speculative date, based on "if the show doesn't have another break". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:30, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look at the past seasons - there is a definite pattern. it always airs the 2nd thursday of January. Just like I stated it would air december 7th but you kept deleting that as well and finally you confirmed it and let it stand. The CW site only lists up to Static, we need tobe more proactive and seek other sources. In any event, I guarantee Hydro will air on January 11th. You did threaten me by saying you were going to report me on 3 at least 3 separate occasions. The idea of Wikipedia is a community to be used and edited by users ... if you impose your will on a page and threaten to report people who are just trying to help ... it defeats the goal of the site and discourages people from trying to enhance it. I appreciate your thoroughness ... but lighten up. The dates I'm giving you are right ... and even if they weren't (which they are), they could easily be changed without causing any harm. I didn't edit anything major.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That doesn't matter. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. They could say tomorrow that "an inside source says the 22 episode will be titled 'Wayne'" and that wouldn't matter unless TheCW actually officially announced that. We do not deel in "tradition" or "what was once done", this is an encyclopedia, not a fan website. We deal in what is official, and has source to back it up. I don't doubt that Kryptonsite will be right in the end, where do you think we get most of our info, but unless the CW confirms, we don't use it. This is the rule. You are confusing "dictatorship" with someone that is making sure we report "official" releases, that can be verified, not suspected information. This isn't about "well we can change it later if it's wrong", this is about "we report what is accurate". Since no one can actually confirm those dates, outside of Kryptonsite, we cannot use them. That's the policy behind "Wikipedia is not a crystal ball". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 23:45, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well if that's the case (that Wikipedia is not a crystal ball) then you should not post any future air dates .. since you have no way of knowing if the show will actually air on that date or not. For example, the Emmys were scheduled to air on 9/16/2001 .... but 9/11 happened and the emmys got pushed back to 10/7/01.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you read it, it gives a reason on how you can include it. In this case you would need the CW to actually say they plan on airing it on that date. In the case of the Emmys, you would have kept that date, and then included a reason behind why it wasn't aired on that date. The Emmys are not a show that airs every week, with breaks in between. If the CW doesn't announce it then you cannot use it. This is why we don't post Tom Welling as Director until the CW confirms that. If you go to <a href="../../../5/3/r/53rd_Primetime_Emmy_Awards_d862.html" title="53rd Primetime Emmy Awards">53rd Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, you'll see that it did have the Sept. 11 airdate, but explains why it aired in November, and why it was rescheduled twice. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 00:07, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to explain all of this to me, I feel I have a better understanding of how Wikipedia is meant to work. I really do appreciate your diligence and apologize for calling you a name before.</p>
