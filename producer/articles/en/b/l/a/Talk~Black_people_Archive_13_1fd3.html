<h2><span class="mw-headline">The word Black comes from Classical African Civilization</span></h2>
<p>Hetep and Respect Good Spirit, The first word in recorded history to describe Blackness is a burnt piece of wood. This Metu Neter glyph is translated as the letters km. A piece of bread is added "t" and the symbol for nation to make the Name of Classical African Civilization, Kmt (Kemet) or the land of the Black people.</p>
<p>See the Kemetic (Egyptian) word for Black and Black people. You can find a detailed explanation in my book "The What Makes You Black, Blook". You will find the details with the metu neter (pictographs) in the appendix.</p>
<p>This takes place thousands of years before the first Greek writes a book. This article should be updated to reflect the fact that the Word Black was first written by Black people. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/u/n/User%7EAunk_6cc3.html" title="User:Aunk">Aunk</a> (<a href="../../../a/u/n/User_talk%7EAunk_b3b0.html" title="User talk:Aunk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aunk_71d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aunk">contribs</a>) 18:16, 8 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Alun the "other black background" on the british census is also only for people of African ancestry. The fact that a tiny % are from Oceania means nothing. There are people of African ancestry who live in Oceania. Enough with the original research.</p>
<p>In any event it's clear that there's a narrow definition of what it means to be black and a broad definition, just like there's a narrow definition of what a <a href="../../../l/i/z/Lizard.html" title="Lizard">lizard</a> is, and broad definition (anything that looks kind of like a lizard including a crocodile and a dinosaur). Encyclopedias tend to focus on precise definitions so that's what we'd like to do with this article. There's another article for teh broad defenition of black. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 18:20, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I can find no evidence for your assertion anywhere and yet you accuse me of original research. I am British, I know what is included in the British census. People are entitled to respond how they like. You have consistently made totally unfounded claims regarding the criteria used in the collection of information by the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_for_National_Statistics_a97f.html" title="Office for National Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>. Did you read the document I posted? If you did then it will be as clear as the nose on your face that you are quite wrong. Your statement has no basis in fact. It is incorrect, and however much you might <b>want</b> it to be correct you will still be wrong. The document clearly provides information that includes people of non-recent African descent in the "Other Black" category. Give it up. You cannot keep pushing this single POV, you appear to be very much against consensus here. I know it is difficult sometimes to see another's point of view, but it is really time for you to accept that ther POVs do actually exist. We are not disagreeing with you for fun, we are not trying to annoy you, we are not trying to offend or upset you, and I'm quite sure none of us has enjoyed disputing with you. But it must be plain to you by now, given the multiplicity of definitions and sources we have produced that your contention that Black people are exclusively of recent African origin is just <b>one point of view</b>, and that <b>it is not the only point of view</b>. We have demonstrated this to the satisfaction of wikipedia's policies. It is now you who is going against all three policies of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. For example there's this:
<blockquote>
<p>For more than eight in ten (84 per cent) of those in the Other Black group, an ethnic group description was specified in the text box on the census form. The majority (63 per cent) specified a ‘Black British’ ethnic identity (Figure 4.2). A further 13 per cent were coded to a ‘Black Mixed’ group, indicating mixed ethnicity where both or all ethnicities described are from different black groups. A ‘Black British’ identity was even stronger among Other Blacks born in the UK. Three quarters (74 per cent) of the Other Black group born in the UK specified a ‘Black British’ identity. The proportion was similar for those over 16 years old (75 per cent) and those under 16 (72 per cent), most of whom will have had their ethnic identity written in by a parent.</p>
</blockquote>
So what do we know about these "Black Other"? We know that most describe their ethnic identity as Black British, and that the vast majority were born in the UK (79%). That's all we know about them, they do not describe their descent at all, they just tell us where they were born and what their ethnic group is (Black Other and Black British mainly). We can assume they do not identify as Black Caribbean or Black African as they did not choose this option. You are claiming these people as of recent African descent, maybe a lot of them are, I don't know, but neither do you, and yet you claim to know this as a fact. How do you know this? <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 20:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Introductory paragraph</span></h2>
<p>No offense, but I think that the introductory paragraph is again migrating towards a bit of bias and also some inaccessible English. Here is my suggested replacement:</p>
<p><i>This article is about the different definitions of the phrase "black people". To see the article about the African American use of this phrase, see Black people (US meaning).</i><br />
<b>Black people</b> is a term that usually refers to various dark-skinned people.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> "Black people" are also known as <b>blacks</b>. There is no universally agreed-upon definition for who is "black". "Black" can be a racial, ethnic, societal or cultural classification. A variety of racial, socio-political, lexical, and biological factors can influence the definition of a "black person". Some argue that the term should be reserved exclusively for dark-skinned people of recent African ancestry in certain parts of the world.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, some argue that this definition is inaccurate since it excludes <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negritos.html" title="Negritos">Negritos</a> and Australoids and other dominantly dark-skinned groups.</p>
<ol class="references">
<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> This phrase "black people" is not a particularly accurate description, since no humans have black skin.</li>
<li id="_note-1"><b><a href="#_ref-1" title="">^</a></b> In particular, some <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> favor this definition, although it is not universally accepted, even among African Americans.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is not perfect, but at least it is a proposal to argue over. I would then suggest that another article discussing the African American point of view be produced. It would have to feature both the restrictive view and have links to more general views. However, there are already hundreds of articles written from the more general viewpoint on Wikipedia, so this should not be hard to flesh it out properly so as not to claim that ALL African Americans support a definition of</p>
<ul>
<li><i>recent African ancestry from subSaharan West Africa with dark skin and those who live in subSaharan West Africa with dark skin.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>which many seem to want to push for. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:08, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Alright, I will remove the mention of Negritos and Australoids from the lead para. Is that good enough for yous? --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 21:15, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We can keep the reference to Negritos and Australoids, as long as we do it in a way that does not step too hard on someone else's toes. In fact I would like to include them so that people can understand what we are hinting at actually.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:18, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok I edited it slightly to include Negritos and Austaloids. I also improved the English a bit. I favor shorter cleaner expository sentences.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:23, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Sorry but I can't accept a bias in the introduction that states that Black people is <i>usually</i> used for people with a recent African origin. This is not true. In <i>some parts of the world</i> it's true, but not everywhere. I also don't understand what is particularly "not neutral" about the word "exclusive". Exclusive simply means "only". So if it's <i>exclusively people of African descent</i> it just means the same as <i>not including people of any non-recent African descent.</i> If this is what you mean then how is it POV to say it? It's just accurate that's all. I don't get how it can be neutral to keep saying that "African descent"="Black", now you want to say it in the introduction, or at least imply that this is the "usual" or "normal" usage everywhere in the world. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 21:44, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Wobble/Alun. Which is why I said SOME people claim this. Obviously not everyone does. I also have a problem with exclusive, so I am trying to add enough qualifiers to describe the situation accurately. It is true that SOME people want to define it this way. But not everyone does. And I do not believe that what I have suggested claims that African descent=Black, but if it does I should change it. I have given many many counterexamples here that demonstrate African Descent is NOT the same as black. And not just Aborigines. Many many other counterexamples exist.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:53, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well it said that Black people <i>usually</i> refers to people of recent African origin. I changed it and got told I was <i>just being stubborn</i>, see the edit history of the page. I think it should say that <i>some</i> people think it is only people of recent African descent and some people think it is people anywhere in the world with a very dark skin colour. I'd be happy with that. There's no bias there is there? To call one usage "usual" imediately brings in a bias. That's what I am specifically against.

<dd>How is it being stubborn? This is something we have been over again and again. I thought we were slowly coming to a consensus, and now you want to go back to saying that Black is recent African origin and recent African origin is Black, "usually". What I don't understand is how you think this is at all significantly different from what Timelist is saying, because as far as I can see you are now agreeing with him.

<dd>I really do tend to agree with this. We should try to include all points of view here. I know there are several people here who do not want to apply wikipedia policies, but they are quite straightforward in this case. We present all POVs without bias. Simple. If we cannot do this then we need some help. We could go for a peer review, or an RfC or some such thing. We could seek mediation. But I do think that spliting the article will not work. We cannot have what are essentially two articles about the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_diaspora.html" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a> just because a few editors refuse to accept that a different POV to their own does exist.

<p>Message to Timelist, I dont come here often enough to know who is who, (I know a few of my big time enemies come here). I have just observed some of the incorrect edits you are doing and must ask you to stop, It is not going to give you victory, why are you doing it. Is it fair? Is it fair for your American POV to be a WORLD POV. have u been to Fiji and other countries where non-African people identify as being of a "black" race. Furthermore many people in the world were called black by Europeans. Almost everyone became black. Imagine if a Jewish person said suffering and genocide and Holocaust only referred to them--is it right? Stop causing trouble. I think the intro accommodates your POV, and if I had anything to say about it the intro wouldn’t so be happy for what they have given you and be a broader thinking human being. I know how you feel, cuz if they start saying African means White South Africans I would flip. But black really doesnt only apply to African, trust me my friend most African never call themeselves black. Go to Niger, or Timbuktu, or Gonder and see if you hear the word black people.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halaqah</a> 13:46, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gosh! I've just had a brief look at the mediation. It was back in August, and exactly the same people were having exactly the same argument. The mediator seems to have come to the same conclusions as most of the editors here, and yet the few who refuse to accept other verified points of view are <b>still</b> pushing this POV. I wonder why they went to mediation at all if they were not prepared to even consider any other POV. I also think this contraryness has gone a bit far. We have catergorically shown that there are many <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that support the point of view that Black people is usually used to refer to people of dark skin colour, irresepctive of descent, these people still refuse to accept this POV. This refusal is a direct breach of the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Indeed there is little evidence that Black people <i>only</i> refers to people of recent African descent. Most definitions from dictionaries support both POVs. The "Biological definition" section in this article is misleading and should be scrapped. The section about Ethiopians is extremely POV, pushing the "African descent" idea and implying that a non sub-Saharan descent is not compatible with identifying as Black. Indeed I think there should be a shortish section giving the "Black as recent African origin" idea (possibly including the section about genetic definitions) with a link to the main article about the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_diaspora.html" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a>. It seems to me that because nearly all North American Black people are of recent African descent the words have become near synonyms there, this is probably exacerbated by the adoption of the "African" epithet in North America to replace the word Black. Now both words are used and seem to be applied to the same North American ethnic group. But this does not make it acceptable for people to ignore the obvious fact that these words are not synonyms, and I suspect that they are not synonyms for many North Americans either, just for certain groups. I think Filll has made this point several times before. So do we go for an RfC? Do we go for an accusation of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisruptive_editing_02a2.html#Dealing_with_disruptive_editors" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">disruptive editing</a>?

It is true that we do not really know who is who and how many there are. The falangists might be all one person. Many of the "African Americans" might also be one person. Or maybe just 2 or 3. Maybe splitting the article will not help. Splitting it would not negate the need to make at least one general article, even if the general article is a disambiguation page. Now of course everyone is fighting over who gets to have the simple "black people" article. Let's take a look at how many people we are talking about:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>African Americans no more than 40 million at most, of all colors</li>
<li>Africans more than 800 million, of all colors</li>
<li>dark skinned peoples in Europe about 3-7 million</li>
<li>dark skinned peoples in Australia about 230,000</li>
<li>dark skinned people in the rest of Oceania that have been called black hard to say but could be many more</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We know that not ALL African Americans agree with the restrictive viewpoint, since many have a global viewpoint. I believe Editingoprah has a global viewpoint and is a self-identified African American. We known from Halaqah who is our only self-identified African that not all Africans share this view, and maybe no Africans. I know that very few if any Australian Aborigines share the view. We do not know about the others. Certainly some in South Asia use the term for political purposes (<i>DALIT: THE BLACK UNTOUCHABLES OF INDIA, THIRD EDITION</i>, by V.T. Rajshekar ISBN: 0-932863-05-1, 124 pp., illus., 1995, $9.95) and possibly for other reasons. There are over 160 million Dalits in India. However, it is fairly clear that the perspective that</p>

<li>Black refers <i>only</i> to those of recent African ancestry from West SubSaharan Africa and particularly to African Americans (some of whom have seized the name for themselves and deny reality and history)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>leaves out very large groups of people who have other views, even those with dark skin who self-identify as black. I would not say a group of 230,000 Aborigines is a trivial number. How many Dalits call themselves black?

<p>I think from what FILL said above I sign off on this debate, it is beyond argument, 40 million are called black and even more in Austrailia and Oceania, like Fiji etc. I dont want to be a "thats it" but i think the point is 100% accurate and the debate should be closed. Too much evidence supports that black people is not only for Africans. I even heard an Italian women calling a dark Italian black. I have seen no supporting evidence for why only AA are black, NONE! or are they denying the entire history of Indians being called black by the Bristish? --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halaqah</a> 15:07, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

The following is a personal view only, I used no references, or encyclopedic content, do what u will with this contribution. Here's my two cents:</p>
<p>I am an African-Canadian, son of Jamaican immigrants who sought Canada as their place to better their lives and the lives of their children. I initially logged into this 'black people' page to find out more about black people across the globe and their history, struggles as a minority. 'Black people' are all over the world, a minority in Russia, Korea,Europe, Mexico, Central and South America. I was and still seek knowledge of the plight of Blacks all over the world, Canada, U.S. and the other nations I mentioned.</p>
<p>To get back to the point, the terms black and African to describe a community, are problematic. Let's say you use the term 'black', who is defined as such. Many 'blacks' can easily pass for whites or caucasian, Mariah Carey,(as pointed out in an e.g.), the other problem is black as defined in the dictionary is defined very negatively, as evil etc., and not every one likes the term assigned to them. The 3rd problem, most people who call themselves black aren't black they're brown at best ( a silly point, possibly but true nonetheless. The good thing about the term 'Black',in the seventies became a call to self-pride for many in America, (and more than likely across the world), a call to build a united community that supported its needs through Blacks supporting their businesses, working together to build safer, stronger communities etc. That's why I like the term 'Black', in the sense of racial pride.</p>
<p>African is term I also use, I firmly believe that many if not all blacks (possibly all of humanity) originated from Africa. Many people I speak to have no allegiance to Africa as a number of Africans (those I've spoken to) view us as exiles, not worth working with and not true Africans. Many people reject the African term and have allegiance only to the nations of their birth I am Jamaican, or American first. A viewpoint that I think is foolish especially unless you are from a nation where blacks are the majority, you more than likely have suffered more hate from your fellow countrymen who view you as a lesser being than a fellow Brit, Canadian or American.</p>
<p>The sad thing, there are terms used to describe us, some less than flattering which I refuse to use myself. Negro is the lesser of the evils, but I've hated the term. It's a definition dumped on us not one I believe we chose for ourselves. Negro, Negroid, I just hate the term.</p>
<p>Which makes this whole debate very confusing, the attempt was to have an entry to define a group that exists all over the world, It is necessary to have info about blacks all over the world not just in Africa or the usual suspects, not an easy feat of course but worth investigating. To help aid myself or others in that search for information terms had to be selected. Should we squabble over the term black or african when we ourselves have trouble figuring out how we identify ourselves&#160;? I have heard of no term that would satisfy me, so if any one can think of one, please let's hear it. That's my two cents.Darkrider30 04:01, 25 December 2006 (UTC)darkrider30</p>

<p>So we have editors like Wobble and Fill who want to create a ridiculous article listing all the people in history who have ever been called black by anyone ever regardless of whether the term was used in an ethnic context or not.

<dd>Halaqah I'm not suggesting that all Africans call themselves black. But many people of recent sub-Saharan African ancestry use the term Black to describe our unique ethnicity and rather than write an article about that, many people want to merge all these unrelated definitions of black people (Black Irish, negritoes) into one article, when the far more interestinng article is about Black as an ethnic label. Essentially we're bing told "NO!

<dd>Timelist, Black people are not an ethnic group. There are hundreds of ethnic groups in sub Saharan Africa, to lump them all together as a single ethnic group is extremely offensive to them. These different ethnic groups do exist, have you not heared about Rwanda and the genocide there? Do you seriously think that Black people of recent African descent form a single ethnic group? African Americans are a different ethnic group to West Indians who are different again to all African groups. You are also being unfair, you want to repeat the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_diaspora.html" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a> article as a "Black people" article. The only reason I can think of for doing this is that you cannot accept any other POV than your own. I am really angry about this. There are Black people who are discriminated against because of the colour of their skin all over the world. This is not just about people with recent African descent, this is about Black people. Your criteria for defining Black people are narrow and not representative of the consensus here. Many people here have tried hard to accomodate your POV, have accepted that we should include it in the article. But this does not seem to be enough for you, it's your own personal definition or nothing at all. Well this is an encyclopaedia, it is not <b>the world according to Timelist</b>.

<p>That perhaps 90% of the trouble at this page is the cause of one user with multiple accounts harassing others and engaging in disruptive behavior. I think the time has come to come to grips with this. All efforts for at least 6 months have gone nowhere. Many editors have given up in disgust. Tons of material was flushed down the toilet. All so one editor can rant and rave and threaten and throw tantrums and charge others with racism. This is too much. Even when I tried to get them to create a separate page with their own agenda, they wanted this one instead. And were not at all constructive. It is not as though black and African people and African Americans have no pages. There are literally hundreds. And this person does not want to contribute but just fight others and waste time and energy and be destructive. And their edits are usually stilted awful English. I am not even convinced any more that this person is truely African American or a person of color, but an outside agitator trying to cause trouble and damage to the article. This person is working at cross purposes to people of color, and might even be like the falangists, just trying to cause disruption to keep these articles from being written.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 17:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Timelist, Black people are not an ethnic group.</i></p>
<p>Then why are they an ethnic origin category on the U.S. census?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know, but Black people are no more an ethnic group than White people. I was at that article as well for a while. I am not "ethnically White". I am ethnically <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_people.html" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a> and I am ethnically <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">British</a>. When I stste my ethnicity it tells you something about me. You know where I come from, you know the culture of the place, you know what languages I speak, you might expect me to follow <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Union_a947.html" title="Rugby Union">Rugby Union</a>. You would know that I am partial to <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeks.html" title="Leeks">Leeks</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/f/Daffodil.html" title="Daffodil">Daffodils</a>. You might guess that the car sticker I have is of <a href="../../../y/_/d/Y_Ddraig_Goch_9023.html" title="Y Ddraig Goch">Y Ddraig Goch</a>. You would expect that I probably support England in football and Cricket, but not in Rugby. There are a miriad of things that my ethnicity tells you about me. The fact that I'm "White" tells you very little. I have ethnically British friends that are not "White", I have far more in common with them than I do with people in Finland, where I live, because I do not share an ethnic identity with Finnish people, but I do with other British people, even if they are not White. Ethnicity has nothing to do with the colour of a person's skin. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 17:58, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>There are hundreds of ethnic groups in sub Saharan Africa, to lump them all together as a single ethnic group is extremely offensive to them.</i></p>
<p>But it's not offensive to lump all the dark skinned people of the world into 1 category?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't say that it wasn't. I wouldn't have Black people or a White people articles personally, I find them both offensive. I find this article <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_British_d404.html" title="White British">White British</a> particularly pointless and offensive, because no one identifies as "White British", it's not an ethnic group, it's a census classification, British people are British people, whether they are White or not. If we have to have one, then it should reflect a world view, and not just your view. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 17:58, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>These different ethnic groups do exist, have you not heared about Rwanda and the genocide there? Do you seriously think that Black people of recent African descent form a single ethnic group? African Americans are a different ethnic group to West Indians who are different again to all African groups.</i></p>
<p>There are ethnic groups within ethnic groups. The popular argument is that there are many tribes of Native Americans but that doesn't change the fact that Native Americans are still a coherent ethnicity.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not think this is correct. There certainly are ethnic groups within ethnic groups. I am both Welsh and British. I may even identify as European on an ethnic level (just as someone might identify as African). I never identify as ethnically "White", because I don't think such a thing exists. There are people that are considered White who do not live or derive from Europe. This was a big source of disagreement on the White people page. Myself and several editors were trying to stop some editors asserting that only Europeans can count as White. We appear to be having a similar problem here. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 17:58, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>You are also being unfair, you want to repeat the African diaspora article as a "Black people" article. The only reason I can think of for doing this is that you cannot accept any other POV than your own.</i></p>
<p>I have no problem with other POVs. But the word black has more than one legitimate meaning. My ethnicity (recent sub-Saharan African ancestry) is as legitimate as any other ethnicity and I have as much of a right to an article about my ethnicity as any other ethnicity does. Why are you resisting the right of my ethnicity to have an article (under the terms we choose)? Why are you telling me my ethnicity doesn't exist? True, black also refers to dark skin, but "white" also refers to light skin, yet your ethnicity is still allowed its own article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You certainly do have a problem with other POVs. We have all been prepaerd to compromise and include both your POV and our POV. You have consistently implied that we are racists for doing this. No one has called you a racist for insisting that the only Black people in the world are the ones that <b>you</b> decide are Black. Your ethnic group does have an entry. Are you claiming that you are not <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a>?

<p>There's more to being black than experiencing discrimination. Being discriminated against has nothing to do with being black, it's just an unfortunate byproduct. Why does it make you angry to see people of recent sub-Saharan African ancestry assert their identity.

<dd>I guess that is an admission of sockpuppetry. Because we do have a history log here. And I do recall Deeceevoice contributing a lot but disagreeing with you. But we do have records. I only came here because there was a call for editors to come and help stop the fighting. Which I have tried to do, and many others have recognized me for it. This article is renowned for fighting and being locked. And it seems like Timelist and associates sockpuppets have caused most of the fighting. I have tried to discourage the white supremacists it is true. However, if one checks the records, as long as they are productive, I think even they have a right to contribute. And I have supported their right to contribute as is a clear matter of public record. And yes I have talked about people I know because that forms my frame of reference. Many others do here as well. I will also note that bandwidth is cheap, but we should be writing articles. Which I now realize you are declining to do. A person really interested in contributing would write an article and call it black people (US meaning) or black people (American ethnic group) or add to the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> page or accept a disambiguation page at this address.

If you break a rule it's not an excuse to claim that the rule doesn't apply to you because you choose to interpret it that way. This applies here, just like the census data don't interpret Black people as only of recent African origin. And now I've had a look at the old mediation I can see tha the mediator was in agreement that <b>neither the US nor the UK census criteria excluded people of non recent African descent from the definition of Black.</b> <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 19:13, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>See Timelist? This is what happens when you get people sufficiently annoyed by your tactics. They lose the willingness to cooperate with you. You get a bad name. I think that a case can be made to have two articles, particularly if this one is made general to be about ALL people called black or who self-identify as black, either now or in the past. The ethnic article has to be done very carefully. I do think that there is some sort of generalized "ethnic" or "cultural" argument that is broader than African American but not as broad as BLack people, so that ethnic article would fit in an intermediate niche. Here is a sort of diagram showing what I imagine:</p>
<p>|&lt;----------------Black people--------------------&gt;|<br />
|&lt;-------------Black people (ethnicity)----&gt;|<br />
|&lt;---African American---&gt;|&lt;--African people---------------&gt;|<br /></p>
<p>This is not quite correct, because of mulattos and other complications. But is approximate. I think that Timelist can make a successful argument, but he must give up the notion of fighting with everyone and anyone who he thinks wants to use the name he personally wants to reserve for his own personal definition, ignoring the world outside the US, ignoring African Americans with a global perspective and ignoring history.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:52, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see myself ignoring history because the reality is language is fluid. Just because black has one meaning in one language at one point in time doesn't mean the term can't evolve in other languages and time periods to have completely different meanings. And I do have a very global perspective in that I feel kinship with peoples of African ancestry from all over the world. Hence I find terms like African-American too limiting. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 22:27, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Excellent point Fill! An effort will be made to direct readers to any and all alternative meanings when they are already adressed in wikipedia.

<dd>I don't. It's a POV fork, pure and simple. Anyone can see that. The history here proves it. When it became obvious that Timelist was editing against consensus s/he decided to go off and create another article about a thing that does not exist, but that Timelist would like to exist. The name is bad, the article is worse. It seems to be from a single POV and mainly personal opinion, one whole section has a single cite, I don't think we can cite material by saying <i>This section was adapted from Chapter 3 of Frank W. Sweet, Legal History of the Color Line: The Rise and Triumph of the One-Drop Rule (Palm Coast FL: Backintyme, 2005)</i> can we? We cite facts, not whole chunks of material. If this section is entirely from a single source, then how can it be neutral? This is clearly a POV fork, and it is clearly Timelist's "personal" vanity article. It's nothing more than opinion. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 22:02, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have to remember that this is the first rough draft of such an article. Since Timelist wrote it, of course it is from his personal viewpoint. This will probably evolve if he allows it to evolve to be more neutral. I encouraged him to do it, because I think that he does have a point about blacks having a somewhat different meaning in the US, and ethnicity being somewhat different than race or other criteria that black is used as. Everytime you turn around, you see things labelled as black in the US, even though in principle it should have been long since replaced by African American. It is in government documents and government committee titles. So he has a point. However, I think that the main article, this one, should be reserved for the broadest possible interpretation.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 22:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually Fill has been suggesting that the black people article should be divided into a family of articles for quite some time now. He was right all along and I should have listened sooner. My article might not be the greatest but its brand new and I've had help from no one. Give it time! It's not based on opinion or POV but on black as an ethnic classification as per the U.S. census. There's already an article on <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_as_a_skin_color_identity.html" title="Black as a skin color identity">Black as a skin color identity</a>. What's wrong with an article on black as an ethnic identity since this is how I've always understood the term to be used. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 22:22, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have indeed been suggesting something like this for about 4 months. And I was shot down every time. I think if we give it a try, we might be able to make a case for it.

It is just a rough draft now.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 22:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And Alun, can you please stop saying that African origin ethnicity does not exist. I know your not from North America, but here people of African ancestry call ourselves "brother" and "sister" and feel an enormous degree of kinship. Please show us enough respect to acknowledge the fact that peoples of recent sub-Saharan African descent are a legitimate ethnic group and deserve the same amount of respect as any other legitimate ethnic group.

<p>I have had several reasons for suggesting more articles for months. One of the reasons is that there is too much material for one article. If it was repetitious to have that other article, I would agree that we should only have one article. But it is not repetitious. I also think that we can accommodate more viewpoints more easily with this article. Just fighting we do not move forward. If we can allow another article and not fight, then that is helpful. Also, if you look at the list of articles on this area, we have several hundred already. So if we have another one, so what? It does no harm. Also, we have to recognize that given their wealth, African Americans have more influence on Wikipedia and the internet than Africa or other places. This might be unfair, but it is reality. This accommodates that reality. It might not be the best reason, but it is true.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 22:47, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fill is 100% correct. And to add to Fill's great points I would say that growing up, I only ever heard the term black being used exclusively to describe those of recent sub-Saharan African ancestry, but when I got to wikipeda, I found that my reality was not adequately reflected. So I think the ethnicity article fills a void. It's great to have the Australian aboriginal perspective on what it means to be black, but does it have to come at the expense of mine. Fill is right. There's room for more than 1 article. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 23:02, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sub Saharan African people</span></h2>
<p>The discussion is too long, I havent bothered to read it. So excuse me if I'm repeating someone. I think Black people (ethnicity) should be renamed to Sub-Saharan African People, which is defined as people who are of "recent" Sub Saharan Ancestry...</p>
<dl>
<dd>The question of names is difficult. The reason I am doubtful about this is that many people that we are proposing to cover in the ethnicity article are not <b>in</b> SubSaharan Africa, and may have only ancestral roots there within the last 500 or 600 years, since the start of the African Slave trade by the West (although probably it extends further back in time thanks to Arab traders). I think that the use of the word ethnicity also highlights the cultural aspects which are important; attitude, music (jazz, hiphop, rap etc), food, clothes, some measure of shared experience as well as genetic similarities. etc. I think that the name and description SubSaharn is still a bit confusing because the Sudan is not all SubSaharan, and neither is southern Algeria, Morocco, Libya, etc, and it is hard to draw nice clean boundaries really. I am not sure that all of African Americans are of SubSaharan origin either. Basically I see it as an American definition by African Americans and Americans. Which might not be fair, as I said, but the Americans are still a dominant force on the internet and world culture. Also, there are many Afrikaaners etc that are white skinned in Namibia, South Africa etc that can add to the confusion, and they have been there for many generations. So I am uncertain that SubSaharan Africans is a good title.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 23:44, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well if you want an article about black skinned people just call it black skinned people. The problem with calling my ethnicity sub-Saharan African people is multi-fold. A) The census describes us as Black so its best to go with established terms, B) Not everyone agrees that the Sahara desert is a meaningful barrier for distinguishing black Africa, from non-black Africa. Many people find the term "sub-Saharan" offensive if only because it includes the word "sub". C) Personally I just don't like calling myself sub-Saharan. D) I'm not a sub-Saharan African person. I'm a person of recent sub-Saharan African descent, so my recent ancestors are sub-Saharan Africans, but I personally was not born there and never lived there. But I'm glad you agree with Fill and I that the article needs to be split <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 23:34, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No it is not about dark skin. It USUALLY about dark skin, but it is not about dark skin (no skin is black). I agree that the Sahara is not a great barrier. It is rough at best.

<p>I think Canada probably absorbs most of this from the US. After all, most of the Blacks in Canada are there because Canada was the terminus of the Underground Railroad. There are some there because of being recent Commonwealth immigrants and some there because they are descendents from the very few black slaves in Canada before the British Empire outlawed slavery. But most come from the US. And most of the culture in this regard is imported from the US. Canada is culturally dominated by the US to a large degree.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 00:38, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Excellent point Fill. But I don't think it's just North America. see this article about Blacks in Latin America.[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A38089-2002Dec25?language=printer" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A38089-2002Dec25?language=printer" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] I would guess (though I have no proof) that most of the world equates Black identity with African ancestry identity, if for no other reason than the fact that African descendants are the dark skinned people most of the world has had the most contact with. Most of the world has never met an Australian aboriginal or a negrito so I think over time these groups have become excluded from the definition of black in the minds of most people. That's just how language eveloves. The meaning of words comes to reflect their most common useage <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 00:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But if you try to pare the definition in that way, you will end up getting killed with charges of a fork. You can get away with it if you claim this is a US based thing and part of US culture. But only by a hair. You still might get nuked. If you try to shove Afro Argentinians etc in , aside from just a tangential mention, you will get your article killed.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 00:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You might be right Fill. I certainly need to do a lot more research on just how widespread the practice of calling only people of African origin Black is. Is this something limited to North America, limited to the Americas, or is it also common in Europe, Africa and much of Asia? I know that in North America black is a social category for people of African descent but when black is used for all dark skinned people in other countries, I'm not sure if they mean it as a social category, or as a literal description of extremely dark brown skin. If one use of black is a "social category" and the other use is a physical description, we might be comparing apples and oranges. That's yet another reason why you are so correct in advocating a family of articles <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 01:09, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In Norway, black seems to be used with African and Caribbean as in Black/African/Caribean as a ethnic or people group...<a href="http://www.nsd.uib.no/data/ny_individ/norStudy/norVariable.cfm?norVarID=7989" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nsd.uib.no/data/ny_individ/norStudy/norVariable.cfm?norVarID=7989" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukas19_cfbd.html" title="User:Lukas19">Lukas19</a> 01:18, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the UK many people use the term Black to describe any non-indigenous European people (ie anyone not White). So it has been common for people from India or Pakistan to identify as Black. This is more of a social and political statement than anything else, but it is worthy of inclusion that this meaning exists. It is in one of the definitions used in the article. In the UK it is increasingly common for Indian and Pakistani people to identify as Asian. Indeed when British people speak of Asians they primarily mean people from the Indian subcontinent. You might find this article interesting. Though be warned the terminology is British, definitions used here may not apply outside the UK.<a href="http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/58/6/441" class="external autonumber" title="http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/58/6/441" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Cheers. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 10:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you Fill. Nothing wrong with a general article giving the overviews of various definitions. But perhaps it could be better organized. Instead of dividing it up based on social/lexical/biological definitions, it could be divided up based on ethnicity definitions, and skin color definitions, and then the ethnicity definitions could say: see main article Black people (ethnicity) and the color definitions could say: see main article <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_as_a_skin_color_identity.html" title="Black as a skin color identity">Black as a skin color identity</a> Just a thought. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 01:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been busy with other things for a while. Coming back after a few days I find lots of confusion, and odd support from the OED and the "canonical" dictionary of Chinese that was first put together not long after the Chinese deposed the Manchurians for defining Australians with Africans. The view has more merit than I would ever have believed before seeing the research of Wells et al., but just picking two groups as "most related" because of skin color denies the objective research of Wells and others.</p>
<p>I would like to see an article that began with the putative earliest Homo sapiens sapiens population in Africa and showed, within the confines of the African continent, how the San, the Mbuti, the East Africans, the Bantu, the Nilio-Saharan, and the West Africans relate to each other, but also relate to groups with whom they are in closest geographic and social contact, the Berbers, the Sardinians... and I don't see the Egyptians mentioned on the Cavalli-Sforza square chart, but they and the Arabs should probably be included as well, not as core populations but as peripheral populations that have diverged themselves and perhaps have brought some outside diversity back to Africa.</p>
<p>Once we have that article (which we might call something like "African people" meaning people with (fuzzily) "all" (almost all) their family history occuring on the continent of AFrica and adjacent areas (Arab peninsula, and, for historical/genetic reasons the island of Sardinia), it would be easier to talk about the diaspora and give groups such as the Australian aboriginal population and the African Americans a clear position related to what we have already established as the historical and geographical center.</p>
<p>To carry out this kind of an organization we need to be cognizant of existing article, and perhaps we would end up tailoring them to fit a more global picture than has been presented previously. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 01:42, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One general suggestion: If we decide what groups to make articles about, how to define those groups most elegantly, etc., it will then be relatively easy to find names for them. We are now stuck on names that people want to us and then running into trouble when there are as many definitions for the names as there are contributors. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 01:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An article like that which you describe would probably benefit from a more precise title, and would also end up encompassing material from articles like: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Africa_008d.html" title="History of Africa">History of Africa</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_genetic_history.html" title="Human genetic history">Human genetic history</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_migration.html" title="Human migration">Human migration</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_diaspora.html" title="African diaspora">African diaspora</a>.

<p>As I noted above, there are literally hundreds of articles about black and African people. There are some articles which need to be written and some which are in bad shape and need to be expanded or worked on. We have some gaps. We also need to organize the material so it is accessible. We do have to be careful not to duplicate too much and to name things appropriately. <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Africanism_0097.html" title="Pan-Africanism">Pan-Africanism</a> is part of a big family of articles. <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> is part of a big family of articles. There are many <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial.html" title="Racial">racial</a> articles but I do not get the impression they are too well organized yet. There is a lot on genetics, again not super well organized yet. But we could serve a valuable service by organizing this area, creating a few lead articles, filling in gaps, etc. I would propose that <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_people.html" title="African people">African people</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> be very general articles. Very wide, not too much depth. Then we can have a suite of others more in depth on various aspects. Some exist already. Some are in pretty good shape. Some need work, to be honest. But it will take a while to get a grasp on the humungous volume of stuff and figure out what is needed and where it should go.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 04:20, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whenever we get articles started without an umbrella article or articles to give them some context they tend to need to do with side issues. For the question we are working on now, the umbrella articles should be <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">Race</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_construction.html" title="Social construction">Social construction</a>. Maybe we should also include articles on culture and language in that list. All of the aforesaid factors are at work in defining "black people" (in very many different ways) and in influencing the way that individual humans interact to what they (individually) regard as "black people."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When you zoom in on Africa plus the migratory routes out of Africa (and, occasionally, small-scale returns to Africa), you see the same topics, but limited in scope. These topics become <i>specified</i> as as to relate to the "racial" (i.e., genetic) identities of the indigenous populations of Africa, and the social constructs that are imposed on these matters of genetic fact. Culture and language have ancillary effects that may be important for people living in Africa but need an extra level of interpretation for people who have an "all Africans are the same" view. I'm just guessing, but just the body language of a Dyak on the streets of NYC might give troublemakers and other interested people a heads-up that "this is something else." Such factors have powerful effects that are not always easy to analyze or even to pick up on. (See <i>The Silent Language</i> for some good examples of "culture shock" things that people all do that are strongly discordant in the eyes of members of other cultures and yet below the level of conscious awareness.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When you zoom back out a big you see the same topics, but in an interesting light since social construction becomes somewhat more important. We are all African, but at least two "canonical" authorities on the use of language, the OED and the 國語辭典 (China, ca. 1930), separate some of the "black-skinned" among us into a special category. The classification of "black" has medical relevance for issues like UV damage, but it is mainly a "cosmetic" issue in the negative sense that many social constructions place on dark skin color are disadvantageous to the "black" individuals concerned. At this level the cultural and language issues become much more socially relevant since — despite skin color — people frequently treat others differently depending on the language(s) they speak and the cultural features that are manifest in dress, affective mannerisms, etc.</dd>

And this is the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> page. And timelist has been working on the black people (ethnicity) page.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/f/r/African_people.html" title="African people">African people</a> is just a start and does not yet include the diversity of all the people in Africa. It needs a lot of work, but it is a start. It will cover all the people who live in Africa, obviously. Very important since this is one of the 7 continents (6 continents with native populations).</li>
<li>This page, the "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a>" page, (which might get renamed to something like "Who is black?" or some other similar name) will describe all people who call themselves black or who have been called black.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> exists and describes the group known as African American. It is one of a huge collection of pages on this topic.</li>
<li>The new black people (ethnicity) page, which might also get renamed, is about the ethnic and/or social identity that is called black by African Americans and other Americans. It has little or nothing to do with skin color, since many of the people who are called black in the US look essentially white and might be only 1/128 or 1/256 or less of African ancestry. Many African Americans and Americans (apparently including the American government census definitions) do not include Australian Aborigines and other nonrecent African ancestry people as black. This category includes many but not African peoples that African Americans look to as their kin. This category also includes many other groups with recent African ancestry around the world. Black is really important in the US even though in principle it should be replaced by African American as a term. There is a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_History_Month_8597.html" title="Black History Month">Black History Month</a> every year that is widely publicized. There is a Congressional <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Caucus_56cd.html" title="Black Caucus">Black Caucus</a> that is an important government group. Laws use the phrase black. The phrase black is part of the public discourse. It is in the media. Organizations put black in their titles. Black continues to live on.

<dd>I am not sure what the right name should be. But I do know several things:
<ul>
<li>we have plenty of material to fill multiple articles</li>
<li>we have been mired in edit wars for far too long and it shows in this <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> article</li>
<li>if we can all work together, instead of at cross purposes, we will make far more progress on this suite of articles, including this one</li>
<li>The USA definition of "black" might or might not be the same as others around the world or historic definitions, but the US definition of "black" is very closely tied to the US Civil Rights movement. This gives the term "black" a very special resonance in some quarters. Also, Americans are very dominant on the internet and have a large influence on world culture for a variety of reasons. As a result, I would favor trying to see if we can divide up this material in some way such that their separate more restrictive perspective can be more extensively developed in a separate article than is possible in a general or summary or inclusive article like <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a>. This does NOT mean that I do not think that the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> article or other articles should not be general or inclusive in nature or that <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> article not be globally defined, with a wide scholarly treatment of the term. In fact, I think if we do this, we can have a far more general <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black people</a> article.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 19:54, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree 100% I've never understood why a person with one "White" parent and one "Black" parent is usually identified by society as Black, but never White. I have drawn the same conclusion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The one-drop rule isn't universally accepted, and "Mullato"?</span></h2>
<p>This is sort of a response to the list of pictures above this post. The one drop rule is an American law (which I thought was dropped out, I didn't know it was still in effect), and wouldn't apply to many other places like South Africa for example. All of them are either mixed, or have parents who are mixed.</p>
<p><br />
...Another rant I hold is the use of the word "mulatto". I think it's degoratory since it originates from the word "mule", which is a mix between a Donkey and a Horse... now, which ever race you think would represent the horse, obviously noone would like to be called a donkey (based on the human characteristics associated with the animal, e.i. dumb, lazy, etc.). So if you call yourself a Mulatto, in a way, you're insulting your own parents. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.235.81.0_f6f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.235.81.0">68.235.81.0</a> (talk) 16:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Why dont you create an account and log in so we can know who you are? <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mulatto.html" title="Mulatto">Mulatto</a> is a well known and accepted term. It might have a less than savory provenance and/or etymology, but so do many many words that we use in English. We would end up discarding a huge fraction of our vocabulary if we applied this suggested rule of yours. Also, everything about race can be determined to be offensive to someone, so all of the hundreds and maybe even thousands of articles on this topic should be deleted. This might be politically correct, but not helpful for the readers of the encyclopedia and not helpful for someone trying to understand cultures, societies and history. And I do not believe that the "one drop rule" is on the books still, but it might be. Nevertheless, it is an important part of history. And as such there is no problem with including it. The goal of this article is not be politically correct, but to explain the world. And the world is not and never has been politically correct. The article is about how people do not agree on this subject, which they do not.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 17:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mulatto like all the words i hate is a problem, word it is rarely used, not polite and should be avoided, we need to be respectful, it was a dirty word fashioned out of enslavement. multi racial heritage is far more accurate, and most people of multi racial heritage are African or racial identify with being Black people and guess what they are, because race is in your head. And anyone with enough african blood is an African, if they wanna be. Yes everyone will find something offensive but that why we need to look at the words carefully clearly looking at Mulatto and multi-ethnic background we dont need to try hard to see which one is better. Retarded or Mentally challneged. blacks or African Americans, is it just me or is African Americans a more beautiful term? that yellow person or that Chinese person?

<dd>I had always assumed that the term reflected the intermediate social status of individuals with one "white" and on "black" parent. If a "white" man had a "mullato" offspring and he loved his child, then another "white" person in that society would have more to worry about if he attacked that child than if he attacked a "black" child because he could not assume that the "white" parent would be as relatively powerless as a "black" parent would be. Among the "non-white" members of a racially structured society, a lighter individual might be perceived as better than a darker individual.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There are other terms to describe "mixed race" people, and it is difficult to know what is safe to use. "Half-breed" has always been disrespectful as far as I know. In Chinese there are two terms, "zá zhǒng" (miscellaneous seed, miscellaneous kind, sort, variety, [mutt?]), which is viewed as "bad language," and the socially acceptable "hùn xǔe ér" (muddled blood child, child of mixed parentage), which is viewed as proper and respectful language, i.e., PC.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think that terms that may be problematical need to be contextualized, e.g., "people having parents of two different 'races' are sometimes called 'mullatos.'"</dd>
</dl>

<p>One of my friends has a very ordinary-sounding name, and except for being a rather large guy he looks nothing out of the ordinary. But according to him, a significant part of his family is Cherokee, which is still a major nation around here. Anyway, as far as anybody who looks has any opinion, he is "white." He married a "black" woman, so he has a "black" child. While this boy was growing up, my friend was frequently in company of his "black" son's friends. At first his son's friends felt suspecious of him and I guess there were things they didn't want to talk about. Finally, somebody new to the group said something about my friend, and another of the kids said, "Aw, don't mind him. He's black." End of story.</p>
<p>Sometimes people can be very cruel. I remember being in a program involving Native Americans. One of the presenters was a person who had one "white" and one "Amerind" parent. Two tribal elders, from other than his tribe if I remember correctly, got up and spoke at length and with some heat about the hatefulness of a state in which there exist people of mixed heritage. All of this was said to the poor guy's face in a pretty small group.</p>
<p>Another quirk is that for some purposes people carry identity cards that identify them as members of certain tribes. This is essentially a matter of governmental relations <b>between</b> nations. American Indian tribes have the status of nations, and treaties between, e.g., the Cherokee nation and the U.S. federag government still play a part in the arcane workings of government. Anyway, the result is that you get some people whom even the Amerinds view as "white" who are full members of a recognized tribe. So these kids often feel very put upon when somebody tells them that they "aren't Indian."</p>
<p>Racism aside, what are the real-world differences among these people? There is at least speculation to indicate that Old World people have had distilled alcohol available to them for so many centuries that the people who cannot metabolize alcohol efficiently and therefore are subject to certain disease processes when they consume alcohol heedlessly must have largely been eliminated from the gene pool. But these differences can only be attributed, if at all, on a statistical basis.</p>
<p>What are the other differences that matter? I'm still waiting. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 00:44, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was merely refering to the Neutrality tag on the aricle, and how I see the best way of coming to a consensus about removing it. I was not trying to imply that my observations were neutral, but I did think that my observations might start a general discussion about how to get a consensus on what changes are required in order to remove the neutrality tag. I am not under the impression that I am any more or less POV than any other editor. I think our main aim at the moment is to remove this tag, and we should be collectively trying to come to a consensus as to how to achieve this. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 14:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is interesting to me about the topic of Black peoples is the ability that we are now gaining to see how people who were black and/or eveolved into the current dark skinned people of Africa moved out and gradually became the rest of us. If that history indeed involves a group that moved north, picked up some northern adaptations and/or random variations, and then moved back and either were still as dark as they are now or else selectively bred back their dark hues, why could they possibly be excluded from this story?</dd>

<dd>Of course that brings up another question: When does a group <b>stop</b> being black? It's completely bonkers to think that moving onto the Arabian peninsula would do it. Would developing the epicanthic fold do it? Would developing a heavy adult tolerance for lactose do it?</dd>

<li>Remove section about Biological definitions. These are no biological definitions, they are "racial" definitions.

The other definitions display the sort of systemic bias that equates Black people with a recent African descent. I suggest these definitions be placed in a section that covers the POV that Black people are always of recent African origin, it is a POV that should be discussed i the article, and these quotes certainly fit that particular POV. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:20, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

At the time he wrote he didn't know that Wells would be able to show a "first wave" migration that went by a peri-tropical route directly to Australia. I'm pretty sure that it is known which groups in present-day Africa are L1, which are L2, and which are L3. By now there should be lots more information. Cavalli-Sforza is getting quite dated.

<dd>If you mean that there is very little real difference on the biological level but huge differences are imputed on that basis, then I have to agree. Someday we will be able to say that after running broad bandwidth comparisons of, e.g., Irish and San genomes, it was discovered that the actual differences amounted to a presence of 99% in San of epicanthic fold vs. .01% in Irish, a .57% presence of red hair among San vs. an 18% presence in Irish..... and nothing that matters much except that the Irish will not walk the Kalahari naked without paying for it.

<li>Blacks as the original race. This section is misleading. I suggest that what we really need to ask is "Were the original anatomically modern humans Black." I think there is enough evidence here, that has been cited on this talk page to conclude that they were, but I also think this fits better in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_skin_colour.html" title="Human skin colour">Human skin colour</a> article.

<dd>If I were to look at this as a scientist, I would say the preponderence of evidence by far is that the original humans were black, or quickly became black in a few generations as they transitioned from some sort of hairy forebearer. Losing fur in the tropics pretty much means that even if your skin is white to start with (which we have no proof of, aside from the white skin of chimpanzees etc, which is no proof at all, really), it will soon have to turn black for you to survive and reproduce. However, I cannot look at this as a scientist with my biases. I know that there are lots of "nuts" in the literature and on this page that claim otherwise. So I think we should least acknowledge that they exist, but I would not write in a balanced way. My bias is that humans were black because of biology and geography and climate. And that is that. It would be very difficult to convince me otherwise. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 02:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we open up the possibility that the "original anatomical modern humans" both were indigenous to Africa and were "not black," then we have a genetic continuum that starts out as "non-black", becomes "black" at some arbitrary point, stays "black" throughout history down to the present, but branches out into "non-black" populations one or more time, etc., etc. That's a very odd, very fuzzy, set. Having it fuzzy on two ends rather than on just one end is not a big deal, but it does give the appearance that it is all smoke and mirrors.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 06:09, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We always return to the problem, race is a social construction and black is so invalid in any real historical context. Ancient Egypt black or white, its more complex than that. Black then or black now? Black if they were in Africa today or Black if they were in America today. All of them black or some of them black. we like to throw everyone in one box. I know Africa is the birth place of fully human people and climite would have made them what we call "black" people today. we know this because African people have the broadest gene pool and there only one way to have such a broad gene pool, to be the source of the gene pool. but it is far more complex than that, and people simplify it to exploit it for all forms of racial agendas, we dont live in an honest society and hence we cannot begin to have an honest discussion on race.

<li>This article should be quite small IMHO. I think all we need to do is explain that generally speaking the term Black people is applied to various different "racial" and "ethnic" groups and that it is sometimes applied only to people with a recent African origin. We do not need, nor should we, go into any rgreat depth regarding the ethnicity of these various groups, we should simply link this article to the various groups. This would allow any reader to easily navigate to more specific articles about the various groups. For example if we link to the article <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Ethiopia_0b8c.html" title="Demographics of Ethiopia">Demographics of Ethiopia</a> a anyone can read about Ethiopian people in detail there. There are also links in this article to the various ethnic groups in Ethiopia.<a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:20, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think all articles should be short, but this does not always happen in practice. We have discarded a huge amount of material that might find a home on the page if we can agree.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I think we should be aiming for something like the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">Briton</a> article. The term Briton is also quite a controversial term, especially for <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_people.html" title="Irish people">Irish people</a> and people living in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

So this article does not try to treat <i>British people</i> as if they are an ethnic or racial group. It simply gives a brief definition in the introduction. It then goes on to list "Common usage" (rather than definitions) and finally has a section about "Sensitivity arount use of the term". I think this sort of short article would be good for this subject. Put the detail in articles that are more specific, like African American or Black British etc. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:20, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This article is quite amorphous. It has no real structure, and does not know what it wants to be. It is neither an article about an ethnic group, nor is it an article about a racial group, though it tries to imply elements of both. I find this quite unsatisfactory. Black people are not any sort of homogeneous ethnic or racial group, and the artificiallity of trying to imply this is evident in the article. The article contradicts itself several times, especially when parts of the article give definitions of Black that clearly include people of non-recent sub-African (or West African) origin, and other sections strongly assume that a recent sub-Saharan/West African origin is essential to be a Black person. This is just confusing. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 07:20, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Over-arching articles need to be in place before we can do a good job of this article. One of the over-arching articles should pertain to the evolutionary/genetic history of Homo sapiens sapiens. Is there currently a strong article on that subject? A second over-arching article should pertain to social construction. Do we have that article? How about articles on Language, on culture, and on ethnicity?</p>
<p>Assuming that all the above articles are in place or could be brought to completion, then we can look at the black peoples of the world. The article on African peoples limits its story to the evolution of humans within the geographical confines of Africa, with a little attention being given to any back-flow of genetic change from areas outside of Africa. The article on Black peoples should then tell the story of how the people that trace their genetic heritage largely to early African sources have gone beyond the geographical confines of Africa.</p>
<p>There have been two main ways that people have left Africa, one was in a series of two migrations fairly near to the dawn of human history. One of the unexpected results of recent genetic research has been that the first migratory wave moved along the ocean edge and ended up in Australia. The people who stayed in the tropics presumably never lost their dark-skin adaptation. The second wave moved farther north and skin color adaptations occurred, making these people other than "black people."</p>
<p>The second main way that people have left Africa has been the slave trade, so we may need to check for adequate canopy articles on slavery, etc.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Can we get rid of the ethiopia "theory"</span></h2>
<p>I must ask that the stuff about Ethiopians being from some strange cluster me moved or deleted, it confuses the discussion, it is an off topic, it is also an exotic view which is nowhere in mainstream thinking. We need to streamline this topic not explore every exotic discussion around blackness. The material discussing who is black (in different parts of the world) is far more critical than an extensive "abstract" study of what race Ethiopian people belong to based on some mad scientist.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halaqah</a> 16:37, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">black Kenyan man picture</span></h2>
<p>It's a great picture, but I don't think it fits perfectly to represent an average black person due to the obvious culture that's also visible in the picture. It isn't shared by every black person on Earth. His cloths and hair (his culture) stands out far more than his race (or skin tone). It would fit more in an article about African lifestyles or something similar to that, but not in such a broad article representing a whole race. Would it be too much to ask for or to provide a better picture that grabs a viewer's focus more on the person's physical appearance rather than his or her cloths or hair style?</p>
<p>I know there are other different pictures, but this one being on top makes it the "main" picture, and I am debating that it should not be. A good one would be a black woman with natural hair wearing no cloths (image cropped to her shoulders...) or any Black person wearing universal cloths like a regular shirt and pants. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.235.81.0_f6f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.235.81.0">68.235.81.0</a> (talk) 16:19, 16 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Yes I agree with you muntu simply means person, and as the majority always view themselves as the normal and the outsiders as different. Therefore in Africa the majority will refer to themselves as people and outsiders will have more specific terms. For instance a possible conversation would be something like</p>

<dd>A similar kind of naming occurred in China of the 12th century. China's equivalent of Thomas Aquinas spoke of "people" (meaning Han Chinese), and "barbarians" (non-Han tribal peoples). He explained the "barbarians" as creatures who were "between humans and animals." Since even Chinese people do not always successfully distinguish between Chinese and, e.g., Japanese, language and other learned behaviors tend to be more important in defining "human" status. Generally, members of the Han Chinese culture are regarded as ethnocentric rather than racist in cases where they discriminate on the basis of group or population membership. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 04:30, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reply: We are all the same BIOLOGICALLY. Yeah we all have different physical attributes than one another. Indians and Chinese men are both Asians, but would you claim the Chinese as more "Asian" because of their eyes? I've seen pictures of Africans with slanted eyes similar to East Asians. It isn't separated by race, you are generalizing.--Bélancourt</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Race" is a word without an agreed-upon definition, so there are potentially as many definitions of "race" as there are humans that have ever existed and will exist. At one extreme, you could use one trait to define a "race." Then you might get a list of all the people with it and all the people without it. At the other extreme, you might include the entire genome for each person as a definition of a race. In that case you would get approximately as many races as there were, are, and will be, human beings. (You'd have to factor out the identical twins.) Add the right trait and two brothers get sorted into different races. Restrict the list of traits to skin color and maybe a couple other things and Swedes and Ainu become members of the same "race."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So the short answer to your question of "how many more races have such unique things?" is: All of them. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 19:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Finding the right spot under the canopy</span></h2>
<p>I will assume that if there are holes in any of the canopies I refer to below then editors will come forth to comment on them, and, hopefully, will patch them in appropriate ways.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for controversy and challenges to the neutrality of this article, implicitly mentioned in the article already, is that "Black people" is a social construct. I cannot think off hand of another category that would seem to have a "label" built right into the "product." If you view "black" as one <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set.html" title="Set">set</a> and "people" as another set, then "black people" ought to be the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersection.html" title="Intersection">intersection</a> of the two sets. As we have seen on this discussion page, people object vehemently to that simplistic view, and do so on various grounds.</p>
<p>The first element of the social construct may be the dark skins of humans who are well adapted to withstand high levels of UV. A "black" skin is the most easily perceived trait of the various groups of people that various observers call "black people." A minor problem with talking about this element is that the <i>de facto</i> definition of the word "black" is different from the definition the word is given in physics. It is helpful to realize that the definition actually used by most people corresponds more closely to what artists who work in oil paints and other such pigments call a "shade," i.e. a "darker shade" of any color on the artist's palette is obtained by mixing in some amount of a truly black substance like carbon black. As observers we are more sure that something is a "shade" of some color when the percentage of black pigment is high, and more doubtful about as sequentially less intense shades of that color are encountered. I would not, for instance, assert with much confidence that some of the photographs of "black" people that Filll provided had black pigment on their palettes. Those people, a very much lighter shade of dark, are accepted by some as "Black people", and yet the same judges may reject much darker people from S.E. Asia, so just discussing the dark skins does not adequately describe what some people mean by "Black people", so we have to take their criteria into account. (Factual component 1: pigments present in the skin.)</p>
<p>The second element of the social construct, at least for many people who use the term "Black people," appears to be close genetic connection to some but not all of the current populations of Africa. Without splitting hairs, it is easy to see what the intent and reasoning is here. The original inhabitants of Africa (L1, L2, and L3) all seem to be accepted as founding populations for the populations that are accepted as "Black Africans" today, and it is membership in the "Black African" family tree that is for many a <i>sine qua non</i> for membership in their version of the "Black people" category. Just as there is a kind of logical fuzziness with the idea of "black" coloration, there is also a kind of logical fuzziness with the idea of membership in the "Black African" family tree. The fundamental question is what status is appropriate for a person one of whose parents descends from a long line of ancestors isolated in "darkest Africa," and the other of whose parents descends from a long line of ancestors from some far part of the world, the Taiwanese aborigines for instance. (Factual component 2: genetic heritage of the individual.)</p>
<p>The third element of the social construct, and one that I haven't mentioned before, is actually a group of <b>learned behaviors</b> -- things such as language, group-specific behavioral cues to group membership (hair styles, affective display conventions, dances and music, etc.). (I am reminded of being with my friends, the owners of a fruit stand in Taipei, their kids, and some of their frequent customers, when an American-born Chinese was being interviewed in Chinese on Chinese TV. His Mandarin was good, but his body language was totally aberrant--for a Chinese--because he was gesticulating "wildly" as any American teenager might. My friends seemed torn between being highly amused and being creeped out. I had the flip side of that experience one time watching a teenager approach a low-rise apartment building on a bike. I assumed he was an "Army brat" who was far off course and I was just speculating how a kid could get ten miles off course on a three-speed bike when he jumped off his bike and shouted toward a third-floor window, "Mama, wo hui lai le!" (Mom. I'm back!) He suddenly went from what he looked like (typical American teenager) to what he sounded like (typical Chinese teenager). He continued to <b>look</b> American, but I could tell in an instant that he hadn't been raised that way. Chinese people going back to around 200 BC would have predicted just this result whenever a "barbarian" child is raised in a Chinese household, or vice-versa. Just read Xun Zi.) (Factual component 3: ethnic heritage of the individual.)</p>
<p>Unless somebody can point out how these three factors fail the test of fairness in explaining how various groups conceptualize "Black people," I am going to add something to the intro paragraph to indicate that "Black people" is a family of concepts that involves a certain range of skin pigmentation, a certain range of genetic heritage, and a collection of ethnicities. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 07:11, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Bible's role in defining blacks?</span></h2>
<p>The Biblical section in question does not "define" blacks. It is important that what Genesis 9 actually says is presented. The section has plenty of info about what other groups or doctrines claim but what is the detail of the Biblical narrative itself? This info is directly relevant because Genesis makes no definition of blacks based on skin color or race. This is in contrast to assorted teachings that attempt to impose some racial hierarchy on the ancient narrative, but it contains no such hierarchies for 2 reeasons: (a) the "curse of Ham" relates to a prediction that was to befall certain Caananite peoples- conquest by ex-slaves out of Egypt. It does not mention any blacks or slavery at all. (b) As for the supposed inferiority of the Hamitic peoples, the Biblical narrative suggests the direct opposite. The highly civilized Egyptians, the powerful empire builder Nimrod of Cush, and the sophiscated urban and trade civilization of certain Caananite peoples clearly demolish any such claims. A lot of info on the section deals bounces back and forth with a wide range of scattered statements, like Jehovah Witness doctrine. The detail of the "original" source narrative needs to be clearly stated and presented before launching into these scattered fragments. Also, the book- Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times (referenced in the article) provides scholarly background, and discusses traditional peoples and their associations- such as Mizraim (Egypt) Cush (Ethiopia, Sheba, Seba, Yemen) plus Libya, and Caanan (today's Palestine).<a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnriquecardova_b15b.html" title="User:Enriquecardova">Enriquecardova</a> 09:28, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is true that other information in the section runs afield. I am trying to pare it down to what is directly relevant to defining (or not defining) "Black people."

<dd>The article should tell the reader about the claim that race is defined in the bible, who makes the claim, and what evidence the claim rests on.

<dd>Agreed as to all the various views, but I think it is directly relevant to note clearly what the Biblical passages in question state or don't state. It is not a question of balancing various theologial views, but of the plain statement of the passages. Right now that is not as clearly stated as it should be and we have a number of other scattered items in there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Different human traits associated with indigenous "Black" people</span></h2>
<p>I found an informative and very well researched study based on physical characteristics of all human types in general; and the following link is a page mostly based on those defined universally as Blacks. Since we can't copy the image and use it here, I think we can get ideas out of it, and maybe use real photos rather than drawings if possible. I don't want to recommend linking to it since it would seem more like a free advertisement of it because this isn't exactly an official website based on that sort of stuff. Anyway here it is:</p>

<dd>Interesting. Joumana has certainly done her homework, but nevertheless its original research, and not particularily relevant here. It may not be her intention, but her assumptions come forth as an attempt at <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_racism.html" title="Scientific racism">scientific racism</a>. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 10:53, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
