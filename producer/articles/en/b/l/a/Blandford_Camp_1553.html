<p>There are numerous <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prehistory.html" title="Prehistory">prehistoric</a> sites within the camp boundaries, but the first recorded use of the site was as a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horseracing_in_the_United_Kingdom_63ab.html" title="Horseracing in the United Kingdom">racecourse</a>, giving rise to the naming of part of the area as <b>Race Down</b>. Race meetings began in the late <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> and an annual race week was held until the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is thought that the area has been used by military forces for many centuries but the first definite use of the site was in the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> when local volunteer units used it as a training ground. In addition, in <a href="../../../1/7/2/1724.html" title="1724">1724</a> a troop of the <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hussar.html" title="Hussar">Hussars</a> were stationed in the area for anti-<a href="../../../s/m/u/Smuggling.html" title="Smuggling">smuggling</a> duties.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>With the outbreak of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> a large number of <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Naval_Reserve_4a0f.html" title="Royal Naval Reserve">Royal Naval reservists</a> were called for full-time service, in excess of the numbers required to man ships. It was therefore decided that a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Naval_Division_ca77.html" title="Royal Naval Division">Royal Naval Division</a> would be formed to augment the army divisions. After its initial action in the front line in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, the Division returned to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> and established a base depot and training camp at Blandford. A German <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">POW</a> camp was also set up alongside it.</p>
<p>The RN Division had battalions named after the former naval officers <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Drake_386b.html" title="Francis Drake">Drake</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Nelson%2C_1st_Viscount_Nelson_5aea.html" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Nelson</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Benbow_eec2.html" title="John Benbow">Benbow</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hawke%2C_1st_Baron_Hawke_3c91.html" title="Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke">Hawke</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Hood%2C_1st_Viscount_Hood_af9a.html" title="Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood">Hood</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Howe%2C_1st_Earl_Howe_2214.html" title="Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe">Howe</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Anson%2C_1st_Baron_Anson_251b.html" title="George Anson, 1st Baron Anson">Anson</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthbert_Collingwood%2C_1st_Baron_Collingwood_3323.html" title="Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood">Collingwood</a>, and the various encampments at Blandford took these names. Instruction on trench construction and trench warfare was carried out within the camp area and traces of the Royal Naval Division trenches can still be seen in the area beyond Drake East Lines.</p>
<p>The men of the Division left Blandford Camp to embark on the ill-fated <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> operation.

<p>During <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> the camp changed from being the depot for the Royal Naval Division to being an 'Intake Camp' for the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> which was at that time being reformed as the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>, and a branch railway line was built to bring materials and personnel to the camp. The railway was linked with the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_and_Dorset_Joint_Railway_7166.html" title="Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway">Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway</a> line immediately south of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blandford_Forum_railway_station_2ef2.html" title="Blandford Forum railway station">Blandford Forum railway station</a> and there was a daily passenger service to bring civilian staff to the camp from <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth.html" title="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> and the villages in between. At the end of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, however, the camp was closed and both the wooden huts built for the RN Division and the camp's railway line were removed. By the end of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> the site had been returned to agricultural use.</p>

<p>With the build up of tension leading up to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, the camp was reactivated in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> as a <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobilization.html" title="Mobilization">mobilization</a> and training centre for <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reservist.html" title="Reservist">reservists</a>, with a new wooden hutted camp being built on the sites of the RN Division encampments. There are still a few huts from the 1939 camp remaining, these being in Drake East Lines and in the Benbow Lines.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Battle of France">fall of France</a> the British Army went through a period of reorganisation, and anti-aircraft units of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Artillery_85a7.html" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> trained on the site, as well as a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> battalion of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Northumberland_Fusiliers_1b8e.html" title="Royal Northumberland Fusiliers">Royal Northumberland Fusiliers</a>.

Each unit spent a month carrying out intensive training prior to being sent to a combat area such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_African_campaign_8953.html" title="North African campaign">North Africa</a>, or preparing for the planned <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>.</p>

<p>Since, once the invasion of Europe was underway, Blandford Camp would no longer be required as a training camp, it was decided to convert the camp into a <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._First_Army_6608.html" title="U.S. First Army">US Army</a> hospital complex and, in April 1944, the first of five US Army general hospitals was established. The hospitals started receiving patients about two weeks after <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">D-Day</a> and many were brought from the combat area via the wartime <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbase.html" title="Airbase">airfield</a> at <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarrant_Rushton_ebbd.html" title="Tarrant Rushton">Tarrant Rushton</a>. The hospitals were often working at full capacity and receiving as many as 500 <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casualty_%28person%29.html" title="Casualty (person)">casualties</a> during one night. The hospital complex closed after <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory_in_Europe_Day_1c6a.html" title="Victory in Europe Day">VE Day</a> and the majority of the staff returned to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a> during October <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> Garden and Memorial were dedicated on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_30.html" title="May 30">30 May</a> 1945 in the camp, and a memorial service is held there annually in November in remembrance of those who died.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, <b>30 Signal Regiment</b> moved into the camp from <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Wallop_d5c6.html" title="Middle Wallop">Middle Wallop</a>. Blandford was then selected to be the future home of the School of Signals (then at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catterick_Garrison_3867.html" title="Catterick Garrison">Catterick</a>) and the present-day camp was planned.</p>
<p>The School of Signals (now the <b>Royal School of Signals</b>) moved in in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, to be responsible for all management and technical courses for <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Signals_07a9.html" title="Royal Signals">Royal Signals</a> Officers and NCOs.

<p>In the early 1990s, under the Government's '<a href="../../../o/p/t/Options_for_Change_9ff2.html" title="Options for Change">Options for Change</a>' initiatives, DADPTC moved to <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrivenham.html" title="Shrivenham">Shrivenham</a> and 30 Signal Regiment moved to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bramcote.html" title="Bramcote">Bramcote</a> to make way in 1995 for Royal Signals soldier training to be moved from Catterick Camp. The Headquarters of the Corps also came to the site from London. All special-to-arm training is now carried out with <b>11 Signal Regiment</b> at Blandford.</p>
