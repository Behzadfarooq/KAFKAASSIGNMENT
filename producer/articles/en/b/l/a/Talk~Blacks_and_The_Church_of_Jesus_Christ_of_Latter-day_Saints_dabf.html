<p>I may be biased (I'm attempting Good Faith here, so my intentions are good... I hope), but outside of the very generous Mormons that I've met here in Puerto Rico (either native Puerto Ricans or missionaries from abroad) and at Temple Square in Salt Lake City when I visited (extremely nice, I should add), at one time I had to interface with various members of the Church, whose ideas on multiculturalism were, uh, negative, to say the least. Two particular women that I met were brutally (and stupidly) racist. Somehow I sense that in Mormon culture, racism is a taboo topic. Of course, reporting on this on a Wiki topic is a NPOV minefield, but I sense that, somehow, the topic has to be addressed beyond what is official LDS church policy. Any comment? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemf_1aef.html" title="User:Demf">Demf</a> 01:09, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I imagine there might be as many opinions among "the flock" as there are members of said flock. Racism is a very touchy topic everywhere in the United States. The LDS community is no exception. My own personal experience mirrors yours a bit.
<ul>
<li>When I lived among Latter-day Saints abroad (Venezuela) I encountered almost no racism. The members were very proud of their "Lamanite" heritage, and very little if anything was said about blacks or the former policy of exclusion.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I grew up in a <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sundown_town.html" title="Sundown town">Sundown town</a> in Southwestern Lower Michigan. The Latter-day Saints there found the topic of racial exclusion very interesting and noteworthy and discussed it at length, presumably because it reinforced their own opinions that blacks should be kept separate from whites.</li>
<li>I have also heard reports from North Carolina that no such nonsense exists among the members. All the hardcore racists left the Church in 1978, so the congregations there are the most integrated anywhere.</li>
<li>While "Western" Saints are the most likely to keep their children home from camping trips if there is any chance they might share a tent with a black child.</li>
<li>I also heard a story about a white high school student dating a black student. A fellow ward member asked another how she felt about that: she replied: "Fine, he's a member of the Church after all."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In short, I believe the answer to your question is an interesting one, well worth the time and energy of research, but I'm not aware of any research that has been done. I have only anecdotal hearsay, but if you find any comparative study of LDS racial opinions, I totally think that we should include it somehow.--<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a> 18:15, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll tell you where this all stems from. Joseph Smith was given a revelation to not let the "Blacks" have the priesthood. He then told the Church this and gave no supporting explanation other than "thus saith the Lord." The general membership and many of the leadership have tried over the years to back it up with some scriptural reference giving rise to the lame Cain &amp; Ham theories. The truth is the people were weak and could not handle the higher law and God gave them a lesser law. When the people as a whole could handle the higher law the lesser law was repealed. --Evan Davis 23:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to see more citation. I am reading Rough Stone Rolling, and there is a ton of great information there. I would like to see Joseph Smith's history with blacks cited and fleshed out more, particularly with their issues with local government, and how the church was basically neutral, and then had to present themselves as not supporting freedom for slaves, more for their own survival and peace with their neighbors. Remember, they were being forced out of their homes and their very survival depended on good ties with their non-mormon neighbors. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 07:02, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wherever you would like to see a citation, place a '''{{fact}}''' tag. The section on Joseph Smith is at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacks_and_Mormonism_f4a0.html" title="Blacks and Mormonism">Blacks and Mormonism</a>. I think you've found it already. It's a mess. I think it has had many contributors and it needs a lot of clean up. It's completely disjointed. I started on such a project once, but I became overwhelmed. I, for one, would appreciate you're input. On the other hand, I reject the theory that the Saints adopted a racist policy in order to get along with their neighbors, in part, because it didn't work. They were not racists enough to get along with Missourians. I believe they remained true to their own feelings against slavery while simultaneously remaining true to their feelings of racial superiority. In other words, they didn't think that blacks should be slaves, but they were obviously inferior, very complicated, but there is good evidence to suggest that Joseph began maturing away from this position while he lived in Nauvoo. Also remember that a person could oppose both slavery and abolition at the same time. Abolition called for the immediate release of all slaves. This terrified many people who called for granting freedom to the slaves in a more orderly and gradual manner. -<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a> 19:04, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"African Americans have long suffered from racist laws and policies in the United States."</p>
<p>I'm removing this sentence because it makes an unfounded and inappropriate connection between the United States and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. No evidence is given that the church's policy was determined by popular policies in the United States or polices or laws of the United States government. Furthermore, the church's policy had a wider application than just the United States.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The connection is simply that fact the policy was established by citizens of the United States. Policy makers were victims of their own cultural upbringing. Although the policy was applied to persons outside the United States, they were a tiny minority. It was the growth of this minority which directly lead to the appeal of this policy. -<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErinHowarth_2473.html" title="User:ErinHowarth">ErinHowarth</a> 21:56, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that the sentence that has been removed is valuable and does make an appropriate connection between the US socio-political climate and the LDS, a point repeated made by Mormons commenting on their former anti-black position. It makes very clear the 1978 decision as being part of the evolution of the church in keeping up with the times and society at large and actually places the LDS in the mainstream of American culture and religious thought.

<p>Fundamentalist is a term used for a particular kind of biblical exegesis, and is rooted heavily in the debate with modernism, it is absolutely the wrong word to use for the "Southern fundamentalists", as it is for any group that existed before the 1920s. I suggest finding another, more accurate word. Demagogues? Conservatives? Anyway, "Fundamentalism" didn't exist yet. Also, if you're tempted to use evangelical, I would also guess that is again absolutely the wrong word (and they are not nearly synonymous).</p>

<p>The way much of the piece reads, it seems to be from the POV of believers in the Mormon faith.

Other sects have had a very differing view of Blacks over time. Thus this article should provide a much broader view into the LDS church's views on blacks over their 180 year history. I think the article is supposed to read that there was a ban from about 1848-1978, but church leaders knew it was temporary. Most leaders taught that the ban would one day be lifted - whereas other denomoniations (baptist, penecostal, etc) that belived in the "curse of ham" or "curse of cain" believed that the curse was permannet. This is an imporant distinction as most would natually assume the permanency, not the temporary nature told by church leaders. The article no doubt needs work. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 20:00, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The second paragraph is very POV. Someone should edit it to reflect that this is the Mormon philosophy on the previous stance regarding black priests so that it doesn't seem like Wikipedia is interpreting why God allowed these things etc. etc. 69.136.61.68 02:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I entered the second paragraph. It is the actual belief of the Church and fits with all established doctrine. I would like to leave it there, but I agree with your last statement and I am unsure at this point in how to best objectify it. I made a quick fix and would appreciate help. --Evan Davis 23:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
