<p><i>The structure of the show is being criticized for a number of reasons:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Both families are supposed to be representative of their respective races. Whatever the white family says or does is supposed to be the "white" way and whatever the black family says or does is supposed to be the "black" way. Furthermore, whatever each family claims about their race is taken to be true of all members of that race. This model fails to take into account differences among individuals. Whatever one family (or an individual within the family) does or says varies significantly from family to family (and from person to person). And whatever claim they make about their race is nothing more than their own opinion and not true of all (or even a majority) of the population.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Both families must live with each other and any conflict that arises between them is automatically assumed to be on racial grounds. As with the previous criticism, this model fails to take into account differences among individuals. Not all people between racial groups or within racial groups will be able to live successfully with one another. These conflicts are caused by simple differences in lifestyle that vary from individual to individual.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The show fails to point out the effect of extraneous factors on human behavior, such as the fact that a camera crew will sometimes follow the families around as they "experience" being a member of the other race. Being filmed tends to cause people to act differently, and so it could be with the people they encounter. This makes any judgment of those people's level of racism (or lack thereof) difficult to ascertain.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>While the show doesn't claim to be scientific, they explicitly lack control experiments. As individuals "experience" being a member of the other race, they don't first go out being a member of their original race. So if a participant is treated well or bad as a member of another race, they have no basis for comparison of what they would have experienced as a member of their original race.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>The show is edited only to show contention between the races. While there are certainly time constraints on how much can be aired per episode, the viewer doesn't see the bulk of what actually happens. For example, in the first episode when Brian is a bartender we are shown a segment of a white man making a racist rant about how the neighborhood is nice and quiet because it is majority white. We are not shown any other interaction with customers for the many hours Brian is there. There could be many more moments of non-racist customers that represent the majority of the population.</i></li>
</ul>

This whole section is entirely POV. It must be NPOV to comply with Wikipedia policy. Without proper citation of an official source of the opinion, it cannot be used. Furthermore, the other two sections below this section (on the article page) are still questionable, even with their proper citation. Anyone who reads that section above wouldn't know if it was just some Wikipedian with a strong opinion on the matter or a writer for Time. Either way, Wikipepdia is not the place for POV. This topic is naturally subjective, but that does not excuse it from NPOV policy. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilhelm_Screamer_17e0.html" title="User:Wilhelm Screamer">Wilhelm Screamer</a> 07:25, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Original research is a term used on Wikipedia to refer to material added to articles by Wikipedia editors that has not been published already by a reputable source. In this context it means unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, and ideas; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments that, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a 'novel narrative or historical interpretation'."</p>

<dd>Unless someone can provide a reference for this show being scripted, please keep it out of the article. The fact that some of the cast members have had acting parts does not mean that the show is scripted or otherwise faked. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 03:00, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the show scripted? If it's not, then the article shouldn't say that it is. 75.2.221.50 11:08, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would agree for the fact that much of the show is scripted/staged much like many other reality television shows. One thing many people don't think of is the cameras themselves being there. For example, woundn't any of the "regular" people on the show (teens from Roses poetry class/Teens from Nicks etiquette class) be somewhat curious as to why these people are carrying cameras around? Also there was the thing about Bruno and Rose's acting backgrounds. Are they even related?208.25.198.231 14:39, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
