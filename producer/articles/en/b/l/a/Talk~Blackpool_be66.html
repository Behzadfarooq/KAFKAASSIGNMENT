<p>Some of the names listed are very tentatively linked. Roy Walker's from Blackpool because he's appeared on the pier? I'm considering making the list exclusive only to those born in the town. - <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudesleeper_55a1.html" title="User:Dudesleeper">Dudesleeper</a> 13:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree Roy Walker is not "from" Blackpool. He does live in the area though (Lytham) which may have given rise to the idea that he's from Blackpool. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelovedfreak_145c.html" title="User:Belovedfreak">Belovedfreak</a> 7 November 2006</p>
<p>Making the list exclusive to only those born in the town would be a mistake in my opinion as it would exclude then numerous people who, although they were not born in Blackpool were brought up in the town and consider themselves to be Sand Grown 'Uns. For instance the Nolans - only one of the original 5 sisters were (I think) born in Blackpool, yet at least one of them was only a baby when the family moved to Blackpool in the early 1960's and was brought up in the town. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangerines_d3a3.html" title="User:Tangerines">Tangerines</a> 00:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the page called Blackpool should lead you to the disambiguation page, and this page Blackpool, England should be renamed as such.

<li>Seeing that 'South Shore' is part of Blackpool (not Blackpool 'Borough', just Blackpool) and the fact that the parts of the South Shore that make it notable ie. South Pier, Pleasure Beach, Sandcastle, Blackpool Football Club etc. are already included in the Blackpool article, then yes, they should be merged.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Disagree</b> do not merge. There are other areas of Blackpool listed separately on Wikipedia. South Shore is just the same as say <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layton%2C_Blackpool_fbaf.html" title="Layton, Blackpool">Layton, Blackpool</a>. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangerines_d3a3.html" title="User:Tangerines">Tangerines</a> 00:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, merge. As a native of South Shore, I think it doesn't have a distinct identity; only a local would know or care where it turned into Central or Marton, and it is a lot simpler for the reader to find everything under Blackpool. The South Shore page is also very limited in and of itself - poor grammar, not much content, not a lot to stand alone on. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_Farrell_a510.html" title="User:Andy Farrell">Andy Farrell</a> 17:22, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Shore%2C_Blackpool_a961.html" title="South Shore, Blackpool">South Shore, Blackpool</a> article is not at present particularly well written though, (and it is pretty poor to be honest) is not justification for it to be merged with this page. It is a definite reason for it to be improved yes, but not merged. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangerines_d3a3.html" title="User:Tangerines">Tangerines</a> 17:46, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Additional Comment</b> I have also just found a Blackpool article on the GENUKI (Geneaology UK &amp; Ireland) website which has the following entries - "1819 - A man named Thomas Moore built the first houses at South Shore." and "1836 South Shore Parish Church (Holy Trinity) erected." Those entries alone would surely suffice to keep South Shore as it is now, in the same manner that other areas of Blackpool have pages.

<p>I'd like to contest the fact that residents of Blackpool are known as 'Sand Growns'. I've lived here all my life and have never heard that term used.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I live in St Annes and have heard the term "sandgrown'un" used to refer specifically to residents of the Moss as it was in previous decades. A better term might be Blackpudlian but I've not heard that used much either (not by locals anyhow).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have lived in South Shore up until I moved to Birmingham to attend University in September 2005, and have always considered myself a "Sandgrown'un". When I moved to Birmingham and met other people, I told them I was from Blackpool, several people pointed out that I was Sandgrown'un. Clearly, it's not only Blackpool citizens that associate the term "Sand Grown" with us.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sand Grown 'Un s is a common Blackpool term, and is not anything to be contested as it is fact that the term is used to describe those born on The Fylde Coast (as opposed to just Blackpool, but it is also used for those born in Blackpool). It is correct to say that residents of Blackpool are not Sand Grown as it is only those born here. I was born here and consider myself a Sand Grown 'Un. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETangerines_d3a3.html" title="User:Tangerines">Tangerines</a> 20:33, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I grew up in Blackpool as did the maternal side of my family and "Sandgrown'un" was (and is) commonly used. Blackpudlian was not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Blackpudlian sounds more like someone who would eat <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_sausage.html" title="Blood sausage">black puddings</a>. I was brought up in Bolton, but I have relatives who live in Blackpool who used to run various guest houses: they have heard people use the term "sandgrown'un", but only visitors.
