<p>The film opens at night with a small party occurring in a sorority house for a private school. A man is shown entering the house through the open attic window. We are introduced to all of the girls in the sorority house, the main ones being Jess (Olivia Hussey), the heroine of the film, Barb (Margot Kidder), a drunken loud mouth, and Phyllis (Andrea Martin), Jess' friend and the peace keeper of the group. The girls have been receiving mysterious phonecalls from someone they call "The Moaner". The calls start out sexual in nature, but they gradually grow more <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macabre.html" title="Macabre">macabre</a>, with the man on the other end saying strange things in different voices.</p>
<p>The shyest sorority girl, Clare (Lynne Griffin), goes upstairs to pack, and when she goes into the closet, the man dives out and wraps a plastic bag around her head, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphyxiating.html" title="Asphyxiating">asphyxiating</a> her. He then drags her into the attic, and puts her in a rocking chair by the window. The next day, Clare's father (James Edmond) comes to pick her up, but nobody knows where she is. It becomes a mystery as the police search for the missing Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. MacHenry (Marian Waldman), the house mother, stumbles upon the killer while searching for her cat in the attic and gets a <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifting_hook.html" title="Lifting hook">crane hook</a> in the face.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jess admits to her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) that she is pregnant, but she's having an <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. He begins to act strange, and shows off some anger problems. As Barb and Phyl are murdered by the killer, Jess gets another call. The police trace the call and realize that they are coming from in the house (the telephone in Mrs. Mac's room) and warn Jess to leave the house immediately and wait for them outside. Instead of going out, Jess goes upstairs with a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireplace_poker.html" title="Fireplace poker">fireplace poker</a> and is attacked by the killer. She manages to escape and heads to the basement. There she runs into Peter, who she now believes is the killer. He approaches her to talk, but Jess kills him with the poker.</p>
<p>The police arrive and feel the case is closed, and leave the house, leaving Jess alone to sleep off the excitement. Then as the camera shows the house we get to see the attic one last time and see that the two dead bodies have not been discovered. We hear a man say, "Agnes, it's me, Billy." As the credits begin to roll, we hear the phone ring more than once again.</p>

<p>Working from a budget of $620,000 and an eight week shooting schedule, the film was shot in 35mm format utilizing Panavision cameras and lenses in and around <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> during the winter of 1974. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annesley_Hall_7c24.html" title="Annesley Hall">Annesley Hall National Historic Site</a> was used for some scenes. When originally released in the United States, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, fearing that audiences might confuse it for a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaxploitation.html" title="Blaxploitation">blaxploitation</a> movie, changed the title to <i>Silent Night, Evil Night</i>. It performed poorly until its title was changed back to <i>Black Christmas</i>. It was later retitled <i>Stranger in the House</i> for television broadcast.</p>
<p>Though <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carpenter_cfa6.html" title="John Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>'s <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film%29.html" title="Halloween (film)">Halloween</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_in_film.html" title="1978 in film">1978</a>) is generally credited with popularizing the main motifs of the contemporary <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slasher_film.html" title="Slasher film">slasher film</a> genre, many genre aficionados contend that <i>Black Christmas</i> invented many of them four years earlier. For example, the film features shots from the perspective of the killer, replete with muffled breathing noises. Also, like <i>Halloween</i>, it is centered around a holiday.</p>
<p>Upon it's original release, the film did well in comparison to its budget, grossing $4,053,000 in the USA alone. Critic's reviews were mixed, for example, <i><a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28magazine%29.html" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> felt the film was heavily cliched and that "Black Christmas, a bloody, senseless kill-for-kicks feature, exploits unnecessary violence in a university sorority house operated by an implausibly alcoholic ex-hoofer. Its slow-paced, murky tale involves an obscene telephone caller who apparently delights in killing the girls off one by one, even the hapless house-mother."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Eclectic DVD has released two editions of <i>Black Christmas</i>. The first was a bare-bones release that hit shelves on November 6, 2001. This was then followed by a collector's edition released on December 3, 2002, that featured a making-of documentary and two commentary tracks (some of the commentary material was obviously taken from interviews for the documentary), among other features. On December 5, 2006, Critical Mass released a new "special edition" disc that offers a featurette titled "The Twelve Days of Black Christmas" and two deleted sound scenes, in addition to interviews with Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder and clips from a Q&amp;A sessions at a midnight screening with the makers of <i>Black Christmas</i>.</p>

<li>First horror film to use the "the calls are coming from inside the house" plotline. Later used in <i><a href="../../../w/h/e/When_a_Stranger_Calls_%281979_film%29_2485.html" title="When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)">When a Stranger Calls</a></i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Saxon_%28actor%29_b4ef.html" title="John Saxon (actor)">John Saxon</a>'s scenes were filmed separately from the leads, yet they appear to be in the same room.</li>

<li>Originally scripted as <i>The Babysitter</i>, the title was changed to <i>Stop Me</i>, and eventually produced as <i>Black Christmas</i>.</li>
<li>The original script was written by Canadian Roy Moore who had read about a similar story happening in major cities around the world in a 12 month period. This was never proven. Apparently the Westmount section of Montreal was the closest story to home.</li>
<li>Director Bob Clark, in the <i>On Screen</i> documentary, claims that he came up with the basic idea of <i>Halloween</i> (including its title) as a hypothetical sequel to <i>Black Christmas</i>; he later gave the idea to John Carpenter.</li>
