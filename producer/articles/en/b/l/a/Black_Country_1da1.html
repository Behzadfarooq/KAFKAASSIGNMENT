<p>The bounds of the Black Country, however, are controversial, and the whole of Wolverhampton is included by some and none at all by others. Birmingham is most definitely <i>not</i> in the Black Country. The usual 21st century definition of the Black Country, are the four metropolitan Boroughs of <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley_%28borough%29.html" title="Dudley (borough)">Dudley</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandwell.html" title="Sandwell">Sandwell</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walsall_%28borough%29.html" title="Walsall (borough)">Walsall</a> and the City of <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton.html" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>. The town of <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley.html" title="Dudley">Dudley</a> is sometimes referred to as being the Black Country's (unofficial) capital.</p>
<p>An older one defines it by the extent of the coalfield, as bounded by the eastern and western boundary faults and on the north by the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bentley.html" title="Bentley">Bentley</a> fault (which divides the south Staffordshire coalfield from the adjoining <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannock_Chase_524d.html" title="Cannock Chase">Cannock Chase</a> coalfield. Near <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halesowen.html" title="Halesowen">Halesowen</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stourbridge.html" title="Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a>, the coal seams outcropped, providing a southern boundary. On this basis parts of <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton.html" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stourbridge.html" title="Stourbridge">Stourbridge</a> are not part of the Black Country.</p>
<p>A useful guide for outsiders is to regard the <a href="../../../m/5/_/M5_motorway.html" title="M5 motorway">M5 motorway</a> as the eastern boundary, but this is only approximately correct, as <a href="../../../s/m/e/Smethwick.html" title="Smethwick">Smethwick</a> is to the east of it, and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walsall.html" title="Walsall">Walsall</a> lies north of the junction with <a href="../../../m/6/_/M6_motorway.html" title="M6 motorway">M6 motorway</a>.</p>
<p>The Black Country has coalesced into a single conurbation, but is unusual in that it has no single centre, having grown up from a number of historic market towns and industrial villages that have coalesced during the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>. It remains essentially polyfocal with many of the towns and villages remaining recognisable communities and in some cases resenting having been subsumed into a metropolitan borough whose centre is elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Black Country lies wholly within the West Midlands County, but was formerly divided between the ancient counties of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire.html" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcestershire.html" title="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>. Curiously, the ancient parish (and pre-1965 municipal borough) of Dudley was once a detached part of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcestershire.html" title="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a> within <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire.html" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> and some still consider Dudley to be Dudley, Worcs. Even more strangely until <a href="../../../1/8/4/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a> much of the parish of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halesowen.html" title="Halesowen">Halesowen</a>, including <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldbury%2C_West_Midlands_2d12.html" title="Oldbury, West Midlands">Oldbury</a> and Warley Salop (but not <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cradley.html" title="Cradley">Cradley</a> or Warley Wigorn) was a detached part of Shropshire.</p>
<p>The Black Country comprises parts of the city of Wolverhampton, and the towns of:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Country_1da1.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Industrialisation in the Black Country goes far back. It was already an area where metal working was important as far back as the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>, due to the presence of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> ore and of <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> in a seam 30 feet (about 9 metres) thick, the thickest seam in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, which outcropped in various places. Many people had an agricultural smallholding and supplemented their income by working as nailers or smiths, an example of a phenomenon known to economic historians as proto-industrialisation.</p>
<p>By the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> or early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, many villages had their characteristic manufacture, but earlier occupations were less concentrated. Some of these concentrations are less ancient than sometimes supposed. For example, chain making in Cradley Heath seems only to have begun in about the <a href="../../../1/8/2/1820s.html" title="1820s">1820s</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/y/e/Lye.html" title="Lye">Lye</a> holloware industry is even more recent.</p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limestone.html" title="Limestone">limestone</a> were worked only on a modest scale for local consumption, but during the Industrial Revolution by the opening of canals, such as the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham_Canal_Navigations_9874.html" title="Birmingham Canal Navigations">Birmingham Canal Navigations</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stourbridge_Canal_5bfa.html" title="Stourbridge Canal">Stourbridge Canal</a> and the <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley_Canal_e609.html" title="Dudley Canal">Dudley Canal</a> (the Dudley Canal Line No 1 and the <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley_Tunnel_67cd.html" title="Dudley Tunnel">Dudley Tunnel</a>) opened up the mineral wealth of the area to exploitation. Advances in the use of <a href="../../../c/o/k/Coke_%28fuel%29.html" title="Coke (fuel)">coke</a> for the production in iron enabled iron production (hitherto limited by the supply of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charcoal.html" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a> to expand rapidly).</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> times, the Black Country was one of the most heavily industrialised areas in Britain, and it became known for its <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a>, particularly from <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> and coal industries and their many associated smaller businesses.</p>
<p>The area soon gained notoriety. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>'s novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Old_Curiosity_Shop_86f6.html" title="The Old Curiosity Shop">The Old Curiosity Shop</a></i>, written in 1841, described how the area's local factory chimneys <i>"Poured out their plague of smoke, obscured the light, and made foul the melancholy air".</i> In 1862, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elihu_Burritt_02da.html" title="Elihu Burritt">Elihu Burritt</a>, the American Consul to Birmingham, described the region as <i>"black by day and red by night"</i>, because of the smoke and grime generated by the intense manufacturing activity and the glow from furnaces at night.</p>
<p>The area is popularly said to have got its name because of pollution from these heavy industries, which covered the area in black soot and led to the name of <i>The Black Country</i>. There is a famous but dubious anecdote about Queen Victoria ordering the blinds lowered on her carriage as the royal train passed through the area. However, historians have suggested that it is more likely that the name was given earlier, arising from above-ground outcroppings of black coal seams that scarred the early heathland. Also, the coal seam just below the surface meant the soil in the area was very black.</p>

<p>It is said that <a href="../../../j/2E/r/J.R.R._Tolkien_b884.html" title="J.R.R. Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a> based the grim region of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordor.html" title="Mordor">Mordor</a> on the heavily industrialized Black Country area in his famed novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>. Indeed, in the Elvish <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindarin.html" title="Sindarin">Sindarin</a> language, <i>Mor-Dor</i> means <i>Dark</i> (or <i>Black</i>) <i>Land</i>, and is sometimes even referred to within the novel as "The Black Country".</p>
<p><br />
The anchors and chains for the ill fated liner Titanic were manufactured in the Black Country in the area of Netherton. 3 anchors and accompanying chains were manufactured and the set weighed in at 100 tons. The centre anchor alone weighed 12 tons and was pulled through Netherton on its journey to the ship by 20 shire horses.</p>

<p>The heavy industry which once dominated the Black Country has now largely gone. Mining ceased in the area in the late 1960s, and clean air legislation has meant that the Black Country is no longer black. The area still maintains some manufacturing, but on a much smaller scale than historically.</p>
<p>Much but not all of the area now suffers from high <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> and is amongst the most economically deprived communities in the UK; this is particularly true in Sandwell, and to a lesser extent Wolverhampton. As with many urban areas in England, there is also a significant ethnic minority population in parts; resistance to mass immigration in the 1960s and 1970s led to the slogan "<i>Keep the Black Country white!</i>".</p>
<p>The "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Country_Living_Museum_a4fc.html" title="Black Country Living Museum">Black Country Living Museum</a>" (see below), in Dudley, re-creates life in the Black Country in the early 20th century, and is a popular <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tourist_attraction.html" title="Tourist attraction">tourist attraction</a>.</p>

<p>The traditional Black Country dialect preserves many archaic traits of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Modern_English_6203.html" title="Early Modern English">Early Modern English</a> and even <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_English_5313.html" title="Middle English">Middle English</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>, and can be very confusing for outsiders. Thee, Thy and Thou are still in use. "'Ow B'ist", meaning "How beist thou?" is a common greeting, with the typical answering being "'Bay too bah", meaning "I bayn't be too bad". "I haven't seen her" becomes "I ay sid 'er". Black Country dialect often substitutes the word "ar" for "yes". It must be made note of that only certain phrases of these apply to the entire considered Black Country, most refer to the Dudley area.</p>
<p>Inhabitants are proud to be known as Black Country "folk" and resist hints at any relationship to people living in Birmingham, calling Birmingham "Brum-a-jum" (Birmingham's colloquial name is Brummagem, a corruption of its older name of Bromwicham - and hence West Bromwich). Residents of Birmingham (Brummies) meanwhile often refer to their Black Country neighbours as "Yam Yams", a reference to the use of "Yow am" instead of "You are".</p>
<p>The strong Black Country dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past.</p>
<p>As the image shows, a road sign contained the local dialect was placed at the <a href="../../../a/4/6/A461.html" title="A461">A461</a>/A459/A4037 junction in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> before the construction of a traffic island on the site.
