<p>A large area of Northern Montana was set aside for Indian use by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Fort_Laramie_%281851%29_d45c.html" title="Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)">Fort Laramie Treaty</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a>. Part of this land was reclaimed by the U.S. in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>. The Sweetgrass Hills Treaty of <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a> broke the Indian reserve into reservations for several separate tribes and established most of the modern reservation borders. In 1893, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Northern_Railway_%28US%29_198a.html" title="Great Northern Railway (US)">Great Northern Railway</a> was completed through the reservation starting the tourist economy and in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, the tribe sold off the western part of the reservation which later became part of Glacier National Park, although initially mining was attempted there.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackfoot.html" title="Blackfoot">Blackfoot tribes</a> were a traditional <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_culture.html" title="Buffalo culture">buffalo culture</a> until the failure of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_bison.html" title="American bison">buffalo</a> hunt in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a> as a result of non-native overhunting. This led to the <i>Starvation Winter</i> when 600 natives died. The federal government tried to establish farms and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a> ranches to reduce hunger and <i>settle</i> the nomadic tribe; however, the area proved marginal for either use and the tribe never became agriculturally self-supporting.</p>

<p>As on other American reservations, the tribe runs local government and provides most services including courts, child welfare, employment assistance, wildlife management, health care, education, land management, senior services as well as garbage collection and water systems. The native police were replaced by the federal <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs_77be.html" title="Bureau of Indian Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> in 2003 because of problems in the local force.</p>
<p>The reservation includes several types of land use. Of the total 1,462,640 acres (5919 km²), 650,558 acres (2633 km²) are held in trust for enrolled tribal members, 311,324 acres (1260 km²) are held directly by the tribe, 8,292 acres (34 km²) are <i>Government Reserve</i>, mostly irrigation projects and the Cut Bank Boarding School Reserve. The remaining 529,826 acres (2144 km²) are <i>Fee land</i> which is taxable and may be privately owned by the tribe, tribe members or non-tribe members.</p>
<p>The tribe leases land for homes, farms, grazing, and commercial uses. Leases must always be offered to tribe members first before non-members. The tribe also has the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_of_first_refusal.html" title="Right of first refusal">right of first refusal</a>; all private land offered for sale must be offered to the tribe first. If they decline to purchase it a waiver is granted.</p>

<p>Unemployment runs very high on the reservation. In 2001, the BIA reported 69% unemployment among registered members of the tribe.<a href="http://dli.state.mt.us/resources/indianlabormarket.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://dli.state.mt.us/resources/indianlabormarket.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Among those who were employed that year, 26% earned less than the poverty guideline. The Blackfeet tribal business council is chaired by Earl Old Person, who has also been chief of the Blackfeet Nation since 1978.</p>
<p>The major income source of the reservation is <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crude_oil.html" title="Crude oil">oil</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_gas.html" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> leases on the oil fields on tribal lands. In 1982, there were 643 producing oil wells and 47 producing gas wells. The reservation also has a significant tourist industry. Other economic activities include <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranching.html" title="Ranching">ranching</a> and a small <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timber.html" title="Timber">timber</a> industry which supports a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencil.html" title="Pencil">pencil</a> factory in Browning.<a href="http://www.pencilpages.com/mfg/blackfet.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pencilpages.com/mfg/blackfet.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>There are no paved north-south roads in Glacier National Park, access to sites on the east side of the park is provided by <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_89_f7cc.html" title="US 89">US 89</a> which runs through the reservation to the Canadian border crossing near <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Mountain_6915.html" title="Chief Mountain">Chief Mountain</a> which provides access to the Canadian sister park, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterton_Lakes_National_Park_9fc3.html" title="Waterton Lakes National Park">Waterton Lakes National Park</a>. Both east-west routes for the park travel through the reservation as does passenger train service. Several <a href="../../../h/i/k/Hiking.html" title="Hiking">hiking</a> trails continue out of the park across the reservation and require Blackfeet-issued permits.</p>
<p>Farms located at least partially on the reservation reported a total income of $9 million in 2002. A total of 354 farms covered 1,291,180 acres (5225 km²), the majority of the reservation's land. Most of these farms were family-owned including the 198 farms which were owned by Native Americans. Eighty percent of the land was used for raising beef <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a>, which also produced eighty percent of farm income. Other livestock included <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hog.html" title="Hog">hogs</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken.html" title="Chicken">chickens</a> with only small numbers of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milk.html" title="Milk">milk</a> cows, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_bison.html" title="American bison">bison</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">sheep</a>.

<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildfire.html" title="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> firefighting is a major seasonal income source. In 2000, some 1,000 Blackfeet worked as firefighters including the elite Chief Mountain Hotshots team. Firefighting income brought in $6.1 million that year. However this income is highly variable depending on the severity of the wildfire season.</p>
