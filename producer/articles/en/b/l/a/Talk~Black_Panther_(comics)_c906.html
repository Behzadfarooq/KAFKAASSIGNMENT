<dd>It's off-topic. This article is about the Black Panther. Wikipedia guidelines say to create a separate article and add a See also to this one. Otherwise, for consitency, you'd have to stick this section in <i>every</i> African comic-book character's entry. -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 13:39, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes that is exactly what I did, which is why I entered it here.
<dl>
<dd>Aside from being off-topic with each, it's redundant. I'll save us the trouble of having an Admin mediate, and create the article "African characters in comics," using your well-researched information. Then you can simply add a ==See also== section.

<p>Hi. I know Wikipedia has a lot of guidelines and it's impossible to know them all. Just wanted to say that if you look through the entries for <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daredevil_%28Marvel_Comics%29_111b.html" title="Daredevil (Marvel Comics)">Daredevil (Marvel Comics)</a> and many, many other up-to-date comics-character articles, you'll see they all follow this format that evolved through consensus by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_b2cf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Comics</a>, with some explars at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Comics/exemplars" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Comics/exemplars" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. Since Wiki oeprates on consensus, I hope you don't mind if I return <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_f844.html" title="Black Panther">Black Panther</a> to the same format as other articles in the Comics Project.</p>
<p>Thanks, and I'm looking forward to seeing your contributions to Comics Project. You might also enjoy <a href="../../../c/o/m/Portal%7EComics_b236.html" title="Portal:Comics">Portal:Comics</a>.

<p>Thank you for your polite posting on my talk page. I understand now, too, from your mentioning that you're sometimes on your father's computer, that you're young and it's important for others of us to be patient and understanding with some of the younger users.</p>
<p>As I stated on my edit summary on the History page of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_%28comics%29_6109.html" title="Black Panther (comics)">Black Panther (comics)</a> — which you can access via the top-of-page tab on each article — I deleted the section because it's just a guest appearance in three issues. And unless the article is going to list every guest appearance of the Black Panther, which would likely be against the policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>, it's not encyclopedic to have a write-up about just one of those guest appearances.</p>
<p>The bibliography section only lists those series that <i>star</i> a character. Listing a guest appearance there is actually inaccurate.</p>
<p>I hope you understand, and I would urge you to add this Panther information to the Avengers: United We Stand page. Thank you again for the opportunity to respond, and I hope you'll continue to be part of the Wiki community. -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 15:06, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would agree that the Kirby-conception material and his temporary costume could go further into the article — good call. Likewise, the material about "rigorous intellectual and physical conditioning" etc. isn't necessary for the introduction, where the key is establishing what he is not, not the deeper detail of why he is.</p>
<p>Given his prominence as the first major Black superhero, and the promience of the term "Black Panther" in American history and politics, perspective on T'Challa's place in popular culture and the larger culture is important to have upfront.</p>
<p>The last two points are simply technical. The first-sentence phrasing that had been there is one that's consistent with ComicsProject style and with entries throughout. Also...such terms as "current" are disallowed.</p>
<p>I've devised a compromise version based on the above. -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 13:29, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm afraid I have to throw my consensus in with <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> — these are one person's opinion of what is significant. Obviously, the first appearance, first solo story, first Avengers appearance and the like are significant — but those are already covered in the main text.

<p>Consensus is certainly a primary goal of Wikipedia comic-related pages, as stated at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_b2cf.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Comics</a>. But so is the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Develop comics-related articles into authoritative, <b>high-quality reference material</b>, making Wikipedia's comics coverage better than any existing reference book!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So tell you what . . . I'm posting this back. After 24 hours if the consensus agrees with Tenebrae and CovenantD, I'll happily relent. Until then, let's give the people a chance to decide. -- <a href="../../../a/b/c/User%7EABCxyz_7131.html" title="User:ABCxyz">ABCxyz</a> 20:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Posting opinion and waiting for people to say it's not is not what I'd consider a compromise solution. Two longtime editors both agree this is POV, and stated our reasons. If you want to post something on this page, by all means; it's your right. But the POV needs to come down in the meantime. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 21:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The biography section mixes the various relaunches together. IMHO, it might be better to narrate it by author.

<p>"Fannish over detail?" This is the week for people to hurt my feelings. . . . &#160;;-P</p>
<p>I would have called my edits "<a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html#Out-of-universe_perspective" title="WP:WAF">out of universe perspective</a>" myself rather than "fannish overdetail" seeing as how that's how fiction writing is supposed to be done. It looks like Tenebrae's edits get us farther away from the fiction guidelines and more into the in-universe cruft that's infected most of the fiction writing on wikipedia.</p>
<p>In addition, the problem with BP's "powers and abilities" section after Tenebrae's revert's is that it's entirely grounded in Priest's run, and describes a lot of stuff Panther hasn't used before or since. It's unsourced, and, as I've said, unsourceable except to a limited number of comics.</p>
<p>I'd be open to thoughts on how to resolve it. Could we just delete the arsenal section?<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 10:56, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a>, I agree with you that the arsenal list is a bit much — does Wikipedia really need, by way of analogy, a list of every single thing Batman's ever used in his utility belt, or can that be relegated to a fan site or an official site?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm actually a bit confused, though, since I was streamlining what was here to delete over-detail, and not adding "in-universe cruft". The arsenal list already existed when I came here; I think it's too much, myself, but rather than wholesale-delete it without consensus, I tried to trim it to basic information. -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 17:27, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're not adding in universe cruft, but if you delete references to authors, volumes, and issue numbers, what you're left with is in-universe writing. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 17:56, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I do think this particular list is a bit much, the "fictional character biography" section is by definition in-universe writing, which is acceptable within the parameters set by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Comics_exemplars_601d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/exemplars">Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics/exemplars</a> (please see).

<dd>Tenebrae - let me know what you think of my current description of the Panther's arsenal. I think it's an improvement because (1) it no longer focuses on a bunch of stuff that BP used during the Priest run and no other time before or since, cool as that stuff was; (2) it's written in an "out of universe" style; and (3) it's shorter.

<p>Near the beggining, the text says something along the lines of "black panther was the first black superhero". If you click on "black" then it links to the page titled "negro".

<p>This article says:</p>
<pre>
The Black Panther, whose name predates the use of the term by the Black Panther Party
</pre>
<p>However it also says that the Black Panther debuted in July 1966, whereas the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_Party_31db.html" title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a> article says:</p>
<pre>
With the death of Malcolm X in 1965, the Black Panther Party was founded
</pre>
<p>Which is accurate? Which usage of the term came first? If the political party came first, it would probably be safe to assume the character's name was based on it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.79.49.245 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.79.49.245_ff34.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.79.49.245">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>The third paragraph in Publication History states, "Immediately following the initial series was the much less well-received Black Panther, written and illustrated by Jack Kirby".
