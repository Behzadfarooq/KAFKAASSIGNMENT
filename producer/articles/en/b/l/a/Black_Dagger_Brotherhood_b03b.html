<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dagger_Brotherhood_b03b.html" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summary</span></h2>
<p>In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war going on between vampires and their slayers. There also exists a secret band of brothers like no other - six vampire warriors, defenders of their race.</p>
<p>As a result of selective breeding within the race, Brothers possess immense physical and mental strength as well as rapid healing capabilities. They are not siblings for the most part and are inducted into the Brotherhood upon nomination by the Brothers. Aggressive, self-reliant and secretive by nature, they exist apart from civilians, having little contact with members of the other classes except when they need to feed. They are the subject of legend and the object of reverence within the vampire world.</p>
<p>The Black Dagger Brotherhood series tells of these highly trained vampire warriors who protect their species against the Lessening Society. Members of the Lessening Society are called <i><b>Lessers</b></i>; de-souled humans who target vampires for extermination. Lessers must be stabbed through the chest in order to be killed, otherwise they are ageless. They do not eat or drink and are impotent. Over time, their hair, skin and irises lose pigmentation until they are blonde, blushless and pale-eyed. They smell like baby powder. Inducted into the Society by the Omega, they retain a ceramic jar thereafter into which their heart was placed after it was removed.</p>

<p><b>Wrath</b> is the King of the vampire society. He is the last pureblood vampire remaining. Essentially blind, he is the leader who is not willing to lead. His story is told in <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dagger_Brotherhood_b03b.html#DARK_LOVER" title="Black Dagger Brotherhood">Dark Lover</a></i>.</p>
<p><b>Rhage</b> is the strongest and most beautiful of the Brothers. Cursed by the vampire's deity, <i><b>The Scribe Virgin</b></i>, he is possessed of a dark side that is a danger to everyone. His story is told in <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dagger_Brotherhood_b03b.html#LOVER_ETERNAL" title="Black Dagger Brotherhood">Lover Eternal</a></i>.</p>
<p><b>Zsadist</b> is the scarred, menacing one. Taken as an infant from his family, he's forced into slavery until his twin, Phury, rescues him. His story is told in <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dagger_Brotherhood_b03b.html#LOVER_AWAKENED" title="Black Dagger Brotherhood">Lover Awakened</a></i>.</p>
<p><b>Vishous</b> is the most intelligent and the one who is specially gifted. His curse is his ability to prognosticate: he sees the future, though not the 'when' of events so he is tortured by his inability to save those he loves from danger. Tattooed over his eye, his genitals, and on his hand, he has the ability to disintegrate objects with a blast of energy from his hand. His story is told in <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dagger_Brotherhood_b03b.html#LOVER_UNBOUND" title="Black Dagger Brotherhood">Lover Unbound</a></i>.</p>
<p><b>Tohrment</b> took over leadership of the Brotherhood when Wrath took the throne. He is the steady one, the calm one.</p>
<p><b>Phury</b> is Zsadist's twin brother and a celibate who cannot truly live because of everything his biological brother has lost. Used to giving rather than receiving, he needs love coming back at him to bring him alive. Phury is incredibly loyal to his brother, even shooting off his own leg to save his twin.</p>
<p><b>Butch</b> is the only human to be allowed within the Brotherhood. He lives at the "Pit", a two bedroom house a ways from the mansion where the King and other Brother's reside, with Vishous and he is a friend to all the warriors. An ex-homicide detective, he was lovingly given the nickname "Cop" by the vampires. His story is told in <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dagger_Brotherhood_b03b.html#LOVER_REVEALED" title="Black Dagger Brotherhood">Lover Revealed</a></i>.</p>

<p><b>Mr. X</b> The <i>Forelesser</i> - leader of the Lessening Society. He was approached to join in the 1950s, when he was seventeen. A murderer before his induction, he joined in an attempt to satisfy his sociopathic tendencies. Calculating and powerful, he aims to achieve total extermination of the vampire race.</p>
<p><b>Mr. O</b> An anomaly in the Society, O strives to stand out in a group where uniformity is upheld; and the longer one is a part of it, the more anonymous they become. He dyes his hair in an attempt to hold off the eventual losing of hair and skin pigmentation that occurs in <i>lessers</i> over time. He joined the Lessening Society for the opportunity of a lifetime of killing, but it is clear he is unhappy with his decision.</p>
<p><b>Mr. U</b> joined the Lessening Society 200 years ago, which is evident in his pale skin and white hair. He has a 'by-the-book' mentality that does not encourage deviating from <i><b>the Omega'</b></i>s goal of vampire extermination.</p>

<p><i>Dark Lover</i> is the first of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. It tells the story of Wrath - the last purebred vampire left on the planet. The uncrowned king of the vampire species, Wrath lives only to fight in an endless war with the soulless vampire slayers, lessers, who brutally murdered his parents centuries ago. As leader of the Brotherhood, his only solace is in fighting, not looking to the past or future, shunning his duties as King.</p>
<p><br />
Within the vampire world, Wrath is known as <b>the Blind King</b>, due to his extremely poor eyesight, though this does not affect his prowess on the battlefield nor his ability to sense the feelings of others around him.</p>
<p><br />
Blaming himself for his parents death, Wrath has wrapped himself in a cocoon of self-hatred and unfeelingness, but Dark Lover tells of his enlivening. When the lessers kill one of his best fighters, Wrath is left with the responsibility to help the warrior’s half-human daughter, Beth, through her <i>transition</i> - this is a critical moment in a vampire’s life when he or she transforms into an adult. Thereafter, they must drink the blood of the opposite sex to survive and are unable to withstand sunlight. Occurs generally in the mid-twenties. Some vampires do not survive their transitions, males in particular. Prior to their transitions, vampires are physically weak, sexually unaware and unresponsive, and unable to dematerialise.</p>
<p><br />
It is through Beth that Wrath learns to feel, and look toward the future, of his life and of the species as a whole.</p>

<p><i>Lover Eternal</i> is second in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. It tells the story of Rhage, the strongest and best fighter of the Brotherhood. He is also considered the most attractive of all the Brothers, and his beauty earned him the nickname 'Hollywood'. However, Rhage was cursed in the early eighteen hundreds, for angering <i><b>The Scribe Virgin</b></i>. Due to his continued recklessness and uncontrollability just after his <i>transition</i>, <i><b>The Scribe Virgin</b></i> gave him <i>The Beast</i>. Fearsome in its beauty, <i>the Beast</i> resembles a huge dragon with massive claws and a jaw filled with sharp fangs.</p>
<p><br />
It was a punishment designed to regulate Rhage's energy and moods. Whenever he gets out of control, <i>the Beast</i> comes out. When this occurs Rhage's eyes turn a brilliant white and his body mutates in a grisly display of tearing and ruptures - letting <i>the Beast</i> emerge. When it is out, Rhage is totally suppressed and he is in no way able to control <i>the Beast</i>, who knows neither friend nor foe. Because of this, Rhage has to keep <i>the Beast</i> from coming out, subduing it through the satiation of a good fight or sex.</p>
<p><br />
Rhage's sexual exploits are the stuff of legend in the Vampire society. It is said that fathers tell their sons the story of Rhage when the time is right. But Rhage does not relish this reputation and is, in fact, eager to cast it off.</p>
<p><br />
In <i>Lover Eternal</i> Rhage meets Mary, a human female who he is unexplainably drawn to. Mary is unwittingly thrown into the vampire world and reliant on Rhage's protection. However, with a life-threatening curse of her own, she is not looking for love and lost faith in miracles long ago. But when Rhage's attraction turns to something more emotional, he has to fight to make Mary his alone.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Dagger_Brotherhood_b03b.html" title="Edit section: LOVER AWAKENED">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>LOVER AWAKENED</i></span></h3>
<p><i>Lover Awakened</i> is the third in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. It tells the story of Zsadist, the most lethal of the brothers. A former blood slave who was mercilessly tortured during the first hundred years of his life, Z is the one who has fallen farthest from grace. <i>Lover Awakened</i> tells of his worthy redemption.</p>
<div class="floatleft"><span><a href="../../../l/o/v/Image%7ELover_Awakenedsmall.jpg_fbd1.html" class="image" title="Lover Awakened by J.R. Ward"><img src="../../../upload/b/ba/Lover_Awakenedsmall.jpg" alt="Lover Awakened by J.R. Ward" width="122" height="195" longdesc="../../../l/o/v/Image%7ELover_Awakenedsmall.jpg_fbd1.html" /></a></span></div>
<p><br />
As an infant, Zsadist had been taken from his home and forced to serve in the house of a vampire aristocrat while he was <i>pre-transition</i>. Years later, hours after his <i>transition</i>, he found himself tied down, with thick black bands being tattooed into the skin around his wrists and neck (his pulse points). Overnight he had become a <i>blood slave</i> - a male or female vampire who is subjugated to serve the blood needs of another. For a hundred years, Zsadist had to suffer through the horror of being at the mercy of a brutal vampire female, <i><b>The Mistress</b></i>. Over time, Zsadist became numb. His canary yellow eyes, similar to that of his twin’s, Phury, grew black and soulless, a reflection of how he felt inside.</p>
<p><br />
Though Phury rescues Zsadist, Z still bears the scars from a past filled with suffering and humiliation. He becomes renowned for his unquenchable fury and sinister deeds, especially where females are concerned. He is considered a savage, feared by humans and vampires alike. Anger is his only companion and terror his only passion—until he rescues a beautiful female from the Lessening Society.</p>
<p><br />
Bella had been instantly entranced by the seething power Zsadist possesses; and though he considers himself unworthy of her, she strives to prove her feelings and her belief in him. When Zsadist’s thirst for vengeance against Bella’s tormentors drives him to the brink of madness, Bella must help him overcome the wounds of his tortured past and find a future with her…</p>
