<li>I'm afraid it's not my duty or right to pick the right version. Admins are generally not supposed to "endorse" any particular revision. I'm just following the rules.

<ul>
<li>I know it is not your duty to pick the right version. I however think that in such cases at least a neutrality dispute note should be added. And could you please fulfill your duty and protect wikipedia from vandals who ignore not only the three revert rule but also the policy not to attack others personally? TDC was already blocked once, now he even chooses inappropriate language at the page that is meant for mediation because of his conduct: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/TDC&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4974111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/TDC&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4974111" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGet-back-world-respect_c406.html" title="User:Get-back-world-respect">Get-back-world-respect</a> 01:58, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<p>I'd just like to note, I really disagree with protecting <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>. I think that it's important to have pages that have a lot of current and fast changes going on open for editing. I think this edit war is stupid and likely to be ongoing, and that protection isn't going to stop it - going to mediation or RfC will, but we all but have explicit POV warriors going on here. I'm loathe to let POV warriors effectively stop the development of pages like that, especially near-permanantly as seems likely to happen if protection of these pages goes on. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 00:19, Aug 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Snowspinner, I respect you and all, but this has gotten out of hand. There have been revert wars going on in regard to this article for nearly two weeks. We are an encyclopaedia, and as such, our primary goal is to present information. Correct, NPOV, unbiased information. And the information in this article has been changing every 2 minutes recently. That makes us look unreliable and not trustworthy as a source of information. This needs to be resolved before we can open the page, IMO. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 01:57, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>They is is not acceptable. The singular "they/their" form has not yet gained suffecient acceptance in formal writing to use it on Wikipedia. Please do not use it on Wikipedia. If you make that edit to a main page template after this warning, you will be blocked from editing.</i></p>
<p>Are you kidding? Singular "they" is used all over Wikipedia. I don't believe Wikipedia has an official pronoun policy.</p>
<p>If it's vandalism to change "he or she" to "they", then it would also be vandalism to change "they" to "he or she", and there are dozens of articles on Wikipedia that use singular "they".</p>

<li>Wikipedia does not have any pronoun policy. It's not your place to make judgements about "poor grammar". You say changing "he or she" to "they" is <i>vandalism</i>, and you say the opposite change is <i>fixing</i>... That's not the spirit of Wikipedia. No one made you the arbiter of pronouns. The articles that use singular "they" are not "incorrect" and they don't need to be "fixed".</li>

<ul>
<li>I disagree. Singular they/their has been used by educated people in a formal register for a long time. In fact, I have a copy of a British passport application that uses it in that sense. I prefer it sometimes and intend to keep using it. Grammatical rules are fluid and prescriptivists who think they are not can have a stifling effect on discussions and even distort people's perceptions of some groups within a society based on some perceived error in the way they speak. For an encyclopaedic style, all that matters is whether a significant number of educated, native speakers would find a particular usage acceptable. Proscriptions on split infinitives, terminating sentences with preposition and other <i>poor grammar</i> are for another age. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGest_ef44.html" title="User:Gest">Gest</a> 09:19, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Did you address a message to me today accusing me of valdalism, etc? If so, then you must be sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>I haven't made a broad, "vandalistic" edit in several months (they have all since been reverted as I have learned the rules of the boards).</p>
<p>Recently my only edits have been to the following articles:</p>
<p>1. Fidel Castro (adding a single external link from Freedom House and had a bitter political argument with another user on the DISCUSSION page--hardly a crime).</p>
<p>2. Robert Mugabe (added an external link to Freedom House report)</p>
<p>3. Rios Montt (the article is currently locked due to an edit war between myself and 172, among others, but I am involved in an open-ended talk on the DISCUSSION page about how best to balance the article. I am attempting to make it more NPOV and less like a partisan hate-piece against Rios Montt, the School of the Americas, and President Reagan.)</p>
<p>I don't know who is taking their beef with me to you, and I fail to see how I have overstepped any wiki boundaries about the editing process. Read these pages and you will see that this is all a mistake.</p>

<p>Hiya. I noticed you voted against <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a>'s adminship nomination. Purely out of personal curiosity, might I ask why?

<li>Well, firstly, I feel he's too "subversive" (for lack of a better word) in regards to his opinions on numerous aspects of the project and how it is run. I don't want to support someone that might endeavour to get abilities only to try to fuck things up or try to revolutionise something. Secondly, I don't like a lot of his reasoning, especially his <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecently_created_admins_768f.html#Snowspinner" title="Wikipedia:Recently created admins">recent reasons for opposing Snowspinner's RfA nom</a>. All in all, I just don't feel comfortable at all with him being an admin, bottom line. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 04:07, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please take note, yesterday, I posted my version of the facts on this issue as per the page's instructions: "If you disagree with some evidence you see here, please provide counter-evidence, or an explanation of why the evidence is misleading. Please do this under a seperate header, to seperate your response from the original evidence."</p>
<p>However, tonight, <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a> has twice deleted my statement from that page and instead moved it to the "discussion" page.</p>
<p>I am trying my best to defuse the tense dynamic between Neutrality an myself, but I am at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p>For example, Neutrality is again jumping all over my edits on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> and deleted/reversed me me multiple times tonight wihtout discussion. I have left copious notes on that talk page explaining my edits, but Neutrality dos not dialog with me.</p>
<p>I really would appreciate some guidedance on getting Neutrality to give me some breathing room.</p>
<p>Also, please take note, although I am feeling very pressed againg by Neutrality, I am not reverting to my intial method of snide commentary.</p>
<p>Since Snowspinner chastized me several days ago with a 24hr ban, I have reconsidered and am avoiding harsh statements. That being the case, when can I expect Neutrality to be advised to leave me be and not be so agressive to me? <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 01:48, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, Neutrality can be a bit stubborn sometimes. You can try to raise the issue on Neutrality's talk page if you haven't already. You can list the article on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a> to let other users comment on the debate. Or if you really think Neutrality is acting in bad faith and/or contrary to Wikipedia policy, you can open begin a dispute resolution process by listing him on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a>.

<p>Dear Blankfaze, a message from you somehow reached me telling me to stop vandalizing entries. As I am a anonymous user and only read things here, I find this quite hard to understand. I guess you have identified me via my IP-adress, so I hope you can see that I'm not doing more than viewing pages on wikipedia.org. thanks, anonymous user</p>

<p>blankfaze, I'm copying here my response to you re: Mikkalai, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Administrators/Administrator_Accountability_Policy#A_quick_peek_into_who_the_proponents_of_the_new_policy_are" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Administrators/Administrator_Accountability_Policy#A_quick_peek_into_who_the_proponents_of_the_new_policy_are" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I do this as a courtesy, so that you're not taken by surprise, and can if you wish, formulate a response to my (quite vehement) critique of you. Of course, also feel free to remove this copy; if you do respond, I'd appreciate you do so on my talk page, so I see it forthwith, as well as on the Administrator Accountability Policy page.</p>
<p>I wish I could have been less vehement, but I can't ignore and I can't countenance the way you used your sysop position to threaten another user.</p>
<p>Copied text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>blankfaze, who is entitled to give "explicit instructions not to edit [a] page", and under what circumstances? As far as I was aware, anyone could edit anything. Thanks. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 04:00, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well I've taken the time to work up this proposal, and I'd like to manage it myself. So I politely asked that others not edit it. I don't think that's too much to ask, really. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(беседа!)</small></a> 05:29, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>blankfaze, you politely asked, and then you threatened to use your admin powers to block him <i>despite his having done nothing more than edit a page</i>. Yes, you made the proposal, and yes, things are so politicized around here lately that -- despite the wiki spirit of community editing -- I personally wouldn't have edited it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your argument that Mikkalai's "edits were disruptive, as they might mislead a reader of the proposal into thinking that for some reason voting would start at any time other than the one specified. I do not believe his edit was necessary or even in good faith, for all he would have to do is raise the issue on the talk page and wait for me to respond" is entirely specious. Not only was no one going to be misled -- as all he was doing was adding <i>a suggestion</i>, but the argument that he should wait for you to respond pre-supposes that you and only you have a right to set the time of the vote. Again, given the politicization, I'd likely have deferred to the author's preferred time, but no one is obligated to do so.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But the page <i>is not</i> your property, and all Mikkalai wanted to do was <i>suggest</i> extending the editing period -- something you yourself later decided to do. Given that you <i>are</i> a sysop, the onus is on <i>you</i> to provide a better, more collegial example -- but instead you decided to take the trust the community reposes in you and use it to be heavy-handed and threatening -- and to a newbie, of all people. <b>Not to put too fine a point on it, you were being a bully while sitting safely behind your computer screen, and expecting to get away with it because you're a sysop.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You claim, above, that "my warning was more of an attempt to curve [sic] an edit war before blocking became necessary, rather than to make a serious threat." That is disingenuous <i>at best</i>: You weren't trying to curb an edit war; as it was <i>your own</i> edit your were trying to maintain, you could have avoid the edit war that simply by compromising.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But on your <i>own</i> talk page, you admit that (emphasis orthogonal's) "<b>I was sort of hoping to scare him</b> into stopping his sillyness [sic]." <b>You expected to be "scary", but you now claim that while you hoped to be scary, what you did wasn't a "serious threat"?</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How is threatening to (indefinitely) block a user from editing not a "serious threat"? Not only is it a serious threat, the only WP sanction less severe than banning, it's also a threat that <i>can only be made by a sysop</i>. Rather than avoid being a judge in your own cause by finding another user or sysop to mediate, <i>you threatened to take away a newbie's entire ability to edit over your <b>own</b> edit war</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And you've avoided answering my initial question: <b>who is entitled to give instructions not to edit a page?</b> You state you gave "explicit instructions not to edit", but I don't see where you get the authority to give "explicit instructions" to anyone. Or do you claim that as another perquisite if being a sysop.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You acted precipitously, you in your own words tried to "scare" a fellow user, you were a bully, and you abused your powers as a sysop. And now, rather than admit your mistake like a grown-up, you persist in characterizing Mikkalai's attempt to add a <i>clause</i> -- a clause merely turning a hard time limit into a suggestion -- to your proposal's preamble as "disruptive behavior".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You owe Wikipedia an explanation of just where you think you get the right to "explicitly instruct" the rest of us, and an explanation of how you justify threatening a user who was merely following the wiki spirit of editing boldly. And you owe Mikkalai, <i>and Wikipedia</i> an apology. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 07:40, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will be frank&#160;:-) Tomorrow, as soon as I have time, I will start an edit war on the absolutely disastrous title given to that article. Given that much discussion already took place on the title of the article, the current change of article without previous discussion is extremely inappropriate. I will wait for opinion, but I will probably put the article back to the previous title.</p>

<dd>So we'll move it back to where it started the day at <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_law_on_secularity_and_conspicuous_religious_symbols_in_schools.html" title="French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools">French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools</a>? I'm fine with that, I don't really think this title is specific enough to the article content. EdPoor said he wouldn't fight with us if we wanted to move it back (I have been chatting to him about it on <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">his talk page</a>). I'll ask Ed to move it back if we're agreed (it has to be moved back by a sysop and he said he would do it for us). So no edit war needed! &#160;:D <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabiform_a7bf.html" title="User:Fabiform">fabiform</a> | <a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabiform_a651.html" title="User talk:Fabiform">talk</a> 18:19, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good. So since you mention that Ed would be ok to put it back at the old title, I do it right now&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">fr0069</a></dd>

<dd>I didn't realise you were an administrator. How convenient! I think I've annoyed PoorEd for enough in one day. &#160;:) <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabiform_a7bf.html" title="User:Fabiform">fabiform</a> | <a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabiform_a651.html" title="User talk:Fabiform">talk</a> 18:26, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmmm, that is a "power" I use less than once a month&#160;:-) Done for february then. The number of titles is quite ridiculous&#160;:-) I would be glad that Ed edits my text to make it good english (but this title was just grrrrr). Also, there is some stuff missing. Plus, it probably needs cimenting, and organising. Well, there is still a lot to do anyway. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">fr0069</a></dd>

<p>Your English is exquisitely precise. I comprehend <i>this title was just grrrrr</i> quite clearly!&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Edmond Le Pauvre</a></p>

<dd>do you understand <i>bizzzzz</i> as well&#160;?</dd>
