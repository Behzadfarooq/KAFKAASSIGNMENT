<p>What's the point of having enhanced interrogation techniques link to tortue? Is this politcal commentary?</p>
<p>After reviewing the link, there appears to be no point to having Enhanced Interrogation Techniques link to the entry for torture. The torture entry contains no information relevant to the practice of EIT. I've removed the link for the time being.AdmiralAhab 18:53, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there a page for "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"? Maybe with a helpful explanation on what exactly that fucking phrase even means? I'd like to see someone try to describe waterboarding, coldcell, stress positions, sleep deprevation, slapping and forced feeding as anything other than torture. That would be amusing.

<p>I removed the remark that Camp Iguana was used to torture children. I did some research on the minors held by the USA. And I don't believe that is true.</p>
<p>There are some horrific accounts of how minors are treated in Cuba. Mohammed el-Chad and Omar Khadr have been subjected to cruel treatment. But they weren't held at Camp Iguana. Clive Stafford Smith told the BBC that he believed 20 minors had been held in Cuba. Three of them were housed in Camp Iguana. Following their release it sounded as if they were treated far better than any of the other detainees. They were taught to read and write. They got to play soccer, and video games, watch movies, eat take-out food brought from the base's McDonald's. They were allowed to have two showers a day, could turn the lights on and off, whenever they liked. One newspaper compared the incarceration of these three boys as being not much worse than that of a boarding school. In subsequent interviews they described positive aspects, they wanted to write the friendly guards they bonded with.</p>
<p>They also described much harsher treatment back in Bagram. My guess was that by the time those three arrived at Camp Iguana someone had realized they were just innocent kids, who never should have left Afghanistan. But the other dozen minors were held with the general detainnee population, and were treated as harshly as the adult detainees.</p>
<p>Khadr was short-shackled for extended periods of time, until he soiled himself. Other detainees have reported this. But Khadr reported that when the guards returned they used his bound body to use his hair and clothes to mop up his urine and feces. Khadr reports being subjected to brutal beatings at the hands of the IRF. Mohammed el-Chad has a painful skin condition, and had medical treatment withheld. In the early morning after he was moved to a new cell the IRF invaded his cell and beat him so badly they knocked out his front teeth. It turned out that it was a case of mistaken identity. The IRF had been instructed to beat the detainee who had previously been held in that cell. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 04:12, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Today's Washington Post hosted an online discussion with Dana Priest, the author of the article that broke the secret interrogation story. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/10/28/DI2005102800907.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/10/28/DI2005102800907.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The third questioner quotes a local paper that picked up the story:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Given that only one CIA plane so far has been spotted landing on a military airstrip in northern Poland (this from a story in today's Gazeta Wyborca quoting your article), doesn't it make the vision of a Guantanamo-like camp in Poland somewhat less probable?"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I used google to look for that article. I found an article, entitled: <a href="http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,53600,2995739.html?skad=rss" class="external text" title="http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,53600,2995739.html?skad=rss" rel="nofollow">Tajne więzienia CIA w Europie Wschodniej</a> that mentioned both the WaPo and the CIA. And I used <a href="http://www.poltran.com/pl.php4" class="external text" title="http://www.poltran.com/pl.php4" rel="nofollow">this polish-to-english translator</a> to try to read it. I didn't see any mention of the number of flights. Any Polish speakers out there interested enough in taking a closer look for this article? -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 23:15, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A more relevant article is <a href="http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/wyborcza/1,34513,3000119.html" class="external text" title="http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/wyborcza/1,34513,3000119.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>At this point, the only relatively solid piece of information is that in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_737.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737</a> plane (apparently the one shown <a href="http://images.google.pl/images?q=N313P" class="external text" title="http://images.google.pl/images?q=N313P" rel="nofollow">here</a>), widely thought to be involved in CIA-related flights, made a landing at Szymany airport. However, it is completely unknown what was the reason for the landing. At this point, Polish press is not reporting any evidence which could point directly to the existence of any CIA holding facilities in Poland.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand the questioner's argument. There is only one well documented (by the Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, etc.) suspected CIA transport plane, but there is no reason to conclude it's the only such plane. The CIA operates in secrecy. Neither is there any reason to suspect the CIA would land its planes exclusively at a single known military airstrip in Poland. Covert landings at multiple locations, including civilian airstrips are probably likely to preserve secrecy. Moreover, if there are eight currently operating black sites containing around 100 individuals total, one would expect in the neighborhood of 12 people to be held in Poland. A single plane could easily handle that. --Chris Thompson 23:43, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not from the US so I don't know for sure, but can anyone confirm whether this is at the moment generally regarded as a "scandal" in the US? I personally think it deserves to be regarded as such, but that's my opinion. If it deserves to be called a "scandal", then should it be tagged in the category "George W Bush administration scandals"? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeslegloupier_8007.html" title="User:Georgeslegloupier">Georgeslegloupier</a> 14:55, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm from the US and I can tell you that the Bush Administration here is having many, many problems all at once. Yes, the CIA Black Sites are a problem, but bigger issues in the public mind are calls for pulling out of Iraq, problems with the budget (program cuts, tax increases), prewar intelligence gaffs, and an assortment of sordid Republican scandals involving corruption of various kinds. Bush is trying to change the tone of discussion by bringing up other issues like intelligent design in schools, his court nominations, and lately border controls. I think the attitude of the American public is that torturing people in European countries is fine since we've been doing that in Iraq anyway. There's an acceptance (in my view an extremely foolish one) that terrorists are evil and have no rights whatsoever. Elite opinion is starting to change, but the man on the street still sees no connection between his civil rights and those of accused criminals.Jburt1 19:44, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
As an American expat I do not converse with people "on the street", so to speak, but I am shocked that a fellow American believes that this is not a huge issue with "ordinary" people. Those with whom I communicate regularly and I are appalled that Bush is getting away with so much. His administration is trying to keep the public busy with other issues which (seem to more) directly affect them. He dishonors our forefathers who gave their lives for basic human rights, liberty and free expression of religion.

<p>I think someone misinterpreted the original Washington Post article. I think it said that there were eight countries, in total, where there were covert interrogation sites.</p>
<p>I question the reference to Denmark. The English article on Denmark only says the plane landed there. These planes land all over, including, this week, Iceland and Canada.

<dd>The comment referred to the most famous "hard site" -- the cell block, set up by Captain <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolyn_Wood_7b70.html" title="Carolyn Wood">Carolyn Wood</a>, where the abuse pictures were taken. It was set up to hold the detainees that the intelligence officials were most interested in. Why "hard"? Maybe because they are so hard on the prisoners? While Abu Ghraib had other cell blocks, with almost 10,000 prisoners, most prisoners are housed in tents. I agree that whoever included that phrase made a mistake. The Fay document makes clear that Captain Wood recommended that Abu Ghraib should have a hard site like the other prisons in Afghanistan.</dd>

<li>American tactics were to send in troops to ocnduct sweeps, to round up suspects.</li>
<li>85% or more of thses suspects would be found to be completely innocent, wrong place, wrong time.</li>
<li>But the decision to release suspects had to be approved by a committee, that consisted of Brigadier-General Janis Karpinski, Colonel Warren, Sanchez's chief legal advisor, and several other senior officers. They schedules conflicted so much that they only managed to meet very infrequently. So innocent men spent months longer in detention long after they were determined to be innocent. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 10:08, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It must make us wonder what has become of the morals and ethics in this world, when some seem to have both the power and the selfgiven right to take away human rights from a "suspect" for years without any proof of any kind. Also dont get the facts wrong. The countries of interigation, are not in any way related to the countries where the planes have landed, moving prisoners. For examble, The Icelandic government never gave permission for those prisinor planes to land on an Icelandic ground.</p>

<p>This section is frankly appalling from an encyclopedic standpoint. "According to government sources" - not cited. "officers are allowed to use what the agency calls Enhanced Interrogation Techniques which violate the UN Convention and U.S. law." - if it's against the law, they're not allowed to use the tactics by definition. Either they're breaking the law or it's not against the law in the first place. They can't be allowed and breaking the law at the same time. None of this is sourced anyway.</p>
<p>This section needs serious attention from someone qualified, and needs much better sourcing. I have therefore added an accuracy dispute until it's fixed. <a href="../../../v/o/n/User%7EVonspringer_981a.html" title="User:Vonspringer">Vonspringer</a> 17:49, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Vonspringer, your logical flaw is that they may be allowed to break the law. Is it relevant that someone is breaking the law if they are never penalized for doing so, and if in fact they receive medals for doing it?</p>
<p>allow - 'to forbear or neglect to restrain or prevent.' The definition says nothing about whether an action is legal or illegal. If you allow someone to do something, then you neglect to keep them from doing it. Your criticism about breaking the law is a separate issue. It's like saying that "torturing people is immoral, so how can they be allowed to do it?" Jburt1 19:51, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem I have with the article is that if what's being practiced is in fact illegal, then the government as an entity does not allow it. If individual CIA authorities "allow" illegal acts to be carried out, they're not acting in the capacity of the government, they're acting in the capacity as a lawbreaker. The government itself is not neglecting to restrain or prevent, it's government employees acting outside their designated authority. Perhaps the article should reflect who's doing the allowing. If I can think of a good way to reword it, I'll see what I can do.</dd>

<dd>I'm leaving the accuracy dispute because I have seen no evidence that the government (i.e., people with legal authority to order interogation tactics) have directly ordered violations of specific codified US law.

<p>Human Rights Watch have a few reports on the torture issue, that might be of use. Here's a quote from and reference for the latest one I found: 'Q &amp; A on Military Instruction Number 10' "...while the Instruction prohibits the use of evidence acquired by torture, it contains few safeguards to make the prohibition meaningful. Moreover, the Instruction does not bar the use of evidence acquired by abusive interrogations that fall short of torture but nonetheless violate the prohibitions against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in the Convention against Torture as well as in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)." from: <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/03/31/usdom13109.htm" class="external free" title="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/03/31/usdom13109.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/03/31/usdom13109.htm</a></p>

<p>I just removed an {npov} tag placed by a numbered IP. They didn't state what part of the article displayed a biased point of view. I regard this as an absolute obligation on those who place an {npov} tab, because the rest of us should have to guess as to what they think is biased.

<p>They also asserted that the existence of black sites was merely <b>alleged</b>. I removed the word alleged because the existence of black sites is not in question.

<p>Ok so your proofs: 1: We know the US holds dozens of high level al Qaeda suspects. Given. 2. We know they aren't held in Guantanamo. Possibly not true given deception on the CIA's part, but lets call it a given. 3: They have to be held somewhere: Do they? They don't necessarily still live. They could be held in a ships brig off the coast of Iraq, or Afghanistan, in a navy prison. They could have been found not guilty and released. The fact is, we just don't know. 4. Where do I think they're held? I think they're held in a military facility, most likely in the country they were arrested in. 5: the error is here: Just because a location is classified does not make it, by definition, "black". That's a HUGE assumption, that classified = black. Classification is a security measure designed to protect OPSEC. Did you know, that even though they're publically available through internet research, the GPS coordinates of US bases in Iraq are "classified"? What about Camp Doha, Kuwait, the CentCom HQ. It's not an open facility: it requires a Colonel's approval to be permitted on site. Is that a "black facility"? a "black site" by the more common definition would have to meet two characteristics: it would have to be clandestine (i.e. not appear on any budgets, or appear misleadingly), and it would have to be illegal (or else it's merely a covert facility).</p>
<p>I'm not arguing anything about an NPOV tag, as you suggest on my RfA. I'm just suggesting that your definition of a "black site" is flawed. (Camp Bondsteel? Come on....that's the US army's headquarters for KFOR, and it IS an open facility. If you had a specific facility on that base that was considered "black", such as the SFOD-D Stockade at Ft. Bragg, or the "covert hanger" at Eglin AFB that SF and CAG use, that'd be another story.) <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 18:40, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it quite appropriate to refer to Mary McCarthy as a "Democratic activist"? While I'm aware of the $7,700 she's donated to Democratic candidates and causes, I don't believe this represents the most relevant portion of her involvement with the "black site" issue. It also ascribes a political motivation to an action that, to date, the individual in question denies having any involvement in. I'd like to propose for consideration that the sentence be amended to read, "On April 21st, 2006, Mary O. McCarthy, a longtime CIA analyst, was fired for allegedly leaking info about black sites to Dana Lewis of the Washington Post."</p>

That there are worse forms of torture does not seem to be a point anyone is arguing.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 04:57, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a significant amount of proof prisoners have been tortured. For instance, this document <a href="http://www.phrusa.org/research/torture/pdf/psych_torture.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.phrusa.org/research/torture/pdf/psych_torture.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> has more than 800 footnotes detailing its sources. If you don't trust that document, go directly to the primary sources listed.</p>
<p>The definition of torture used in this article is the same as the definition used in the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">Torture</a>. Much of the torture used by US forces and their agents is psychological, you're right, but see the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology_of_torture.html" title="Psychology of torture">Psychology of torture</a> for details on how even that can damage an individual for life. Regardless, there is also plenty of evidence that US forces and their agents also engage in forms of physical torture including <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterboarding.html" title="Waterboarding">Waterboarding</a> and beatings. See for instance, these pictures and articles from the Abu Ghraib collection: <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs54.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs54.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs54.jpg</a> <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs01.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs01.jpg</a> <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs31.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs31.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs31.jpg</a> <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs08.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs08.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs08.jpg</a> <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs07.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/abu-ghraib_sbs07.jpg</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html</a> This was not an isolated incident.

<p>I stumbled accross this page from some other random site.</p>
<p>This page has very few references and is making some pretty bold claims. It is filled with so many poor and circular references that it has no credibility at all. Given the facts, a number of the conlusions it seems to draw are some amazingly long leaps.</p>
<p>No wonder so many people have problems with wikipedia.</p>

<p>Someone updated this article to reflect today's admission by President Bush that the USA had been maintaining secret interrogation centres. Someone else changed its wording, so it no longer said he "<b>admitted to</b>", but rather he "<b>recognized</b>" the existence of the secret prisons.</p>
<p>WTF? "Admitted to" is the description on the news up here in Canada. "Recognized" seems like an obfuscating euphemism to me -- and, sorry, expressive of a biased POV.</p>
<p>What, like the President didn't know about the secret sites, until today?</p>
<p>I changed it to say Bush "<b>acknowledged the exiistence</b>".</p>
<p>IMO a neutral point of view doesn't require us to use obfuscatory euphemisms. And, sorry, but the expression "<b>recognized the existence</b>" seems to be expressive of a biased POV to me. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 02:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It the opening paragraph it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Black site is a military term that has been used by United States intelligence agencies to refer to any classified facility <i><b>that is officially denied</b></i> by the US government."</dd>

<p>My understanding is that the policy is to neither confirm or deny. Can someone confirm what it is and either correct me or edit accordingly?</p>
