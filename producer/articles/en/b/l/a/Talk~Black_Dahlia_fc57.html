<p>I added a picture of her grave (it is just around the corner from me), but this page badly needs more images, both of Short while she was still alive, and of the condition of her body (yes it might be graphic, but it is - tragically enough - a major part of the reason she is notable). Does anyone know the state of copyright on images of her? Or where to obtain ones that Wikipedia can use? <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkCryst_6000.html" title="User:DarkCryst">DarkCryst</a> 06:38, 23 September 2006.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, I think this page needs an image of Elizabeth in life.... but a photo of her dead body is not only graphic or tragic, is pure bad taste and it would be only cruel to her. Elizabeth Short isn't only "The Black Dahlia", she was a woman, a human being.... and she doesn't deserve to be killed an infinite number of times, on serious or less so web sites.... More, "Wikipedia" is a "general" Encyclopedia, not a Forensic Sciences Encyclopedia and a there could be sensitive users, not so accustomed to morgue images.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually I disagree about that. There is nothing wrong with featuring images of her death - as long as they are not the main image. An Encyclopedia shouldn't care about offending people - it should just report the facts. Some (limited) images about her death would be very to the point - as that is why she is known. Specifically the famous shot of her body at the scene would probably be the best one. You are right in that there is no reason for this article to have every autopsy photo. But I think there should at least be one photo related to her gruesome death <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkCryst_6000.html" title="User:DarkCryst">DarkCryst</a> 07:22, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page was moved to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Short_d17b.html" title="Elizabeth Short">Elizabeth Short</a>, but I moved it back to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Black_Dahlia_cb2e.html" title="The Black Dahlia">The Black Dahlia</a>.</p>
<p>Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">naming conventions</a> require articles to be named after the <i>most common</i> name used, rather than the <i>most correct</i> (by whatever criterion). So even though Short's name is <i>really</i> "Elizabeth Short", that doesn't matter if she's better known as "The Black Dahlia". (See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> for more information.)</p>
<p>The article says "better known as The Black Dahlia", and that claim is the basis for my decision to move the page to that title. For all I know, Short is actually better known as "Elizabeth Short"; if this is true, then by all means move the page back there! But please fix the article <i>content</i> as well (perhaps to "also known as" rather than "better known as"). ^_^</p>

<p>Someone up and moved the original article without discussion, claiming that because a new movie was coming out with the same name (based upon the same incident) that the main article name should be a disambiguation page. This makes no sense. Making a movie about <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> does not mean forcing a move of that page to Christopher Columbus (person) with a disambig page at the original name to the new movie and the person. The main page should be about the actual event. Same goes with the other entries of this nature, it should be no different here. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:32, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello...</p>
<p>It was not my intention to do anything wrong but thanks for letting me know. I still have much to learn&#160;:) The reason I did it was not only because of the movie <b>The Black Dahlia</b> but also because of James Ellroy's book <b>The Black Dahlia</b>. I believe no more that <b>The Black Dahlia</b> aka. Elizabeth Short is unambiguous. The movie especially seems to be the center of increasing attention. However, I will not move another page without discussion. <a href="../../../m/a/f/User%7EMafics_c6b3.html" title="User:Mafics">Mafics</a> 14:12, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I was looking for a little more detail, maybe the cause of death, but not anything too gruesome. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_kitty_734c.html" title="User:Good kitty">Good kitty</a> 19:15, 22 March 2006 (UTC) i saw the autopsy photos on the sundance channel last month it was awful i cried. &lt;lenatee&gt;</p>

<p>While I did not add that paragraph, I believe it came because of an explanation of the crime on TLC's 99 Most Bizarre Crimes. The show ended by saying that Hodel was the murderer, but was never arrested due to having information on some dirty cops. This information came from his son, who found that he had an old picture of Short, and saw that his father's handwriting matched that of the killer's.</p>

<p>An anon added the following paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Another widely circulated myth holds that Short was unable to have sexual intercourse because of some genetic defect that left her with "infantile genitalia." Los Angeles County district attorney's files states the investigator had questioned three men with whom Short had sexual intercourse. The autopsy describes her reproductive organs as anatomically normal. The autopsy also states that Short was not and had never been pregnant, contrary to what is sometimes claimed.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Lovely. Not only are there no sources to prove that there is such a myth, there is no source to dispute it. I'll leave this here for a while, but without sources, I'll be deleting it. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 22:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

00:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)00:31, 21 August 2006 (UTC)~~ Source of the myth is probably LA reporter Will Fowler, who later admitted he made it up. It figures prominently in John Gilmore's book "Severed", which many still regard as the definitive source on the case.</p>

<p>who ever killed elizabeth short put her there for a reason...if not then he would have put her near a river or something like that he must have put her there so that thepolice and repotrers and everyone would find her. the 2 suspects george hodel and walter bayley were both surgons and both smart. george hodel was said to be smarter then einstein and he excelled in surgery....i dont know really anything about walter bayley but those are the 2 suspects that stand out in my head.</p>

<p>is it true her teeth was so rotten and she was so poor she filled her teeth with wax? I don't get it, she was very plain and everyday looking. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a></p>

<hr />
<p>It doesn't sound much realistic, but, according to some sources (FBI papers, available after <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_Information_Act_%28United_States%29_01fc.html" title="Freedom of Information Act (United States)">FOIA</a>), she had "bad teeth", even if, in many of her photographs in life, her teeth appear pretty normal. In a maybe excessively graphic close up of the corpse, which can be easily found on the Web, her teeth seem to be broken, but it could be a result of the senseless torture she suffered.</p>

<p>I added the info about the bartholin gland, which has also been referred to as "unspecified female trouble", together with the relevant attribution. This is a fairly common problem, far more plausible than some rare genetic defect related to "juvenile genitalia", if indeed such a conditon even exists. Duncan Cumming</p>

<p>This section is very long, and could be longer, I was considering moving it to a separate article and making the section on this page a summary with a main article link. Thoughts?</p>

<li>Jack the Ripper suspects has it's own suspects article, and there are plenty other suspects not mentioned in this article which could be added.--<b><a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaas120_f981.html" title="User:Amaas120"><font color="red">andrewI20</font></a></b><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmaas120_5c14.html" title="User talk:Amaas120"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 06:38, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There should be more info about her family. The article is mostly about the crime, which is probably what most people reading the article are interested in, but all the same, why not talk about her mother- which has not a single mention. Or name her sisters. The mention her father Cleo a couple times, but and a slight references to "her four sisters". What are their names? How old are they? etc. Why not mention the fact that she usually went by Bette instead of Elizabeth? --<b><a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmaas120_f981.html" title="User:Amaas120"><font color="red">andrewI20</font></a></b><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmaas120_5c14.html" title="User talk:Amaas120"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 06:38, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
