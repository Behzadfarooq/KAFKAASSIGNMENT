<p>Personal note: I fucking <i><b>hate</b></i> the phrase "In spite of (or perhaps because of)". It just seems completely meaningless to me. "<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> lost <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> In spite of (or perhaps because of) the genius of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>...?" <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 02:28, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I agree that the phrase can be misused, I don't think it is in this circumstance. The phrase implies that although the subject is believed to have had a significant effect on the outcome of something, it's hard to tell whether the effect was to help or to hinder that outcome. In the case of the Churchill example above, the phrase would only be meaningful of we're not sure whether Churchill's genius helped Hitler lose or whether his genius was instead helping (intentionally or unintentionally) Hitler to <i>win</i>. I can't think of any situation where one might argue that Churchill's genius was helping Hitler to win, though. In the case of its usage in this article, the question is whether the unresolved cliffhanger at the end of the series helped or hindered fanfic writers, and I can much more easily imagine an argument for both of these. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 04:12, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now, to me, the way <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_television.html" title="Science fiction television">science fiction television</a></i> is all one link looks odd, because it was obviously a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> (adjective) <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a> (compound noun). And linking half the noun in with the adjective just seems wrong. And <i>science-fiction</i> should certainly be hyphenated.</p>
<p>I appreciate that the link <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_television.html" title="Science fiction television">science fiction television</a> does point somewhere relevent, but it seems messy.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

While this is potentially quite a good link, I found that the site itself doesn't work in the web browser, konqueror. Specifically, there is no way to get the episode guide working. For this reason, I am reverting the modification. I welcome a discussion on adding this link despite the site not working on some browsers. Please do not revert my reversion without a discussion, however. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:18, 2005 Feb 10 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Out of curiosity, which parts of the Anorak Zone Guide don't work for you? I don't have Konquerer, but it seems to work fine on Camino, which is also XUL-based. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 00:34, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took a quick look at the site in Safari, which is based on (somewhat modified versions of) the same core rendering and JavaScript engines as Konqueror, and it appears to work fine. Yamla mentioned the episode guide; this seems to work fine in Safari, so if you have problems in an older version of Konqueror try a more recent version of KDE. However the tree view in the left frame is dependent on JavaScript and won't work right if JavaScript is disabled (the 'season one' etc can't be expanded so the individual episode links can't be accessed). --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 00:41, Mar 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll try with a newer version of KDE, hopefully tomorrow, and post my findings. I'm a little annoyed that the site requires JavaScript, which not everyone enables, to access the content. The content is quite decent, I've read it in Firefox. Anyway, I'll post my findings tomorrow, hopefully, or later in the week. Assuming it works, I'll withdraw my objection to posting the link if everyone else thinks it is okay. But it may still be worth discussing. Of course, I won't withdraw my objection if it does not work, but hey. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 04:27, 2005 Mar 20 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why are the "seasons" of this show labelled A,B,C and D, instead of referred to, properly, as "Series 1, series 2" etc, as is the practice with British television? <i>(unsigned question from User:24.90.94.112)</i></p>

<dd>I have no idea what the usual practice is, but <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Maloney_facb.html" title="David Maloney">David Maloney</a> (the producer of the thing) definitely refers to "C" rather than to 3 during the Terminal episode's commentary track on the season 3/C DVD.

<p>What about <i>season</i> (American style) vs <i>series</i> (British style)? —<a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamfang_5c14.html" title="User:Tamfang">Tamfang</a> 03:31, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi all, I'm presently taking the plunge and gradually changing all occurences of 'season' to 'series', no offence to US editors who may have contributed but Wikipedia does have a convention of using terms appropiate to a show's 'home market', in this case Britain. Cheers, <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rose_c71d.html" title="User:Ian Rose">Ian Rose</a> 23:31, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that this clashes with the terms appropriate for the show in question. Virtually all the writing on Blake's 7 that I've seen uses "season" rather than "series" (there's probably a crossover influence from Doctor Who fandom) and it seems more natural to use the standard terminology for that show. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 11:12, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, it's something of a myth that the British only use "series" and the Americans only use "season" (although the latter is more common). I've read articles saying that there are examples of a British production team using "season" back in the 60's. I only wish I could remember where so I could cite it here! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenb_2afe.html" title="User:Stephenb">Stephenb</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephenb_a7a3.html" title="User talk:Stephenb">(Talk)</a> 14:24, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No denying there's significant usage of 'season', although my reading also indicates 'series' being used more often. If the official term used by the production is 'season' (and indeed season A/B/C/D) I wouldn't set out to contradict that, although I think it may look odd to the average reader who's used to seeing 'series 1/2/3/4' rather than 'season A/B/C/D' - unless we spell it out somewhere. In any case the article still has a mixture of 'series' and 'season' and numbers and letters. For the moment I'll replace a couple of instances I inserted an official-looking 'Series 1/2/etc' with a more generic 'first/second/etc series' and see about rationalising the letters v. numbers.

<p>Additionally, I was appaled to see that Blake himself has no article of his own. Roj Blake merely redirects to Blake's 7. This should be remedied. I don't know how to do it, but hopefully someone who does will.</p>
<p>Character pages have already been started for all the main players in the series, which I hope to expand upon in due course.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_King_2e0a.html" title="User:Ben King">Ben King</a> 08:44, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article mentions the series occurring in "the second century of the third calendar" - I was always under the impression it was the <a href="http://www.hermit.org/Blakes7/SevenCyc/FanLore.html#SECOND" class="external text" title="http://www.hermit.org/Blakes7/SevenCyc/FanLore.html#SECOND" rel="nofollow"><i>third</i> century of the <i>second</i> calendar</a> - besides which, as far as I know it was never mentioned in the shows themselves, more as fan lore (Blake does, however, mention in <i>Pressure Point</i> that churches were dissolved at the end of "the Old Calendar", implying that there where <i>two</i> calendars, and that the earlier may have been the Gregorian one). The phrase <i>third century of the second calendar</i> does appear in some of the trailers on the recent Blakes 7 DVDs, but as these were created considerably after the programmes themselves it seems illogical to mention this date as an acknowledged fact about B7's premise. Should this be removed, or moved to 'Trivia', or...? --Mister Macbeth 15:19, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The correct phrase is indeed "the third Century of the second calendar", according to Andrew Pixley's article "The Dirty Dozen In Space" for TV Zone Issue #156. The primary source, according to Pixley, is "Blake's Seven - A Space Adventure Series of the Future", a press release issued by the BBC on Thursday, 15 September 1977. Article corrected accordingly. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_King_c3f1.html" title="User:Joe King">Joe King</a> 18:57, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About this Star Wars screening stuff: I have repeatedly heard it said in interviews that (producer David Maloney, director Pennant Roberts, and designer Roger Murray-Leach?) went to see Star Wars fairly early on during the production of B7 - ie, before it was broadcast - and were dismayed by how good it was, and came away saying "we shouldn't even be attempting what we're doing on our budget". I don't see how this tallies with "The Way Back" being transmitted on the same day as Star Wars opens.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 13:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The DVD section should indicate they've only been released in Region 2. That is, if that's the case. I've got conflicting reports on whether they've been released elsewhere, so I leave it up to someone who has better knowledge to fix this.</p>

<p>There's a lot of good stuff in this article but it's mostly buried through poor structuring and excessive amounts of un-encyclopedic trivia. In an effort to try to make a few improvements I have done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the “Locations” section and placed it into an article of its own – <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blake%27s_7_planets_7bd1.html" title="List of Blake's 7 planets">List of Blake's 7 planets</a>, ala the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Doctor_Who_planets_f3f6.html" title="List of Doctor Who planets">List of Doctor Who planets</a> article, with links to it from this page from the “See also” section and the infobox.</li>
<li>Removed the “Cast” section and placed it into the programme infobox which, I feel, is a better way of conveying this information</li>
<li>Removed some of the trivia information:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The story that the <i>Liberator</i> model was pointed the wrong way. According to Roger Murray-Leach, in <i>Blake's 7 The Inside Story</i> by Nazzaro and Wells, he “turned the ship around, so it was drawn to look as if it was going one way but flew the other way. In fact, if you take the line of flow, the angles go with it to get a sense of speed, and we turned that around so the 'wings' all canted forwards, not backwards”. Which would seem to blow that theory out of the water. In any case, the editor who added this point attributed it to Matt Irvine, who didn't join the show until Season 2 after the <i>Liberator</i>’s orientation had been settled.</li>
<li>The last minute reprieve for the fourth season – this is now in the history section (or the article that leads from it)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This still leaves considerable scope for improvement. I would suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lead section needs to be expanded per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>. (Maybe leave this until after the article has been improved?)</li>
<li>“The series” section is unfocused – I would see that it should give one paragraph on the series' concept and setting: e.g. “Blake is a political prisoner who steals an alien spaceship and goes after the baddies in the Federation”, one paragraph on the series' influences and one or two paragraphs on the main themes of the series (Stephens and Moore's <i>Liberation</i> and Muir's <i>History and Critical Analysis of "Blake's 7"</i> would be useful references in this respect.</li>
<li>The “Plot Summary” could be reworked to incorporate the “End-of-season cliffhangers” section – I'll go to work on this over the next few days.</li>
<li>The “Music and Sound Effects” section – interesting but, perhaps, too detailed a section for an article that should be providing an overview of <i>Blake's 7</i> as a whole?</li>
<li>“Trivia” sections as a whole are frowned upon on Wikipedia these days. Most of what's here could either be deleted for being too obscure or trivial or incorporated somewhere into the main article.</li>
<li>The “Video and DVD” section should be renamed “Merchandise” and expanded to include the magazine, the annuals, the corgi models etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advice and opinions on these comments is sought please before I do any more damage :). <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_King_c3f1.html" title="User:Joe King">Joe King</a> 16:44, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
