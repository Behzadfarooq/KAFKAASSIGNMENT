<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../c/a/p/Capture_the_Flag_ddfe.html" title="Capture the Flag">Capture the Flag</a></b> - The classic schoolyard game, with a paintball twist. Teams start on opposing sides and attempt to acquire the opponents' flag while protecting their own. Victory is achieved by being the first team to hang the opponents' flag on the designated location at or near their own starting location. Also, victory can be achieved by eliminating (shooting) all the players on the other team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Neutral Flag or Center Flag</b> - Similar to Capture the Flag, except that the game starts with a single flag at the center of the field instead of one at each end. The winner is the team that brings the flag to the opponent's end of the field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Elimination</b> - The team that eliminates all of the players on the opposing team wins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Resurrection</b> - Similar to Elimination, except hit players may return to their team's starting station and re-enter the game as a live player.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Just Plain Crazy</b>" - There are other names for this game, e.g. Superman, Counterstrike, and Total Elimination. This game can be played with teams or individually. The players start on opposing sides and meet in the middle of the field. The end result is never good. The object of the game is to be the last player standing. This is achieved by players finishing their air supply, running out of paintballs, or leaving because of pain. The players do not get eliminated by one paintball hit, but rather by the inability to withstand the onslaught of paint from all angles and no minimum distance. This game is usually played at the end of the day when players want to "waste" their air and paint supply. Due to the violent nature of this game, this type of play is not common. Usually, the players end up drenched in paint and covered with welts.</li>

<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodsball.html" title="Woodsball">Woodsball</a></i></p>
<p>Woodsball, paintball's original format, is generally played in a wooded area large enough to hold dozens of players. Woodsball games usually take more time than speedball games, and players may take their time and stalk their opponents in this format. Also, as a generalization, woodsball markers are not designed to fire (cycle) as fast as their speedball counterparts as suppression by fire is not as important in woodsball as speedball. Instead, accuracy is a much more key issue in most woodsball games. Accuracy is so important because woodsball tends to be more of a stalking game than speedball and other variants. Since stealth is consequently such an issue, players will do all they can to keep their locations unknown to the opposing team(s). Paintball markers tend to be relatively loud when fired, and thus can betray a player's position to opposing players. In response, woodsballers often try to buy quiet markers or 'mod' their current markers to be more quiet when firing. Woodsballers tend to fire less as well, since it is harder to tell the location of an opposing woodsballer if that player fires sparingly, as the direction of the shots will be harder to place. To fire less often, players must have greater accuracy in order to maintain the same success rate as players who fire more often.</p>
<p>Many different game types may be played in woodsball. Center flag, capture the flag, total elimination, protect the president, hopperball, 21, civil war, and many other games limited only by the players' imagination.</p>
<p><a name="Speedball" id="Speedball"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Speedball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Speedball</span></h3>
<p>Speedball is a faster, more closer-quarters game than woodsball and is played on a field about the size of a basketball court or two. Artificial barriers (bunkers), often inflatable rafting material, plastic tubing, wood pallets or tires, are placed throughout the field for players to move between and take cover behind. Any material may be used and is usually placed in an open field in a symmetrical pattern, relative to the other side, in such a way as to give no advantage to one side or the other.</p>
<p>The close quarters foster a lot of movement and "bunkering", or running up to an opposing player's bunker and eliminating them from close range. Attributes concerning marker preference usually include high rate of fire rate (BPS, or balls per second), reduced weight and compactness of a Marker Setup. Players typically shoot much more paint in this style of play. Most national and local tournaments and leagues are built around the speedball concept.</p>
<p>Speedball can further be broken down into several popular different varieties.</p>
<p>Airball is now the most popular form of Speedball, having supplanted Hyperball in 2002-2003. Airball uses inflatable barriers constructed of vinyl (similar to what would be found on a whitewater raft). The concept was introduced for ease of tournament set-up/takedown/transport. Originally, all bunkers were supplied by off-field generators, with tubes running between bunkers and to the generators. As of 2006, the more common form is self-contained, and filled with air through a leaf blower or some other type of pump.</p>
<p>Hyperball is another popular form using plastic culvert pipe of different sizes and shapes on a Rectangular field. This concept was brought forth by WDP (makers of the Angel line of markers) in the mid to late nineties as a spectator and TV friendly way of playing for tournaments.</p>

<p>Scenario paintball games are often large scale games with a theme, usually Historical, Fantasy or Science Fiction involving hundreds of people, such as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a>, or modern scenarios such as storming a building and rescuing <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hostage.html" title="Hostage">hostages</a>. Scenario games can last hours or even days, and bigger games often have player re-insertions at set intervals. Skirmish Paintball in <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Thorpe%2C_Pennsylvania_c4a6.html" title="Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania">Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania</a> holds several every year, including The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Stalingrad_f1b5.html" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> and the Battle of Normandy, which drew more than 3,000 attendees in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.

<p>Modern tournament paintball, or tourneyball, has developed in earnest since roughly 1990. Woodsball tournaments, the original and once the most popular format, have largely given way to speedball fields, whose inflatable bunkers can be moved between matches or tournament stages. The most common tournament formats pit two teams of three, five, or seven players against each other. Teams play several other teams, accumulating points in each game for acts such as being the first to get the flag, bringing the flag to the goal, eliminating opposing players, and having non-eliminated players left at the end of the game.</p>
<p><b>Tournament Formats</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capture the Flag</b> - The original tournament format used in wooded play. Teams must capture the opposing team's flag and return it to their own flag station, receiving extra points for eliminating opponents and having players remaining at the end of the game. Capture the flag may be played with teams of various sizes from 3 to 20, commonly noted by referring to the event as a "5-man", "7-man","10-man", etc, depending on the number of players on a team. 20- and 15-man tournaments on wooded fields were common in the 1980's, but modern tournaments are usually 3-man, 5-man or 7-man and played on grass fields with manmade obstacles.</li>
<li><b>Centerflag</b> - Like Capture the Flag, only with one flag in the middle of the field that both teams try to bring to their opponent's flag station on the opposite side of the field. Like Capture the Flag, Centerflag is commonly played in 3-man, 5-man and 7-man formats.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>X-Ball</b> - A newer tournament format, X-Ball pits two teams against each other in multiple rounds of Center Flag played one after another until time runs out. The winner is the team with the most victories after two 16- to 20-minute halves. Teams of up to 18 players field five players at a time. Unlike most tournament formats that forbid players to communicate with people on the sidelines, X-Ball allows a coach to advise players on the field. Players who receive penalties are not permanently removed from the game, but placed in a hockey-like penalty box for several minutes. X-Ball has taken root at the national level, although variations are found in regional and local competition. The X-Ball Light variant has one period, typically 15 minutes long. The first team to reach a set point total (commonly 5 or 7 points), or the team with the highest point total after game time has elapsed, wins the match.</li>
</ul>
<p>X-Ball was briefly considered for Summer Olympic sport status some time ago, but was rejected. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Reball" id="Reball"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Reball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reball</span></h3>
<p>A "reball" is a solid, dense-foam substitute for a paintball. Reballs are the same size as normal paintballs but weigh less, and do not contain a paint filling. While they do not break open to leave a paint mark on players, the lack of filling makes them useful for indoor locations where accumulation of paint from broken paintballs would be a problem. A reball is more expensive than a paintball, but since they can be reused, they are cheaper over the long term. Some paintball parks have added dedicated reball fields. The primary use of reballs, as intended initially by the manufacturer, is as a practice aid for teams who wish to practice and save money by using reusable ammunition. Other manuacturers have made Reball duplicates like the V-Ball, a <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velcro.html" title="Velcro">velcro</a> (hence the name V-Ball) reusable paintball. Reballs are also used at a lower velocity because of their inability to break on whoever they hit. For example, a Regular paintball will normally be shot at 280-290 ft/s, but a Reball is supposed to be used at around 250 ft/s. Reballs themselves were preceded by Lazerballs by Brass Eagle. These were of a larger caliber than a paintball, and designed specifically for Family Fun Centers and other venues where paint clean-up would be an issue.</p>
<p><a name="Pump_play" id="Pump_play"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Pump play">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pump play</span></h3>
<p>A pump action paintball marker operates on the principle that the player has to chamber a new ball after each shot by pumping or sliding the marker's cocking mechanism back allowing a new ball to enter the chamber, then pushing the cocking mechanism forward with the aid of the pump handle, to close the chamber requiring a total of two separate movements to "load" the marker. After loading, the paintball marker is ready to expel the loaded paintball.</p>
<p>A popular style of pump play is the use of what is referred to as a Stock Class marker. Stock Class refers to the marker configuration, reminiscent of the original paintball markers of the early to mid 1980's, and forsakes the use of hoppers and a constant propellant source. Stock Class play utilizes a ten to fifteen round tube parallel to the barrel of the marker. Typically, the feed tube of paintballs is mounted over the top of the marker running flush with the body of the marker so as not to allow any stacking of paintballs over the chamber and hence requiring the marker to be tipped (rocked) forward or backward before being pumped (cocked). The complete action for loading another paintball into the chamber of a Stock Class marker is called "Rock &amp; Cock". 12 gram CO2 powerlets are also incorporated into Stock Class rules so as to require the player to recharge the marker with propellant after roughly 20-40 shots depending on the efficiency of the marker.</p>
<p>Although this style has lost popularity due to modern paintball technology greatly increasing the speed of paintball guns as well as their overall performance, pump tournaments in both the Stock Class and in another class, in which hoppers and propellant other than 12 gram cartridges, continue to be held and in fact attract some of the most popular professional tournament players to guest play on these pump teams.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Slingshot Paintball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Slingshot Paintball</span></h3>
<p>Slingshot paintball is a fast growing alternative among many recreational paintball players because of the low cost of play and the variation of strategy involved in the game. Players attempt to shoot opponents with paintballs that are fired from slingshots rather than standard paintball guns (or markers). Even though manufactured slingshots <i>do not</i> shoot faster than <b>300 fps</b> <a href="http://norcalimmortals.blogspot.com/2005/08/how-about-slingshot-paintball.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://norcalimmortals.blogspot.com/2005/08/how-about-slingshot-paintball.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.network54.com/Forum/400261/message/1144973176/last-1146104916/slinngshot+speed" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.network54.com/Forum/400261/message/1144973176/last-1146104916/slinngshot+speed" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.archeryexchange.com/products/novelty/slingshots/sst-115.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archeryexchange.com/products/novelty/slingshots/sst-115.shtml" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.groupsrv.com/hobby/about50435.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.groupsrv.com/hobby/about50435.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, most paintball fields don’t allow them. A normal game usually requires <i><b>all</b></i> players to use slingshots, but some games may allow certain players to use pump action markers vs. slingshots, such as Cowboys and Indians.</p>
<p>Slingshot paintball was first played in the late 90s by a group of friends in Mountain Home, Idaho. The game was promoted by inventor Ron M. Smith after discovering the benefits of using slingshots instead of paintball guns. The game quickly spread throughout Idaho, Utah, and other states, and soon after, fans had their own website by 2005 <a href="http://www.slingshotpaintball.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.slingshotpaintball.com" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>The gear required to play slingshot paintball basically consists of a slingshot, a paintball mask, and a pocket (or pouch) to carry the paintballs in. Players normally prefer to wear fingerless gloves for protection. Each player carries a designated number of paintballs, anywhere from 3 to 20, depending on the game that is being played.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to playing slingshot paintball over traditional paintball. Mainly, the cost of a slingshot is much less than that of a paintball marker. On average, a game of slingshot paintball requires about 10 paintballs to play, compared to an average game of standard paintball, which often exceeds 200 paintballs. Another advantage of using a slingshot is its ability to shoot almost silently. This advantage often enables players to eliminate opponents without revealing their location. The primary benefit to slingshot paintball is strategy. Since players can only shoot one paintball at a time before reloading, players must use skill, stealth, and teamwork to accomplish their objective.</p>

Tournament paintball is played by the same rules as normal paintball, but in a more competitive environment. There is a set number of people on each team (commonly three, five or seven), and modern tournament play is primarily speedball. Due to the competitive nature, most tournament players use high-end markers capable of higher rates of fire. The major leagues are National Professional Paintball League (NPPL), Paintball Sports Promotions™ (PSP), and Millennium Series. The leagues consist of a whole circuit of paintball tournaments, but smaller regional and locally-sponsored tournaments are very common.</p>

<p>Players usually fall into one of three categories: recreational, scenario or big game, and tournament.</p>
<p>The recreational class of player encompasses a range of levels of involvement in the sport, from occasional players like members of church groups or people attending birthday or bachelor parties, through more regular players who may own their own entry-level equipment, but do not play in tournaments. Recreational players may play at commercial, insured paintball parks, or on private land.</p>
<p>According to the Sporting Goods Manufacturer's Association, of the approximately 10 million people who participate in paintball annually only about 15% (1.5 million) of them play 15 or more times per year. These frequent participants can generally be divided into two groups: Scenario players and tournament players. While these two groups differ in style of play and appearance, the most devoted members of both groups may spend thousands of dollars per year not only on paintball equipment, but also on travel to paintball events.</p>

<p>Most players play, and most scenario games and tournaments occur, at commercial, insured paintball parks. A paintball park may be an area of woods, a complex of speedball fields, or a combination. Additionally, some commercial fields offer fast-paced indoor game play, often with multiple rooms. Commercial fields adhere to specific safety and insurance standards and have employed staff (often called referees) whose job is to make sure players are instructed in proper play and play in a manner that insures all participants' safety.</p>
<p>Some players play on private land, often referred to as "renegade" play or "out-law ball". While less expensive, and often less structured than play at a commercial facility, due to the lack of standards, instruction, and oversight, the vast majority of injuries incurred by paintball players occur in a "renegade" setting. Private landowners may also be liable for injuries sustained on their property, especially if there are any fees for play.</p>
<p>Major scenario and tournament events may sometimes occur at other locations like fairgrounds, military bases, or stadiums, essentially creating a temporary paintball park, including the trained staff and insurance found at permanent commercial paintball parks.</p>

<p>Prospective players should check the individual field rules where they are playing. Variations of the following rules are in effect at most fields, but the number one rule, is mask/goggle safety. The following are the most common regulations.</p>
<p><a name="Safety_rules" id="Safety_rules"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Safety rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Safety rules</span></h3>
<p>There are three primary safety rules for paintball which apply to all games: Players must always wear a paintball goggle and mask system when on the field, even after the game has ended, the paintball marker used by a player may not shoot paintballs that travel faster than 300 feet per second (about 200 mph), and barrel plugs must be in at all times when not in the playing area. The velocity limit may be lower than 300 feet per second depending on the size of the playing area, or insurance or legal considerations. Paintball is an extremely safe sport when these three rules are always followed.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Tagging rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tagging rules</span></h3>
<p>Generally if a player is marked anywhere on his or her body or equipment with a <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarter_%28United_States_coin%29_9ab9.html" title="Quarter (United States coin)">US Quarter</a> size mark or larger, that player is considered as having been eliminated. If the player believes the paintball broke before impact, or if he cannot see the area to confirm a hit, then he should call for a paint check (by yelling "paint check"). A referee will come over and make a judgment call. Usually, if there is any spot that isn't clearly a hit or larger than a US Quarter, it will not be considered a hit. While being paint checked, the referee may call the player “neutral” and he may not be marked or advanced on while being checked (this rule may or may not apply).</p>
<p>Even if the player is not marked, exclaiming "I'm hit" will eliminate him from the game. Players should always check to see if a paintball that has hit them has indeed broken. A paintball may simply bounce off a player’s body, and will not count as a hit. Players should always call for a paint check on another player, if they believe they have marked an opponent as some players will wipe off the paint and continue playing. This practice is widely considered cheating and may result in the player being banned from the field. In most instances a penalty of “1 for 1” will be called. This is where the cheating player and an additional teammate are eliminated from the current round. Paintball, like most sports, is considered a game of honor and the player has to judge himself first and then ask a ref if they are unsure.</p>
<p><a name="The_X_foot.2Fmeter_surrender_rule" id="The_X_foot.2Fmeter_surrender_rule"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: The X foot/meter surrender rule">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The X foot/meter surrender rule</span></h3>
<p>Some fields require that if a player is within a certain distance of an unaware opponent (usually 10 to 15 feet or closer), they must demand their <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrender_%28military%29.html" title="Surrender (military)">surrender</a> (by yelling "Surrender!" or "Mercy!") before they may open fire. If the opponent complies verbally, or by raising their hand or marker, they are considered marked and are out of the match. However, if they refuse and attempt any hostile action (such as turning to fire), the challenging player may fire upon them. While waiting for a response, however, the player can still be hit by other opponents. Shooting players at close distances is dangerous and should not be done if it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>In almost all tournament play, there is no surrender rule. If a player catches an opponent off guard, they are free to fire at him. Moves such as a 'run through', where a player sprints down the field shooting as many of the opposing team as he can, have developed over time and are now very important plays. Another popular move is "bunkering" this refers to running/charging up to the bunker or barricade that an opposing player is behind and tagging them at very close range. The offensive player moves as close to the opponent as possible, so that they can catch the defensive player off guard, giving them little to no time to react, and minimizing their chance of missing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Safety">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Safety</span></h2>
<p>Safety is paramount while playing paintball and is strictly enforced. This means players must wear only paintball-specific goggles and facemasks at all times while playing, even if they are out. Under no circumstances should eye protection ever be removed on a live field.</p>
<p>If a player’s mask is covered with paint, sweat, or dirt, and they cannot see well enough to safely get off the field, they should stand with both hands in the air and yell (usually "Fogged!") for assistance. A ref or another player will lead them to a safe area.</p>
<p>If a player’s mask falls off during a game, he should quickly lie face down on the ground, Yell "Mask!" or "Goggles!" to alert all players of this issue, with one arm covering his eyes, and another over his head. This position gives the best chances of avoiding injury in this dangerous scenario. Players who see another player in this position should stop all game activity and call out for a cease-fire so that referees can safely deal with the situation according to their training.</p>
<p>Besides mandatory use of masks, fields require that markers don't fire above a certain velocity. This reduces the possibility of mask failure, and will leave less of an injury when a player is hit. The allowed speeds usually range from around 250 Feet Per Second to the highest allowed velocity of 300 ft/s (just because a gun's velocity is higher doesn't mean it will shoot better). Velocities exceeding 300 ft/s will break uncovered skin and cause bleeding.</p>
<p>Many players involved in outlaw games will tend to have their guns firing "hot" or above this velocity. It is recommended that everyone playing outlaw games, get their guns "chronoed" or speed check before playing. Chronographs or "Chronos" can be found relatively cheap and can greatly help the safety of everyone playing.</p>
<p>Changes in temperature/ atmospheric pressure, and paint will affect marker velocity; it is therefore strongly advised markers are "chronoed" several times throughout the day. Players involved in outlaw games are strongly recommended to purchase a chronograph to ensure safe play at all times. Chronographing is also highly recommended when changing anything on a marker such as disassembly, different barrel etc.</p>
<p>Another safety rule players should be aware of and follow is keeping their marker's safety on when not actively playing. Furthermore, when not playing a game, markers should have their barrels blocked by a barrel condom (barrel blocker, bag, or sock). It is a tough bag which covers the end of the barrel and attaches to the marker via a cord of some sort. This prevents accidental shots from leaving the barrel. Barrel plugs (a plug pressed into the end of the barrel) used to be used, however the barrel sock has taken over, and many fields do not allow plugs anymore. Barrel plugs are prone to being shot out of the barrel, leaving the barrel open and unsafe.</p>
<p>Paintball has proved to be an extremely safe sport and its good record comes from the uncompromising emphasis on safety.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Common misconceptions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Common misconceptions</span></h2>
<p>Various misconceptions are held by players as well as people who have never seen a paintball marker.</p>
<p><b>War and Violence</b></p>
<p>One common misconception is that paintball simulates war and encourages violence, due chiefly to the noticeable resemblance of some markers to firearms and the donning of camouflage for woodsball. Additionally, paintball has been used for close combat training by both law enforcement agencies and anti-terrorist groups.</p>
<p>The paintball community generally works to dispel this image, increasing the public's exposure to paintball is seen as crucial to breaking down stereotypes. Paintball fields do not tolerate physical violence (contact with an opponent is usually forbidden) nor even verbal abuse. Today's markers are generally not designed to mimic firearms. And "scenario" paintball games seek to re-enact historic wars and battles, not to encourage violence.</p>
<p>Tournaments include aspects of traditional sports: players wear bright colors as fans watch the action behind safety netting and film crews record nearly all top competitive events for DVD or TV.</p>
<p><b>Injury and Danger</b></p>
<p>Another common misconception of paintball is that it is dangerous. <a href="http://www.ottersccustoms.com/newbie.html#safe" class="external text" title="http://www.ottersccustoms.com/newbie.html#safe" rel="nofollow">Recent statistics</a> have indicated that paintball may be safer than traditional sports, such as football. Paintball fields require anyone near the field to wear a face mask, and that markers shoot at a velocity of less than 300 feet per second. Many fields forbid the use of <i>full-auto</i> markers, which are illegal in many countries (for example the UK).</p>
<p><b>Quality of Equipment</b></p>
<p>Many players believe that more expensive and higher quality equipment determines how well a person plays. Good equipment does lend a competitive edge, but it is possible to get good results with relatively inexpensive equipment... only IONs</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Agg</b> - Agg is a commonly used term for paintball fads. Things such as designer headwraps, to spray painted masks are agg. HK Army at this time is the leader in Agg. Pronounced like and short for "aggressive".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Barrel Tag/Tap Out</b> - When a player is close enough to reach out with his or her gun and physically tag the opposing player, the tagging player may say "Barrel tag!" and simultaneously, and gently, tag the other player with the barrel still on the gun. This counts for an elimination, even if the players are on the same team. This technique is not always allowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Barrel Smoothie</b> - A 'barrel smoothie' generally refers to an excess amount of broken paint that drips from the barrel after several paintballs had been broken inside of it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bonus ball</b> (n)- Hits a player receives after being eliminated, usually while leaving the field of play. A player may receive bonus balls due to the increasingly fast rate of fire of markers in tournament play, walking through a spot another player is shooting, or occasionally by being intentionally shot by an opponent. Sometimes referred to as "Extra Love" and "Bonus Ball loving". These usually happen in tourney setting and also result in penalties; it is also used to prevent Dead Man Walking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bounce</b> - Term which signifies when a paintball makes contact with a player but does not break on them. It in turn bounces off of them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bunker</b> (n) - A non-natural obstacle on the field of play suitable for use as cover. In wooded play, a bunker may be a large fallen log, a collection of wood, a constructed obstacle of wood, barrels, or other material, or even a dug-out depression in the ground. In speed ball, virtually all objects placed on an otherwise empty grass or dirt field are "bunkers", and in most modern speed ball tournaments, bunkers are inflatable vinyl obstacles (like river rafts with more basic and varied shapes).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bunker</b> (v) - When a player is behind a bunker, the bunker blocks that player's view of the field in front of him, forcing the player to occasionally look out from behind the bunker (and risk being hit) or rely on teammates to prevent opposing players from advancing through that area. If the teammates are looking the wrong way, or there are no teammates left, an opposing player can often run straight up to the player's bunker without the player seeing him and "bunker" the player by shooting directly over or around the side of the cover.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bunker Bitch</b> - A player who spends more time than necessary behind a bunker, and is speculated to make getting ultimate cover from one the highest priority.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Caveman</b> - A player who, like a rogue, does his own thing on the field, but keeps an especially low profile.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Chop</b> - Sometimes a marker may fire when a paintball has only fed partially into the breech. The force of the bolt of the marker moving forward will then cut the paintball in half inside the marker's chamber, creating a rather unpleasant mess that will prevent the marker from shooting accurately until cleaned. However many high-end markers have 'eyes', technology that prevents the marker from firing until it sees that a ball is completely in the chamber.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Chop a Snake</b> - A process in which one player will fire over the head of an opponent located behind a snake, pinning him down, while another will advance along the length of the snake eliminating the opponent.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Condom</b> - Also referred to as the barrel condom or barrel bag, it is the safety device that slides over the front of the barrel to prevent anyone from being shot by mistake if a player were to accidently discharge their marker while outside a playing field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dead Man Walking</b> - where a person is shot, but the paint doesn't break. The person pretends he is out, and walks toward their box. He then proceeds to shoot everybody on the other team. In most tournaments this is illegal due to the fact that a player is acting as if he's out only to gain an advantage on the other team or players.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Eye/Eyes/ACE ( Anti-Chop Eye(s) )</b> (n) - An infrared detection system installed on electronic markers. There are two types; break beam and reflective. Break beam incorporates an infrared beam fired across the breech to a sensor. When a ball enters the breech of the marker, it breaks the infrared beam, telling the marker that a ball is ready to be fired. Reflective sends an infrared beam across the breech from one eye. If a ball enters the breech, the infrared beam will be reflected back into the eye, indicating that a ball is ready to be fired. These electronic infrared systems help prevent chopping in markers and help markers reach higher rates of fire consistently.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Flank</b>- A Strategy used in both speedball and woodsball where usually one or two people provide cover fire while other team members move around the sides. Since the opposing force is preoccupied with the people providing cover fire they are usually unaware of the force coming around the side (or even the back side). The opposing force is easily taken out.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fogged</b> - This term typically refers to a player who's visor has fogged up so badly that</li>
</ul>
<p>they cannot see.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ghost</b> - A player who continues to play after being tagged out, but keeps an extremely low profile, often playing in non-populated portions of the same field, or hanging around the back or sides.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Gogged</b> - An expression denoting that a player has been hit directly in the mask by</li>
</ul>
<p>another player.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gun Whore</b> - An individual who collects more paintball markers than he uses. Frequently, 'gun whores' will trade out one marker almost immediately after receiving it for another.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Guppy</b> - One of the many terms used when referring to the large tubes used to carry paintballs on the field, the industry refers to them officially as pods.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Headcheck</b> - A term used to describe the tactic of giving a quick look out from protection to get a better idea of the enemies' position just before shooting. Used often in tournament play seconds before a <b>snapshot</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hopper</b> - The hopper is simply the magazine for the paintball marker, sizes do vary but the average is about 200 rounds. While some designs utilize a hopper that feeds balls to the gun via gravity placing it directly above the bolt, some other designs use a Hopper built off the side of the marker using a pneumatic system to feed them into the breech of the marker. Other hopper designs are offset to the right or left, or recently set forward and below the barrel. Many hoppers now are mechanical "force feed" hoppers, in which the paint is forcefully fed into the gun by the hopper.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Hoser</b>- A hoser is a player who shoots excessive amounts of paint, leading the bunker he was shooting at to drip paint.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kamikaze</b> - A player who plays with little regard to being hit for the sould purpose of tagging other players out. An example is a kid who proceeds to sprint down the field, shooting aimlessly at the opposition hoping to get a hit, while taking no cover.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Lit up</b> - An expression connotating overwhelming victory. It is often used to describe someone who has been marked several times. It can also be used to describe a situation in which an individual or team exercised a great advantage to defeat the other player or team. This is a dangerous practice prevalent in tournament play which results in penalties being issued to the offending team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Noob</b> - A new player.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Nub</b> - An experienced player who exibits characteristics of new players.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Own</b> - To tag a player in a manner that is often noticed by a majority of other players. To get 'owned' can refer to this, but to many other players it can also be being tagged in an obvious place in a humorous manner.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Paint Check</b> - When an official or another player inspects a player for hits. Necessary because hits on hard equipment may not be noticed by the player, and hits that do not leave a mark do not count, so a player may need another person to check to see if a hit broke when it is on an area of the body the player cannot readily see.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pawn</b> - Any player who is often 'used' by the rest of his team in situations where his/her value is less than significant in that particular game. One example is a newer player who is sent to the most 'dangerous' parts of the field in order to simulate what might happen if the rest of the team were to proceed into that part.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ramping</b> (v)- A feature enabled in many aftermarket electronic marker 'mod boards' that functions as de-facto full-auto; while in ramping mode, pulling the trigger faster than a preset lower limit (typically 5 or more times a second) causes the marker to "ramp" to its maximum preset rate of fire, which can exceed 20 balls per second, or to fire as quickly as the hopper can supply balls to the breech. Many "ramp boards" also incorporate elaborate schemes to conceal this feature from tournament referees, including a simple "panic button" This panic mode is found mainly on cheating boards. The "Panic button" is a trigger press sequence to turn ramping off before a marker can be confiscated and tested, and randomized rate of fire to mask the fact that the trigger activity doesn't match the actual firing of paintballs. In response to the popularity of ramping (and the difficulty of catching violators), some organizations have abandoned a strict semi-auto-only policy and adopted a 15 ball-per-second cap in its place. This allows referees with sound-activated timers to monitor rate of fire during games.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ref</b> - Short for "Referee".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Rogue</b> - A player who generally does his or her own thing on the field, often refusing to follow the game plans of head 'authorities' of their respective teams.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Snake</b> (n)- In hyperball, speedball, x-ball, and airball a snake is a long, low structure (less then 1 meter/3 feet high) usually located either in the middle or to one or both sides of a field. The snake is a unique setup because it allows a player to advance a considerable distance while still being protected from being hit from most locations on the field.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Snapshooting</b> is a method, used in paintball, to begin shooting before leaning out from behind a bunker in order to have a better chance of hitting a target. This is a common practice used in tournament play.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Surrender</b>- This is yelled by the shooter if s/he holds an upper hand on an opponent within a close range; this is done to give the enemy a chance to surrender without being shot. This rule is widely used amongst many new players and paintball parks. Much like barrel tagging, however, it is not always allowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Tanks</b> - This refers to the C02, Air, or nitrogen cylinders or tanks used to power a paintball gun's ability to fire, in most cases the tank is screwed directly into the marker however, some players use a coiled hose that allows them to carry the tank in another location of their person removing extra weight from the marker. The exception to the gases named above is with the <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tippmann.html#C-3" title="Tippmann">Tippmann C-3</a>, which is specifically designed to run on propane, though this gas should not be used with any other marker.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Tricked out</b> - A term used to describe a gun that has numerous upgrades and enhancements.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pimp</b> - A player who relentlessly gets other players to carry out his biddings on the field, without having any 'authority' as team leader for that particular game. 'Pimps' can also be considered to last throughout each game where he 'uses' other players, using most of his skills to keep a low profile.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pod Bitch</b> - A term used to describe a person who stands on the sidelines and fills up pods with paintballs for players.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Wiping</b> - Refers to the illegal act of cleaning off a hit before a referee sees so the player can keep from being eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Remote</b> - A coiled hose connected to a nipple on a gun which channels CO2 from a tank on the player's harness. Used to prevent being encumbered with a heavy tank affixed to one's gun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every paintball field has its own lingo for various obstacles, bunkers, and landmarks that are unique to the site. Prospective players should always familiarize themselves with the terms used by other players beforehand.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladestorm_Sandbox_Paintball_8c76.html" title="Edit section: Scenario/Big Game Lingo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scenario/Big Game Lingo</span></h2>
<p>Scenario games have their own set of lingo in addition to the standard paintball jargon above.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>APV</b> - Acronym for Armored Paintball vehicle, also called a tank. These include both land, and in some case, water vehicles. A typical APV is equipped with a LAW launcher or handheld or mounted paintball markers. Typically, they are enclosed to protect the operators, and can only be eliminated by a direct hit from another LAW rocket. Due to the nature of being built custom made, a plethora of tank designs can be seen across the scenario world. Also see "PAV".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Armband Tape</b> - Used to identify what team a player is on. Tape is literally colored duct tape. Typical armband team colors are generally blue and red. Other colors such as brown, yellow, white, black, etc. can be used to designate special job positions, such as demolitions, engineer, medic, pilot, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>BBD</b> - Barrel Blocking Device. Another term for a barrel sock (barrel condom), although this term can be used in a more general sense to mean anything that effectively stops the marker from injuring another person accidentally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>CO</b> - Commanding Officer. See General.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Demolitions</b> - Job position in which the player is allowed to use demolitions equipment such as satchel charges or LAWs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Engineer</b> - Job position which has the ability to repair destroyed structures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>General</b> - The General, or CO, is the leader of one of the two sides in the scenario. He is the one responsible for issuing missions and keeping his team's morale up. When he is not available, his XO takes over.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>GSRP</b> - Acronym for General Scenario Rules of Play. These are the basic set of rules that many scenario games follow. Even if your scenario producer does not use the GSRP, it is still a good idea to know the basic rules.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Medic</b> - Job position which allows the player to "heal" other players by physically wiping the paint off of the other player. A common strategy is to "lure" medics out into the open by shooting one of his team mates who calls for him. Then the medic can be taken out as well. Medics can not heal themselves, and can not be healed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>PAV</b> - Paintball Armored Vehicle. See APV for more information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pilot</b> - Job position which allows the player to "pilot" a "helicopter" or other such transportation vehicle. These pilots can not be shot at, nor anyone else on the "helicopter", nor can the occupants of the helicopter shoot at any other players until they are dropped off.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>LAW Launcher</b> - A device used to eliminate APVs, bunkers, or other enemy players. Typically constructed like a spud gun, they are used to fire LAW Rockets or <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabot.html" title="Sabot">sabot</a> rounds at the enemy. Because of the increased mass of the projectile, muzzle velocity is generally chronographed far lower, around 230-250 feet per second at the most.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>LAW Rocket</b> - Typically a Nerf foam pocket vortex football. They are two inches in diameter, and fit snugly into the barrel of a LAW rocket. In most games, after firing they are dead props until a ref re-issues them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mission</b> - Missions are what determine the winner of the scenario game. The producer will send the coded missions to the Generals, who must then assign a force to accomplish them. Having a ref sign off on the mission card completes the mission and awards the team points for it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Prop</b> - Any object which the scenario producers have introduced into the field as a playable object for players in the scenario game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Producer</b> - The company or person responsible for organizing, running, and keeping the game safe. Some well known scenario producers include MXS, Viper paintball, Blackcat Paintball, and Wayne Dollack.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>RTS</b> - Real Time Strategy. A newer scenario game concept being heavily pursued by scenario producers such as Viper Paintball. The idea behind this setup eliminates the standard mission sequence and allows the two Generals to duke it out as they see strategically fit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Satchel Charge</b> - A kind of prop that is placed under referee supervision for triggered elimination or demolition. These are typically an alternative to LAWs for vehicle elimination.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>XO</b> - Executive Officer. Second in command to General.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Over Kill</b> - A player is tagged more than necessary.</li>
</ul>
