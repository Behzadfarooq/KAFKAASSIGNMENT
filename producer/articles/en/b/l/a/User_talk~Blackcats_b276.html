<p>With regard to <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, you seem reasonable, yet we disagree as to the evidence.

<p>I am unclear what I have failed to communicate. Please ask a specific question. The best that I can guess is that you refuse to accept that Bush's behavior could be due to his incompetance rather than some planned scheme. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 04:30, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"why I or anyone else should believe more than President Bush and his friends are liars and incompetents" That does not make sense. I just want to be sure that I'm clear on what exactly your question is before I respond. Does this mean "[should you believe] that more people than just Bush and his friends are liars and incompetents" or "that Bush &amp; Co. are more than just liars and incompetents" or that "Bush &amp; Co. are more than incompetent and are liars"?... If you could clear up this confusion this would help me to answer. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 04:39, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just read "That's true that you shouldn't just take the site at its word, so I would invite you to look around that site for yourself and see whether or not it matches your preconcieved notions. Can you find any examples of "idle speculation" (other than the one page with the hypothetical theory)?... Blackcats 01:31, 29". - - - My problem here is motivation. I need some CLUE that it is not a waste of my time. I know all leaders are liars. All. I know everyone makes mistakes. Everyone. You, me, them. ... everyone. How are guesses without evidence about the fall of the towers useful for anything? There are a lot of things I can do with my time. I need something other than what I've read so far to convince me to spend hours. I'll spend minutes here and there on hunches and suggestions. But if you want hours, I need more than what you've supplied so far. I love TRUTH. But to me truth = logic+evidence and so far there is a lack of evidence. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 05:07, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>WAS - We're certainly in agreement with regard to the basic truth equation. Regarding evidence, I think the best first place for you to look would be to download and watch a short video clip of WTC 7 collapsing. You can do this at <a href="http://www.wtc7.net" class="external text" title="http://www.wtc7.net" rel="nofollow">wtc7.net</a>. Keep in mind that this 47 story steel framed structure was not hit by a plane or by any large pieces of the Twin Towers. Does its collapse look like a controlled demolition? Judge for yourself. Of course those 8 seconds or so of footage may not be enough to convince you, but hopefully it'll make you have more of an open mind. Also, is it not suspicious that most Americans haven't heard of this building - for all the coverage that there was of 9/11 - most Americans think only two large buildings came down taht day. Howcome the TV news only showed video of this once or twice and it was not repeated hudreds of times like the footage of the plane hitting the south Tower? There are a lot of other pieces of evidence that I could go into, but just one more for right now is the dust clouds that formed when the towers came down. Without explosives, what was the mechanism for so much concrete (all 220 floor slabs) to be pulverized into fine powder? More discussion and photos of this <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/collapses/concrete.html" class="external text" title="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/collapses/concrete.html" rel="nofollow">here (analysis)</a> and <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/dust.html" class="external text" title="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/dust.html" rel="nofollow">here (photos)</a>. And one more point for you to consider - if all the analysis like that at 911research.wtc7.net is without merit and has no good evidence to support it, then why would a respected professor like <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_E._Jones_96d2.html" title="Steven E. Jones">Steven E. Jones</a> not only find it compelling (and compelling enough for his paper to be published in a peer-reviewed journal), but why would he be willing to stake his entire reputation on it?

<p>I saw your comment at the 9-11 "wild guesses" article (smile) and responded "What I have read is different than what you have read. But the points you bring up are exactly the right points that matter, so the issue is the evidence for exactly the points you mention. Let's talk further at your talk page." I'm too tired to even read your above comment, but I'm really liking this conversation. I'll get back to you tomorrow.

<p>With regard to the 9-11 conspiracy article talk page where I responded "What I have read is different than what you have read. But the points you bring up are exactly the right points that matter, so the issue is the evidence for exactly the points you mention. Let's talk further at your talk page.": the key is the evidence behind those statements and the credibility of that evidence. If you care to go into that we can.<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:10, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>With regard to the comment on this page I was too tired to even read:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't care about the WTC 7 collapsing; I only care about the two that were hit by planes. Maybe WT7 was deliberatly destroyed to keep a secret that would have been revealed; or maybe it was an ammo depot; with the twin towers falling down all around it and on it anything is possible. Someone panicing and pushing a fail-safe button that destroys WTC 7 (or some such scenerio) doesn't prove the twin towers falling was also caused with planted explosives.</li>
<li>You ask "what was the mechanism for so much concrete (all 220 floor slabs) to be pulverized into fine powder?" It wasn't ALL turned into dust, most of it was carted away in chunks. The energy from all that weight falling all that distance is sufficient energy to create the dust that was created.</li>
<li>You say "if all the analysis like that at 911research.wtc7.net is without merit and has no good evidence to support it, then why would a respected professor like <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_E._Jones_96d2.html" title="Steven E. Jones">Steven E. Jones</a> not only find it compelling (and compelling enough for his paper to be published in a peer-reviewed journal), but why would he be willing to stake his entire reputation on it?" He concludes that his hypothosis "ought to be seriously, scientifically investigated and debated." He doesn't stake his career on it being right. He is instead embarking on a career that pays FAR better than physics: the book and lecture circuit. I don't say it has no merit, I say the hypothosis and the dats presented are to me less than compelling. I have an open mind, but I would not spend MY money investigating this hypososis. On the other hand, if publisising and talking about this hypothosis was going to make me a lot of money (and it will for him) then I'm sure I would unconciously find it far more credible and appealing. People's self interest color their judgements. I have no doubt he believes he is sincere. I have no doubt the evidence he provides looked suspicious to him and when he started getting involved with the whole thing he found a great deal of new found social and economic oportunity that made it emotionally and financially rewarding to continue on that path. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:10, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>"I don't care about the WTC 7 collapsing; I only care about the two that were hit by planes." Interesting that how a 47 story building came down is completely insignificant to you... "Maybe WT7 was deliberatly destroyed to keep a secret that would have been revealed" So that would mean that it was destroyed as part of a coverup. "Someone panicing and pushing a fail-safe button that destroys WTC 7 (or some such scenerio) doesn't prove the twin towers falling was also caused with planted explosives." What it does prove is that it had to have been set up for demolition at least several days before 9/11. Controlled demolitions require careful planning and setup. All of the explosive charges cannot be placed in a matter of hours - particuarly not on a day like 9/11. So whoever had the explosives placed would have had to have had advance knowledge of 9/11. If WTC 7 were destroyed by controlled demolition this would also prove that the official FEMA/ASCE and NIST teams, who produced reports on how it supposedly collapsed, either were intentionally deceptive or did not have the ability (for whatever reasons) to detirmine the true cause of its collapse. And this would cast serious doubt (to say the least) on the credibility of their reports regarding how the Twin Towers fell.</p>
<p>"[The concrete] wasn't ALL turned into dust, most of it was carted away in chunks." Show me some evidence of this. Have you found any photos of large chunks of concrete in the debris field? All the photos I've seen just show the steel beams and a lot of dust. Also the statements I've read and seen on video of firefighters and rescue workers all say that everything was pulverized into dust. I've you've got some evidence to the contrary, I'd be very interested to see it.</p>
<p>You say that Dr. Jones hasn't put his reputation on the line, but I think he clearly did - by endorsing analysis which others had dismissed as "conspiracy theory." If his analysis were without merit, it could easilly be debunked, and he'd be the laughing stock of all his colleagues. But he's sumbitted his work to peer reviewed journals. Now you've suggested that Jones may just have mercinary motives, but what about the editors of those journals that accept his work for publication? They're not marketed to the general public, but rather to the scholarly community, and their reputation depends on the scientific merit of what they publish. Also, nobody's asked you to spend your own money on the research. Jones has asked though that the NIST and the various government agencies release all the evidence they have so that it can be investigated by a truely independent group of scientists from around the world who would seriously consider the demoltion hypothesis (for both the Twin Towers and WTC7) along with other hypotheses that have been proposed by the previous investigations. Does this not sound reasonable to you?... <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 20:22, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

"Interesting that how a 47 story building came down is completely insignificant to you" look up number of deaths in the world per year. Calculate number per second. Now tell me again about what I should care about. I could have better phrased it as saying even if that building was deliberately destroyed it proves nothing about the twin towers. "So that would mean that it was destroyed as part of a coverup." No. The US has tons of secrets. Suppose that building had key <a href="../../../e/c/h/ECHELON_b865.html" title="ECHELON">ECHELON</a> stuff in it and was rigged with explosives "just in case" and the explosives were set off by a panicked person. Not a coverup, just keeping secrets as usual. My father was in military intelligence and I have had top secret USAF clearance. (but not now, I'm retired) The US has more military secrets than you can imagine. "official FEMA/ASCE and NIST teams, who produced reports on how it supposedly collapsed, either were intentionally deceptive or did not have the ability (for whatever reasons) to detirmine the true cause of its collapse. And this would cast serious doubt (to say the least) on the credibility of their reports regarding how the Twin Towers fell." No. The best lie is a half truth. There is no reason lies about one building implicate the report comments on the twin towers, although I have little doubt key facts were withheld for political reasons. I just think the covered up key facts probably had to do with mistakes and incompetance rather than an elaborate plan to blow up the twin towers. I don't know there were covered up key facts, but governments control by fraud and force, and excel at both. "Have you found any photos of large chunks of concrete in the debris field?" yes, I saw on TV dump truck after dump truck filled with the stuff as they carted it off. Scientists always "endorse analysis". Its their job: "give me money to study this". "easilly be debunked" and "laughing stock of all his colleagues" and "mercinary motives" completely misrepresents what I said and what I believe. "nobody's asked you to spend your own money on the research" I was suggesting others might feel likewise, sorry I miscommunicated. "Jones has asked though that the NIST and the various government agencies release all the evidence they have so that it can be investigated by a truely independent group of scientist from around the world who would seriously consider the demoltion hypothesis (for both the Twin Towers and WTC7) along with other hypotheses that have been proposed by the previous investigations. Does this not sound reasonable to you?" We have freedom of infoemation act. He can get released all data not deemed a secret. What was the government reponse to his request as per the freedom of information act? Or was his request simply a media ploy? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 20:55, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Blackcats, I was wondering if you happened to know whether or not the user who posted the misleading information about Alex Jones and pod theories is the same user that posted false information on Jones' biography about Jones throwing his support behind a political candidate who thinks he's god. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeenaR_f426.html" title="User:SkeenaR">SkeenaR</a> 22:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
