	    <p>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 (Exciting Pro Wrestling 8 in Japan) is a forthcoming professional wrestling video game released by THQ and developed by YUKE's Future Media Creators. The game is based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It will be the latest installment of the WWE SmackDown! series and is the successor to 2005's WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006. On March 31, 2006, THQ, YUKE's and WWE officially confirmed the game.</p>
<p>A PlayStation 3 version was also planned but has been cancelled. The developers publicly announced that they would rather concentrate their resources on other game systems. However, next year's SmackDown! game is planned for release on the PlayStation 3. There was also consideration over releasing the game on the Wii as the game's developers were waiting to learn more about the system. However, during a video interview, creative manager Cory Ledesma announced there are no plans for SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 to be released on the Wii.</p>
<p>Like the previous game, the game will be released on the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable. While the series has traditionally been exclusive to the PlayStation series of consoles, this game is also planned for release on Xbox 360 after a series of lackluster wrestling games THQ released on the original Xbox. This is the first time a game in the SmackDown! series is featured in two different console generations.</p>

<p>THQ says it will bring a more realistic fighting experience with a new analog control grappling system, enabling the player to throw their opponent anywhere they want, in contrast to previous preset animations. In the new system, grappling moves will also be affected by analog control, in contrast to the button-based system from preceding games. The chain reversal system has also been improved and now involves grapples as well as strikes. An option to switch to the previous control layout is also possible.</p>
<p>Move sets have been improved as well and now feature restrictions on specific moves for particular wrestler classes. Moves such as hurricanranas cannot be done by taller, heavier wrestlers and more power based moves cannot be performed by cruiserweights or divas.</p>
<p><br />
A lot more interactivity in the arenas will also be present such as fighting within the crowd. Signs and objects from the crowd can be used to beat down the opponent. One major feature included is the inclusion of environmental "hotspots" such as the ring ropes, steel steps and scaffolding which players can interact with. The PS2 version however has a restriction on crowd fighting and interaction for specific match types.</p>
<p>Voice chat will be in the game to communicate with other players in the online modes. This was a feature that was supposed to be included in the previous two SmackDown! vs. RAW games but was not included due to time constraints.</p>
<p>The graphics have also improved with each superstar consisting of 20,000 polygons for the Xbox 360 compared to the total of 500 from the PS2 version. Sweat from the wrestlers has now been included in the Xbox 360 version of the game.</p>
<p>Cory Ledesma, creative manager of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, announced in a video interview that the Season mode will be similar to the one featured in WWE SmackDown! Here Comes The Pain, featuring champion, challenger and generic storyline paths and more choices for the user. The season mode has been confirmed to last for ten years. It has been confirmed that season mode will have several new features, such as the inclusion of a replica WWE.com, where the player can purchase costumes, belts and legends, as well as read wrestler biographies and articles on developments in the season mode. Also included is WWE Magazine, where one can read about the current storyline, and the ability for wrestlers to switch brands throughout the season. Ledesma also announced that there will be improvements to the General Manager mode.</p>
<p>Ledesma confirmed that the game will have no new match types. However, there will be improvements in existing match types. The Money in the Bank variant to the ladder match will be added and all ladder matches will feature more flexibility in placing the ladders. The Tables match is also undergoing a complete overhaul, requiring players to build up momentum and store a finisher before being able to put an opponent through a table. An improved Hell in a Cell match has also been confirmed.</p>

<p>August 16, 2006 - With only a few weeks left to go before we kick off our annual SmackDown Countdown for WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, the amount of available information about the game has been kept to a minimum; it's the calm before the storm, if you will. But just to whet our readers' appetites a little before we get started, THQ has granted us access to a few new tidbits of information -- namely the confirmation of a handful of new superstars and a sneak peek at the final box arts for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and the Xbox 360 (pictured).</p>
<p>The box art may look familiar to those of you who have been perusing online retailers over the last 24 hours, as it started to appear on select outlets sometime yesterday evening. Trivia fiends should take note: this is the fourth time in eight games that Triple H has appeared on the cover in some form or another.</p>
<p>But on to the more pressing question: Which superstars have been confirmed for today? "Legend Killer" Randy Orton, "The Animal" Dave Batista, and the dog-toting diva, Torrie Wilson are the newest three to join THQ's growing lineup. The addition of this trio brings the current roster count to 12, which already included Shelton Benjamin, The Undertaker, John Cena, Triple H, Rey Mysterio, Booker T, Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, and Johnny Nitro.</p>
<p>We'll be back with one more update before our Countdown begins in early September. So be sure and check our media page below for some new screenshots added today (PS2 and Xbox 360) and remember to keep your eyes peeled for more.</p>
<p><a name="Improved_matches" id="Improved_matches"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazer14_Sandbox_51bb.html" title="Edit section: Improved matches">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Improved matches</span></h2>
<p>(Money in the Bank Match (New!)) After two consecutive WrestleManias, THQ has finally brought the wildly popular Money in the Bank match to SVR. In it, six different WWE superstars battle it out for a shot at the title from their particular brand (SmackDown or Raw).</p>
<p>Similar to a traditional ladder match, this contest places a briefcase with a championship contract suspended high above the ring. The first wrestler to successfully navigate his way to the top of a taller ladder and grab the briefcase wins the match. Being successful guarantees that superstar the right to a title shot any time they want. Sadly, the exact way in which this works during the career mode (re: if?) is still unknown. But at least we know that it's in there.</p>
<p>(Ladder Match) Before we reveal the changes in this match type, consider this bit of background info first: The moment in which Shelton Benjamin ran up a leaning ladder (which was resting against an already-setup ladder) and clotheslined Chris Jericho off the top rung at WrestleMania 21's Money in the Bank match served as inspiration for this year's improvements. In addition, last year's Rey vs. Eddie custody-deciding ladder battle (and the several spectacular moments it provided) also motivated the SmackDown team for this year. You can guess where this is going. SVR 2007 will indeed give players the ability to lean one ladder against another so that they perform running spears or clotheslines off of it. If that isn't enough, gamers can also position ladders into turnbuckles both vertically AND horizontally. This means that when you Irish whip an opponent into the steep-steps during a grapple initiation that you can perform four different kinds of attacks. You can use the ladder as an environmental grapple too -- just drag a fallen opponent towards a floor-bound ladder and you can sandwich him between it. Also, players can expect the ability to control how many times they can close it on him as well.</p>
<p>But that's not all. The way in which players can grab hanging championship belts has also been changed. As many fans probably remember, the ladder used to automatically fall down once users grabbed the title. Acquiring that belt was then accomplished by tapping the bejeezus out of the controller. No more. Now, the right and left analog sticks are used to reach for the strap via individual arms; Move the left stick up and the left arm extends, move the right stick and the right arms extends. And yes, if you move both up at the same time both arms will definitely reach for the belt simultaneous. Once the championship is in hand, the next thing to do is locate what THQ is calling its "sweet spot." As an example, if you grab the title with your left hand, the sweet spot can be found by moving the left analog stick around. The closer to the spot you get, the more the controller will rumble. A "Ladder Gauge" will then appear on the screen and start to throb and disappear. If the wrestler can hold onto the belt until the meter disappears, he'll free the title and win the bout. This same technique applies to the other two methods of grabbing the belt as well (right analog or both), but there's more risk involved when using two hands because if he doesn't find the sweet spot quick enough he'll fall off the ladder (after all, there isn't a free hand to anchor himself). Of course, the advantage is that two hands depletes the ladder meter faster than one.</p>
<p><br />
(Table Match) The last match type to get a big overhaul this year is the Table match. Previously, it was far too easy to break a table and there was no drama with setting it up in the first place. THQ hopes to correct that in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007.</p>
<p>This time, players who want to put their enemies through a table have to meet two separate requirements. Requirement number one is that your wrestler has a stored finishing move icon (easy enough) and requirement number two is about momentum --that meter must be filled as well. Once both of those goals have been reached, users can then send an opponent through a table.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that breaking a table doesn't just "happen." Once the table is set up (be it against a turnbuckle or in the center of the ring), users must Irish whip their opponents towards the thing to get them to lay or lean on it. Once that has been accomplished, gamers can then execute a finishing maneuver smash their way to victory.</p>
<p><br />
Tables are handled very differently this year. The good news is that there are different table finishers that depend on a variety of factors. Table placement affects the animations and moves that take place on it; superstar-specific finishing moves have been added in there as well. Play as Triple H, for example, and you can pedigree someone right through the top of the wood. What's more is that most superstars on the roster will have their own unique table finisher (no word yet on how many, though). Even better is that the way in which the closing moves are performed will get an upgrade too -- so expect a much a more cinematic presentation at the end moment.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is one other goodie worth mentioning: an all-new feature for SVR 2007 is the ability to double-stack tables. To do it, players just have to set one table up in the ring and then, while holding another table, walk towards the one that's already standing and tap the action button (X on PlayStation systems, A on the 360). This will set the second table on top of the first one. If you perform a finishing move on a double-stack, the wrestler on offense will climb the turnbuckle and superplex their victim through them.</p>
<p><br />
That's all for this week's SmackDown vs. Raw feature. Be sure and check back with us again in the near future for even more information, more superstars, and more media than anywhere else on the Internet!</p>
