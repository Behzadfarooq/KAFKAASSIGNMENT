<blockquote>
<p>Blaxthos, political articles de facto belong to those with the greatest axe to grind and/or the greatest time on their hands. Weasel words and bad (or no) citations are like chisel and mallet in the hands of these artists as they carve their POV into an article. I respect your boldness in tagging the obvious, but know this: your "bogus" instigation has just placed you toe to toe with a veritable Wiki-Bernini. Tread carefully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry for being cryptic. It was a warning (kindly meant). That, despite the fact that you are dead right, you must beware of the time and frustration commitment required to keep political philosophy articles scholarly and to a Wiki standard. You must contend with the closet bloggers - who will simply dismiss as "bogus" any notion that the POV in <i>their</i> artcle is disputable.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.16.120.14 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.16.120.14.html" title="User talk:24.16.120.14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.16.120.14_ea77.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.16.120.14">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I was just joking with the jealousy remark. No problem.</p>
<p>I am only tangentially participating in the RfC. I figured if people were to come to the article, there should be some showing that this is pure sour grapes by one holdout and that editors have reached a consensus. I was going to add my opinion to the RfC list page, but I think that would be against Wiki policy. That's why it's the first comment. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 23:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also, i like you reference to forms of communism which ignore practical reality, I seem unable to view the video linked there-to. Is there any more simple ascii/text or html kinds of explanations of your point?</p>
<p>Thanks again, Charles ...</p>

<p>I'm well aware of that fact and did, in fact, read the material. But yet the argument was going on and on and degenerating into mere personal attacks at the other person, and showed no sign of stopping. So I thought a definitive vote (which given your consensus you should easily win) would help finish the discussion rather than prolong it. And, to be fair to Cbuhl79, the original RfC concerned a different issue. You may think consensus had been reached over the whole wording; he (rightly or wrongly) disagrees. How do you foresee this argument ending if all he does is repeat his argument, and all you do is say you've already reached consensus. And your edit summary was far from assuming good faith, I might add. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 17:59, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think perhaps we have to agree to disagree over this. I think cbuhl is still acting in good faith (based on the tone of his postings) and doesn't think the issue is as cut and dried as you do. The vote I proposed <i>hadn't</i> already occurred - the current intro came after discussion (not a vote) at the end of the last RfC which had began on a different topic. So I don't see how I'm calling for "another" one. You say you'd planned to stop responding, but it had been going on for 5 days already with little progress. If you thought it was 'sour grapes' and not worth replying to, why did you bother responding for that time? And in any case, how was I to know you weren't going to continue ad infinitum - you showed no sign of personally stopping (well, you said "I think at this point further conversation is moot" but then replied twice more). I said earlier that I've thought about the issue and am largely indifferent as to which intro goes in - I'm not going to 'jump' in on a particular side. I'd been following the discussion for several days without commenting and thought it was getting nowhere, so suggested a poll, with agreement in advance to adhere to the result, might break the deadlock. But then you jump on me as if I've done something wrong. You shouldn't be afraid to defend your position, and if you think there was already a vote (an actual poll) on the issue in question can you point me to it because I can't find it.<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 07:07, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, he's trying arbitration now (although I suspect it won't be accepted as a case) and I don't want any further part in this.

<p>Thanks for taking the time to review <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> -- I'm not in a rush about GA status, and I really do appreciate the feedback. I've asked a friend to help me copyedit for grammatical errors in particular, and fixed any obvious flaws I could find on that front, including your examples.</p>
<p>With regards to POV and OR, I'd really appreciate examples of any sections or passages that seem problematic to you besides the White House dinner section, which I will work on. OR in particular -- You mentioned that certain thorns stick out, but I think I'm having trouble seeing them because I've been looking at the article for too long. I had intended to work on this a fair amount this week, both cleaning up and expanding a few things (the "early career" section in particular). I'm also interested to know which specific areas you felt needed greater depth of coverage.</p>

<dd>One more quick note -- I just saw your comment about this not being a former GA. I didn't realize I was supposed to leave both templates while renominating, but the article was listed as a GA for 3+ months. It was only delisted three days ago, and I only renom'ed it because the delisting editor indicated her objections were now fixed.

<p>Blaxthos, I'll surely take a look at the request, read it thoroughly, and make my statement known. I am however on my way out of town at the moment. I'm standing at the <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn-Opelika_Robert_G._Pitts_Airport_6b33.html" title="Auburn-Opelika Robert G.

<dd>I will definitely go make a statement; I'm actually in mid statement right now, pausing to reply here. After getting in late last night, and having to be back at the airport this morning, I was unable to <i>coherently</i> write much of anything at that point. I would hope this request is taken seriously, and not simply brushed off. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>18:06, 30 October 2006 <sub>(<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</sub></small>

<dd>I was starting to wonder if the ArbCom was on vacation, but it seems another member has finally issued an opinion; 1 Accept, 1 Reject...hopefully it will keep going in the positive direction.

<dd>Definitely a good sign. I was curious to see if the other members were active so I looked into their contribs and it seems they are all actively participating in ArbCom proceedings. Since we'll need all other members to vote accept, this could be tricky. Needs to be 5/1/0 I believe.

<p>You did an excellent job in the workspace in showing that there may be some sockpuppetry involved in this. I really think if the Arb gets accepted, we should look into the edits of Cbuhl, Trebor, and Kevin Bass, and make sure there are in fact three users, and not sockpuppets of each other. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 18:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added a comment to the ArbCom request, noting how disappointed I am in the way it's being operated. With a 4-2 vote, it's likely to be delisted. On a similar topic, I believe we're now dealing with another Cbuhl suckpuppet on the FNC talk page. They amazingly stop/start editing at the exact same time.

<dd>You and me both. It's amazing what lengths some people will go to in order to push their POV regardless of previous discussion. One of the things I do most is reverting vandalism, but I never expected to spend so much time arguing <i>one</i> point on <i>one</i> article. As far as sockpuppets, I'm not convinced one way or the other, but if it's just a coincidence, it is one hell of a coincidence. If anything, I'd agree that Cbuhl would be the sockpuppet of Mrmisc rather than the sockmaster. The arbcom was a definite disappointment. With 4 members willing to hear the case, 1 voting before any involved members made a statement, and several "active" members not even voting, it was not handled well. I'm not going anywhere either, so I guess we'll both be on the <i>task force</i> for a while to come.&#160;;-) -- <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">AuburnPilot</font></a><a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><sup><small>talk</small></sup></a> <small>04:03, 11 November 2006 (<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</small>

<p>Hi, after reading your request and studied a bit I think I can help you with this (though my "speciality" are direct personal attacks rather than excessive wiki-lawyering). As you said, what you like is an advisor rather than a "real" advocate, if you need something, please feel free to send me a message to my <a href="../../../i/m/a/User_talk%7EImaglang_20a4.html" title="User talk:Imaglang">talk page</a> or an <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Imaglang_3283.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Imaglang">e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>Now, about the case itself, what I see is that Cbuhl79 is violating any consensus policy there is in WP and that's the main point of everything he does. But, I would really need that you send me more details (some diffs) to fully understand what's happening. Meanwhile, I'll be looking the evidence in your userspace.</p>

<p>I apologize for not responding to your messages earlier, but I was tied up in real life and didn't have enough Wiki time to come up with a thoughtful response. I too am troubled by the behavior Cbuhl79 has exhibited and I admire the fact that you are willing to make the effort to bring this editor to account. Too often here on Wikipedia (myself included) we are unwilling to make this effort and ignore troublesome editors in hopes that they will eventually wander off. However, what is more important than confronting a troublesome user is preserving a good user, and I hope that you don't get so frustrated with this conflict that you get burned out on Wikipedia entirely. With that said, if Arbcom is unwilling to deal with the situation or feels that it is not significant enough for their attention (they are quite busy) there is no reason that Cbuhl79 cannot be observed by concerned individual administrators who can intervene if necessary if he decides to continue this sort of thing on other articles. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 23:44, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going to remove the deletion request. Instead of threatening to remove the article within 5 days, how about a little discussion first . . . an AfD request perhaps? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMyselfalso_5909.html" title="User:Myselfalso">myselfalso</a> 09:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, now come on, and for cryin' out loud, Blaxthos! Does this mean that each and every listing on WP is going to be placed up on AfD? Given that each listing grew out of their associated parents, what would you suggest -- that each list be reabsorbed into their parent articles? A lot of people put a lot of work (myself included) -- in good faith that they were doing things the right way. Are you saying that all of this was for naught? How about a better explanation of the rationale here! --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 15:29, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Using such a narrow interpretation would eliminate the vast majority of all similar lists on WP. It would certainly open up a can of worms, and defy the intent of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> if not the spirit (imo). While I understand the necessity of a restriction, when the lists in question are tied to an appropriately noted article, I would dare say they become encyclopaedic and outside the realm of WP:NOT by default. Otherwise, do we eliminate lists of state congressional representatives? Lists of newspapers owned by The New York Times? Historic lists of teams who have been in the National Football League? A reasonable line has to be drawn somewhere. --<a href="../../../m/h/k/User%7EMhking_b8d7.html" title="User:Mhking">Mhking</a> 15:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just voted delete. But it appears that these articles have a group of editors who are so numerous that a successful AfD is impossible.

<p>Maybe you should take your own advice, biographies are supposed to be presented in a NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW, as with anything else on Wikipedia. Your opinion does not override what the individual has presented to you as fact. The evidence is COURT DOCUMENTS, they are the FACTS of record.

<p>CNS stands for Cybercast News Service. It formerly stood for Conservative News Service but they changed the name a few years back. There is no doubt they have a conservative bias, just as there is no doubt the NY Times has a liberal bias. Having a bias does not preclude a source from inclusion in an encyclopedia. If it did, no publication could be cited. The fact is that CNS News is a well-respected news outlet that has broken several important stories, including stories about the Operation Iraqi Freedom Documents. While liberals may not like to read the stories CNS News chooses to cover, no one doubts the accuracy of the reporting. That is what matters to an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 12:35, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Night? Funny, here it is morning.&#160;:-) Wikipedia and its articles will never be complete, but will stay instead a expanding process.

By the way the British peers are notable by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28royalty%29_f89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)">Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)</a> and there is also a project to write articles to them all.

<dd>You're right, an article full of redlinks doesn't look good, however better than one without any links. Also it is hard work, after having created an article, to search where you can add appropriate wikilinks, which guide to the new article - preexisting redlinks can make this work a little bit easier.</dd>
<dd>The reason for the piping is simple. Peers or baronets have sometimes various Christian names and titles, but normally we use only one as articlename: in example the article of Gilbert James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby is located on <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Ancaster_c73c.html" title="Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster">Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster</a>, but he is also Gilbert James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 27th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. Therefore we pipe the redlinks to avoid double creations with different names or titles. <span style="color:darkgreen">~~ <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoe_4759.html" title="User:Phoe"><span style="color:darkgreen">Phoe</span></a> <sub><a href="../../../p/h/o/User_talk%7EPhoe_94bb.html" title="User talk:Phoe"><span style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkgreen">talk</span></a></sub> 14:31, 14 November 2006 (UTC) ~~</span>

<dd>PS.

<p>Blaxthos, civil libel actions are more common than criminal libel, but libel is a crime and can be prosecuted by the state. Check out this article on "Libel and the Law." <a href="http://www.tpub.com/content/photography/14130/css/14130_176.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tpub.com/content/photography/14130/css/14130_176.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I complained about your attack against me because any reader of your statement would believe I was the source of an accusation against Senator Kennedy. You wrote <b>"Your source is unreliable and your accusation libelous."</b> It is not <b>my</b> accusation. I only seek to have the published and verified reporting on the issue included in this article on Kennedy. It is against wikipedia policy to prevent the inclusion of information on POV grounds. Read carefully this excerpt from the guidelines for biographies of living persons.</p>

<p>It was nice to see Seraphimblade agree that the source for the CNS News and Washington Times op-ed piece is solid. (As an aside Seraphimblade, your conclusion that the Washington Times piece "is an editorial and therefore inherently unreliable" is not exactly accurate. Any reader is free to disagree with the conclusions of an op-ed piece, however, the facts presented in the piece have to reach the same level of accuracy and verifiability as any reporting. When reading op-eds, you have to be able to separate the reporting from the opinion. It is common practice for op-ed pieces to be linked on wikipedia.) It is wrong to say a controversy exists on the issue because neither Senator Kennedy nor John Tunney have denied the story. The story is based on far more than the recently released book by Paul Kengor. Kengor's research has certainly moved the story along by providing fresh details, but the story is based on several recovered KGB documents. Former KGB agent Vasiliy Mitrokhin published a paper in February 2002 based on document(s) he found. You can read that paper on pdf here. <a href="http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/HistoricalResearchCorner/ACFAE9.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/HistoricalResearchCorner/ACFAE9.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> An op-ed piece by Herbert Romerstein gives some additional facts. One of the KGB documents "was found by the knowledgeable Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats and published in Moscow's Izvestia in June 1992." The first document was "discovered in the Soviet archives by London Times reporter Tim Sebastian and a report on it was published in that newspaper in February 1992." <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200312/ai_n9318614" class="external autonumber" title="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200312/ai_n9318614" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> According to the London Times, businessman John Tunney (he was already a former senator by this time) admitted going to the Soviet Union on 15 occasions during the late 1970s and early 1980s to represent Kennedy and other senators. There is certainly more to the story and more of it will come out. However, we cannot say the story is "too new" for inclusion in an encyclopedia. The story has been verified repeatedly and has never been denied by Senator Kennedy or John Tunney. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 10:42, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Blaxthos, I'm new to this and have noticed you appear to be a moderator or something. I just wanted to ask you about wikipedia and its uses. Can anyone post on any page? Also do you always have to state facts with a source. (I've noticed that some do not contain links or at least the links are dead) If the links are dead should I delete it? Also how do you create a red link page? Some of the things I've looked for are red linked (I think it means nothing is there?) Thanks for your help, Alantio 01:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe you have the wrong impression of what constitutes vandalism. I urge you to review the Wiki standards page on vandalism. My contribution of personal opinion to a discussion page is, according to Wikipedia standards, merely that. "Unconstructive text" is not mentioned anywhere as vandalism, and furthermore, I'd consider your mischaracterization of me to be vandalism, as you have stated misinformation on my user page since you did not phrase it as a personal opinion of me.</p>
<p>As for my comments on Kennedy, I recently discovered the most likely scenario was that Kennedy simply fled from the scene to escape a DUI, which is the opinion of the investigating officer, so I no longer stand by the notion that he strangled her himself, although that is still a possibility, in my mind, as there was no autopsy. I would also urge you to try to be less "authoritarian" when you deal with opinions that conflict with your own.</p>

<li>Your opinion regarding historical facts have no place on wikipedia. This constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</li>

<dd>Again, not vandalism, and my opinion, as well as the opinion of others, belongs in the discussion page, where I left it. Your threatening comments were unprovoked. Did you not realize it was a discussion page? You are completely wrong, and you obviously have a problem admitting when you're wrong.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 204.228.149.10 (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.228.149.10.html" title="User talk:204.228.149.10">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.228.149.10_76c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.228.149.10">contribs</a>) 13:20, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li>Please sign your work when you post on discussion pages. <b>This is not optional.</b> Please see <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIGN</a>.</li>
<li>Discussion pages exist to discuss improvements to the articles found on wikipedia -- <b>not</b> to discuss your personal opinions or thought the subject of the articles. I direct your attention to the talk header at the top of the talk page, which <i>clearly</i> states such.</li>
<li>The <i>threatening comments</i> to which you refer are actually from the Wikipedia template regarding vandalism, which I simply applied because I felt it was appropriate. If it was not intended to be vandalism (and simply uninformed espousal of an opinion) I apologize. Please see the point number 2 on this list. Unsigned work is often the work of vandals, and in conjunction with the wild speculation with no sources (that, as mentioned earlier, violates at least five Wikipedia policies) appeared to be simple vandalism.</li>
<li>Please do not assume that I am attacking you, or I threatened you. One of the five pillars of Wikipedia is to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. Your claim that I "<i>obviously have a problem with being wrong</i>" -- that is in complete violation of the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> policy. Please read it.</li>
<li>You claim I am "<i>completely wrong</i>". Where, exactly, do you get justifcation for that statement? I've now quoted several <b>policies</b> on Wikipedia that directly contradict what you're saying.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, before jumping in feet first <b>please take time to read appropriate policies before jumping in and claiming wrongdoing</b> -- especially since you have almost zero edits to your credit. I am going to continue to assume good faith that you simply do not understand the way Wikipedia works -- please make the effort to do some reading of the policies. If you need further clarification on this or any issue, post to my <strong class="selflink">talk page</strong> and I'll help if I can.

<p>You removed a piece of history about an alternative (and the genuine) reason for the Warp product name. I cited the actual Court in which a SEVEN YEAR battle took place to establish the fact that IBM were approached by APT to market their software and they instead took the name. The Court records are public domain if you care to go to Paris to check them out! I also have original copies of letters from IBM regarding our offer to them regarding our product WARP.If you want an image of the letter I will show it with the article. Theft is not trivial and it is certainly relevant to the origin of the name. IBM reputedly spent $300,000,000 marketing a product using our trademarked name.<a href="../../../k/d/a/User%7EKdakin_15f6.html" title="User:Kdakin">ken</a> 18:34, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Blaxthos, maybe you are the one to ask. There is an article published that refers to only the positive roles a certain group has had on a community, however, takes no mention of listing any negative roles. How can a wikipedia 'article' be an article if facts aren't listed, just the positive twist on things?</p>
<p>For instance, if I was to write an article on Saddam, would it truly be an article if I wrote only the positive attributes he had on his country (no matter how short it may be?), and none of the negative roles he played in terrorism?</p>
<p>There are articles published, however, because of the nature, only in community published college level. However, citation can be made.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the matter?</p>

<p>After reading the quote on your main page, I believe we share the same concerns. I joined Wikipedia after becoming frustrated with a popular trend amongst many editors. Many editor's who claim to be concerned with having NPOV's are amongst the worst abusers. I call their tactic 'psychologically suggestive writing'. They site neutral facts, and then present it in an ideological manner. The average person will not notice these things. For example: If I read an article to learn about one political candidate, I will then read about their opponent. Proper judgements cannot be made until one has all of the facts. Citeing sources, and giving true information is useless if they are presented in an ideological manner. If you share these concerns I would like to work with you on fixing these discrepencies. If not, thank you for your time.(<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfForByThePeople_64ea.html" title="User:OfForByThePeople">OfForByThePeople</a> 03:24, 13 January 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Are you kidding me? Have you actually read the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research policy</a>? Do you understand it is one of only three content policies on Wikipedia?

<dd>Hello, thanks for the refresher course in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy. From what I understand, the original research policy explains that original research doesn’t belong on Wikipedia, which I agree with. If the content is unverifiable, then it doesn’t belong on this encyclopedia. However, the content in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Griefer_1cce.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Griefer">AFD discussion</a> which you refer to is verifiable, can be easily sourced, and has more than enough information on the web to back it up (on many <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Reliable</a> sources which I may add) and yes, I have pointed that out in my comment. So no need for the rude remarks. While we're on topic of Wikipedia policy and guidelines, I would recommend might want to take a look at <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVL_0765.html" title="WP:CIVL">WP:CIVL</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No personal attacks</a> and you might want to work on your <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Etiquette</a>.

<dd>You can't have it both ways -- if it is original research, it is not allowed. As I understand it, this is a <b>non-negotiable</b> policy. It is not the content I'm talking about, it is your blatant disregard of said policies that I find offensive. In no way have I issued a personal attack; I just don't let people casually disregard the rules when it suits them.

I have clearly stated in the AFD discussion, that because the content is verifiable, with a list of reliable sources, then it shouldn't be deleted, sources and references should just be added to the page. I hope you understand my reasoning for me wagering in a Keep on that page.

<dd>Again, I wasn't trying to circumvent any rules. I wrote that statement, because I was questioning the nominator's endorsement. As I believed that he/she decided to endorse the article for deletion without <a href="../../../o/s/t/WP%7EOSTRICH_1864.html" title="WP:OSTRICH">doing any proper investigation to see if the article had any significance whatsoever</a>. I know the article contains a large amount of original research or non-sourced information, but if the article was properly sourced, there wouldn't need to be any reason for deletion (as I said in the last sentence <i>"Surely, we can look beyond what we see as original research, and verify the information ourselves. "</i>. Please understand that the tone of your message overall sounded negative, and the last statement <i>"then I don't think you should participate in&#160;?fD debates. "</i> can be seen by many readers as rude, and inappropriate. I understand now that the intention of your message was to make sure I was aware of certain policies. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, and I hope we can move past it. Please try to be more polite in the future. As for these reliable sources, if you read what I posted, you can clearly see that these links bring you to articles on Griefing found on Microsoft’s website, G4 Tech TV's website, Escapist's magazine, and many others, as for the AFD itself, it seems that the consensus on the AFD discussion is swinging on the side of keep, mostly because comments made by other users who also pointed out notable reliable sources. One editor actually changed his/her decision from delete to keep. I'll change the wording of my statement so it doesn’t sound too ignorant of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy. P.S I wish no bad blood between us, I hope that in the future, we both can come together on more friendly terms, and work with each other in a constructive manner.

<dd>Nah, shit online doesn't get my blood up, . I am aware that I have a rather curt attitude towards those who appear to care nothing for the policies and guidelines contained herein. I think a lot of people on wikipedia try to bend/stretch/conveniently ignore the rules when it suits them, much like most people speed when a cop isn't around. Conflict in the short term is necessary to keep wikipedia in balance; conflict in the long run hurts us all. As a general rule for me, once we've said our peace it's done. &#160;;-) /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 06:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A little quick to threaten the block, eh? I think you caught the list as it was in progress -- both of the ones you had mentioned I had already culled from the list before final AfD. It certainly was not indiscriminant, nor was it a bad faith nomination. Practically speaking, I understand your position and bow to your experience. However, I would expect enough <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to assert that, would I have allowed to finish, only those that merit deletion would have been included.

<dd>It is my understanding that the admin in question was to roll back the AfD templats on the affected articles (thereby removing them from AfD). I never linked the AfD debate page to the main AfD list, so hopefully if the changes were rolled back there will be no discussion necessary. The admin discussed picking five that truely need removal and listing them at a later time. So, I would say that you shouldn't worry about this AfD currently, as it has been (or is in the process of) being "rolled back" (see above). If for some reason the comic in question gets re-listed at a later time, a more clear direction of where to discuss will also be made available.

<p>Hi Blaxthos, I noticed that you archived the talk page of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> by moving it. For future reference, it's probably better to cut and paste, because moving splits the page history, and it's sometimes helpful to be able to scan the history as a whole, rather than having to search through different archives. I hope you don't mind that I moved it back. Cheers, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:42, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When you move a page, you move the page history too. If you move one page into archive 1, and another into archive 2, and so on, you end up with multiple page histories. Therefore, anyone in future who wants to see who made a certain change must search through these multiple histories. That can be a lot more work than simply scrolling down one history. It's also easier to spot edit patterns in one history: for example when looking for sockpuppets. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I edited various aspects of the Fox News Channel article from a neutral standpoint. The changes I made were based on reputable sources which either I cited, or were already cited. None of the changes I made were original content.Chris 02:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I must have forgotten to cite where the Blue Streak info came from. But that's not a big deal; I understand that it is less fact based than other parts. As for for the Fox News number of viewers, it was not original research. The website that the last person had cited for that entry is what I used. The website explains why Fox News has higher ratings but a lower number of daily viewers. It is a standardized equation used to determine ratings. What I had stated IS the reason the ratings were higher. You might want to check out the website if you don't believe me (<a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2005" class="external free" title="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2005" rel="nofollow">http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2005</a>) it is reference number 15 on the current version of the article. You also said I you removed the moveon.org part because I called it liberal. I would like to point out to you that I changed the text (which you reverted back to) from "left-wing moveone.org" to "liberal moveon.org" and I did that because the word liberal fit into moveon.org in the same way the word conservative works in the current version of the article. There were many other changes I made from grammar mistakes to word choice many of which were to adjust the language to comply with a neutral point of view. Finally, if those were the problems, why did you revert EVERYTHING I did? I really wish you would have read my changes and read what you were reverting back to. 99% of what I did matched the rest of the article in neutrality, wording, grammar, etc. I am entirely willing to leave out the changes to Blue Streak and leave out the words "liberal" and "nonpartisan" form moveon.org and Common Cause; but I disagree with your other decisions.Chris 05:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I see where you might feel that some of my edits were nonsense. I have OCD tendencies and poor wording in formal writing irritates me which is the reason for many of me small edits. Often it is because a style has been used on the whole article except in a few locations and I like to reword those areas so that it flows smoothly. And I don't mean to criticize other editors, but the Fox News Channel article is one of the more poorly written articles on wikipedia. I'm surprised at how great the style and grammar changes from paragraph to paragraph in the article, and I was trying to adjust that. I also was unaware that there was a special procedure for editing that article and I didn't even realize that there was an issue until long into the edit. So I probably reinserted information that you had reverted back from without even realizing it and I apologize if I did do that. At no point in time have a doubted that you or any other editor made their decisions in bad taste. On a side note, your definition of "unique" is technically correct but it doesn't mean that it's an appropriate word. Very few people interpret the word unique the way you are thinking of it when they are reading an article. It comes across as suggesting that there is something wrong or abnormal about CNN's views if you call them unique when referring to their viewers. If you could discuss with me the other problems with my edit that prompted you to revert all of the changes I would greatly appreciate it, and it would be useful when I perform future edits on articles.

It might even be a better illustration since the chip is the main focus of the free use image. In addition, the article is about IBM, not the chip, so the image basically serves as decoration. Without an adequate <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">fair use rationale</a>, the fair use image also doesn't clearly meet the requirements of inclusion under fair use. I'd stick with the free content; it almost always trumps fair use. If I can clarify my viewpoint on this, let me know. <b><a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><font color="mediumblue">auburn</font><font color="darkorange">pilot</font></a></b> <a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><small>talk</small></a> 19:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, thank you for you input on the deletion discussion of Another Anime Convention. However, you cite only <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> with little else in your explanation. Would you mind taking a look at the article again and then telling me on my talk page what should be corrected? Thank you! <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 22:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your response, although I disagree. Remember notability is not about importance, but about its <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">worthiness of being noted</a>. In comparison to the other anime convention articles, several have little proof that they are worthy of being noted, except what the article says (I had listed 15 of them!). Anyways, thank you. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 22:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the article does satisfy <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, all the actual information in the article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">verified</a>, via <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I would also argue, more importantly, that a convention with over 500 attendees is pretty notable, and since it has already happened, doesn't violate WP:Crystal ball. Not to mention, the convention is being held again, (not violating Crystal ball because it has been held once), and it would simply go against <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_sense.html" title="Common sense">common sense</a> to delete a <i>useful</i> article that would be recreated after the second convention. The absolute most important things to remember about Wikipedia is that Wikipedia is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>, except it is an encyclopedia with no practical limit to the amount of content it can hold. Nobody will care about McDonalds in Muscatine, IA, because it's not interesting or important. There are at least 500 people (excluding Patrick) who would be interested in this article and who would consider it notable. Not to mention that anyone who likes Anime, or anyone who is curious about attending an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_convention.html" title="Anime convention">anime convention</a> in the NH area, would probably consider the convention notable. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and useless cruft should be removed, yet Another Anime Convention is very encyclopedic. More importantly, it is <i>the biggest anime convention in New Hampshire</i>. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 22:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Don't say none if it's not none. Animecons.com and Anime-mania are both reliable for information. But ignore that discussion, how about this one: Another Anime Convention is <i>the biggest anime convention in New Hampshire</i>. Doesn't that make it notable??? <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 23:23, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to invite you to take another look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Another_Anime_Convention_%282nd_nomination%29_08ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Another Anime Convention (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Another Anime Convention (2nd nomination)</a>. I had presented that <i>Another Anime Convention is the biggest anime convention in New Hampshire</i>, but before much discussion had taken place the deletion was closed. Would you like to voice your opinion, for or against, at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_19#.5B.5BWikipedia:Deletion_review.2FLog.2F2007_March_19.7C19_March_2007.5D.5D" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_March_19#.5B.5BWikipedia:Deletion_review.2FLog.2F2007_March_19.7C19_March_2007.5D.5D" rel="nofollow">the deletion review</a>? The claims to notability meet <i>the sole requirement</i> for such claims to be <i>verifiable</i>, not necessarily verified. The two source I had provided show that the claim is as true as can be proven also. As I stated, if I claimed to own the only Computer Repair Company in Iowa, and I had multiple phone-books to prove it, that would be enough verifiability for Wikipedia. Also, any user can search Google for Anime Conventions in New Hampshire, and they will find no current ones (nor any larger than Another Anime Convention). I hope you consider participating in the review discussion. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 00:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Blaxthos,</p>
<p>After you contributed to the deletion discussion on the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Hollick_19ce.html" title="Helen Hollick">Helen Hollick</a> article, the author herself put some references on the deletion page, and I think we now have adequate confirmation of notability from independent sources. I initially voted to delete myself, but I've been working with her to improve the page with more footnotes and more information. At this point I think the article is worthy of keeping, and I'm continuing to work on it with her. Please take another look at the page and consider whether you'd like to change your vote. Thanks! <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 22:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>please don't blank talk pages, it is considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>. By the way, after looking at your recent edits, it is clear you are way out of line trying to suggest an "edited by consensus" tag on the FOX news page, one has only to look at the history to see some editors were even forced out after making factual fully referenced additions. Its a nasty page, its why I don't even head there at all, it makes more sense to just say that some wikipedia articles are blatantly flawed and highly inaccurate and poorly written, and to use other sources for such topics that are subject to fan bases and political blocks &amp; gangs of editors. Enjoy the FOX page, its all yours! But stay out of other editors' business on more important matters and pages. Stick to the FOX news page and what your good at. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystalizedAngels_4af9.html" title="User:CrystalizedAngels">CrystalizedAngels</a> 01:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>indefinite???...well...in some sort of way i guess depending on the definition of indefinite (<i>or else the the reference point &amp; time frame of the observer</i>)...what is indefinite to one occurence/entity may be quite brief to another occurence/entity...so you vandalize a talk page by blanking the comments of a user (a user totally uninvolved in this dispute over soemthing totally unrelated to FOX news)...then you get an admin to defend your vandalism!...well well...<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User%7E83.78.181.65.html" title="User:83.78.181.65">83.78.181.65</a> 12:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
