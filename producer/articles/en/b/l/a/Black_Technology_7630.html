<p>Artificial Intelligence in the world of Full Metal Panic is far more advanced, powerful, and reliable in comparison to that of existing technologies. The AI has been installed into vehicles such as the Arm Slave, and the TDD-1. The military use of AI computer systems shows a surprising level of maturity of the technology. Curiously, this technology has not been seen in civilian usage at the current time.</p>
<p>Special examples of AI systems have been observed expressing comprehension of concepts such as jokes, and whim. It is unknown if this is programmed response, or actual comprehension by the AI system. Al(AL), the ARX-7 Arbalest AI system is especially notable for its adaptive behaviour, molding itself to become closer to its pilot. The relationship between Sosuke Sagara and the AI has been a source of trouble for the pilot, as the AI continues to defy the behaviour of conventional AI systems in use. The relationship between the two has been likened to the relation between Sosuke and Kaname Chidori.</p>

<p>Largely humanoid powered suits operating in a semi-master slave set up, it is a military weapons system that revolutionized the meaning of mechanized infantry. They were developed in the early 1980s under the Reagan Administration. The average Arm Slave (or AS for short) is roughly 9-10 metres tall. This places the craft smaller than most <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecha.html" title="Mecha">mecha</a> in size.</p>
<p>It is one example of the culmination of achievements of many different pieces of black technology. In a way, it can be said that all other black technologies were created in this fictional universe to rationalize the existence of these humanoid combat machines.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Technology_7630.html" title="Edit section: ECS (Electronic Conceal System)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ECS (Electronic Conceal System)</span></h3>
<p>A form of active camouflage, an active ECS confers near total concealment from <a href="../../../r/a/d/RADAR_0aba.html" title="RADAR">RADAR</a> and related electromagnetic detection. Initial systems are said to have had limited capabilities that only masked millimeter length <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microwave.html" title="Microwave">microwaves</a> and later, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrared.html" title="Infrared">infrared</a> signatures. More recent systems are more powerful, and is capable of masking signatures in the visual range of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetic_spectrum.html" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. The system works by utilising a rapidly oscillating laser screen to project some sort of distortion around the concealed object. Specific details are not described, but has shown adaptability to sudden and violent changes in ambient conditions and the ability to see out from within the concealment, making the system suitable for combat deployment. The view from within a ECS field is washed out and tinged in violet and red.</p>
<p>The technology requires a significant power input and significant size, and thus deployment was limited by the powerplant of craft the ECS is to be mounted to. It is assumed that shorter wavelength (such as the visual range) is more complex and requires more power. It is noted that a ECS capable of invisible mode operation (masking visiual spectrum signatures) is also capable of operating in a more limited mode, such as only masking its radar signature. Its immense power requirements make the use of the system while making combat manuvers impossible on Arm Slaves. Human sized ECS units are also not yet possible without a suitable powersource and miniturization.</p>
<p>In the world of Full Metal Panic, the <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-2_Spirit_9d58.html" title="B-2 Spirit">B-2 Bomber</a> was never developed. Instead, the <a href="../../../b/-/1/B-1_Lancer_9d5f.html" title="B-1 Lancer">B-1 Bomber</a> was deployed with the ECS. This is designated as the B-1C. This places the development of the ECS after <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> and before the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. As such, passive stealth technology is a largely forgotten technology.</p>
<p>The ECS is not impervious. Its weaknesses include its inability to mask UV spectrum emissions. A high output ECS also ionizes the air, emitting ozone. Insects, and birds attracted to insects gather around an active ECS from the UV signature. Dogs have been observed avoiding an active ECS from its ozone smell. Recent developments in countermeasures include the ECCS (Electronic Conceal Counter System) designed to detect ECS signatures.</p>

<p>Electromagnetically control surface fluid dynamics of the submarine, TDD-1. Acts as secondary propulsion, but is used mainly to reduce surface turbulence and cavitation. The EMFC can propel the TDD-1 in any direction, including a lateral slide, at a maximum speed of 5 knots. This allows the immensely large TDD-1 an agility rivaling, if not superior to that of a Los Angeles class Fast Attack Submarine. At the same time, the EMFC greatly reduces the operating noise of the TDD-1 while allowing it a much higher top speed.</p>

<p>Officially called the "false axis repulsive field generator system", the lambda driver is a Black Technology device capable of exerting mechanical force against space with no observable physical interaction. False axis refers to the lack of physical interaction, or lack of moment arm in the application of torque. This is in direct violation of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion.html" title="Newton's laws of motion">Newtonian physics</a>, particularly Newton's Third Law.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Technology_7630.html" title="Edit section: Muscle Package">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Muscle Package</span></h3>
<p>A class of semi-biological <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroactive_polymers.html" title="Electroactive polymers">EAP (Electro Active Polymers)</a> produced as a low noise and high power source of mechanical motion. They are electrically activated artificial fibres that contract when exposed to an electrical current. (Similar to <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myomer.html" title="Myomer">myomer</a> in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battletech.html" title="Battletech">Battletech</a> series of games and novels) Similar technology is currently under research in reality. Black Technology fueled advances in materiel engineering created the revolutionary advances seen in the Full Metal Panic universe. While the concept and research is not fiction, the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_efficiency.html" title="Energy efficiency">efficiency</a>, durability and high power output of the material as demonstrated by the impossible agility and strength of the Arm Slaves in Full Metal Panic is purely fictional.</p>
<p>These artificial muscles are used as primary motivators on the fictional class of humanoid weapon systems called Arm Slaves. The artificial muscles offer the three favorable traits over alternate mechanical or hydraulic systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Precision control</li>
<li>Low noise</li>
<li>High mechanical torque</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Polymers of the Muscle Package have high <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tensile_strength.html" title="Tensile strength">tensile strength</a>, comparable to <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevlar.html" title="Kevlar">aramid fibres</a>. This allows for the third generation Arm Slaves such as the M9 series to carry less armor plating, as the drive systems themselves serve as ballistic protection. These traits have given the third generation Arm Slave high survivability, high maneuverability and low observability.</p>
<p>Earlier forms of the Muscle Packages were underpowered, and required a secondary power system. Second generation Arm Slaves are noted by having a binary drive system, such as the RK-92 "Savage". The Savage operates its hydraulic actuators for high torque, and uses the muscle package for precision operations. The more recent muscle packages have overcome this handicap, removing the need for a heavy and bulky hydraulic system. The most advanced Muscle packages have unreal <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volumetric_efficiency.html" title="Volumetric efficiency">volumetric efficiency</a> that drastically increases the power to weight ratio of the third generation Arm Slave.</p>
<p>In exchange, the muscle package requires a massive electrical input. Traditional power generation systems such as a gas turbine engine would be required to scale up in size, increasing mass to power a muscle package system. This increased mass would require more powerful Muscle Package in a cyclic process. It is only with the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Technology_7630.html#Palladium_Reactor" title="Black Technology">Palladium Reactor</a> that the high power to weight ratio is realized.</p>
<p>The muscle package is also a technology that requires constant maintenance. The polymers that make up the muscle package experience materiel stress, reducing its efficiency and peak power output every time it contracts. It has been revealed that a muscle package is only capable of 70-80% of its design specifications after 10 combat missions. This aspect coupled with the high cost of the muscle package makes the third generation Arm Slave an extremely expensive weapon to upkeep. The frequency of replacement is determined by the individual organization. Elite organizations such as Mithril, SEALs, and SAS that require 100% power for all its missions will replace the muscle package after every combat operation. Most first world armed forces replace the muscle packages at the manufacturer recommended 10 times. Organizations with a relative lack of funds may only replace it when absolutely necessary. It is noted that the muscle packages that are "tired" still find use as training sets. Under lower power demands (running the systems at 75% power), these muscle packages have a vastly extended lifespan. Many of these used sets also make their way to the black market.</p>
<p>From these reasons, a second generation Arm Slave under conditions where replacement parts are not readily available has several advantages. A "Savage" will degrade in performance far less than a comparable M9 unit away from a supply line. While the "Savage" will slowly lose its fine motor control, its mobility will not be affected, as most of its drive mechanism is hydraulic. The rate of decay of the Muscle Package in a "Savage" is comparatively lower, as fine motor control is not a high power application.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Technology_7630.html" title="Edit section: Palladium Reactor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Palladium Reactor</span></h3>
<p>A form of a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Fusion_937a.html" title="Cold Fusion">cold fusion</a> reactor, the Palladium Reactor is an advanced electrical power generator with notable advantages in power output and low noise in addition to its low waste heat. It is called a cold fusion battery by characters, but the distinction between a reactor and battery is uncertain and could be arbitrary.</p>
<p>Its usage has revolutionized two classes of combat vehicles. One is the Arm Slave, and the second is the submarine. The near silent operation of the Palladium reactor enables both types of craft to operate impressive amounts of equipment in a nearly undetectable manner. The power output of a Palladium Reactor is unknown, but is assumed to be slightly lower than a nuclear fission reactor of a similar size. This assumption is made from the number of reactors aboard the Assault Landing Submarine, TDD-1.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Technology_7630.html" title="Edit section: Miscellaneous Technologies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Miscellaneous Technologies</span></h3>
<p>Black technology has been applied to various fields, many of them absorbed into general usage. This has created minor differences in the technology present in Full Metal Panic and that of our own world. Material Sciences seems to have gained a moderate boost from black technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arm Slave Pilot Suit: The characteristic suits the AS pilots of Mithril wear exhibit excellent ballistic and thermal protection in addition to shock absorbing characteristics. The suit will stop most handgun bullets and conventional blade weaponry. In addition, an egg wrapped in the suit material is said to survive a 10 story drop. The thermal protection of the suit will insulate the wearer from direct contact with metal heated to 120 to 200 Celsius, but not for long.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gas Turbine Engine: The use of advanced materials in the gas turbine engine has yielded a machine far more efficient and powerful than that of our own. The fuel consumption is comparable to piston diesel engines, making them suitable as main generators in the second generation Arm Slaves. For instance, a <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-130.html" title="C-130">C-130</a> Hercules transport plane is shown operating with jet engines. The real life jet engine Hercules did not see mass production.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Monomolecular Cutters: Advanced materials have created mono-molecular blades, allowing unprecedented sharpness. Many of these weapons are also outfitted with a vibrational system to increase their destructive capability. both of these functions are possible from advances in Black Technology.</li>
</ul>
