<p><b>Black Adam</b> is a fictional <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a> character whose morally ambiguous nature has his character fall between the lines of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroism.html" title="Heroism">heroism</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain.html" title="Villain">villainy</a>; as a result, he has associated himself with both <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superheroes</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supervillain.html" title="Supervillain">supervillains</a> in the past.</p>
<p>The character was originally created in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> for the premiere issue of <a href="../../../f/a/w/Fawcett_Comics_754f.html" title="Fawcett Comics">Fawcett Comics</a>' <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Marvel_Family_f5a6.html" title="The Marvel Family">The Marvel Family</a></i> comic book by <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Binder_bd43.html" title="Otto Binder">Otto Binder</a> and <a href="../../../c/2E/c/C.C._Beck_602d.html" title="C.C. Beck">C.C. Beck</a> as an "evil" version of Fawcett's popular <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29_6626.html" title="Captain Marvel (DC Comics)">Captain Marvel</a> character. Adam was later revived by <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29_6626.html" title="Captain Marvel (DC Comics)">Shazam!</a></i> comic book, becoming Captain Marvel's most powerful foe in terms of physical abilities. Originally called <b>Teth-Adam</b> (translated into English as <b>Mighty Adam</b>) in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, Black Adam was a previous appointee of the wizard <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shazam_%28comics%29.html" title="Shazam (comics)">Shazam</a>, but soon used his power for his own corrupt ends, which forced the wizard to punish him. Generally, that punishment was to remove Adam from that time, only to appear in modern times to challenge Shazam's current appointee, Billy Batson, in his Captain Marvel form.</p>
<p>By the early 21st century, Adam had been redefined by DC writers <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Ordway_3160.html" title="Jerry Ordway">Jerry Ordway</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Johns_b4e3.html" title="Geoff Johns">Geoff Johns</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_S._Goyer_ef33.html" title="David S. Goyer">David S. Goyer</a> as a corrupted <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-hero</a> attempting to clear his name, but unable to fully rid himself of his evil influences. Adam's personal goal is to enforce justice; however, his ideals of justice, often involving hostile action or execution, are considered extreme by many of the heroes who have attempted to give the former supervillain a second chance. This current version of Black Adam is the ruler of <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahndaq.html" title="Kahndaq">Kahndaq</a>, a fictional <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Eastern_4973.html" title="Middle Eastern">Middle Eastern</a> nation in the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a>. Featured roles in comic books series such as <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_of_America_bb01.html" title="Justice Society of America">JSA</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../v/i/l/Villains_United_e689.html" title="Villains United">Villains United</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comic_book%29.html" title="52 (comic book)">52</a></i> have elevated the character to a level of prominence in DC Comics nearly surpassing that of Captain Marvel.</p>
<p>Adam is depicted as a powerful <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arab</a> man wearing a costume similar to Captain Marvel's, except that the red portions are instead black, and Adam does not usually wear a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape.html" title="Cape">cape</a> (recent depictions of the character give him a black cape similar to the other Marvels'); indeed, Black Adam has also been called The Black Marvel. Some artists, following C.C. Beck's original design, also depict Adam with pointed, <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf.html" title="Elf">elfin</a> ears.</p>

<p>When Adam said the magic word "Shazam", he was transformed into a black-clad super-powered being, Mighty Adam (literally translating into 'Mighty Human'). Possessing the same powers that Captain Marvel would later be granted, Adam was soon corrupted by the vastness of his powers. No mention was made of the fact that the wizard Shazam seemed to be giving an ancient Egyptian character powers from Greco-Roman deities, a fact which would seem unpalatable to later writers who would change (twice) the deities whose names made up the acronym "Shazam" for Black Adam.</p>
<p>Deciding that he should rule the world, Adam overthrew the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh.html" title="Pharaoh">pharaoh</a> and assumed the throne. An angry Shazam gives his errant champion a new name -- "Black Adam" -- and banishes him to the most distant star in the universe.</p>
<p>Adam spends the next 5000 years flying back to Earth; by the time he makes it back, in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, Shazam has appointed three new champions to take his place: <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29_6626.html" title="Captain Marvel (DC Comics)">Captain Marvel</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Marvel_bb0f.html" title="Mary Marvel">Mary Marvel</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel%2C_Jr._9067.html" title="Captain Marvel, Jr.">Captain Marvel, Jr.</a>. Adam does battle with the trio, known as the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Family_75ee.html" title="Marvel Family">Marvel Family</a>, but since all are equally invulnerable, the fight goes on and on without resolution. At the suggestion of the wizard Shazam, <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle_Marvel_8858.html" title="Uncle Marvel">Uncle Marvel</a> tricks Black Adam into saying the wizard's name, transforming him back into his mortal form. Adam's natural aging process takes hold, and he withers away into a skeleton within moments.</p>

<p>While he was defeated in the same story in which he debuted, Adam was resurrected nearly thirty years later (by <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Sivana_d7d6.html" title="Dr. Sivana">Dr. Sivana</a>) in <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a>' <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29_6626.html" title="Captain Marvel (DC Comics)">Shazam!</a></i> revival of the Marvel Family characters.

<p>Black Adam was reintroduced to the DC Universe in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Power_of_Shazam%21_9ab7.html" title="The Power of Shazam!">The Power of Shazam!</a></i> graphic novel by <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Ordway_3160.html" title="Jerry Ordway">Jerry Ordway</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. In that story and the subsequent <i>Power of Shazam!</i> ongoing series, Adam was a deadly and evil adversary for Captain Marvel. <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Ordway_3160.html" title="Jerry Ordway">Jerry Ordway</a>, the writer of <i>The Power of Shazam!</i>, redefined Black Adam's origin for the Modern Age of comic books.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Adam_1f2e.html" title="Edit section: Revised origin of Mighty Adam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revised origin of Mighty Adam</span></h4>
<p>In this revised origin (told in <i>Power of Shazam!</i> #10), Teth-Adam was the son of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egyptian_bd12.html" title="Ancient Egyptian">ancient Egyptian</a> <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh.html" title="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rameses_II_7a6d.html" title="Rameses II">Rameses II</a>, and impressed one of the high priests, the wizard <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shazam_%28comics%29.html" title="Shazam (comics)">Shazam</a>, with his good deeds. The wizard had the young prince brought before him, and ordered him to speak his name. Teth-Adam did so, and was transformed into Mighty-Adam, a superhero possessing the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru (<a href="../../../h/o/r/Horus.html" title="Horus">Horus</a>), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti, the power of <a href="../../../a/t/o/Aton.html" title="Aton">Aton</a>, and the courage of <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehen.html" title="Mehen">Mehen</a>.</p>
<p>Mighty-Adam served as Egypt's champion for many centuries, but became corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam's evil daughter <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaze_and_Satanus_61e6.html" title="Blaze and Satanus">Blaze</a> in disguise. Bewitched by Blaze, Adam became convinced that he and his mistress should rule the Egyptian kingdom, so he killed the Pharaoh and appointed himself ruler. Shazam was made aware of this treachery, and resultantly unleashed a powerful spell on Adam. The wizard extracted Mighty Adam's magic powers and encased them in a mystical scarab necklace, rendering Adam's depowered body, now several hundred years old, into a withered corpse.</p>
<p>Shazam then buried both the body and the scarab in the tomb of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rameses_II_7a6d.html" title="Rameses II">Rameses II</a>, where he had planned for it to remain for all eternity. In death, the former hero was referred to as "Khem-Adam" ("Black Adam"). Disillusioned by what he perceived as Adam's betrayal, Shazam went several millennia before appointing a second champion to fight evil in his name.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Adam_1f2e.html" title="Edit section: Revised origin of Black Adam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revised origin of Black Adam</span></h4>
<p>The original <i>Power of Shazam!</i> graphic novel (which predated the publication of the series by a year) explained how Black Adam was revived and introduced into the modern world. In this story, an unscrupulous archaeological aide named Theo Adam finds himself assigned to the Malcom Expedition, an archaeological dig financed by the <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Sivana_d7d6.html" title="Dr. Sivana">Sivana</a> Foundation to excavate the tomb of Rameses II. Adam uncovers Khem-Adam's tomb in a secret passageway, and leads his superiors, C.C. Batson and his wife Marilyn, to the discovery. Upon first sight of Khem-Adam's scarab, Theo Adam became obsessed with the artifact, and killed both Batsons in order to steal it. Escaping <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Theo Adam soon made his way back to America.</p>
<p>The Batsons' son, Billy, had been left behind in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and was soon appointed to become Captain Marvel, the second champion of the wizard Shazam. When Theo Adam first encountered Captain Marvel, he noted both Marvel's identical appearance to C.C. Batson and the lightning-bolt insignia on Marvel's chest that had also decorated Khem-Adam's tomb. Adam therefore had a revelation, and realized that he was a reincarnation of Khem-Adam. Grasping his stolen scarab, Adam spoke the wizard's Shazam's name and was transformed into the super-powered Black Adam. Black Adam revealed himself to Captain Marvel as the Batsons' killer, and the two battled. Captain Marvel emerged victorious by snatching Adam's scarab, and therefore his power, away from him. Marvel brought Theo Adam to Shazam, who wiped Adam's memory and took away his voice, so that he could not access his powers.</p>

<p>Although Adam appeared during the <i>Power of Shazam!</i> ongoing series' first year of publication as a villain, towards the end of the series' run, Adam returned and announced that Black Adam and Theo Adam were separate personalities. Black Adam went on trial again for the murders of the Batsons, and was acquitted when it was revealed that his fingerprints did not match those of Theo Adam's.</p>
<p>The reformed Black Adam was still vulnerable to his murderous host's influence, and he attacked the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_of_America_bb01.html" title="Justice Society of America">Justice Society of America</a> under Theo Adam's control in <i>JSA</i> #6 (1999). In subsequent issues, Adam joins supervillain <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Sorrow_499c.html" title="Johnny Sorrow">Johnny Sorrow</a>'s <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injustice_Society_e07d.html" title="Injustice Society">Injustice Society</a> after Sorrow removed a malignant brain tumor from Adam's brain. Adam soon betrayed Sorrow, and he and the JSA defeated the Injustice Society. Claiming to be free of Theo's evil influence again, a redemptive Black Adam requested membership in the Justice Society, and was granted a probationary membership in <i>JSA</i> #21 (2002).</p>
<p>During his tenure in <i>JSA</i>, writers <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoff_Johns_b4e3.html" title="Geoff Johns">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_S._Goyer_ef33.html" title="David S. Goyer">David S. Goyer</a> redefined Adam's personality and background, focusing on the character's old-fashioned and militant ideals of justice, and his officious and strongly opinionated attitude. Several of the other JSA character were shown to be skeptical of Adam's reformation; primary among them was <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom_Smasher_077e.html" title="Atom Smasher">Atom Smasher</a>, who later became Adam's close friend. The writers also created added tension in the book by having Captain Marvel, who was wholly unconvinced that Adam had reformed, join the team. One <i>JSA</i> story arc (issues 39 through 44) features Marvel, <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkgirl.html" title="Hawkgirl">Hawkgirl</a>, and <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Terrific_b7f7.html" title="Mr. Terrific">Mr. Terrific</a> venturing back in time to ancient Egypt, where they meet Mighty Adam before his corruption.</p>
<p>Johns and Goyer used this story arc to slightly alter Adam's origin. The hero now hailed from the fictional Arabian nation of <a href="../../../k/a/h/Kahndaq.html" title="Kahndaq">Kahndaq</a>, not Egypt, although he served mightily for the Egyptian prince Khufu (who would later be reincarnated as JSA member <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkman.html" title="Hawkman">Hawkman</a>). The character of Blaze was completely removed from the origin story, and Adam's rage was described as having resulted from the conquering of Kahndaq (and the murder of his wife and children) at the hands of a magically powered supervillain named Ahk-ton. Mighty Adam killed Ahk-ton, and returned to Kahndaq to re-claim it by any means necessary, including murder. The wizard Shazam did not agree with Adam's actions, and robbed Adam of his powers and killed him.</p>

<p>In <i>JSA</i> #45 (2003), Black Adam and his teammate <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atom_Smasher_077e.html" title="Atom Smasher">Atom Smasher</a> both defected from the Justice Society. During the next few issues, Adam formed his own organization, which would administer justice the way Adam wanted it: "an eye for an eye". His roster included a mix of DC heroes and villains, including Atom Smasher, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainwave_%28comics%29.html" title="Brainwave (comics)">Brainwave</a> (who was possessed by <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mister_Mind_bb01.html" title="Mister Mind">Mister Mind</a>), former <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity%2C_Inc._9546.html" title="Infinity, Inc.">Infinity, Inc.</a> member <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwind_%28comics%29.html" title="Northwind (comics)">Northwind</a> and the rest of the society of Feithera, <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemesis_%28DC_Comics%29_1cff.html" title="Nemesis (DC Comics)">Nemesis</a>, and the JSA's former museum curator Alex Montez, who had made himself the human host for the demon <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclipso.html" title="Eclipso">Eclipso</a> after figuring out how to control the demon's power. Adam's collective executed Kobra, a villain who had been acquitted by the legal justice system. Adam then turned his attentions to his old homeland of Kahndaq.</p>
<p>Late 2003 began the publication of a <i>JSA</i>/<i>Hawkman</i> crossover story arc titled "Black Reign", written by Geoff Johns alone, which featured Adam and his militia's hostile takeover of Kahndaq (with obvious references to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>' concurrent takeover of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>). A war soon broke out, with Adam, his comrades, and the Kahndaqi people on one side; and the Justice Society on the other. By the end of the arc, the JSA left Adam in control of Kahndaq, provided that he did not leave its borders. Only Northwind and Atom Smasher remained at his side. Brainwave had been saved by the JSA, Mister Mind was apprehended, and Nemesis and Alex were both killed during the war when Alex lost control of Eclipso, resulting in Nemesis being killed by the demon and Alex killing himself so the demon couldn't continue to use him.</p>

<p>As Kahndaq's ruler, Adam was depicted as fiercely working to protect his people and his nation. Black Adam was featured heavily in DC's 2005 <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a></i> crossover, primarily in the <i><a href="../../../v/i/l/Villains_United_e689.html" title="Villains United">Villains United</a></i> miniseries as a member of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Society_of_Super-Villains_0002.html" title="Secret Society of Super-Villains">Secret Society of Super-Villains</a> (which he only joined to protect Kahndaq from the Society).

<p>Black Adam currently appears as a featured character in DC's weekly <i><a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comic_book%29.html" title="52 (comic book)">52</a></i> comic book. Depicted as the violent protector of the nation of Khandaq, Adam has killed several super-villains in public and on television to demonstrate his views. As a result, he is distrusted by several of the superheroes he claims a place beside, including <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Girl_3499.html" title="Power Girl">Power Girl</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Lantern_12db.html" title="Green Lantern">Green Lanterns</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stewart_%28comics%29_6b5e.html" title="John Stewart (comics)">John Stewart</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Jordan_6278.html" title="Hal Jordan">Hal Jordan</a>.</p>
<p>In the stories printed during the first ten weeks of the <i>52</i> series, Black Adam created a coalition, based on metahumans from <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="../../../u/z/b/Uzbekistan.html" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonar_%28comics%29.html" title="Sonar (comics)">Modora</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother_Blood_8f76.html" title="Brother Blood">Zandia</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, against the perceived metahuman supremacy of the United States of America. He is actively increasing membership. In <i>52</i>, DC introduced Adrianna Tomaz, a slave offered to Adam by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intergang.html" title="Intergang">Intergang</a> as a token to curry his favor. Although Adam dealt harshly with the slavers, Adrianna becomes Adam's love interest, and her counsel proves wise to him. In week 12 of the series, Adam uses the magical Amulet of Isis, hidden on the scarab in which Shazam imprisoned him, to transform her into the superheroine <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isis_%28DC_Comics%29_7519.html" title="Isis (DC Comics)">Isis</a>. Weeks later he proposes, and the two are married under the auspice of Captain Marvel and the rest of the Marvel Family.</p>
<p>In <i>52</i> Week 23, Black Adam and Isis, with the assistance of the Question and Renee Montoya, find Isis' brother Amon. Due to a failed escape attempt, Amon suffers near-fatal wounds. In order to save his life Black Adam bestows a portion of his own power on the boy, as Captain Marvel did for <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel%2C_Jr._9067.html" title="Captain Marvel, Jr.">Captain Marvel, Jr.</a>. Isis' brother then becomes a new addition to the Marvel Family under the name <a href="../../../o/s/i/Osiris_%28DC_Comics%29_1500.html#Osiris.2C_Amon_Tomaz" title="Osiris (DC Comics)">Osiris</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/s/i/Osiris_%28DC_Comics%29_1500.html#Osiris.2C_Amon_Tomaz" title="Osiris (DC Comics)">Osiris</a> is accepted into the <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Titans_629f.html" title="Teen Titans">Teen Titans</a>. Upon returning from a mission, he and the rest of the Black Marvel family are attacked by the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_Squad_1727.html" title="Suicide Squad">Suicide Squad</a>. Black Adam and his new family successfully defeat the Squad, but not before footage of them in battle (including Osiris' accidental killing of a Squad member) is captured by Amanda Waller, who uses it to further ruin the Black Marvel Family's reputation. Meanwhile, the Black Marvels' home country is struck with a number of natural disasters, which seem to have a supernatural origin.</p>
<p>Wracked with guilt over the murder of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persuader_%28comics%29.html" title="Persuader (comics)">Persuader</a>, Osiris pleads with the Marvel Family at the Rock of Eternity. He wishes to have his powers removed, as he fears Black Adam's influence (and those of his gods) has tainted him with evil. Black Adam arrives and the two battle until subdued by Isis and the Marvels. Osiris relents and accompanies the Black Marvel Family back home, only to be unexpectedly betrayed and brutally devoured by <a href="../../../s/o/b/Sobek_%28DC_Comics%29_1ea6.html" title="Sobek (DC Comics)">Sobek</a> while in his mortal form.</p>
<p>Isis and Adam are startled when Adam is struck by the magic lightning, and Osiris' powers are returned to him, restoring Adam's powers to pre-52 level. They confront Sobek, who reveals that he is the Fourth Horseman of <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apokolips.html" title="Apokolips">Apokolips</a>, Hunger (Famine). He and the other three (Pestilence, War, and Death) attack. Adam swiftly disposes of Sobek by pulling his jaws apart, but is initially pummelled by War. Pestilence infects Isis, enraging Adam enough to gain the upper hand against War, only to nearly be killed by Death. Defeated, Isis nevertheless manages to summon a stream of lava that blasts Death away, saving Adam. In her last words she says that she was wrong earlier about the basic goodness of human nature, and urges him to show no mercy to evil, and avenge her death. She dies in his arms as the magic lightning strikes yet again, presumably returning her powers to the Amulet of Isis, but according to an editor of 52, Adam gained her powers. The last panel depicts Black Adam's rage and sorrow.</p>
<p>After the funerals of his wife and brother-in-law, Black Adam spurns the comfort of both the Marvel Family and the new Question. Seething with fury, he flies to the neighboring nation of <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bialya.html" title="Bialya">Bialya</a>, where Death has taken refuge. Adam slaughters Bialya's government and army before turning his rage upon the country's citizens. When Death at last reveals itself, it has grown stronger, nourished by Black Adam's <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocidal</a> slaughter of millions of innocent Bialyan men, women and children. Despite this, Black Adam defeats Death in battle, then tortures it into revealing the whereabouts of its masters. Intent on revenge, Black Adam is seen flying toward Oolong Island at great speed, much to the delight of Dr. Sivana (one of the many scientists abducted and brought to Oolong by Intergang).</p>
<p>Black Adam easily smashes through the various Oolong Island defense systems, before being halted by an attack by several of the island's mad scientists coordinated by I.Q. and finally defeated when Dr. <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._O._Morrow_353d.html" title="T. O. Morrow">T. O. Morrow</a> activates a device designed to open a <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesseract.html" title="Tesseract">tesseract</a> "the size of a football field" within his invulnerable brain. The stunned Adam is fitted with a "Neuro Crown" (which reroutes the electrical impulses his brain sends his body) and turned over to Dr. Sivana for further experimentation.</p>

<p>Promotional art for DC's upcoming World War III event implies that Black Adam will be unleashed as a weapon under the scientists' (or more likely, Intergang's) control. On the back of 52 #44, he is shown with his eyes almost black in coloring.</p>

<p>When Theo Adam says the magic word "Shazam" and is transformed into Black Adam, he is granted the following powers (which are derived not from the same Greco/Roman/Biblical figures as Captain Marvel, but from more ancient Egyptian gods):</p>
<table class="wikitable">

<td><b>H</b></td>
<td>for the swiftness of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horus.html" title="Horus"><b>H</b>eru</a></td>

<tr>
<td><b>A</b></td>
<td>for the strength of <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amun.html" title="Amun"><b>A</b>mon</a></td>
<td>Black Adam has a phenomonal level of super strength, able to easily bend steel, punch through walls and lift massive objects. Adam's strength is enough that he can hold his own against beings such as <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Marvel_%28DC_Comics%29_6626.html" title="Captain Marvel (DC Comics)">Captain Marvel</a>.</td>

<td>Aton's power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Adam, also enhances Adam's other physical abilities, provides physical invulnerability and magic resistance against most magic spells and attacks, as well as allowing for interdimensional travel.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>M</b></td>
<td>for the courage of <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehen.html" title="Mehen"><b>M</b>ehen</a></td>
<td>This aspect is primarily psychological, and gives Adam superhuman amounts of inner strength from which to draw.</td>

</table>
<p>Additionally, Adam's senses are acutely sharpened (though not to the extent of Superman's).</p>
<p>Saying the magic word again initially changes Black Adam back into Theo Adam, although when the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spectre_%28comics%29.html" title="Spectre (comics)">Spectre</a> strips him of his powers during the Black Vengeance affair, he reverts to Teth Adam, the ancient Khandaqi farmer who was Mighty Adam. Subsquent depictions in the <i>52</i> series also show Teth Adam as Black Adam's default mortal identity. However, Black Adam very rarely changes back to his non-powered form. It is worth noting that as Captain Marvel shares his powers with the rest of the Marvel Family, Adam's unshared powers are often depicted as rendering him somewhat stronger than the Captain.</p>
