<p>As their power and knowledge had grown throughout the course of that Age, the Númenóreans had become increasingly preoccupied with the limits placed on their contentment—and eventually their power—by mortality, the purpose of which they began to question;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>But the fear of death grew ever darker upon them, and they delayed it by all means that they could; and they began to build great houses for their dead, while their wise men laboured unceasingly to discover if they might the secret of recalling life...</i> ('<a href="../../../a/k/a/Akallab%C3%AAth.html" title="Akallabêth">Akallabêth</a>' ~ <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Silmarillion_7dd6.html" title="The Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This growing wish to escape death, known as 'the doom of Men' (in contrast to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gift_of_Men_8a09.html" title="The Gift of Men">The Gift of Men</a>), also made most of the Númenóreans envious of the immortal Elves, or <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldar.html" title="Eldar">Eldar</a>, who they had come to physically resemble as part of their reward from <a href="../../../i/l/%C3%BA/Il%C3%BAvatar.html" title="Ilúvatar">Ilúvatar</a> for having been their allies. The Eldar sought ever to remind the men of Númenor however, that death was a gift from Ilúvatar to all men, and to lose faith in Ilúvatar would be heretical.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after S.A 2221, when Tar-Ancalimon became King of Númenor;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...the people of Númenor became divided. On the one hand was the greater party, and they were called the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Men_%28N%C3%BAmenor%29_82bf.html" title="King's Men (Númenor)">King's Men</a>, and they grew proud and were estranged from the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vala_%28Middle-earth%29_3b8a.html" title="Vala (Middle-earth)">Valar</a> and the Eldar.</i> ('Akallabêth' ~ <i>The Silmarillion</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The 'King's Men' therefore became increasingly predisposed to the corruption of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron.html" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>, who, after having arrived in Númenor;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...naturally had the One Ring, and so very soon dominated the minds and wills of most of the Númenóreans.</i> (<i>Letters</i> ~ No. 211)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Eventually, in Númenor's last years, the powerful but elderly King <a href="../../../a/r/-/Ar-Pharaz%C3%B4n_5748.html" title="Ar-Pharazôn">Ar-Pharazôn</a>, who had become "frightened of old age" (<i>Letters</i> ~ No.156), was persuaded by Sauron that Ilúvatar was a lie invented by the Valar, and seduced him;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...back to the worship of the Dark, and of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melkor.html" title="Melkor">Melkor</a> the Lord thereof, at first in secret, but ere long openly and in the face of his people.</i> ('Akallabêth' ~ <i>The Silmarillion</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Within Númenor, the majority immediately followed suit, and this worship quickly passed across the ocean to most of Númenor's colonies in Middle-earth;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>..for in the days of the sojourn of Sauron in that land the hearts of well nigh all its people had been turned towards darkness. Therefore many of those who sailed east in that time and made fortresses and dwellings upon the coasts were already bent to his will...</i> ('<a href="../../../o/f/_/Of_the_Rings_of_Power_and_the_Third_Age_d017.html" title="Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age">Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age</a>' ~ <i>The Silmarillion</i>)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>The Men of Númenor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward regions of the Great Lands, but for the most part they fell into evils and follies.

</dl>
<p>These sacrilegious 'black arts', which arose as a consequence of their worship of 'The Dark' and Melkor, marked the final, irrevocable division between the 'King's Men' and the minority known as the 'Faithful' Númenóreans, or the '<a href="../../../e/l/e/Elendili.html" title="Elendili">Elendili</a>', who kept to their old faith in Ilúvatar. They were also presumably the earliest religious rituals of those who became known afterwards as Black Númenóreans, along with a disbelief in Ilúvatar.</p>
<p>After their founding, the new Númenórean kingdoms of the Elendili saw their southern counterparts as renegades because of their beliefs, and coined the name that was used ever afterwards for them;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...the Black Númenóreans; for they established their dwellings in Middle-earth during the years of Sauron's domination, and they worshipped him, being enamoured of evil knowledge.</i> ('The Black Gate Opens' ~ <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>)</dd>

<p>Those few Númenóreans who had never disavowed the Eldar, and had always remained true to their belief in Ilúvatar, also survived the destruction of their homeland, and their Lord <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elendil.html" title="Elendil">Elendil</a>, a royal Númenórean, immediately established suzerainty over the most northerly Númenórean colonies, naming them <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondor.html" title="Gondor">Gondor</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnor.html" title="Arnor">Arnor</a>.

</dl>
<p>Throughout their existence, the Black Númenóreans held a low opinion of 'The Faithful' and their descendants, as</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...they inherited without lessening their hatred of Gondor.</i> ('Appendix A' ~ <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>).</dd>

</dl>
<p>For many centuries after the Downfall, descendants of the 'King's Men' held onto the southernmost of what had been Númenor's colonies in Middle-earth, the nearest of these new realms-in-exile to northwestern Middle-earth being <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbar.html" title="Umbar">Umbar</a>, where a Black Númenórean aristocracy survived for over a thousand years after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haradwaith.html" title="Haradwaith">Haradwaith</a>.

<p>Following Sauron's physical destruction during the drowning of Númenor (or possibly after the war of the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Alliance_of_Elves_and_Men_93de.html" title="Last Alliance of Elves and Men">Last Alliance</a>), it seems the Black Númenórean realms enjoyed a high degree of independence from him: in Umbar for example the giant white pillar commemorating the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Lord_63e6.html" title="Dark Lord">Dark Lord</a>'s humiliation by Ar-Pharazôn was still standing when the Black Númenóreans left in T.A 1050, over a thousand years after its erection by their ancestors (in fact, the monument was not destroyed until T.A 2951).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_N%C3%BAmen%C3%B3reans_bb51.html" title="Edit section: Famous Black Númenóreans">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Famous Black Númenóreans</span></h2>
<p>Two early Black Númenórean lords are named from the time of the late Second Age: <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herumor.html" title="Herumor">Herumor</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/i/Fuinur.html" title="Fuinur">Fuinur</a>. Like all Black Númenóreans and 'King's Men' before them, Herumor and Fuinur desired power over men of other, lesser races, and they "rose to (great) power amongst the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haradrim.html" title="Haradrim">Haradrim</a>", the peoples neighbouring Umbar. Their fate is unknown, but they perhaps shared Sauron's defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Another possibility suggested by many is that these two were ensnared by Sauron's <a href="../../../r/i/n/Rings_of_Power_887d.html" title="Rings of Power">Rings of Power</a> and so became <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringwraiths.html" title="Ringwraiths">Ringwraiths</a>.<sup title="Needs citation">[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i>citation&#160;needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>It is known for certain that three powerful lords of Númenor did become Ringwraiths: "(...)those who used the Nine Rings became mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old," and so they would be among the first Black Númenóreans, possibly synonymous with Herumor and Fuinor. In one of his letters Tolkien wrote that the Witch-king of Angmar, the greatest of the Ringwraiths, was probably of Númenórean descent.</p>
<p>In another letter, Tolkien wrote that <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Ber%C3%BAthiel_2abd.html" title="Queen Berúthiel">Queen Berúthiel</a>, wife of Gondor's King <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarannon_Falastur_8d9b.html" title="Tarannon Falastur">Tarannon Falastur</a> (9th century, T.A.), was a Black Númenórean, from a Black Númenórean realm he describes as "the inland city" somewhere south of Umbar. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a political accommodation. That such arrangements were possible implies the existence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans than the much later Mouth of Sauron.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_N%C3%BAmen%C3%B3reans_bb51.html" title="Edit section: In later centuries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In later centuries</span></h2>
<p>The triumph of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age marked the long decline of the Black Númenórean race:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>After the fall of Sauron their race swiftly dwindled or became merged with the Men of Middle-earth...</i> ('Appendix A' ~ <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<p>This was at least partly due to the fact that&#160;: <i>...some were given over wholly to idleness and ease, and some fought amongst themselves, until they became conquered in their weakness by the wild men.</i> ('The Window on the West' ~ <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>)</p>
<p>The Black Númenóreans faded into obscurity after their defeat in Umbar by <a href="../../../c/i/r/Ciryaher.html" title="Ciryaher">Ciryaher</a> in T.A 1050, although a population of sorts certainly survived somewhere as a distinct people at least until the end of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Age_ede9.html" title="Third Age">Third Age</a>: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mouth_of_Sauron_f038.html" title="The Mouth of Sauron">The Mouth of Sauron</a>, who mocked the army of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragorn.html" title="Aragorn">King Elessar</a> in front of the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morannon.html" title="Morannon">Morannon</a>, was a Black Númenórean "renegade", which is presumably the term used by the Free Peoples of that time to describe all folk of similar ancestry.</p>
<p>The Black Númenóreans did not use <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westron.html" title="Westron">Westron</a>, but probably retained their old tongue <a href="../../../a/d/%C3%BB/Ad%C3%BBnaic.html" title="Adûnaic">Adûnaic</a>, speaking a dialect of it.</p>
