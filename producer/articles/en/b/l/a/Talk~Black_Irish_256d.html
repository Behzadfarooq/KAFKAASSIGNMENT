<p>My father must be a myth then as he was born into a farming family near the West Coast of Ireland and is darker than most Spanish/Italians. There is no doubt in my mind that much historical information about the Irish has been subverted and obscured over the centuries for political and religious purposes. The occurrence of dark skinned Irish, especially along the west coast of Ireland, is significant enough to warrant further investigation.</p>

<dd>The point is not that there are not dark Irish. Obviously, there are. There are a lot of Irish people with dark hair and dark complexions, and there always have been. The real "subversion" has been the (American) conventional wisdom that all Irish are pale skinned and light or red-haired.</dd>

<dd>Jbull, the "political and religous purposes" are in reference to the Anti-Irish immigration attitudes in the U.S. in the 19th Century and early 20th Century. Irish were portrayed as dogged-looking leprechauns with hellish red hair and were characterized as being "subversive" by nature. The dominant class in America during this time was Anglo-Saxon and Protestant. Seeing an influx of Irish-Catholics in the major developed areas of American society was perceived as a threat to their environment.</dd>

<dd>Physical anthropology deals with groups of people with shared physical traits. There is no distinct population of "Black Irish." There are just Irish people, the majority of whom have brown hair. Listing the fictional "Black Irish" under "Anthropological categories of people" would be like listing another made-up category like "Black-haired Chinese." It's redundant and confusing. I'm removing it again.--Jbull 22:59, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for using the talk page. Even if it is a mistaken theory, the category is correct. We have articles is "Race" category for terms deemed incorest and obsolete, but still they are in the antropological category. Please don't confuse a scientific classification or <b>real life</b> with classification of articles.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, right now the dispute is purely academic, since it turns out there is a better category. You should have used it yourself, if you are expert in things Irish (whicle I am not). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 04:48, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have often heard the term "black Irish" used in Ireland to describe white Irish people who happen to have black or dark brown hair, brown eyes and a tan. If people think about it a bit they'll mention Spain and ancient trade links and maybe the Armada. That's about all there is to it. I'm not sure it constitutes an ethnicity or deserves an article.

<p>The phrasing of the first paragraph under 'Other uses of "Black Irish"' suggests that the Irish were used as slaves in the English and/or French Carribean. This is undocumented on the "Slavery" page. Perhaps this discussion should take place on the Slavery page, but as I am uninformed on this matter, perhaps I have just misread this phrase. If this is the case I suggest that it be rephrased to specify the status of the Irish mentioned.</p>
<p>I did a little research on this. It seems the scholarship is contested but it does appear that thousands of Irish people were taken as slaves and/or indentured servants to the British American Colonies, in the mid 1600's to work as domestics and labourers. <a href="http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/mailing_lists/CLA-L/2000/11/0041.php" class="external free" title="http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/mailing_lists/CLA-L/2000/11/0041.php" rel="nofollow">http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu/mailing_lists/CLA-L/2000/11/0041.php</a></p>

<p>As far as Montserrat goes I found accounts of Irish slaves, Irish servants and Irish slaveowners. Anything that can't be referenced in the entire article should be deleted because most of it is anecdotal. --Halib Frisk 09:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>this article suggests that the term "Black Irish" in releation to people who do not directly have have 1/4 to 1/2 Black African ancestry is limited to the US. I don't think that's true. I heard the term first about 10 years ago. Also there is the case of <a href="../../../h/a/e/Haemochromatosis.html" title="Haemochromatosis">Haemochromatosis</a>, one of the symptoms of which is the ability to tan easily. Apparently 1 in 5 people of Irish descent carry the gene and it manifests itself in about 1:86 ( <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4842700.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4842700.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4842700.stm</a> ). I know someone who has just been diagnosed with the condition (the iron levels in his blood were 20 times the norm) and he has to have 1 pint of blood removed from his body each week, he's been doing it for 6 weeks now and will continue to do so until the iron in his body returns to normal levels. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 15:51, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As some of you who have ever been to Ireland may already know, most Irish are not pale with red hair. Those minority characteristics probably stem from Scandinavian settlement of Ireland during late antiquity/the early middle ages. The Celts who settled France, England, and Ireland were a people who originated in Eastern Europe. More specifically, the Gaels who settled Ireland were possibly settled first in Iberia. Here is a direct quote from the Wikipedia article on the Gaels:</p>
<p>"The Gaels, during the beginning of the Christian era (at which time Gaelic people were mostly restricted to Ireland), believed themselves to be descendants of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milesians_%28Irish%29_e444.html" title="Milesians (Irish)">Míl Espáine</a> coming from the north of Iberia, mainly Gallaecia (modern Galicia and northern Portugal), where there existed also an early form of Ogham script. This belief persists in the Gaelic cultures of Ireland and Scotland up to the present day, with many if not most clan leaders in either country claiming descent from their predecessor, back to famous historical kings going back into pre-history. Much of this is covered in the Lebor Gabála Érenn, which catalogues the path of the Gaels' ancestors in a way that, while mostly mythic, may be an embellished account of actual historical events. Discovery of a form of early Ogham script in Gallaecia, as well as genetic studies linking the Gaels to the Basques and Galicians in northwestern Spain, lends credence to such a theory."</p>
<p>My mother is of %100 Irish descent, and her skin is tanner than mine could ever hope to be. We both have dark hair, nearly black. Couldn't these characterristics, common to many of Irish ancestry, have something to do with the Mediterranean/Eastern/Southern European ancestry of the Irish?</p>

<p>Black Irish are distinctive enough to be classified as far outside the normal range of any northern-European ethnic group in that they are born with perfectly straight totally jet-black hair. Also, almond-shaped eyes are seen occasionally among the Irish. For instance; Frank McCourt complained that his schoolmates used to tease him, calling him “squint-eyed Jap.” You’d think someone would put two and two together, especially since every now and then Asian women--many of whom never saw a white man in their lives--living in remote parts of Western China and Outer Mongolia to this day sometimes give birth to blue-eyed babies, and sometimes even babies with red hair and freckles.</p>
<p>If that isn’t enough, however, recently archeologists have uncovered Celtic mummies buried in the deserts of Western China.</p>

<p>It would be nearly impossible for a Celtic population, what with their horses and wagons and nomadic tendencies, not to have traded with the Chinese and establish colonies in far-off places, then routinely intermarry and take their families back to the west coast of Europe.</p>

<dd>I seriously doubt that Frank McCourt's appearance has anything to do with the fact that a mummy in China had tartan on it! He doesn't look typically Irish, true, maybe he had some ancestors from the Liverpool Chinese community (lots of movement between Liverpool and Ireland) or maybe some early eastern european immigrants (he looks a bit <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serb.html" title="Serb">Serbian</a> imo).

<dd>Ireland was settled in pre-Celtic times. As you point out people traded back and forth over long distances. Celtic culture and language arrived in Ireland from central Europe. That does not mean that a large number of Celts arrived in Ireland and displaced the population. --Halib Frisk 09:31, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Being an Irish person, I have personally never come across this term until recent years, after joining a forum and hearing it from American members of that forum. I had always naturally assumed it referred to African-descended Irish people.</p>
<p>However, in regard to this term, as applied to black-haired people, I think it should be noted that black hair is the most common hair colour in Ireland as far as I'm aware, as are blue eyes. Also, some mention should probably be made of the surname <i>Black</i>, which is the Anglicisation of <i>Dubh</i> meaning "dark (of complexion or hair)", eg Clann Mhic Gille Dhuibh = "son of the black lad", and similar with the surname <i>Brown</i>. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 22:15, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ArnieP,</p>
<p>The term "Black Irish" generally ascribes to Irish individuals with very dark hair, as opposed to the blond or red variation often associated with Ireland and her descendants. Eye color and complexion may vary. Irishman <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierce_Brosnan_541b.html" title="Pierce Brosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a>, to whom has dark brown hair and blue eyes has gone on record considering himself a representative of the so-called "Black Irish" look. What Mal finds confusing is the notion that such a term as "Black Irish" even exists, considering that most inhabitants of Ireland are dark haired.</p>
<p>Mal,</p>
<p>Although dark hair is the most common hue in Ireland, for whatever reason, many individuals consider the Irish to be generally rufous or blond. As a result, they term persons of Irish descent having dark brown or black hair as "Black Irish" often suggesting the darker hair, eyes or complexion derives from survivors of the Spanish Armada in Ireland. Colin Farrell with his dark brown hair, brown eyes and medium complexion, along with Lara Flynn Boyle with her brown hair, blue eyes and pale freckled complexion are both looked upon as what some call "Black Irish." – — ArmsHeldOut 03:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quotes from celebrity magazines aren't acceptable as sources for Black Irish. The red hair gene is associated with freckles- this is from a scandinavian and germanic genetic origin not an <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Europe_575e.html" title="Atlantic Europe">Atlantic origin</a>. It has been proven in DNA studies that the Western Irish have less germanic and scandinavian genetic forebears therefore they also have less red hair genes, therefore it is inappropriate to suggest that freckles are a characteristic of the Black Irish.

<p>'Black Irish' in tradition generally refers to persons of pure (or mostly) Irish descent with very dark brown or black hair. The half Irish/Italian characters appearing in the film Goodfellas (although fictional) could have arguably inherited their dark looks by way of Southern Italian lineage, as opposed to an age-old neolithic strain in parts of Ireland.</p>

<p>"Black Irish" was used to describe someone with blue-black hair, blue eyes, and pale white skin. This phenotype was used as an example of what can happen when populations breed in isolation (like, on islands). Usually, dark hair goes with dark eyes and skin. But, the lecture went, in some regions, the "Black Irish" combo developed and was retained because of endogamy (breeding within the group). FYI ...</p>
<p>I personally find the term interesting because I have ancestors and cousins with this coloring.</p>

<p>It's interesting how many stories surround it all. The Irish have many types of coloring ...all genetic imports.

<p>You folks have missed a few other possible explanations for "Black Irish". They say that the black irish were a mix of Spanish and Irish blood from when the Spanish Armada crashed on the Western seabord of Ireland in 1588. The remaining survivors were said to have stayed in Ireland and intermarried w/Irish women there, creating olive-complected, black-haired, dark-eyed descendents. It is also said the Black Irish are those people who still live in the Caribbean today on an island called Marreats. They are a mix of African and Irish (and indigenous/indian too, I'm sure), exactly like me! to this day, they still have a Celtic accent.</p>

<p>In response to Re: Black Irish - American myth posted by irish7774:</p>
<p>Recient genetic testing puts the Irish most closely related to the Basque of Spain, and the original people of Europe. The Irish don't have dark skin. Their skin is light, and often freckled. Their hair can be black, brown, blond or red. What differntiates the black irish from other irish is their black hair only. Strait or wavy thick black Caucasian hair.</p>
<p>The eyes, can be blue, green or brown..but often green. I know many black irish families with blue eyes.</p>
<p>Here in New England, where most of the Irish in the USA arrived from the potato famine era one speaks of them mainly being from Western and South Western Irleand, catholic, and black Irish. The potato famine didn't affect all of ireland, but was rather something visited upon Western Irelands catholic farming folks, which is where the black Irish hail from.</p>
<p>Legends in Ireland place the black irish ancestrys origins in Spain, and give over two stories for their existance.. One story, which is pritty much discounted tells of the sinking of the Spanish Amada and male sailor survivors washing up on the western shores of Ireland and mating with the local coastal village women.</p>
<p>The other legend, with some of the details based in fact, but still not completly provable tells of the spanish seaport that was built at gallway bay, west ireland during the sixtten or seventeen hundreds. The fact is the territory of the black Irish fan out from the central position of gallway bay. The fact is the seaport did exist and was spanish. The rest is only speculation.</p>
<p>Given the new discovery, that the Irish are decendent of the original europeaners and closest relatives to the Basques...and the Basques being in northern Spain France lends, if anything, curiosity when thinking of the Black Irish claim or origins.</p>
<p>The black Irish in the USA hail from two sources..the actual black Irish who came here during the potato famine from western Ireland circa mid 1800's...and the other kind..folks who wanted to pass as white, and so claimed to be black Irish mistaking the term to mean irish that were dark or black.</p>
<p>For an irishman, whats black in the black irish is the hair. If someone is irish and has dark skin, it came by them from elsewhere outside of Ireland..and probably was aquired on this side of the pond.</p>
<p><b>From Readers Comments on The Myth of the Black Irish:</b></p>
<p>10) Wed, 15 Jan 1997, Scott Locklin Interesting article. A few comments: firstly, my family tradition was that the Black Irish were desccendants of Spanish who escaped during the Moorish invasions of Europe. Second, I have read a number of older sourcebooks who identify the Firbolgs as the Black Irish; the race prior to the Tuatha de Dannan. They were supposed to have been swarthy types, and were identified with Iberia (which supposedly had a linguistic link with the word for the underworld, as opposed to the "sun people" - the Tuatha de Dannan), and were supposed to have retreated to the present day areas of "black irish" enclaves. There's also a reference in Tacitus' "Germanica" to swarthy "Iberian" welshmen. I'll be digging into primary sources as soon as I get my library ID, if you're interested in references.</p>
<p>12) Thu, 30 Jan 1997, Betty Massman Hi ....... I enjoyed your article on the "Black Irish", but I'd like to know if there is any connection between them and the "Black Dutch" who descended from the Sephardic Jews of Spain? The Black Dutch seem to display the same characteristics as the Black Irish ...... dark hair, dark eyes, dark complexion. They were in Spain at the time of the Inquisition in the 1400's/ 1500's, and I am curious as to whether or not the Black irish descend from the same bunch. Do you know? I haven't done a lot of research on the Black Dutch, mainly because I don't have any in my ancestry as far as I can tell, but I'm a genealogical researcher and some of my clients have asked about them. I understand that there is a Black Dutch Research Project underway through Gelee Corley Hendrix, C.G., F.A.S.G. at 3 Acorn Court, Greenville SC 29609-3111. I will get in touch with this person and see what's been done, and I will keep you posted. One friend has Black Irish in her background, but so far, she has batted zero in finding out anything about them ... she was very happy to see your article. I will also get in touch with M. J. Laney and see if he knows of any connections. The Black Dutch also went up into Germany and Russia, and maybe some other countries too, then emigrated to America in the 18th and 19th centuries. Very interesting.</p>
<p>7) Fri, 15 Nov 1996, John Whitehouse, Jr. It is a fascinating subject. I have been in search of some reference to differentiate between red haired green-eyed Irish, usually with freckles, on the one hand, and the blue-eyed with black hair and very pale skin. These are, to my observation, the prevalent Irish types. My question is: what is their prevenance, what was the difference between the cultures from which they hail? I've been wondering about this for years, particularly since both the "red" and the "black" appear to be Catholic. By the way, I have heard this black-haired, PALE, blue-eyed type as "Black Irish", also. If you even have a clue as to the answer to my question, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks. [p.s.] I forgot to say that I find your paper to be an excellent piece of research. well-written and well-researched. It's relatively rare to find something of such quality in cyberspace. [p.p.s.] One question, though. Do you have any knowledge or suspicions concerning the place of origin for the red-haired green-eyed Irish phenotype?</p>
<p>14) Mon, 7 Sep 1998, Marvin C. Shaw None of the above. Black Irish refers to a physical type including milk-white skin, often with freckles, blue eyes, and jet black hair, found among most Celtic peoples.</p>

<p>Although studies have shown the western half of Ireland as having <i>somewhat</i> less Germanic DNA, it should be known that darker phenotypes are not <b>exclusive</b> to the west. Actors Aidan Gillen, Colin Farrell and Pierce Brosnan (depicted by some as 'Black Irish') each hail from the east of Eire (County Dublin and County Louth respectively). Furthermore, a good quantity of Irish persons with blond, red or (light to medium) brown hair can also be found in the west. My point? Those who believe that raven-haired Irish can <b>only</b> be found in the west should take what they read (regardless of source material) with a grain of salt and invest some time in personal research. After all, nothing beats what you observe with your own two eyes. Food for thought.</p>
<p>On a side note, here are dual links to a couple images of 2 well known celebrities who some consider to well exemplify the 'Black Irish' look.</p>
<p>The first is the aforementioned Colin Farrell<a href="http://www.unreel.co.uk/reviews/s/SWAT/co1.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unreel.co.uk/reviews/s/SWAT/co1.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a good example of the dark hair, brown eyed, medium to olive complexioned type.</p>
<p>The second is Lauren Graham.<a href="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b250/ArmsHeldOut/Graham%20Girl/grahamlauren0202.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b250/ArmsHeldOut/Graham%20Girl/grahamlauren0202.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> With her blue eyes, fair skin and freckles, this Irish-American beauty likely owes much of her makeup to Germanic ancestors, in addition to visitors from across the Atlantic. Of course, any person of Irish descent with very dark brown or black hair can be arguably viewed as Black (haired) Irish.</p>

Many individuals (not just Americans) are ignorant about the appearance of Europeans and often stereoptype them to look and act a certain way. Although many Irish have very dark hair, quite a following perceive them as typically being redheads or blondes with light eyes and freckles. I presume this is how the term initially came about, but I can assure you that is not only used in the United States. In fact, I was introduced to it by an elder couple from Ireland with connections to Scotland. I do agree; however, that the term likely originated in America, but it can actually be heard in several different nations.</p>
<p>Be advised that the opening statement was modified sometime today to address your concerns, by referencing the origin of the term as being in North America. With that stated, there is no need to replace the word 'traditional' with 'American' is there?</p>
<p>Have a another look below.</p>
<p>Black Irish is a traditional term believed to have <b>originated in North America</b> that commonly ascribes to a dark brown or black hair phenotype appearing in persons of Irish descent.</p>
<p>Perhaps an article on the supposed "Black Irish" is silly, considering that so many of the Irish are naturally dark haired. Nonetheless, there are many other sites on the internet which discuss this term at length. With Wiki, you can at least have a say and try to make the information which is out there as accurate as possible.</p>

<p>Also, I'd like to add that lighter hair/lighter eyes is just a stereotype. Most Irish still today have at least dark hair (brown/black). That's not to say that the Irish did not have lighter hair before the Viking and Saxon invasions, but that these invasions had a large influence in introducing these phenotypes into the Irish Celtic population, so much so they became a stereotype. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <small><font color="green"><u><b><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">hablar</a></b></u></font></small> <small><font color="green"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Revoluci%C3%B3n_ac29.html" title="Special:Contributions/Revolución">ver</a></b></font></small> 10:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, 'Black (haired) Irish' is just a traditional term that most likely originated in the US which refers to white Irish people with very dark brown/black hair - think actor Peter Gallagher. The term generally does not denote typical Irish folk with light or medium brown hair. John F. Kennedy, for example, would not be a good example of the 'Black Irish' look. The term used in the main context of this article really has nothing to do with actual black people living in Ireland.</p>
<p>As you've stated, many Irish do have very dark hair. On the other hand, light eyes is quite common even amongst those with dark brown or black hair. FYI, the notion of lighter haired Irish (particularly redheads) being falsely perceived as the majority is already referenced in the opening paragraph of the article. See below:</p>
<p>'Black Irish is a traditional term believed to have originated in North America that commonly ascribes to a dark brown or black hair phenotype appearing in persons of Irish descent. <b>It can be distinguished in contrast to the (lighter) brown, blond or red hair color variant, the latter stereotypically perceived by many to solely personify the look of typical Irish folk.'</b></p>

<p>The term 'Black Irish' used in the main context of this article is non-derogatory, as it refers to people of Irish descent with very dark brown or black hair color, accompanied by a romantic myth pertaining to the Spanish Armada or genetic studies linking the Irish to the Basque Country. Bias against the Irish during the Victorian Age of Britain and 19th century America targeted all persons of Irish descent (especially Catholics) for social and political reasons, regardless of physical appearance and is another subject entirely. As such, the section 'Racial bias against Irish' should either be moved to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Irish_racism_df3e.html" title="Anti-Irish racism">Anti-Irish racism</a> page or truncated and placed in the 'Other Uses' section of this article.</p>

I'm inclined to remove this reference (from the lead paragraph), but since I am not familiar with this topic, nor the discussion on the talk page that prompted the inclusion of this reference, I will wait for now.

Various taxes, tithes, penal laws, anti-British feeling and vindictive landlords helped drive many to arms. The so-called Whiteboy code was a reaction to this stratification of society, particularly the rise of the tenant classes, and which generally pushed for a return to the pre-inclosure system of commons. This agrarian unrest was not unique to Ireland and it is important to remember that the whiteboys were one of a number of agrairan anti-establishment groupings in Ireland of that period (others being the Defenders, the Peep O'Day Boys, .</dd>

<p>This entire article is perpetuating a complete and fabricated misuse of the term. The term "Black Irish" does not refer to people of Irish heritage or descent with black hair. It refers to a class of Irish people, generally the Catholic underclass of Ireland. Black is often used as an unfavorable term in this and similar contexts: e.g., Black '47, the Black Rose. The term "Black Irish" was used to distinguish from the "noble" Irish, i.e. the families of the Protestant Norman English settlers. It has vague ethnic overtones, in the same broad sense that the English called not only the Africans "black," but also the Maori, the Australian Aborigines, etc. The Celtic, Catholic Irish, especially those in the poor rural areas, especially those in Western Ireland, were not necessarily seen as "white." It's important to understand that these perceptions were vague and not as clearly defined as they are in the late 20th- or early 21st-century Western World. This is a concept that would not have been articulated or classified as it is now. But, when censuses were taken in the mid-19th century, "Irish" was not the same classification as "white." The Irish, like the Italians, were a different race than the "Anglo-Saxon" (also a misnomer, as most descendants of families who consider themselves Anglo-Saxon generally have at least as much Celtic (via Scotland, Cornwall, and Wales, and old Britain) and (especially) Norman blood as they do that of the Angles or the Saxons). So, the term "Black Irish' has been used by different people at different times in slightly different ways, but it was always a variation on the same theme - referring to the poor, Catholic Irish underclass. It was mostly employed by those who wanted to make a distinction in the fact that there were Protestant, educated, "civilized" "Irish" folk.</p>
<p>I don't know when this "Black Irish" term in regard to hair color and the further extrapolation into theories about insertion of (e.g.) Iberian blood came up, but it is quite obviously a relatively recent fabrication and a misuse of the historical term. Perhaps it came from Irish Americans who had heard the term referred to by their ancestors, but had no idea of the meaning, since the context had made it an outdated term by then and no longer employed, except as a historical term of self-reference - much is the same way that African-Americans would refer to, or in extreme cases even use, the term "nigger" when it may have fallen out of use or favor by those who originally employed it as a pejorative. The oppressed like to keep their history alive more than do the oppressors (see, for example, which side preserves the history of the Holocaust more - the Jews or the Germans). So, my theory is that these young Irish Americans would hear their grandparents use the term in conversation, but not having lived through the oppression of the Irish themselves, never heard it used against them. The term was obviously of some import, but they had no idea of its meaning. So, a conjecture meaning was created, the obvious one being that it referred to those with dark features. And, as has been pointed out already, although dark coloring is held by a majority of Irish, the stereotype, especially in America, is that the Irish have fair hair, especially red. It's not hard to see where the conjecture would originate, but the fact is that this is not the historical origin of the term and this encyclopedia should stop perpetuating it.</p>

<p>An exhaustive search of the histories of Ireland tell of no sizable settlement of Ireland by any Spanish Armada sea-men. Indeed, the term, <i>Black Irish</i> hardly appears in the indexes of any Irish history.

<p>This article pretty much affirms that the Spanish Armada did not contribute much at all to the Irish genepool. Read the origin section.</p>
