<p>While it was generally agreed that the game's <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphics.html" title="Graphics">graphics</a> and sound (music composed by Frank Klepacki) succeeded in adapting the cult film's haunting atmosphere, the designers' attempt at innovating gameplay such as simplifying the <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_interface.html" title="User interface">interface</a>, adding <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_game.html" title="Action game">action</a> elements, replacing a traditional inventory with a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Database.html" title="Database">database</a> of clues, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randomization.html" title="Randomization">randomization</a> of some events as well as multiple endings were given mixed reviews.

<p>The Blade Runner videogame is based on the 1982 movie of the same name. The game is set not long after the beginning of the movie (we can see this as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_characters_in_Blade_Runner_c0de.html#Dr._Eldon_Tyrell" title="List of minor characters in Blade Runner">Tyrell</a> hasn't been killed yet, as well as many more minor plot details, such as Holden having been attacked and taken out of commission and, in an optional meeting with Tyrell, the mention of Tyrell being in a meeting with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Deckard_f178.html" title="Rick Deckard">Deckard</a> earlier that day), in November of 2019. Our protagonist, Ray McCoy, is a rookie Bladerunner under command of Guzza, a police officer of superior rank. True to the film, the environment is similar, a <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dystopian.html" title="Dystopian">dystopian</a>, heavily polluted <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, brought to life by the fledgling 3D Real Time technology of the day. Also included are some landmarks from the movie, such as the dominating Tyrell <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid.html" title="Pyramid">pyramid</a> structures.</p>
<p>McCoy is faced with the task of tracking down a group of replicants and "retiring" (killing) them. The game is unique to the point and click genre in that it begins in a highly complicated fashion, and continues that way till the game's conclusions. You progress through a number of crime scenes, in which you must gather evidence, this is a matter of being highly observative of surroundings as well as using techniques typical of <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detectives.html" title="Detectives">detectives</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_%28video_game%29_6608.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Blade Runner</i> videogame is notable for its accurate-to-the-movie, even lovingly-imitated environments, and for remaining quite true to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_K_Dick_3e06.html" title="Philip K Dick">Philip K Dick</a>'s novel. The game is in some ways even truer to the book than was the movie, in that Ray McCoy is more troubled by his identity than the film version of Deckard - much like the book's version of said character. Ray laments through a character named Lucy, who faces a similar dilemma; the theme is carried further by the many choices the player can make for Ray, which determine his eventual fate. Puzzle solving is a major element of the game: one must solve a number of compulsory puzzles and find a number of clues in order to progress the game's storyline.</p>
<p>Clues are found by searching crime scenes and areas in general, the first such scene being a trashed pet shop. Clues come in the form of items, photographs, personal interviews or unusual markings. One can also use the ESPER system, located in the police precinct and in McCoy's apartment, to enhance photos, potentially finding some crucial information.</p>
<p>Combat in <i>Blade Runner</i> is occasional and extremely simplistic. There is one weapon in the game; Ray's standard issue police <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pistol.html" title="Pistol">pistol</a>. However different varieties of <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition.html" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a> are available.</p>
<p>In 1997 when the game was released, Westwood promoted the game's then-unique "Real Time" system, which mainly comprises a series of scripted character paths and events; which should in theory add up to a highly replayable game. The game also includes considerable <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randomization.html" title="Randomization">randomization</a> of certain events, but ultimately these do not have a major effect. The alignment of certain characters (whether they are human or replicant) also varies between playthroughs, and an experienced player can tell what certain characters will be from the evidence collected - e.g. whether McCoy perceives a suspect as an expert or amateur bomber. The game includes thirteen different endings, some of which vary slightly depending on choice. Much akin to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_K_Dick_3e06.html" title="Philip K Dick">Philip K Dick</a>'s writing (or many crime novels), the game deceives and confuses the player intermittently, before eventually allowing them to witness Ray's destiny.</p>

<p>Ray McCoy is the game's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagonist.html" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a> and a <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rookie.html" title="Rookie">rookie</a> police officer, with the badge number BR 61 661. He is younger and less experienced than his film counterpart Deckard, since he was only recently assigned to the Blade Runner unit (officially known as <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicant.html" title="Replicant">Replicant</a> Detection, or "Rep Detect"). Other Runners often treat him with condescension (Crystal, for example) or patronize him (such as Gaff). McCoy lives in an apartment building (apartment 88F) with his pet <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a>, Maggie, for whom he shows a great deal of affection.</p>
<p>During the course of the game Ray investigates several crimes, including animal murders (a serious crime in the dystopian world of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_090c.html" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a>), <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homicide.html" title="Homicide">homicide</a> or illegal weapons selling. Eventually, he is framed for murder of Izo, a black market gun runner, by his superior, Lieutenant Guzza, who considers him dangerous to his business at the police station, which involves deals with black market providers or silencing of witnesses. Forced to hide, McCoy explores the dark, decrepit underworld of 2019 Los Angeles, which allows him to make contact with the Twins Luther and Lance, former Tyrell employees, and break into the Tyrell Corporation pyramids, to steal the basic DNA sequence for the NEXUS-6 replicant series. When twins are given this data, they reward McCoy with a detailed report containing all evidence of Guzza's crimes, which McCoy uses to blackmail his former superior and force him to set his falsified record straight, and to set up a meeting in the kipple, where Guzza used to meet his black market contacts. It is during this face-off that Guzza is wounded by Sadik's <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulse_rifle.html" title="Pulse rifle">pulse rifle</a>, and the decision as to what to do with him (the player can either run off from the scene or perform a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_de_grace.html" title="Coup de grace">coup de grace</a> on the lieutenant). This decision affects the game's ending.</p>
<p>McCoy wears a light brown <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lounge_suit.html" title="Lounge suit">lounge suit</a>, a dark tie and a brown <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenchcoat.html" title="Trenchcoat">trenchcoat</a>, looking similar to Deckard. He uses a standard issue <a href="../../../2E/4/5/.45.html" title=".45">.45</a> blaster as his sidearm.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_%28video_game%29_6608.html" title="Edit section: Crystal Steele">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Crystal Steele</span></h3>
<p>Crystal Steele, badge number BR 61 354, is one of the most effective police officers in the <a href="../../../l/a/p/LAPD_353b.html" title="LAPD">LAPD</a> Blade Runner unit. She is an excellent <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marksman.html" title="Marksman">marksman</a>, setting nearly a perfect score on the police shooting range, and also an exceptional undercover cop. She refers to replicants as skin-jobs and is very much in favour of their extermination. She also has rather unconventional methods of interrogating suspects, as evidenced by her questioning of Spencer Grigorian, who at first refused to give details about suspicious individuals in his group. However, in the second part of the same interview, he hastily describes them, and he is clearly shaken. In regards to Ray McCoy, she is playful, with a considerable amount of condescension towards the rookie.</p>
<p>Her cases often intersect with McCoy's, such as the aforementioned Tyrell manufacturing plant bombing, carried out by Sadik, one of the replicants involved in Izo's black market trade. Crystal also saves McCoy's life before he can be executed by two cops sent by Guzza to silence him. Shortly thereafter he is marked as a suspect and an <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_points_bulletin.html" title="All points bulletin">APB</a> is put out on him, but Steele lets him go, stating that he's "not on her list". Her fate in the game is ultimately tied to the player's actions, and she can either die (killed by the player or in an explosion set up by Sadik) or survive and pair up with McCoy following the retirement of Clovis, the rogue replicants' leader, in the Moonbus.</p>

<p>Gaff is a character originally presented in the film. He is a competent, veteran cop who appears at various intervals to give advice to McCoy, who he seems to see as young and thus unpredictable. He taunts "You killed anyone yet?" in a semi-playful, semi-serious attempt to coax McCoy into a response. He shares Crystal's view on <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicant.html" title="Replicant">replicants</a>, though to a lesser, more casual extent.</p>

<p>Lt. Guzza is the boorish, overweight superior to McCoy and overall commander-in-chief of the Blade Runner unit following Bryant's leave. Guzza is rather unkempt and asocial, remaining in Bryant's office for most of Blade Runner's duration, appearing briefly in the Hawker's circle in the Animoid Row, where he is photographed by Izo, talking to a policeman looking strikingly similar to the one who later arrests and interrogates McCoy.</p>
<p>The arrest was set up by Guzza, who has framed McCoy for murder; McCoy was coming too close to discovering Guzza's illegal operations. These included dealing with replicants (despite his apparent hatred for them) and selling police grade weaponry on the black market. With use of incept photos provided by Clovis, Guzza marks Ray McCoy as a replicant, hoping that he will be removed. However, the framed blade runner manages to procure a detailed report of Guzza's illegal activities. Using this information, he eventually forces Guzza to dismiss the charges and clear his file, and makes him meet with McCoy deep underneath <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.</p>
<p>Guzza's most probable fate is to be killed during the meeting in the kipple surrounding Los Angeles, and his body to disappear in the extremely toxic waste flowing beneath the city.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_%28video_game%29_6608.html" title="Edit section: Clovis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clovis</span></h3>
<p>The leader of the renegade replicants on Earth, Clovis is a man of mystery - on one hand, he appears as a peaceful, highly educated man, eloquent and elegant, on the other he is sometimes a ruthless brute, capable of inhuman acts of aggression, as evidenced by his attack on Runciter's animals. He led the hijacking of the Moonbus, which allowed him and his followers to arrive on Earth, seeking a way to extend their four year lifespan. He also wanted to see the serene and beautiful planet he learned about from books. The disappointment of seeing it devastated by the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_World_War_7369.html" title="Third World War">Terran war</a> might have added to his determination.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the game, he works to acquire different elements of replicant <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> in order to fulfill the goal of living and manages to coerce two siamese twins, Luther and Lance, to bypass the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virus.html" title="Virus">virii</a> encoded in the DNA and prolong the lifespan. The search for DNA would take him to Los Angeles DNA row, where Tyrell subcontractors work, without the corporation's security. Contacted contractors icluded Moraji, who designed the skin (leaving him to die with an explosive charge planted by Sadik next to him) and J.F. Sebastian, the nervous system designer. The search would even take Clovis to Tyrell's headquarters, where he confronted the doctor himself, almost killing him before the security intervened and forced him to jump through the window.</p>
<p>Clovis was an extremely intelligent man, similar to Roy Batty, who would carefully plan and execute those plans. When he struck a bargain with Guzza, which included false evidence to frame McCoy, he intended to coerce the detective into acquiring DNA data for him and eventually make him join the replicants.</p>
<p>His ultimate fate is highly dependent on the player's actions - if he chooses to ally with the replicants by shooting Guzza in the sewers, he can either make his way to the Moonbus and leave with him and Sadik, or, if he spared one of his potential love interests (Dektora or Lucy) he can leave with them via the ruined tunnel beneath Crazy Legs Larry's car dealership. In the former ending, Clovis survives and leads the replicants off-world, while in the latter he is shot on-board the Moonbus by Gaff. If the player chooses to side with the police, he assists Steele in killing the remaining renegade replicants, eventually confronting the resigned Clovis.</p>
<p>Clovis is voiced by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rolston_0c9c.html" title="Mark Rolston">Mark Rolston</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sadik, Zuben, Dektora, Luther &amp; Lance (the twins) and Gordo Frizz</b> are the game's remaining replicants. Their characters develop in cut-scenes and player's interactions with them. Their main goal is to evade "retirement", and to acquire the DNA sequences used to create them, which would allow them to live longer. They would then escape Earth on a hijacked <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonbus.html" title="Moonbus">moonbus</a>. Some are neither aggressive or hateful towards human beings (Clovis and Sadik being exceptions on several occasions). The <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicant.html" title="Replicant">replicants</a> are extremely wary of their status as <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugitives.html" title="Fugitives">fugitives</a>. Some of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicant.html" title="Replicant">replicants</a> hold down jobs: Zuben works in a Chinese restaurant as a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chef.html" title="Chef">chef</a>; Dektora is a model/exotic dancer; and the twins are recently dismissed employees of the Tyrell corporation turned wheeler dealers, mostly in the business of passing artificial animals off as the genuine article; and Gordo Frizz is a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedian.html" title="Comedian">comedian</a>. It should be noted that Sadik, Dektora and Gordo may or may not be replicants, depending on how the plot unfolds. Clovis, Zuben and the twins are the only characters in the game who are guaranteed to be replicants on every playthrough.</p>
<p><b>Eldon Tyrell</b> is another character originally presented in the film, the founder, CEO and owner of the Tyrell Corporation. He is a remarkable genius, being responsible for developing the basic DNA sequence for the NEXUS-6 series of replicants. He is good friends with Dr. Marcus Eisenduller, a gravity expert, and J.F. Sebastian, a DNA designer living in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradbury_building.html" title="Bradbury building">Bradbury building</a> in DNA Row in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As he is not yet deceased, one assumes the game is set shortly after the beginning of the film. Tyrell owns an artificial <a href="../../../o/w/l/Owl.html" title="Owl">owl</a>, which is very rare, as owls were one of the first species to become extinct following <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a>.</p>
<p><b>Lucy</b> is a teenager of about 14 who is unsure whether she is a replicant or a human, and is very concerned as to which she truly is. The extent to which she can appear in the game depends on the player's actions. If she comes to interact with Ray, she grows very fond of him, seeing him as a dependable figure. Lucy may or may not be a replicant, but within the game is more often than not identified as human, via the Voight-Kampff test.</p>
<p><b>Rachel</b> is Tyrell's secretary, and as with Rachel in the film is a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicant.html" title="Replicant">replicant</a> who mimics humanity extremely well; she is modeled after Tyrell's niece. She is very attractive, well spoken, and brusque, and appears only briefly within the game. As she has not yet paired with Deckard, one again assumes the game is set shortly after the beginning of the movie. Her status as a confirmed replicant is not revealed in the game.</p>
<p><b>J.F Sebastian</b> is also similar to his film counterpart, a reclusive <a href="../../../l/o/n/Loner.html" title="Loner">loner</a> residing in the enormous, bleak and dilapidated <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bradbury_Building_4ee0.html" title="Bradbury Building">Bradbury Building</a>, accompanied only by his eerie <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robotic.html" title="Robotic">robotic</a> <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppets.html" title="Puppets">puppets</a>. He owns several futuristic devices, such as a synthetic egg creator. He is one of the chief scientists who assisted in the creation of the Nexus 6 replicant models.</p>
<p><b>Chew</b> is another scientist who assisted the Tyrell corporation in the creation of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Replicant.html" title="Replicant">replicants</a>, unlike J.F Sebastian, his speciality is <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye.html" title="Eye">eyes</a>. He is much like the Chew we see in the motion picture; highly <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence.html" title="Intelligence">intelligent</a>, but at the same time a wary, <a href="../../../e/c/c/Eccentricity_%28behavior%29.html" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">eccentric</a> and cautious person. He conducts his work in a small laboratory opposite the twins' apartment.</p>
<p><b>Bryant</b> is the police captain of the precinct, but is supposedly absent from the game due to sick leave. His stand-in is Lieutenant Guzza.</p>
<p><b>Izo</b> is a gun dealer of seemingly <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian.html" title="Asian">Asian</a> descent specializing in the dealing of rare, high specification automatic guns. He supplies these weapons to the replicants and sympathizes with their cause. He also owns a <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">Samurai</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katana.html" title="Katana">sword</a>, and when cornered he becomes highly aggressive. Prior to becoming a felon, he was a member of a fledgling replicant sympathizer group.</p>
<p><b>Bob</b> is a grizzled <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veteran.html" title="Veteran">veteran</a> of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_III_4587.html" title="World War III">World War III</a> (which appears to have been a pivotal event a decade or so prior to 2019). He mentions that he served for around three and a half years. He owns the gunshop across the street from Animoid Row, and seems to be suffering from some physical disabilities. He appears to despise replicants even more than Crystal, though when a <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voight-Kampff_machine_ca00.html" title="Voight-Kampff machine">Voight-Kampff</a> test is administered his result is almost always inconclusive. When he does receive a definitive result, it is almost always "human". Bob is the only character with whom the player's tampering with the Voight-Kampff test can alter the result; this allows the player to decide whether he is human or replicant, and therefore whether he can be killed by the player without any fear of repercussion.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_Runner_%28video_game%29_6608.html" title="Edit section: The Game Engine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Game Engine</span></h2>
<p>The game engine was innovative for its time (1997), and many gaming magazines (notably PC Gamer) were raving about it thinking it was the future. For the first time ever you had a real-time 3D game that didn't require or use the still very rare and expensive 3D graphics accelerators.</p>
<p>It achieved this through a self-developed technology <i>based</i> on "voxels" (pixels with width, height and <i>depth</i>). They went with that idea and expanded it, calling it "Voxels Plus".</p>
<p>The polygon data of every model was there in the game just like in games today, but it was not rendered as a 3D accelerator would, instead they developed an advanced voxel-based technology so that they could escape the need for a 3D accelerator displaying the polygon geometry. Basically, instead of just having one two-dimensional voxel, they used dozens of rotating voxels in the <i>shape</i> and <i>depth</i> of the <i>actual polygon model data</i>, making it <i>true real-time 3D without requiring 3D hardware</i>.</p>
<p>In laymans term, it was piecing together flat "picture panels", rotating and positioning them in 3D-space so that they gave the illusion of a 3D object. This must still be called 3D, and not 2D as many people keep insisting (for their lack of better knowledge).</p>
<p>It was a great accomplishment, but it wasn't without its share of flaws. The technology made the 3D models look quite rough due to the low amount of voxels used to display them, and if they had gone any higher to increase the detail it would have become too slow to play. With the level of detail they settled on, the game still ran at a minimum of 15 fps even on slow systems.</p>
<p>And despite being groundbreaking it had been long in the making, so 3D accelerators were in reach of the average consumer by the time the engine was released. Therefore the need for this complex "workaround"-technology faded fast which meant that ultimately they had released their technology too late. A few other games using "Voxel Plus"-technology were released after it, most notably the <i><a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Force_%28computer_game%29_54a0.html" title="Delta Force (computer game)">Delta Force</a></i> computer game series in 1998.</p>
<p>For a deeper history on the development there's an interview with one of the Westwood developers.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
