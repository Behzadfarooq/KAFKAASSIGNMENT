<p>The Black Jewels Trilogy is set in a unique world of three parallel Realms: Terreille, Kaeleer, and Hell. This is a society with an elaborate caste system based on strength of magical power--the strength of a person's Jewels denotes the reservoir of power available to that person, and greater power determines the place held in society. The Landens (normal humans with no magical ability) are at the lowest end of the caste system, while the dark-Jeweled Blood are the rulers, meant to govern, control and protect the land and people in their care. This is a matriarchal society, where the ruling power belongs to the females, while the role of males is to serve and protect. In Terreille, a manipulative Black Widow (a witch who deals with poisons and visions) and Priestess, Dorothea SaDiablo from Hayll (a territory in Terreille), has been spreading her corruption throughout the Realm, destroying anyone of any rank that could rival her power so that she may become High Priestess of Terreille and rule unchecked. Her actions have resulted in a vicious subversion of the Blood Society: frightened and abused males resort to breaking (raping) strong females to strip them of power, while strong males are bound by the Ring of Obedience, a device which inflicts unimaginable pain on the genitals of the man by a mere thought, by Queens who fear them.</p>
<p>At the same time two brothers, Daemon Sadi, a powerful Black Jeweled Warlord Prince (who is also a pleasure-slave owned by Dorothea and lent out to her puppet Queens) and Lucivar Yaslana, an Ebon Gray Jeweled Warlord Prince (also a pleasure-slave, owned by the High Priestess of Askavi and currently under the tight rein of Zuultah, Queen of Pruul) as well as their father, Saetan SaDiablo, thought to be the only Male Black Widow in existence, a Black Jeweled Warlord Prince with the title "High <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord.html" title="Lord">Lord</a> of Hell", await the arrival of Witch. Witch is "Dreams Made Flesh" and is the physical manifestation of the dreams of those people who desire a special person in their lives (many different races can contribute to the "making" of Witch, although it is not unusual for only one race's dreams to manifest as Witch). These men await her as the Dark Queen who will provide meaning to their lives as well as cleanse Terreille of the corruption that has plagued and enslaved its people.</p>
<p>The one they have been awaiting is Jaenelle Angelline, a young girl in a very dangerous family situation in Chaillot. While the family matriarch Alexandra Angelline is not evil per se, her neglect and the actions Jaenelle's family lead to Jaenelle being abused, physically, mentally and emotionally. She is the first Witch to walk the Realms in 50,000 years - and she is immensely powerful, but as a child, terribly powerless in the family setting where none recognise her power. Daemon, Lucivar, and Saetan all understand and love Jaenelle and the power that lies within in her, and it becomes a race against time to bring Jaenelle to safety before Dorothea and others discover and destroy her.</p>

<p>In the second novel of the Black Jewels Trilogy, there has been a gap of nearly two years since "Daughter of the Blood" ended. Jaenelle is in the equivalent of a coma and Saetan tries to bring her back. Meanwhile, Daemon Sadi must find his way out of the Twisted Kingdom and discover the truth about what he did at Cassandra's <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">Altar</a> as perceptions of what happened become increasingly distorted. His only help is his mother, the mad Black Widow Tersa. His <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibling.html" title="Sibling">brother</a> Lucivar Yaslana, enraged and believing Daemon is to blame for Jaenelle's injuries, attempts to escape from the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_mine.html" title="Salt mine">salt mines</a> of Pruul... for his last act among the living--to destroy his brother Daemon. He survives against all odds, only to face an Eyrien's worst nightmare, the possibility of losing his <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing.html" title="Wing">wings</a> and the knowledge that he made a terrible mistake. Jaenelle wakes with no memory of what happened to her and begins to reach out to her friends once more, while Saetan SaDiablo continues to prepare for her Offering and her <a href="../../../n/o/b/Noble_court.html" title="Noble court">Court</a>, despite her strong aversion to power. Before this can happen he must learn what it means for Jaenelle to be Kaeleer's <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_%28symbol%29.html" title="Heart (symbol)">Heart</a> and face the powerful young witches who will form Jaenelle's <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coven.html" title="Coven">Coven</a>. Trouble comes when Little Terreille and the Dark Council, led by Dorothea's manipulations, declares war on Kaeleer's Kindred, slaughtering them in an attempt to claim land. Jaenelle realises the only way she can protect them in the face of the council's arrogance, is to play by their rules. Jaenelle makes the Offering to the Darkness, and comes away with unheard-of power. She forms the Dark Court of Ebon Askavi, with every territory in Kaeleer (except Little Terreille) giving her unprecedented ruling power over them. Jaenelle issues a warning to the Dark Council, her first and last, as Saetan leaves the Dark Council with the most important clue to dealing with the Dark Court: "For Remembrance, As a Reminder."</p>

<p>With the Dark <a href="../../../n/o/b/Noble_court.html" title="Noble court">Court</a> established at Ebon Askavi, the Coven and the male Circle who serves them must face the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_corruption.html" title="Political corruption">corruption</a> being spread by little Terreille into Kaeleer. Daemon Sadi returns to be Jaenelle's consort, as the Coven all try and deal with increasing trouble in their own territories. Jaenelle's First Circle consider Daemon a dangerous outsider, and Saetan and Lucivar not knowing him well enough to allay their fears. More complicated still, Wilhelmina and Surreal appear at SaDiablo hall, wanting to join the dark court and ruffling more than a few feathers. Finally, Alexandra Angelline and Jaenelle's family pay a visit to the Dark Court, leading to Jaenelle making a soul-wounding decision. Terreille lays plots and trouble strikes, with Morton lured into a deadly trap, Karla poisoned, Kalush attacked and the Coven and Kaeleer raring for War. Saeten recognises the pattern of events, understanding that Terreille is manipulating them. Events come to a head when Lucivar, Marian and Daemonar are kidnapped, leading to Jaenelle and Daemon's final play... Daemon must turn his back on the Coven and follow Witch's orders, as Witch gathers her strength and descends... and the Maelstrom begins. At first the Coven don't understand the full implications of Jaenelle's decision, and are frustrated with her, until it is revealed that Kaeleer won't be going to war with Terreille... Witch will.</p>

Jared must in turn, discover the meaning of wearing the "Silver Ring" and the "Gold Ring", and come to terms with the bitter truth of Hayll's manipulations.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Jewels_Trilogy_ed0c.html" title="Edit section: Kindred">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kindred</span></h3>
<p>The Kindred are animals who have been granted their own Jewels. Hence, they have similar powers to that of the human Blood, as well as the same hierarchy, and so their name (kindred) is derived from the fact that they are 'related' to the Blood. The Kindred consist of all kinds of animals, ranging from dogs, cats, to unicorns and spiders. They played a large part in the Dreaming of Jaenelle (Witch) and it is through their influence that her true form is part beast, part human. The Kindred possess similar abilities to that of the Blood, but some have special abilities that are specific to a particular species. Arcerian cats, for example, can penetrate any shield, regardless of the difference in the perpetrator and defender's jewel strength. Before the coming of Witch, the Kindred were largely shunned by humans, and some of the cruel ones even hunted them for their special pelts, which were valued for their magical aura. Communication was impossible, but through Jaenelle, several protagonists, such as Daemon and his family, as well as Jaenelle's coven, were able to learn how to speak to each other telepathically. It is uncertain as to what the Kindred do with their Jewels - unlike humans, who gild their Jewels and form necklaces and rings to wear them, Kindred are animals and yet, they are described as wearing chains/crowns holding their Jewels.</p>

<p>The world is divided into <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realm.html" title="Realm">realms</a>, much like <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">dimensions</a> or planes of existence.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Jewels_Trilogy_ed0c.html" title="Edit section: Realms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Realms</span></h3>
<p><b>Terreille - The Realm of Light</b></p>
<p>This is the realm which is most like Earth. It is one of the living realms, and society is much like a harsh <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> culture combined with the refinement of the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> class of 18th century Europe. The coven of Dorothea SaDiablo has eliminated most of the dark-Jewelled Blood, primarily Queens, in Terreille. As a result, many places do not have their own Queens or are ruled by Dorothea's puppet Queens. In some cases they are ruled by councils of Blood males, regardless of the capacity of the local Queens.</p>
<p>Each region is ruled by a Queen. Most of the Realm is controlled directly or indirectly by Dorothea SaDiablo.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hayll - Home of the Hundred Families. Its <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital.html" title="Capital">capital</a> is Draega. Hayll has no Queen, and is ruled by High Priestess Dorothea SaDiablo.</li>
<li>Chaillot - Island Territory. Its Queen is Alexandra Angeline and its capital is Beldon Mor. Alexandra is only a puppet Queen; the real ruling force is a council of males.</li>
<li>Shalador - Its Queen was Shal many hundreds of years before the beginning of the trilogy; she united the tribes of Shalador.</li>
<li>Raej - a Territory known for its annual slave fair.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Kaeleer - The Shadow Realm</b></p>
<p>Kaeleer is also one of the living realms, but its closer proximity to the Darkness makes it a much "wilder" place than Terreille. Alongside the human territories are kindred ones, which are closed to humans and considered mythical (or unclaimed) in the minds of many.</p>
<ul>

<li>Sceval - Territory ruled by kindred <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicorn.html" title="Unicorn">unicorns</a>. Their Queen is Moonshadow.</li>
<li>Tigrelan - Its Queen is Grezande.</li>
<li>Unnamed Island - Ruled by the Dark Council, which settles disputes between Territory Queens and the like if they are unable to reach an agreement themselves. Both Saetan and Andulvar served on this body as neutral parties, although they have both stepped down.

<li>SaDiablo Hall - The home of Saetan SaDiablo, it exists in both Dhemlan Territories as well as Hell (which does not have a Dhemlan Territory). It is connected to the other Halls by a Dark Altar.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some places which exist outside the physical Realms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Twisted Kingdom - The psychological and mystical realm of the insane. Those who have lost their minds are said to be lost in the Twisted Kingdom. This is somewhat Shamanistic in nature, resembling the mythologies of lower or underwolrds in our past.</li>
<li>The Abyss - The psychological and mystical realm from which the Blood derive their power. When the Blood descend to their levels of power, they descend into the Abyss. Witch spirals into the Abyss, and also originates from there. The Abyss is within the mind or more likely, the soul of each member of the Blood. It may be what connects them to the Darkness.</li>

<p>Members of various races in the three realms who are infused with magic are know as the Blood. In the case of non-human, or non-dragon races they are known as Kindred.</p>
<p>The Blood are further divided by <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">social class</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a>.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the Bloods castes in ascending order of rank:</p>
<p><a name="Male_Castes" id="Male_Castes"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Jewels_Trilogy_ed0c.html" title="Edit section: Male Castes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Male Castes</span></h4>
<p>• <b>Blood Male</b>: Refers to any Blood male who does not wear Jewels. A Blood Male can perform basic Craft but cannot reach the level of the Jewels. Blood Males are not guaranteed a Jewel at their Birthright Ceremony as other castes are; they can receive any Birthright color of Jewel though. A Blood Male can also try again to receive a Jewel, once he is older, by making the Offering to the Darkness. The darkest Jewel a Blood Male without a Birthright Jewel can receive at the Offering is Yellow. If a Blood Male does receive a Jewel, he becomes a Warlord, if not he remains a Blood Male. They very rarely rise to the "killing edge" and never experience rut. Blood male (with a low case "m" in male) is also a general term for all males of the Blood. The need to serve has been bred into Blood males since the dawn of their time. They cannot be emotionally whole with out it. A strong love-bond can ease the hunger for service; all Blood males need one or the other. All males of the Blood (whether they wear Jewels or not) can serve Coven or Court, or enter into personal service. A strong Jeweled Blood male may rule territory in the absence of a Queen, or in service to his Queen.</p>
<p>• <b>Warlord</b>: A Warlord is any Jeweled male who does not belong to the other hierarchical levels, equal in status to a witch. Warlords are born Blood Males and become Warlords once they receive their Jewel. They rise to the Killing Edge only when greatly provoked and go into rut only a few times in their lifetime.</p>
<p>• <b>Prince</b>: A Jeweled male equal in status with Healers and Priestesses, one step lower than a Black Widow, one step higher than Witches and Warlords. A Prince is born into his caste, and thus is guaranteed a Jewel, but not what strength the Jewel may be. He must go through the Birthright ceremony and make the Offering to the Darkness to recive his Jewel. Princes are more aggressive and territorial than Warlords are, they are also quicker to anger and thus to rise to the Killing Edge. They experience the rut once or twice a decade.</p>
<p>• <b>Warlord Prince</b>: A Jeweled male higher in status to a Black Widow but, lower than a Queen. Warlord Princes are the highest ranked, and also most rare, male caste. A Warlord Prince is born into his caste, and thus is guaranteed a Jewel, but not what strength the Jewel may be. He must go through the Birthright ceremony and make the Offering to the Darkness to recive his Jewel.The most territorial and sexual males of the Blood, they are extremely aggressive and dangerous. Warlord Princes have the strongest need to bond in service and/or love-bond. They rise to the Killing Edge quickly, easily and without warning. Warlord Princes go into rut once or twice a year. A strong Warlord Prince can rule territory in the absence of a Queen.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Jewels_Trilogy_ed0c.html" title="Edit section: Female Castes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Female Castes</span></h4>
<p>• <b>Blood Female</b>: Mostly refers to any Blood female who doesn’t wear Jewels. Blood Females can do all basic Craft but cannot reach the level of the Jewels. Blood Females are not guaranteed a Jewel at their Birthright Ceremony as other castes are; they can receive any Birthright color of Jewel though. A Blood Female can also try again to receive a Jewel, once she is older, by making the Offering to the Darkness. The darkest Jewel a (no Birthright Jeweled) Blood Female can receive at the Offering is Yellow. If a Blood Female does receive a Jewel, she becomes a witch, if not she remains a Blood Female. Blood Females can serve Coven or Court, or enter into personal service. Also a general term for all females of the Blood, used as Blood female rather than Blood Female.</p>
<p>• <b>Witch</b>: A Blood female who wears Jewels but isn’t a member of the other hierarchical levels. This can also refer to any Jeweled female. A witch is born a Blood Female and becomes a witch once she receives a Jewel, either at her Birthright Ceremony or Offering to the Darkness. A witch will sometimes specialize in a particular side of the Craft such as hearth or garden. Witches can serve Coven (such as the Coven of the Hourglass, the "Guilds" with in the Realms) or Court, or enter into personal service.</p>
<p>• <b>Healer</b>: A witch who tends physical wounds and illnesses, born with the instincts to comfort and heal. They are higher in status than a witch or Warlord, equal to Priestesses and Princes. Healers have the strongest ties to the Body. They are the doctors, nurses, midwives and even veterinarians in Blood society. Healers are highly respected amongst the Blood for they will often sacrifice their own health/safety to heal others. Healers can serve Coven or Court, or enter into personal service, though often they will set up a practice of their own. All Healers must have at least one Jeweled male in personal service to her, in order to ensure her safety and protection.</p>
<p>• <b>Priestess</b>: A witch who cares for altars, Sanctuaries, and Dark Altars; they are the most spiritual of the female castes, leading the celebrations during holidays and ceremonies. Equal in status with Healers and Princes, Priestesses have the strongest ties to the Self or Soul. A Priestess witnesses handfasts and marriages; performs funeral rites and offerings and provides spiritual counsel for her community. Every Priestess can serve in at a local Altar, Coven, Court or enter into personal service. All Priestesses must have at least one Jeweled male in personal service to her, in order to ensure her safety and protection.</p>
<p>• <b>Black Widow</b>: A witch who heals the mind; weaves the tangled webs of dreams and visions and is trained in illusions and poisons, Black Widows are considered to be the most dangerous and sexual of the Blood female castes. Equal in status to none, Black Widows answer only to Queens, Warlord Princes, and other Black Widows of a darker Jewel rank. Black Widows have the strongest ties to the Mind and the Twisted Kingdom. Although a Black Widow is apparent at birth, and they may show some signs in childhood, they do not truly have the Craft or physical traits of a Black Widow until the onset of puberty. Such traits are increased empathy, lucid or prophetic dreaming, the snake tooth under the finger along with the ability to naturally produce venom, immunity to many poisons and venom, and a slight change in physic scent. Every Black Widow must train and serve at her territory’s Coven of the Hourglass; she can also serve in a Court or enter into personal service, or have a private practice. All Black Widows must have at least one Jeweled male in personal service to her, in order to ensure her safety and protection. A strong Black Widow can rule territory in the absence of a Queen.</p>
<p>• <b>Queen</b>: A witch who rules the Blood; is considered to be the land’s heart and the Blood’s moral center; as such, she is the focal point of their society. They are the highest ranked and most rare of all the castes. Queens tend to the land; being the only ones who have the Craft to heal the land after it has been damaged or tainted. They have the strongest ties to the Land/Earth and the Blood itself. Queens are born with the instinct to protect their land, territory and people. All Queens must have at least one Jeweled male in personal service to her, in order to ensure her safety and protection. A Queen’s very strength, psychic scent and nature will draw strong males to her, forming a court. A Queen may serve in another’s Court, and this is common for light Jeweled Queens. Also, young and strong Queens may serve in another’s to gain experience. To make a claim to rule territory, a Queen must have a Court consisting of at least 12 Blood males, has made the Offering to the Darkness, and be 20 years of age. To be confirmed the position; a majority of the other ruling Queens in that Territory must acknowledge her. If a Queen challenges another or more than one Queen vie for the same throne, a general election is held. A Queen can rule a Township, District, Province or Territory, as well as hold a small independent non-ruling court.</p>

<p>The Blood can wield their magic to create various effects, such as communicate mentally using threads, turn <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible.html" title="Invisible">invisible</a>, walk through walls, levitate animate and inanimate objects, vanish inanimate objects to an extradimensional space to reappear later upon command, and project raw magical or psychic force. The Blood can also create magical <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potion.html" title="Potion">potions</a>, poisons, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artifact_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Artifact (fantasy)">artifacts</a> which have a variety of uses, and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoactive_drug.html" title="Psychoactive drug">drugs</a> made from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb.html" title="Herb">herbs</a> that can be used to block a person's power by making them mentally incapable.</p>
<p>To travel the blood can levitate, or (with wings or magic) fly. In addition the Blood can use the various magical webs that link the realms together to travel. The darker the colour of the web the faster it is to travel on it. Each colour of web corresponds to the colour of a <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemstone.html" title="Gemstone">jewel</a>. Also the Blood may travel between realms using Dark Altars. Through a ceremony there they may travel from one dark altar to a parallel Dark <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar.html" title="Altar">Altar</a> in a different realm.</p>
<p>There are 3 "professions" of the Blood that use spells uncommon to the normal Blood. There are Priestesses, who perform in ceremonies such as marriage, Healers, who can cast healing spells, and Black Widows, witches who can deal with the mind and can weave and read tangled webs. A tangled web is a piece of magic enabling the Black Widow to look into the future and have visions. It differs from normal webs of magic that the normal Blood cast. Aside from that, Black Widows can also take a mental step to the border of the Twisted Kingdom, allowing them see truths and draw memories from wood and stone.</p>
<p>With spells the darker the Jewel the Blood wears, the more potent the magic they have available. However, every Jewel Rank has a range of strength, and thus one Red-Jeweled witch could be slightly stronger than another. Both intelligence and creativy also go a long way towards what one can do with the power they possess.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Jewels_Trilogy_ed0c.html" title="Edit section: Jewels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jewels</span></h3>
<p>Most members of the Blood are gifted with a Birthright Jewel. These can be cut or uncut. Cut Jewels are Jewels that are thought to have been used before, and may come already set into jewellery. Uncut Jewels are unused, and are hence more powerful than their cut counterparts. Uncut Jewels come directly from the scales of Lorn himself. Through the Offering to the Darkness, the Blood can earn Jewels up to three levels darker. Tapping into these deeper or darker reservoirs is called "descending", (eg. Birthright White could descend to Rose) and darker stones allow for more potent magic. Uncut and cut Jewels also apply to this ceremony. The Blood can channel magic without possessing a stone, but their Jewels store reservoirs of power not otherwise available to them. The darkest Jewels one can receive for a Birthright is Red, with the exception of Janelle. The Birthright ceremony is performed at an altar, usually by a Priestess, and occurs in early childhood. The Offering to the Darkness occurs at the end of puberty into early adulthood.</p>
<p>The darker a Jewel the more power it holds which in turn can be used by its wearer. This means that a dark Jewelled shield would be able to hold out against a lower Jewelled attack. However, members of the Blood can link their powers together to overcome a higher Jewelled wearer if need be.</p>
<p>The colours of the Jewels are, in ascending order:</p>
<ul>
<li>White</li>
<li>Yellow</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger%27s_Eye_7220.html" title="Tiger's Eye">Tiger Eye</a></li>
<li>Rose</li>
<li>Summer-sky</li>
<li>Purple Dusk</li>
<li>Opal*</li>
<li>Green</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/p/Sapphire.html" title="Sapphire">Sapphire</a></li>
<li>Red</li>
<li>Gray</li>
<li>Ebon-gray</li>
<li>Black</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:Opal is the dividing line between darker and lighter jewels because it can be either.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Ebony</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Twilight's Dawn</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Ebony is darker than the Black, formerly the darkest known Jewel which was almost unheard of having. Ebony is unique to Jaenelle. Twilight's Dawn is a Jewel which has the ability to store powers from Rose, Purple Dusk, Green, Red, Grey, Ebon Grey, and a hint of Black. It represents Janelle's desire to be "not so different from everyone else", (See <i>Dreams Made Flesh, Kaeleer's Heart</i>) and its strength levels reflect the psychic webs that Janelle was wrapped in by Saetan, Lucivar and Daemon while absorbing the backlash of her Ebony strength at the end of Queen of the Darkness. Twilight's Dawn is unique to Jaenelle, given to her by Lorn as an unformed Jewel through Ladvarian.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Jewels_Trilogy_ed0c.html" title="Edit section: Mythology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mythology</span></h3>
<p>The Blood believe they are the stewards of the Earth, meant to be the protectors of nature and the non-Blood (the landen) who share the Realms with them. In the series, the main antogonists have turned most of society away from this belief, encouraging greed and gluttony, causing the Blood to become "tainted."</p>
<p>In the Black Jewels series of books, there are three major religious concepts which contribute to the society of the blood.</p>
<p>The first is the Darkness. It is the literal absence of light, the darkness associated with fertile soil and a woman's womb, as well as the primordial <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_%28mythology%29.html" title="Chaos (mythology)">chaos</a> from which life emerges and ultimately returns.</p>
<p>The second is Witch or rather Dreams Made Flesh. Witch's soul and fate is fashioned by the dreams, prayers and wishes of members of the Blood. Witch is a kind of Saviour or Saint-like figure to the Blood. Witch can be any female caste or wear any Jewel, depending on the dreams that made her. For example, if a plague was sweeping the Realms, people would dream of a brilliant Healer who would find a cure, and if the dreams are strong enough, and the Weavers of Dreams weave right, such a Healer would be born to fulfill that destiny. In the case of Jaenelle as Witch, she was fashioned from the dreams of all the non-tainted Blood.</p>
<p>The next is Mother Night. Often used as an expression of shock, she seems to be a female <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archetype.html" title="Archetype">archetype</a> for the Blood - some sort of manifestation of the Darkness, similar to fertility goddesses as Mother Earth.</p>
<p>The Blood practice a kind of Dark Pagan spirituality, that places a great deal of reverence for the Darkness and the worship of the Earth and nature. The rituals and religion in the series seems to be based loosely upon the pagan religions of ancient Europe and modern day Neo-Paganism.</p>
<p>References to other myths include references to centaurs, unicorns, satyrs, etc. The Black Widow spiders of Arachnia who spin the Webs that created Jaenelle draw from the fable of Arachne, a Greek woman who angered the Gods and was turned into a spider. She, like Bishop's Arachnians, was the most skilled of weavers.</p>
