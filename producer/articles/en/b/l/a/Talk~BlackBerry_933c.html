<p>While the 8700 has a higher rez screen than the 72XX series, the surface area of 8700 screen is slightly less than the 72XX series. Therefore, this is classed as a "medium" size screen, not "large" as it says. This need to be cleaned up.

<p>Proper nouns ending in 'y' end in 's', not 'ies', so BlackBerrys and BlueBerrys is correct. It looks strange, so I bet that's why RIM always refers to them as "BlackBerry devices" and thus avoid having to deal with it. <a href="../../../b/o/l/User%7EBollar_3977.html" title="User:Bollar">Bollar</a> 02:50, Sep 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know anything about how it works beyond what's written above. Deciphering that text gives me the following:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Company provides Blackberrys to employees. Company buys BES software. BES has an email store (place to store email) for each server. BES receives mail for the user, and sends the email to RIM's NOC. RIM's NOC then determines what cellular service the company uses for its Blackberrys, and tranfsers the email over to that cellular carrier's network, which is then responsible for getting it to the actual device.</dd>

<dd>It's not nonsense, and the method described also makes sense.</dd>

<dd>You might want to start by researching how an email server works. When a server receives email, it doesn't just lump it all into a big mess, it puts it in separate stores for each user. Sometimes these are called "mailboxes", or especially in Outlook, "e-mail inboxes". "...the email stores for users...": stores, plural form of "store", a noun, commonly referring to a place to store something in server lingo. <i>Not</i> stores, a verb, being performed by the subject noun "e-mail".</dd>

<p>The Blackberry v. <a href="../../../n/t/p/NTP%2C_Inc._c9b6.html" title="NTP, Inc.">NTP, Inc.</a> case is a critical case that affects not just users of the Blackberry but all new technologies and business tools current and future.</p>
<p>If NTP wins this case, it will affect more than just Blackberry users as the case will be used to support other companies with patent lawsuits many of which have been filed to suppress new technology so that companies that manufacture older technology continue to dominate the market. A majority of these patent infringement lawsuits have been described as frivolous technology patents that prevent advancements in important and useful technologies.</p>
<p>What if opponents of stem cell research file patents for stem cell development so they can prevent anyone from using that technology? The old industries would find new ways to prevent new industries from replacing or superceding their business because it would render their industry obsolete?</p>
<p>We've seen this already with the oil industry, the software industry, and the media industry. Plans for cars that get better gas mileage prevented from being manufactured. Newer software by smaller software companies never get to consumers who seek better business applications.</p>

<p>Research in Motion (RIM), provider of BlackBerry mobile e-mail, may well prevail over patent rights claimant NTP despite losing a major court case to NTP in November, 2002, and in subsequent appeals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has reviewed and is proposing to overturn all cited claims in the five patents that NTP relied on to win its case. While NTP representatives have told reporters that NTP will act to support and maintain the patent claims, the strength of those patents has become doubtful in the light of extensive, though still preliminary USPTO findings.</p>
<p>On its own initiative, the USPTO began reexamining five NTP patents in December, 2002, including four of those cited in the court decision. In August, 2003, RIM challenged the fifth patent that was cited. The USPTO began a reexamination of that patent as well as other NTP patents that were not cited in the court decision, for a total of eight NTP patents under review.</p>
<p>The eight NTP patents were all by inventors Thomas J. Campana, Jr., Michael P. Ponschke and Gary F. Thelen, from the Chicago area, filed between May, 1991, and December, 1999. They are quite bulky, with from 62 to 665 claims, and they are densely interrelated.</p>
<p>Campana, who died in 2004, formerly headed ESA Telecommunications of Chicago, and Ponschke and Thelen worked there as programmers. In 1990 ESA engaged in a remote communications project for Telefind of Coral Gables, FL, and an AT&amp;T division located in Somerset, NJ, involving technology related to the patents now being reexamined. So far as can be seen, ESA had little commercial success in developing this type of technology, but Campana, Ponschke and Thelen continued to describe their inventions in patents that were assigned to NTP.</p>
<p>NTP has submitted thousands of pages of documents responding to the USPTO. In February, 2003, Campana executed a 27-page affidavit with several attachments, recorded by the USPTO July 6 in connection with reexamination 90/006,491. Exhibit 6 of that affidavit is a memo written by the head of Telefind recounting a demonstration that took place in New Jersey on October 26, 1990, further described below.</p>
<p>By late June, 2005, the USPTO had published initial findings for the eight patents, proposing to overturn some patents entirely and others partly. All patent claims cited in the court decision were rejected in the initial USPTO findings.</p>
<p>As of early January, 2006, the USPTO had reviewed responses from NTP to the initial findings for seven patents and was still proposing to overturn all patent claims cited in the court decision. Final actions from the USPTO are expected during the first half of 2006. NTP was allowed until December 28 to respond to one set of findings, and the USPTO will be reviewing its response.</p>
<p>During reexaminations, the USPTO built detailed cases against NTP patent claims developed largely from information contained in other U.S. patents. The USPTO found that U.S. patent 5,159,592 by inventor Charles E. Perkins, assigned to IBM, anticipated many claims in the NTP patents and was filed earlier than any of them. NTP has apparently been unable to show to the satisfaction of the USPTO that its inventions were documented or demonstrated before the Perkins patent held by IBM was filed.</p>
<p>The October 26, 1990, date claimed for ESA's demonstration to AT&amp;T could be significant, because the Perkins patent application was filed October 29, 1990. However, according to the Telefind memo, what was demonstrated then was a "wireless modem to download data and messages" and not the more complex system of e-mail processing and routing that is described in the patents under review.</p>
<p>U.S. patent 5,278,955 deals with e-mail processing and cites an article from 1989 by Richard D. Verjinski entitled, "PHASE, a portable host access system environment," published in an IEEE proceedings. The USPTO found Verjinski's article anticipated many NTP patent claims.</p>
<p>Besides the Perkins patent and the Verjinski article, the USPTO found several other prior publications describing techniques claimed in NTP patents, including a RIM patent and documents published by Norwegian Telecommunications in 1986 and 1989. For many of the NTP patent claims it now proposes to reject the USPTO cites multiple prior disclosures.</p>
<p>Until recent years U.S. patent applications were not published. NTP inventors would have been unable to learn about the Perkins patent application when they applied for the first three of the eight patents now being reexamined. However, the Verjinski article was published before any NTP patent application, and the Perkins patent had been published before applications for the last five NTP patents were filed.</p>
<p>The USPTO has assembled substantial evidence that critical NTP patent claims are invalid. Despite persistent attempts by RIM to intervene in the reexaminations, the USPTO has generally built its own cases without accepting arguments advanced by RIM. So far the USPTO has not explained why the NTP claims now being rejected were instead accepted when the NTP patent applications were originally examined.</p>
<p>NTP has made some adjustments in response to the USPTO findings but is attempting to justify and maintain most if not all of its claims. If the USPTO follows through with final actions rejecting any claims not conceded or adjusted by NTP, NTP has available to it both administrative and court appeals, likely to take many years.</p>
<p>While it would be difficult for anyone but a patent attorney to assess the depth of the flaws in NTP claims currently identified by the USPTO, the breadth and detail of the USPTO findings are apparent. Through events mostly outside its control, RIM has exited the year 2005 in a stronger position than it entered. Now NTP is under attack, and NTP will need to defend its interests more effectively than before.</p>

<p>Is anyone out there running BES on a MSCS-based cluster for HA from a hardware perspective? I know BES is not cluster-aware, but if you alias the VIP of the cluster and SAN-mount the BES/Domino/SQL bits as single-instance installs refencing the alias I would think this should work. Anyone?</p>
<p>We're looking at going down the <b>Doubletake</b> road from <b>NSI Software</b> as a partner in our clustering initiative for the BBs, so if anyone has any insights about them/product that would be great too.</p>
