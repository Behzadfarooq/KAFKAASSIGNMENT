<p>I recommend <i>Summer Breeze</i> by Seals &amp; Crofts. It's very easygoing '70s AM rock. Stuff I like, because I'm an old-ass fogey, at the ripe age of eighteen-and-eight-months.

</ul>
<p>Hi, again, and thanks for the graceful retraction, which is much more important (to me personally) than the offense. (What can i say, i'm weird in general and part of that weirdness is knowing that i <i>am</i> what you called me, and just getting on with it, whatever the fallout of that is.)</p>
<p>And congrats on adminship; your ability to retreat a little on this (in the face of what i don't doubt was, for you, extreme provocation) IMO bodes well for your working into the role productively. (Hmm, having said that, i guess i should clear state that the incident was <i>not</i> at test for you.)</p>
<p>As you've asked only a rhetorical question, i'm not going to presume on yr hospitality by trying to clarify for you my thinking on yr sig, tho i find you now much closer to appearing receptive than in yr 1st response to me. But i'd be glad to discuss if you care to.</p>
<p>I will, tho, state a fact (w/o assuming you'll consider it relevant): i didn't intend to "[go] around ... changing your signatures", and i think you'll agree at least on reflection that you invited the inference that you either construed that intent or misjudged the actual extent of my activity. No offense taken, but since we're still in the context of your being offended and our communication not (yet, at least) being fluent, i consider it best to keep our fact-base as clean as possible, even in what seems to me a minor detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mmmhm. My opinion on the matter is, although you were only "trimming" them to save space, that it is rude and inappropriate to edit <b>someone else's</b> signature without either permission from the user or a community consensus. That's just my opinion. But I'm content to put this in the past. It's not worth fighting over. Wastes time that can be used for something <i>constructive</i>. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</small></a> 17:09, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, my compliments on the Cyrillic chars in your new sig; i think it's clever &amp; attractive even if the word (words?) is just "Talk" or a synonym. My acquaintance w/ Rooskiy is so weak (and the font so small on my screen) that i can't speculate further, but my curiosity was picqued by what appeared to me to be an upper-case Deh amid lower-case letters. [shrug].</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks. It's "<u style="font-size: larger;"><b>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</b></u> (besyeda)" and it means "(Conversation!)"... I love Russkiy, I'm trying to learn. Anyway, one small link isn't worth a war. So... that's it! &#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</small></a> 17:09, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, Blankfaze: Thanks for the thanks! Glad to do it! I don't believe in running discussions, esp. in someone's nomination, but you might have wondered what was going on with the "fish" thing, now that the dust has settled. I'm in New York, where it's quite the thing to do Christian-bashing. A number of pundits have remarked that Catholics are the last societal group it's OK to criticize. Well, since Bush this has extended to almost any Christian belief more conservative than Unitarian/Univeralists. I don't agree that Bush's issue is to push a "christian" agenda, but that's just politics--no big deal. The "fish" however--you see, it has become quite the thing around here to make fun of this symbol (which is drawn almost the same as your fish), but add details. It started with a "Darwin fish" (put legs on it) which is pretty cute, but has evolved into nastier incarnations. So I put 2+2 together and got 5! Anyway, hope you get the opportunity to use your sysopness to make Wikipedia prettier and nicer!

<p>Blankfaze ‚Äî on IRC earlier you seemed to be quite upset and hostile about my objection to Mt. St. Helens on Featured Article Candidates, so I thought I'd just drop a note to explain why I throw objections even at good articles (like that one), and hopefully clear up any bad feeling.</p>
<p>Featured Articles is (currently) the only validation / quality check system we have on Wikipedia, and we trumpet it as the "Best of Wikipedia". These are the articles we direct people to when they say that Wikipedia can't work or can't produce decent articles. Because of this, I think our Featured Articles should be as good as possible; not necessarily perfect, but close. Accordingly, I will object to an article if A) I can see any obvious flaws, or B) If I can see any obvious way it could be improved. This will seem like "nitpicking" and "petty" objections sometimes, but it's not because I'm being malicious, rather it's because I want Wikipedia to be represented well. If I'm being <i>over</i>-picky, and this is entirely possible in cases, then I'm happy to trust the concept of consensus in Wikipedia; if enough people support, and there's only one objection, it will still be promoted. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">‚Äî Matt</a> 19:54, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, thanks for explaining, but... it's still stupid, in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blankfaze" rel="nofollow">‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</a> 19:59, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, it's fine and normal for people to disagree on Wikipedia. I guess it's more of a problem when people start disagreeing in ways that degenerate into insults; as an admin I'm sure you're aware of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> policy. It's much more productive and pleasant to say <i>why</i> you disagree with an objection, rather than labelling it stupid / lousy / petty etc. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">‚Äî Matt</a> 20:23, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, I "just don't get it"; that's fine, we can have different views on things ‚Äî you did indeed go to some effort on IRC to explain why you disagreed to the objection.

<p>First, my condolences on your recent adminship and welcome to our world of struggle.<br />
Second, re: your recent removal of F.K.'s RfA self-nom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>vote has been static for several days, doesn't seem like he'll be supported by anyone else.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not a reason for removal;
<ul>
<li>A static vote with friendly opposition is very different from an active vote with people rushing to oppose, the reason for the early-removal guidelines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content with explicit "listed here until &lt;date&gt;" tags should be kept until that date;
<ul>
<li>Again, exceptions in RfA policy were not initially written for such mild cases; civility trumps the letter of the law when at all possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RfA requests are left up for a week for many reasons, one being that wiki is patient - many visit RfA once a week if that often, and should not be denied a chance to comment on recent requests;</li>
<li>If you simply <b>must</b> flout convention, suggest it on the talk page and reach consensus with others first.</li>

But it doesn't really belong there, according to me, the numerous people (including  
numerous admins) I asked beforehand on IRC, and... oh yeah, RfA policy.  -blankfaze

<ul>
<li>I'm certain you mean well, but getting support from Lysine on IRC doesn't count as reaching consensus with "numerous people"; silence&#160;!= support. Even at the best of times, IRC is no substitute for a talk-page note.</li>
<li>As for the RfA policy exception for unlikely nominations, it has generally been applied to unfriendly 1/14/5 votes rather than to friendly "great work, but" 1/5/1 votes ... and there was an outstanding request for more information from Falcon by Cecropia, which he should see even if the vote will fail. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a><a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 21:13, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the prompt response. Sorry about the heading, I did see that I should have done it, but wasn't sure how to create it - Now I do. Still getting to grips with the formatting styles - there seem to be a lot of different layouts! I'll do Arlene's page sometime next week as I am about to go away for the weekend. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_TB_63ca.html" title="User:Martin TB">Martin TB</a> 12:21, 10 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine about the heading, glad to educate you&#160;:-). Yes, there are various different layouts in use, but try to use one that looks professional and encyclopaedic. But don't fret over it. The beauty of Wikipedia is that, if you make a mistake, sooner or later someone else will come along and correct it. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</small></a> 12:49, 10 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First of all I'd like to offer my condolences for your failed nomination on RfA. As you know, I supported you, as I do and will continue to do with just about anyone Hcheney nominates. While I realise that you have made a few mistakes, such as blanking a talk page, I don't think any mistakes on your part were anything more than honest mistakes. And I think you'd make a fine admin. So don't get discouraged. Just take a month and go to work. Just do good work. Then in a month, someone can nominate you again, and hopefully, you'll make it that time.

<p>BTW, it makes perfect sense that he be Guanaco. I think you are right, Anthony. The cabal has used such tactics before, whereby they employ aliases in order to create an illusion of support for their corrupt and deplorable actions. Blankfaze was one who backed Guanaco's Crusade against me. And, now, suddenly, when they think they're rid of me, he tries to take credit for <b>my</b> articles. Also, I must say, I <b>love</b> the obscene language and use of personal attack present so entirely through this page.

<dd>Hehe, you guys are so silly... it makes me smile&#160;:). Gay rights is like affirmative action. We (redneck-americans) don't mind being fair, but we don't like diversity force fed to us. Lets see an end to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_bathhouse.html" title="Gay bathhouse">gay bathhousees</a> and naked gay pride parades for a few years, and then bring up the gay marraige thing again. BTW, my thought is that marraige aught to be a religious thing, not a legal thing anyways, and the govt. should step out completely (i.e. stop being involved in marraige at all). In conclusion, having a war doen't put morality on the backburner, at least not for <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_collar.html" title="Blue collar">blue collar</a> americans&#160;;)<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Sam_Spade&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>Spade</b></a>] 04:29, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why? There's nothing illegal about gay bathhouses or pride parades (and what is a naked pride parade? Sounds interesting whatever it is) and what do they have to do with same-sex marriage anyway? There are many, many good reasons why marriage is not a "religious thing," none of which I'm going to go into here, and you can stop shoving your morals and your god down my throat.

<dd>I'm in the same boat with Sam. I'm from Boston, and pretty much in the middle when it comes to politics (being left or right makes you wrong, sorry). I went to Emerson College, a superliberal school, and everyone's blind following of the lying, minsinforming Michael Moore wanted me to vote for Bush just because the left was pissing me off so much. The left is just as close-minded and arrogant as the right (you find God ridiculous and that not accepting gay rights is automatically wrong). Personally, I say let anyone marry who wants to, it's not that huge of a deal. Gays can marry here and we haven't become some new Sodom. My point is: until the left realizes they're just as bad as the right, we'll never make any progress. Had Bush not been elected in 2000 (he was elected, you don't have to win the popular vote to win), Gore would've invaded Iraq. EVERYONE, both Democrat and Republican, was under the impression Saddam posed a serious threat and had WMDs (Kerry flip-flopped and changed his tune once he decided to run for president). Everyone who voted for Bush wasn't a rich, gun-toting, war-loving, religious fundamentalist. I can also sympathize with Sam, I don't like Bush very much, but attacking the president does get me riled up, especially when those attackers pick and choose which facts and information they use. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatGatsby_4c96.html" title="User:GreatGatsby">GreatGatsby</a> 04:42, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, since you seem to be in the know, can I remove the underline from links that appear on my user page? And is there a reliable way to add an extra space between items in my articles list?

<ul>
<li>You mean just remove link underlines from your user page or the whole site? Ah, for spacing, you can just add <b>&amp; nbsp;</b> as many times as you want. Except there's not really a space between the &amp; and the n... I had to add it so it wouldn't turn into a space. nbsp's just register as one extra space. add one, or two, or whatever! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</small></a> 16:53, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Blankfaze, I'm puzzled: what are your criteria for supporting an admin candidate? You've voted against a couple of editors recently, which is well within your right, but it made me curious (most recently you felt 1,200 edits wasn't enough, which is a ways above the level most editors usually require) -- do you mind telling me?</p>
<p>Also, on an unrelated note, I think I should mention that, as a Christian who opposes much of the agenda of President Bush and hopes to see him ousted, the comment on your user page makes me feel more like you're attacking me and others who share my faith than like you're attacking Bush's specific misuse of faith to promote a specific political approach. You can leave it, of course, but I thought you might want to know an editor's reaction, especially the reaction of someone who otherwise has no "beef" with you (to quote a line from your recent admin nomination) and simply wants you to know the effect your words are having. If you choose not to change them at all, I won't be offended, but I think softening a little of your attack on Christianity (or else explaining your comments about it a little more) would help me feel a little more at ease conversing with you, and may prevent someone in the future from making assumptions about you (or expecting you're making assumptions about them, which amounts to the same thing, I suppose). Thanks for considering it, anyway.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 20:41, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

I suppose I'm a little on the conservative side in that, but I think it's better safe than sorry. I don't want to see any more crappy/insane/irresponsible admins than we already have.</dd>

<dd>II. I'm really sorry if you felt attacked, I really am. That's not the point of my little message at all. I don't have any problem with Christianity, or any religion, for that matter, at all. In fact, I think it's a really good thing for a great number of people... I do however, think it has absolutely no business playing such a role in our nation's government. George W. Bush and his administration are (IMO) trying to turn Conservative Christian values into laws. And I just think that's totally inappropriate and irresponsible. My beef is not with Christians or their religion, it is with the fact that Christianity and it's values are featured so prominently in the agenda of our nation's leader. Some Americans have religions, some do not. And then the ones that do don't all practice this same one. So, basically, it just pisses me off that our country is run like a Judeo-Christian nation, because we are not one. Anyway... it's been awhile since I even looked at my little statement... it's probably due for some tweaking. Again, sorry if it struck you the wrong way. - <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</small></a> 21:58, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your thoughtful response -- I appreciate it.&#160;:-) No worries about your standards -- I understand the desire to have high ones, though personally I haven't found edit count a very useful criterion. I certainly agree I don't want any crappy/insane/irresponsible admins....I hope we don't have too many of those (and certainly hope my name's not on the list!). I haven't encountered any I felt were insane or really fully crappy, but irresponsible....yeah, I know what you're talking about. And your statement on your user page certainly makes me feel at ease, but I hope I haven't forced you to censor yourself too badly? After all, you're free to have any opinion you like around here, and I don't want you to feel you have to hide your ideas. But I'll just assume, unless you say otherwise, that your new statement is a better reflection of your feelings right now. And we'll both hope that in mid-November you can replace it with a picture of Kerry's arms raised in triumph.&#160;:-) Peace, <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 22:41, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, edit counts aren't always the best criterion, agreed, but they work most of the time. Like I said, there are always exceptions. No, I didn't "censor" myself at all. I agree, the previous statement could have (and apparently did) give off the wrong impression. And anyways, Wikipedia isn't the place for a long, ultracritical political statement anyway. But I try to get the word out when and where I can. I tried to trim it down and be as basic about it as possible, and I actually really like what I came up with. I think it actually fits my opinions a bit better, you know? Focuses more on the positive than the negative... <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</small></a> 22:56, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like the idea about positivity, and would agree that I like your new statement.&#160;:-) Also (not to harp -- I hope this isn't too intrusive of me), I wanted to note that Kim has just added that he edited anonymously before -- the developers are behind on changing attribution for edits. His total including his activity as an anon is roughly 1600 edits dating back to December -- obviously it doesn't meet your firm criteria, but since you voted for DDG just now (who has about 1700, I think) I figured you might want to at least be informed. Whether or not it affects your decision is of course your business.&#160;:-) Thanks for this little conversation -- I feel much more at ease with you now, and hope to work with you in the future.

<dd>Well, like I said there are exceptions. I actually am familiar with and <i>like</i> DDG. I've never really come into contact with this Kim fellow. I may take another look at it sometime if I get the chance. Haha, yeah, nice conversation. I respect you as an editor/admin. I really <b>should</b> do some more editing/writing... Since I became an admin seems like all I ever do is maintenance and vandalfighting. I should go WRITE. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze">blankfaze</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><small>(–±–µ—Å–µ–¥–∞!)</small></a> 23:52, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
