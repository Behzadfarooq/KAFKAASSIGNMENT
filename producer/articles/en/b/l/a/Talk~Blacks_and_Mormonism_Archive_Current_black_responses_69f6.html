<h2><span class="mw-headline">Current Black Responses</span></h2>
<p>I moved the following section to this page for discussion. The author cites no sources to back up any of the following claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The typical Black response to this comment has been that people were, at the time of the racist teachings, responding to the living prophets of their day. It is also important to note that the present revelations indicated no change to the teachings that Cain was the progenator of the Black race, nor the teachings that God would have punished Black people for the sins of Cain, nor why God would humilate Black people by associating their natural skin color with God's displeasure or any kind of negative reaction. The numerous edits and modifications to Mormon scripture and other documents by LDS writers to deflect the intensity of the historical prejudice only has given an impression of a cover up. These fundamental issues have been the primary concern that Black people have with Mormonism and the outrage Blacks experience with Mormon belief systems is the comfortability that White mormons have with accepting the assumption that God did these things. Most Black people have condemned Mormonism as a heresy. Black mormon apologists however have provided some explanations, arguing that the racially discriminatory policies were contextually necessary. Opponents argue that there is no moral context that can justify these activities in Mormon history, and there are no Biblical elements to substantiate them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm very familiar with edits to LDS scripture, and nowhere to my knowledge has there been any change attempting to "cover up" "historical prejudice" against Blacks. Also, if the author is going to state what the "Black response" (as if there was a single, unified Black voice opposing the LDS church) is, there needs to be sources cited; ditto for "Black mormon [sic] apologists." This entire section, unless cited, is simply POV. Sources, please? --[User:MrWhipple|MrWhipple]] 17:11, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, there is a cover up. I go to the www.lds.org, the official church of the Mormon religion, and low and behold, all of this information about Black people is unavailable. In fact, it is refuted, by the LDS church! <a href="http://www.mormon.org/question/faq/category/answer/0,9777,1601-1-1203-1,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mormon.org/question/faq/category/answer/0,9777,1601-1-1203-1,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormon.org/question/faq/category/answer/0,9777,1601-1-1203-1,00.html</a> Here is my favorite part, the last sentance: "We have a lay priesthood, and every worthy man is eligible to receive this priesthood." What, is there a -non-lay priesthood? Is every worthy man eligible to receive this as well? If so, then why was this greater priesthood not mentioned? Why didn't Hinckley say "We have a lay priesthood and a greater priesthood, and every worthy man is eligible to receive both." Why according to the LDS church: The priesthood has two divisions. The lesser priesthood is called the Aaronic Priesthood, named after Aaron in the Old Testament. It includes the authority to preach the gospel of repentance and to baptize. The greater priesthood is called the Melchizedek Priesthood, named after Melchizedek in the Old Testament. It includes the authority to preside over the Church and to perform all ordinances, including giving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Are Black people allowed to give this gift of the Holy Ghost, or is the idea of a Black man giving the gift... unsettling...to the good white Mormon? Those black hands, actually doing such a pure thing! - Zaph!</dd>

<dd>Hi Zaph - good questions. Yes, blacks are allowed to recieve "both priesthoods" you mention above. We've had a few general authorities that are black since the 1978 revelation. However, you misunderstand church doctrine and practice. There is no professional clergy. therefore there is no "non-lay" priesthood. Any man ordained to be an elder has the same priesthood authority as President Hinckley. If you go to the church web site and look under publications - and search, you'll find a lot of infomraotin about views on blacks and mormonism by church leaders and members of both races. And yes, of course blacks can give and receive teh gift of the holy ghost. there is no distinction between the races in teh church currently. I've been given blessings by and performed priesthood ordinances with church members and priesthood holders with blacks, oriental, native american, maori, and other races. there is no difference. I'm suprised by your perception to be honest. There are congregations all across the world where blacks and/or those of other races lead the congregation and bishops, stake presidents, area authorities and other leadership positions.</dd>

<dd>The artilce states that church leaders were unsure if the policy banning those of other races to the priesthood was given by revelation. Yes, the "doctrine" that Cain was cursed and that Canaan was cursed is in the scriptures. And yes, most interpret that these groups had black skin (though the scriptures don't say if they are the same family - ie - was egyptus a descendant of cain or not). This is why Joseph F. Smith, David O. McKay, and others felt that a revelation was needed to change the policy. We were unsure as to how the policy was implemented, as most black males prior to the nauvoo period that joined the church were ordained to the priesthood. The article also states that smith first taught this policy to his inner circle and this was about the same time he taught them polygamy - which wasn't taught publicly until 1852. This policy wasn't implmented until after smith's death. Simply put, historians are unsure why the change in policy instructions by smith, and all of the reasoning behind it. And frankly, speculation about why is lame, as there is no smoking gun document pointing to this. Yes the church has a controversial past, but I'm suprised that the attention it gets - even the penecostal sects didn't officially "de segregate" until the 1990s. The Southern Baptists officially renounced their policy toward blacks in the same decade as the Mormons. But for some reason, because the LDS church took a "revelation" to change, rather than a vote, it recieved more attention. It is apparent that church members were ready to make the change much sooner than their protestant counterparts in many cases, but needed the revelation to move forward. I'm not saying that any form of racial discrimination is right, and many mormons disagree (and had for many years prior to the policy change) with the policy implemented by smith and young. However, it is what is is, an it is now differnt, thank goodness. I know it doens't undo any damage, but history seldom does. Church members just want to move forward as they tend to do and focus on the current prophets teachings which is that all men have access to the same blessings and responsibilities regardless of race. Hope this helps. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 13:56, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for the record, not all Mormons agree that the "Curse of Cain" idea, which was a common belief in 19th century America, was ever actual Church doctrine, though it certainly was taught in the Church. Many consider it a theological rationalization for a social phenomenon (institutionalized racism) common throughout American culture prior to the 1960s and 1970s. These point out that there is no record of an explicit revelation that can be cited as the source of the policy. David O. McKay, for example, was very careful to call the exclusion of blacks from the priesthood a "policy" rather than a "doctrine." B. H. Roberts also openly believed it was not a doctrine. See David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jacob durrant (<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacob_durrant_4e8f.html" title="User talk:Jacob durrant">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jacob_durrant_ee0e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jacob durrant">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
