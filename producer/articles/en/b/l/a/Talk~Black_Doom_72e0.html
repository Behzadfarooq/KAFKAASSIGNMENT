<p>Guys, there is no reason for this. Black Doom is a character with enough information to qualify for his own article; he does not need to be placed in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_villains_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_4316.html" title="Minor villains in Sonic the Hedgehog">Minor villains in Sonic the Hedgehog</a> article. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenjo_59ed.html" title="User:Denjo">User:Denjo</a></p>
<p>Erazor has more backstory then Black doom and he doesn't have his own page. Why shouldn't Blackdoom be any different? He should at least be merged with the Black arms article. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelsait_3f80.html" title="User:Delsait">Delsait</a> 22:10, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fine, if you have to merge him with something, do <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Arms_33b3.html" title="Black Arms">Black Arms</a>; not Minor villains. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenjo_59ed.html" title="User:Denjo">User:Denjo</a></p>

<p>Who ever actually edited the History section, turst me, that suker wasted his time. It says History which means its the history of Black Doom, but it was edited like a story, if i have time i will do some more editing. It began ok, then in the middle of it, it starts to talk about what happened, which shouldn't have anything to do with what happened only his history</p>

<p>Hi. I'm not a registered user here, sorry. However, I was the guy who added the Putrid Corpse, Bloody Skeleton, Shao Kahn, and additional Demons data to the Mortal Kombat species page (by the way, the stuff I added about Demons is still there; I talk about the ones from Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks). Moving along, I know I'm not a registered user but I think I have a useful critique about how you spoke of Black Doom's power. You said he was more powerful than Perfect Chaos, Biolizard/Final Hazard, Metal Overlord, and Dark Oak. While I won't argue Perfect Chaos as his true power has never been seen (the fight he had with Super Sonic shouldn't be counted as Super Sonic's good powers were more powerful than his anger) and Biolizard is obviously weaker than Black Doom, or even Dark Oak (who I think he's even with should he not assume his Devil Doom form) I will argue your Metal Overlord statement. Consider this: it took Super Sonic, Super Knuckles, and Super Tails working together to barely be able to stand up to Metal Overlord. But with Devil Doom, though he was powerful, only Super Shadow (who is even with Super Sonic) was needed to defeat him. Not only did it take more power to defeat Metal Overlord, but one might even say the only reason that Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles beat Metal Overlord was because of the bond they share which could have amplified the power of the Chaos Emeralds (like in Sonic Adventure's battle with Perfect Chaos) or that they work surprisingly well as a team. Shadow on the other hand, was alone and had no real motivations that would apply to the Chaos Emeralds (he was just determined to beat him; he had didn't have any emotional boost from Maria or any other positive feelings the Emeralds usually amplify when used).</p>
<p>Sorry to go a bit off topic in the last sentence or two but I thought it neccessary to emphasize my point. Chances are, you'll ignore this and not acknowledge anything I said but I figured it would be better to talk to you this way rather than adding to another page like I did with the Mortal Kombat species page. If you do decide to read this, then I would be honored, especially if you agreed or commented on what I said. Speaking of commenting on things I've said, you can refer to me as Ninja Bot if the need ever arises.</p>
<p>Once again, sorry about not being a registered user.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I'm not a registered user too, but in the battle with Metal Overlord, Tails and Knuckles wasn't in their super forms... SuperSonic gave them a some sort of an energetic shield, maybe... (Sorry for my bad english).</p>
<p>Shadow <i>did</i> have positive feelings from Maria; she showed up in the transmission from Gerald, which helped to remind Shadow of the promise he made to her. It was Shadow's determination to protect humanity, as Maria wanted him to do, that gave him his determination to destroy Black Doom. --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 01:37, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Actually, Knuckles and Tails may have been in their super forms. In Sonic the Hedgehog(2006), Super Sonic uses his own power to transform Shadow and Silver into their own respective super forms. Granted, their fur had changed colour instead of having an energy orb around them, though they were transformed in the same way as Tails and Knuckles were.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Mad_e0fa.html" title="User:Michael Mad">Michael Mad</a> 22:21, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it helps if you keep the Black Doom and Black Arms articles seperate. There is too much information on Black Doom to put on the already long Black Arms article, and since GUN doesn't get a rewrite to take out all the different weapons it uses, I don't like the idea of the Black Arms article having to be shortened. <a href="../../../o/u/b/User%7EOubliette_b7f9.html" title="User:Oubliette">Oubliette</a> 15:10, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sick and tired of people comparing <i>Shadow the Hedgehog</i> to <i>Teen Titans</i>. Who cares how similar Black Doom is to Trigon? IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE. GET OVER IT. Just about everything in the game that seems to be a reference to TV is purely coincidental. The Billy Hatcher references in the game are intentional.

<p>Let's face it, there's no good reason for the Black Arms to have gone <i>2,000 years without food</i>!!!! Clearly, Black Doom is more than smart enough not to let his spawn (or himself) starve, so you'd think that the Black Arms would have raided other planets while waiting to invade Earth. Speaking of raids, the Black Arms might be the "enemies" that had attacked the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Species_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_ba2f.html#Seedrians" title="Alien Species in Sonic the Hedgehog">Seedrians</a> eight years prior to the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metarex.html" title="Metarex">Metarex</a> conflict in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_X_c94d.html" title="Sonic X">Sonic X</a></i>. The reason that it's the Black Arms is that they're the primary canonical hostile extraterrestrials for the Sonic series; the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Species_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_ba2f.html#Xorda" title="Alien Species in Sonic the Hedgehog">Xorda</a> from the Archie continuity had a personal vendetta against Earth, so they don't count (even though they did constantly threaten the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_Species_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_ba2f.html#Bem" title="Alien Species in Sonic the Hedgehog">Bem</a>.) Plus, the Black Arms are predatory, so they'd actually have a good reason to attack the Seedrian planet; I don't see how the Xorda could benefit from pulverizing a bunch of innocent plants. So, do you think Black Doom could be considered an enemy of the Metarex, and the enemy of the Seedrians in general? I'd like to have your opinion on this! --<a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigifan_ba7c.html" title="User:Luigifan">Luigifan</a> 01:46, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hate to sound pushy, but speculation and rumours are not usually allowed on Wikipedia even if everyone thinks it's obvious. For example let's say Sega never confirmed that Sonic was a hedgehog, and the games were just called "Sonic". Even if it is obvious that Sonic is a hedgehog and everyone thinks so, we can't just say that he is, even if we state it's speculatory. So, sorry, if I could I'd put your theory in the article as it shows what some fans "think". But this is an encyclopedia. And encyclopedias aren't usually filled with speculation or rumours.

<p>I can understand the theory, but I agree that that doesn't mean it should be included. You're basically saying "We know of two alien races in Sonic Team-connected works, one peaceful and one hostile. Because the peaceful race's enemy is never named, we can just assume it's the Black Arms". If that's revealed to be the case in the apparently forthcoming final season of Sonic X, then sure, go ahead and add it. But right now, it's just a theory with very little basis to go on. It's useless fluff like those people who feel the need to add "Some fans think that..." speculation onto new character pages for the forthcoming game.--HellCat86 09:09, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really doubt that the Black Arms had anything to do with the Seedrians. Both species live in separate continuities.

<dd>Well, I have to agree that Black Doom is the "baddest of the bad" (though I couldn't care less for the <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leetspeak.html" title="Leetspeak">leetspeak</a>.) Going over the other villains in the SegaSonic continuity, we find that Black Doom is probably the most evil, and his scheme was the most, to put it lightly, disturbing. <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Eggman_3968.html" title="Doctor Eggman">Doctor Eggman</a> has become a bit soft over the years; <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a> itself has said so! <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_503a.html" title="Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog)">Chaos</a> wasn't evil, just <i><b>really</b></i> pissed off.

Black Doom, on the other hand, tried to make a huge buffet out of the human race (and, actually, all life on Earth would have fallen victim to that nerve gas if Shadow had failed to destroy the Black Comet.) No, I haven't mentioned the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metarex.html" title="Metarex">Metarex</a>, or any of the villains from the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28comic%29_e20b.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (comic)">Archie comic book series</a>, or from <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Comic_12e0.html" title="Sonic the Comic">Sonic the Comic</a>; I don't have any intention to, because they're simply too numerous.

<dd>Just 'cause he was created with BD's blood doesn't mean squat. Just because you were created with some of someones DNA doesn't mean they're your Biological Father. For all you know, Shadow was just a Hedgehog, then Gerald applied his research, along with Black Dooms DNA to make Shadow stable. This "bio dad" stuff was NEVER mentioned. Wouldn't GERALD be more of a father anyway? All Black Doom did is give him some of his blood. If anything, the bio dad thing is fanon. This wasn't even MENTIONED in the game, nor implied. Since all we know is that Shadow was made with Dooms Blood, we can't call him his father yet. Besides, I don't think some BLOOD would just instantly turn into Shadow. There was probably alot of other DNA along with synthetics and whatnot applied. For all you know, Shadow has more HEDGEHOG DNA than Black Arms DNA. We leave it at "he was created with Black Dooms DNA".

<dd>Black Doom- "Don't you know? You were created from MY blood". I think you're being quite desperate. There is alot of evidence in the game that Black Doom is his biological father, including the above quote. He's not a father in the sense of how we humans reproduce, hence why I wrote it as "father". However, that doesn't change his role. To further add to this, Last Story pretty clearly turns this into a nature vs nurture matter.

<p>Black Doom also said that Shadow has always held an intense hatred of humans, and that only his solution is good for humanity. He's gotta be right. But seriously, just because he was created FROM his blood, doesn't mean that all he was WAS BD's blood. The "father" thing is still speculatory. We'd need MUCH more evidence than THAT. Also, remember that it was never SPECIFICALLY stated that Shadow wasn't just some hedgehog that was experimented on. He could have had the DNA, synthetics, and research applied to him. The "father" thing doesn't even contribute to the article anyway. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChao9999_76c3.html" title="User:Chao9999">Chao9999</a> 05:22, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most people I've discussed this with, including myself, took away from the game the idea that Gerald was having no success in creating life, Black Doom offered a mutual alliance from which they both benefit and provided his genetic material which Gerald used to create Shadow. This is supplemented by the fact we know Gerald studied Echidna culture, hence explaining why he wanted his creation to resemble a certain hedgehog. The idea that Gerald and Black Doom augmented an existing hedgehog just over complicates things. Further, Black Doom speaks in a slightly dated manner so 'my blood' more than likely translates into 'my genetic material'--HellCat86 16:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The echidna culture thing is fanon, and fanon doesn't belong in the article. And it wasn't that he "was having no sucess in creating life" it was that he was "having no sucess in creating the ultimate life". Biolizard seemed pretty alive to me. And even IF he meant "my genetic material" (it doesn't matter), that still doesn't even explain why he NEEDED the blood/genetics. There's a large possibility that there were factors in his DNA that were extracted and then applied to the unfinished Shadow, making him stable. The father thing is speculation, as we don't actually know WHY the blood was needed. -<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChao9999_76c3.html" title="User:Chao9999">Chao9999</a> 21:39, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why do you insist the Echidna thing is fanon? He made Artificial Chaos, based on the 'god' who destroyed the Echidna culture and was powered by the Emeralds. He created a way to harness said power based on the exact shrine on Angel Island. There are countless legends about the Emeralds but I think the games made it clear Gerald focused on the Echidnas. Your problem is you seem to have your own personal canon and damned be anyone who introduces conflicting facts into that view.--HellCat86 13:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with HellCat. If he didn't study Echidna culture, then why does Shadow look like Super Sonic? (who was fortold in <i>ancient Echidna culture</i>) Coincidence? I think <i>not</i>.

<p>Do any of you think wikipedia pages should have a section for guesses and speculation on subjects canonical sources don't give much info about? The Black Arms VS Seedrians and the like? Other sites have theory pages and they can really help if you want the info to write fanfics as they present some good ideas. I think it would add to the information we can provide and fill in some gaps.--Neon Apocalypse <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.137.121.11_85c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.137.121.11">24.137.121.11</a> (talk) 13:24, 28 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
