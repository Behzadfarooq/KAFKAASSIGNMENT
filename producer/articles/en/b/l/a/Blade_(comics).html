<p>Blade stood out amongst other comic heroes with his direct and at times, rude, way of speaking. His dialogue was also intended to reflect, to varying degrees of success, the street slang of the 1970s.</p>
<p>While the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> version of the character Blade was British and born in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, the film and television versions of Blade produced by <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Line_Cinema_0eb0.html" title="New Line Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> portray him as an American born in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the detail that in both tellings of the story his mother was bitten by vampires while giving birth to him, there is little resemblance between the movie and comic book versions of Blade. However, due to the success of the film, efforts were made by Marvel to make the comic version resemble the film character more closely. This was achieved by having Blade bitten on the arm by <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morbius%2C_the_Living_Vampire_2839.html" title="Morbius, the Living Vampire">Morbius</a>. The injury resulted in Blade becoming a half vampire, which gave him all of a vampire's strengths but none of their weaknesses. He had super strength, great agility, and <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immunity.html" title="Immunity">immunity</a> to sunlight. Prior to being bitten by Morbius the only unusual attributes Blade was said to have were an immunity to vampire bites and a lesser aging process than humans. Both due to his unique physiology. As Morbius was not a true vampire, but some type of variant, Blade was not immune to his bite like other vampires and it altered his physiology to the extent that it was similar to that of Morbius. However, in the current Blade comic series, this has been the subject of a <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retcon</a> - Blade now claims Morbius's bite changed nothing and that he has been half-vampire since birth.</p>

Blade's origin, by Rico Rival</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The man called Blade was born in a <a href="../../../s/o/h/Soho.html" title="Soho">Soho</a> whorehouse, in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. Blade himself has revealed that the exact date of his birth was <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> - also known as <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Crash_1929_12cd.html" title="Wall Street Crash 1929">Black Thursday</a>; as it was the day the stock market crash began. Blade said he is 72 years old but his vampire powers make him look much younger.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Blade's mother, Tara Brooks; a prostitute at Madame Vanity’s Brothel, experienced severe labor complications, and a doctor was summoned. The name of the "doctor" was <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon_Frost_c363.html" title="Deacon Frost">Deacon Frost</a>, in reality a bloodthirsty <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire_%28Marvel_Comics%29_b430.html" title="Vampire (Marvel Comics)">vampire</a>. Frost feasted on Blade's mother during Blade's birth, killing her, and accidentally passing along certain enzymes in his own blood to the infant. This resulted in Blade's superhuman abilities, such as immunity to being turned, ability to "smell" supernatural creatures, and greatly prolonged lifespan. This also caused Blade's sensitivity to bright light.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Frost was driven off by Blade's mother’s coworkers before he could kill the infant as well. They raised him until he was nine years old. Though he lacked superhuman physical prowess, he trained himself to become an Olympic-level athlete and formidable hand-to-hand combatant. Most notably, he became an expert with edged weapons and especially knives and daggers.</p>

<p>Walking home from school, Blade saw an old man being attacked by three bandits. Blade fought off the hoodlums, who turned out to be vampires, and rescued the old man. He learned that the old man was Jamal Afari, a <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> trumpeter and vampire hunter. Afari moved into Madame Vanity's brothel and trained the young Blade in both music and combat. Blade was soon able to defeat many of the weak, younger vampires that he and Afari found in abundance.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Blade's victories made him cocky. He soon joined a street gang, the Bloodshadows, which was headed by a much older and more powerful vampire than any Blade had met before: Lamia. Blade barely defeated Lamia, and, in doing so, lost his girlfriend Glory, a loss which caused him not only to accept his destiny as an enemy of the undead but also to swear to it forever.</p>
<p>Afari himself later fell prey to the attack of the vampire <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomb_of_Dracula_e3d3.html" title="Tomb of Dracula">Dracula</a>, the first occurrence in an ongoing battle between him and Blade. Blade slew the vampire Afari and followed Dracula back to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Blade tracked Dracula throughout Europe and <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, then on into the far east, staking him many times, but never completely destroying him. In <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, Blade joined Ogun Strong's vampire hunters which included Azu, Orji and Musenda. Together, they staked Dracula again. Once more, Dracula survived, and taught Blade an object lesson by killing all of his new-found friends except Musenda (who eventually retired from vampire hunting). However, Orji created a lasting impression on Blade with his use of wooden daggers as a means to combat vampires. Sometime after Orji's death, Blade mastered the use of daggers and adopted the use of wooden daggers as his preferred method of combating vampires.</p>
<p>Consumed by grief, Blade resumed his quest alone. It was decades before he again allowed himself to endanger another human.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: The Drac Pack">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Drac Pack</span></h3>
<p>Blade eventually located Dracula in Paris, where he first encountered Quincy Harker (son of <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Harker_f513.html" title="Jonathan Harker">Jonathan Harker</a>) and his vampire hunters, unofficially dubbed the "Drac Pack". Blade had heard of Harker before, but had never met him. Because of his mercurial temperament, Blade had a strained but steady relationship with Quincy Harker, Rachel Van Helsing (granddaughter of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Van_Helsing_ecd9.html" title="Abraham Van Helsing">Abraham Van Helsing</a>), Taj Nital, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Drake_%28comics%29_6552.html" title="Frank Drake (comics)">Frank Drake</a>, vampire hunters dedicated to destroying Dracula. Blade never joined the group, but served as their ally on several occasions.</p>
<p>After an unsuccessful battle with Dracula, Blade realized for the first time that he was immune to turning from a vampire's bite. Armed with this knowledge, he left the group and began a quest to find the vampire that had killed his mother and avenge her.</p>
<p>Blade's hunt for his mother's killer next led him to Boston, where he again encountered the Drac Pack and their new ally: Dracula. Blade spurned the alliance and berated Harker for it until he faced <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Sun_e87a.html" title="Doctor Sun">Doctor Sun</a>, the common threat that drove these natural enemies together. During the battle with Sun, Blade met up with one of Sun's allies, whose face provoked a strange reaction in him, dredging up long-buried memories. The vampire escaped, and Blade again abandoned the Drac Pack, and set out on his own.</p>
<p>Blade eventually encountered <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannibal_King_40c1.html" title="Hannibal King">Hannibal King</a>, a private detective who had been turned into a vampire by Deacon Frost thirty years ago; however, to further gain Blade's trust, King lied about his age, saying it was only five. While initially distrusting King, Blade teamed up with him to track down Frost.</p>
<p>Blade and King fought together against Blade's evil <a href="../../../d/o/p/Doppelg%C3%A4nger.html" title="Doppelgänger">doppelgänger</a> (created when Frost killed his mother), who absorbed the real Blade. King enlisted the help of Daimon Hellstrom, the so-called <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimon_Hellstrom_d072.html" title="Daimon Hellstrom">Son of Satan</a>, who exorcised Blade from his doppelgänger and killed it with King's help. Blade and King eventually caught up with Frost who had created an army of vampiric doppelgängers, one for each of his victims. Together, they shut down Frost for good, forging a lasting friendship.</p>

<p>In later years, Blade, along with King and Drake, became a frequent ally of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Strange_ff58.html" title="Doctor Strange">Doctor Strange</a> and assisted in the casting of the Montesi Formula. The formula had been retrieved from a page in the <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkhold.html" title="Darkhold">Darkhold</a></i>, a powerful book of magic responsible for the creation of all vampires. This destroyed Dracula and, for a time, all vampires on Earth. Blade, King and Drake stayed together, and formed a private detective agency called Borderline Inc. The agency discontinued after Drake left and Blade was committed to a psychiatric hospital following a battle with a temporarily resurrected Dracula.</p>
<p>Doctor Strange later arranged the release of Blade so that he could join Drake and King in reforming Borderline Inc. as the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightstalkers_%28comics%29.html" title="Nightstalkers (comics)">Nightstalkers</a>, members of Strange's new team, the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_Sons_1e08.html" title="Midnight Sons">Midnight Sons</a>, at the core of which stood the Nine, humans and others chosen to defend Earth against mystical invasion. Together, unknowingly under Strange's manipulation, they battled various supernatural villains such as the Darkholders, Hydra's DOA, the Lilin (the children of Lilith, mother of demons), and <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varnae.html" title="Varnae">Varnae, the Lord of Vampires</a>. To ensure Blade's cooperation, Strange mystically transmuted Blade's hatred of vampires into an enmity against all things supernatural. But, even more dangerous games were afoot. Due to its gross over-use, the <i>Montesi Formula</i> was weakening: King transformed back into a vampire, and Blade's vampiric <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> resurfaced, making him even more volatile and dangerous and playing him and King against each other. Blade even tried to sacrifice King to the DOA. It was only through Frank Drake's insistence that Blade decided to save his former friend.</p>
<p>At one point, Blade used a page of the accursed <i>Darkhold</i> book of spells to become, apparently, the mystically empowered <b>Switchblade</b>. In truth, his body was taken over by an ancient entity bent on the destruction of the supernatural world called the <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elder_Gods_%28Marvel_Comics%29_4976.html" title="Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)">Demogorge</a>. In this form Blade fought and slew many of the Midnight Sons, and was only stopped when one of them read a spell of banishment and exiled the Demogorge forever.</p>
<p>The damage he had done as Switchblade was reversed; however, Blade could not reconcile himself to the fact that he remembered everything that had occurred, and that he had caused it all through his blind hatred of the supernatural. Using a mystical knife called the Edge of Intrados, Blade reviewed his life as though living it again. This was a major turning point in his life: he realized that, even before Strange's manipulations, he had been governed by his own obsessions and blinded to the safety and well-being of his friends and allies, or the possibility of leading a normal life. He decided to retire.</p>
<p>He was soon pressured into returning to the game, however, when Drake and King were kidnapped by Short Circuit, one of the Lilin. Blade followed them into an alternate reality where King had become the Lord of Vampires. Escaping from this living nightmare, Blade killed Short Circuit, and swore to King that he would never allow King to lose control of his vampiric urges, sealing the rift between them and cementing their friendship forever.</p>
<p>The Midnight Sons were soon after involved in the events known as the Siege of Darkness. In the culminating chapter of this adventure, Blade obtained the mystical sword Justicar from Foundry, a former member of both the Blood and the Fallen, immortal enemies and servants of <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zarathos.html" title="Zarathos">Zarathos</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>Foundry had never completed the forging of Justicar because it needed to be <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tempering.html" title="Tempering">tempered</a> in the blood of one of the Blood. However, when Zarathos and the Fallen attacked, Foundry allowed Blade to kill her, completing the sword. Blade proceeded to kill each and every member of the Fallen, and to seemingly destroy Zarathos.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Darkness_0a0b.html" title="Siege of Darkness">Siege of Darkness</a>, the Midnight Sons began to drift apart, as their destiny as a team seemed fulfilled. Blade and the Nightstalkers continued to hunt vampires, believing that it was partially their fault (through their lack of understanding about how to properly use the Montesi Formula) that vampires were being reintroduced into the human world.</p>
<p>But tragedy soon struck. Blade was devastated when he appeared to be the only one of the trio to survive the final battle with Varnae, which culminated in the death of Blade's old friend and the only one of the "Drac Pack" he was ever able to connect with: Taj Nital, now a vampire serving Varnae. With every member of the "Drac Pack" now gone, Blade decided to return to vampire hunting to honor their memory. He would go on to join forces with a mystic named <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carik_ec19.html" title="John Carik">Bible John Carik</a>, and to encounter a vampire impersonating Deacon Frost and finally a once again resurrected Dracula. Later, in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Blade discovered that Hannibal King had survived the encounter with Varnae, and the two joined forces to defeat a newly resurrected Deacon Frost.</p>

<p>Blade's blood enzymes reacted unexpectedly with Morbius's unique form of <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampirism.html" title="Vampirism">vampirism</a> to produce an almost perfected form of the virus, granting Blade many vampire strengths while eliminating weaknesses inherent to a vampire (it was at this time that Blade assumed the unofficial title of "Daywalker" among his prey).</p>
<p>Recently, Blade has come under the eye of the <a href="../../../s/2E/h/S.H.I.E.L.D_2894.html" title="S.H.I.E.L.D">S.H.I.E.L.D</a> division Project: Silvereye, which sought to use his blood in creating cloned vampire operatives. Blade shut down the project with the help of two vampire-hunting twins, Mosha and Mikado. Blade was then forced to combat a hostile takeover of the vampire world by a breed of vampire called the Tryks while simultaneously repelling the advances of their queen.</p>
<p>One of Blade's recent solo adventures involved a plot by Dracula to assume the title of Vampire Lord officially, by becoming a god-like being like Varnae. Blade joined Noah Van Helsing (actually Noah Tremayne, Rachel's adopted cousin) and several vampire hunters from across the globe to stop Dracula from succeeding.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blade_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: New series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New series</span></h4>
<p>Blade was given a monthly title of his own again, written by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Guggenheim_4e6e.html" title="Marc Guggenheim">Marc Guggenheim</a> and illustrated by <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Chaykin_fd57.html" title="Howard Chaykin">Howard Chaykin</a>. Per the first issue of that series, Blade was contacted by SHIELD's supernatural-security taskforce, the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howling_Commandos_794c.html" title="Howling Commandos">Howling Commandos</a>, to deal with an old adversary. Also, the secret Order of Tyrana appeared to keep files on Blade's life.</p>
<p>Dracula had arisen from his grave once again, and transformed an entire class of schoolchildren into vampires, which <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> happened to be teaching. Spider-Man also fell under Dracula's influence and was briefly "turned". Spider-Man's radioactive blood eventually turned him back to normal, with the children's fate as yet unclear. Blade managed to kill Dracula once again, but the remains of Dracula's body were diverted to the SHIELD Helicarrier <i>Pericles V</i>, something Blade found immediately suspicious. He infiltrated the Helicarrier, and while wearing a SHIELD uniform, Blade fought vampires who made everyone else believe they were SHIELD agents. Blade had realized these vampires wanted to revive Dracula once again, but intervened. Blade managed to successfully kill all of these vampires and fully destroyed Dracula's body with silver bullets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, without Blade's knowledge, his rich father, Lucas Cross, was revealed to be the one responsible for reviving Dracula and wasn't impressed to hear that his son was behind Dracula's demise.</p>
<p>In a next adventure, Blade was summoned by none other than <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Doom_2ca9.html" title="Doctor Doom">Doctor Doom</a> to travel to Doom's home country, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latveria.html" title="Latveria">Latveria</a>. Doom had used his mystical "gypsy powers" to witness an event from the past, in which an alternate version of Blade had been sent deeper into the past to rescue Doom's mother from prison, who was pregnant with Doom at the time. In exchange to make this event happen in the current timeline, Doom offered Blade an elixir that would cure him of his thirst for human blood. Blade traveled successfully in time using Doom's time-travel portal, and arrived in the prison. However, it was so huge Blade needed help and the prison was under attack by vampires. Killing some vampires, Blade rescued a political prisoner, who later turned out to be a younger version of his biological father, Lucas Cross. Cross led Blade to the floor Doom's mother was held in, and Blade helped her turn more vampires into dust. Eventually, with all of their enemies destroyed, Blade travelled back to the future and Doom handed him over the elixir, which has yet to be proven to actually work as it would also cause Blade to lose his thirst for hunting humans. He still carries it regardless.</p>

<li>Following his bite from Morbius, Blade has received all the strengths of a vampire, but none of their weaknesses. In issue #4 of his current series he is referred to as a <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhampir.html" title="Dhampir">dhampir</a>.

<li>Beyond his obvious vampiric abilities, Blade also seems to be something of a savant in the field of weaponry. Blade has virtually mastered the use of every type of weapon known to man, and can adapt new weaponry to his growing repertoire in mere minutes.

<p>Blade appears in a 1996 episode of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Spider-Man%7E_The_Animated_Series_0a1d.html" title="Spider-Man: The Animated Series">Spider-Man animated series</a>, entitled "<i><b>Neogenic Nightmare: Chapter 9: Blade the Vampire Hunter</b></i>." In that episode, Spider-Man and Blade first met each other, and it also marked the very first appearance of Whistler in any version of the Marvel Universe, as Whistler had never appeared in a comic before. In this episode, Blade was hunting down Morbius. It was also revealed that Blade was the son of a vampire man with a human mother, but became orphaned after his mother left him in a foster home after she was bitten by a vampire. In the following episode <b>"<i>The Immortal Vampire</i>",</b> Blade once again makes an appearance alongside Morbius. In the shows 4th season, in the episode <b>"<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Vampire_Queen_%28Spider-Man%7E_The_Animated_Series%29_760d.html" title="The Vampire Queen (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)">Partners in Danger: Chapter 7: The Vampire Queen</a></i>",</b> Blade returns and hunts down the Vampire Queen, who is revealed to be his mother. Blade made his final appearance in the show in the 5th season episode <b>"<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Secret_Wars_%28Spider-Man%7E_The_Animated_Series%29_df60.html" title="Secret Wars (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)">Secret Wars: Chapter 2: Gauntlet of the Red Skull</a></i>"</b> where he was seen working side by side with Morbius and the Black Cat against the Vampire Queen until the Cat was "abducted" by Spider-Man to help him. Blade was voiced by J.D. Hall. It should also be noted that in this series, Blade wore a costume based on his appearance in the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightstalkers.html" title="Nightstalkers">Nightstalkers</a> comic series and his subsequent solo series.</p>
