<p style="margin-left:2em;">Request reason: "I suggested that one of the reviewers was biased and pointed out that he/she was declaring the content gibberish while all terms in the article could be found in online dictionaries. Then, when I was accused of plagurism, the original author of the information editted the page himself and pointed this out in the discussion. While I did engage friends who were familiar with the content to edit and support the article, I in no way presented myself as someone else to further my own cause. How could I help create an article as a personal attack, as the reasons for my block cite?--the article (were it still existent) would have shown that it in no way attacked anyone and simply stated the basic premise of Miller's philosophy of xenanthropism. This content was neither offensive, unfounded, libelous, stolen nor incoherent; and, the content neither promoted nor painted poorly Miller, xenanthropism, nor critics of the philosophy. The admin who repeatedly demanded the article's deletion (Irishguy) is a university student who has a history of deleting articles that he personally disagrees with (and a history of a higher deletion rate per review). His decision to delete and bureauacratize may have had more to do with his political or personal beliefs then the article's content. If pointing out such things is considered an "attack" on another Wikipedian, then how does Wikipedia keep from slipping into some sort of subjectively-molded oligarchy? In the future, I'll use the sandbox and have my citations prepared for posting, as my mistake was creating the article before it was of the highest quality and useability I could manage. Indefinitely preventing me from participating in this free and open (and remarkably successful) wiki due to the opinions of two or less people is nothing short of virtual tyranny and a slap in the face of the whole concept of Wikipedia."</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Decline reason: "Xenanthropism was deleted for being a blatant copyright violation, in direct violation of <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">policy</a>.

<p>The original author (Clint Miller, i.e., User:Amor Fati) granted permission, and his content was used as a template. The error there was creating the article before editing had finished--he's the one who gave it the final polish anyway before the wikinihilists came and threw it all away. Good call on the other page--I don't dispute that, and encourage its deletion since it <i>is</i> a nonsensecal entry. How would I go about proving myself in the arena when the arena is off limits?

<blockquote>
<p>I'll tell you what: If you come up with a version of an article for Xenanthropism (for example, on this talk page) that at least cites reliable sources for who uses this term to mean what, I'll gladly make it visible again - and then possibly nominate it for deletion so that the community of editors may decide. Please read WP:NOR, WP:NOT and WP:RS before writing a new version of the article, though. Thanks, Sandstein 08:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how could I possibly do that when the person who has the power prevents me from even submitting an article on the talk page? Also, he requested its deletion several times before errors were corrected. And now I can't ask that amor_fati's account be allowed access, since he was blocked and accused of being me. *huff huff huff*<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlazingnikons_61b8.html" title="User:Blazingnikons">Blazingnikons</a> 08:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Admin Luna Santin informed me that she'd be willing to rescind the block of my account if I were able to provide her "some reason to believe" that I'm "committed to such ideas (of Wikipedian conduct)," which is impossible as long as the block remains.<br /></p>
