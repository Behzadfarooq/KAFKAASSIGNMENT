You can play as Iraq, Russia, or the United States. You start out with a basic unit and buy shafts to pump oil which automatically turns into money which can be used to fund your war. You then build a landing zone and airport to get more advanced units and a supply depot to give your units ammunition. Then you mass up and war. There are many features like air strikes, bomber strikes, underground tunnels, and many interesting campaigns.</p>

<p>The political crisis has been growing for months. A wave of demonstrations has broken out around the world. The pieces of information released through the mass media hardly reveal half of the seriousness of the situation. And itâ€™s all because of...</p>
<p>In a secret session of the Central Geological <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> Commission it is revealed that worldwide oil stocks have plummeted to dangerously low levels. If consumption remains at current levels, oil reserves will run out within 10-15 years. This proves too short for even the most highly industrialized countries to switch their economies over to alternative energy sources. Lack of oil leads to a total crash of the world economy, transportation systems, and international banking system and, finally, ushers in a period of anarchy and chaos.</p>
<p>In October 2001, the UN General Assembly drafted a resolution calling for the takeover of all world oil reserves and placed their control firmly in UN hands. The stated goal was to bring mankind out of the oil crisis with a minimum of pain.</p>
<p>The OPEC countries response was to call for a Jihad or holy war and quickly began building up their arms supplies.</p>
<p>The UN then passed another resolution calling for the forcible capture of all oil reserves, starting with those in the Middle East. In November 2001 the first NATO fleet hit the shores of the Persian Gulf...</p>

<p>The US is a leading economic and military power. Her capacity for production and war making is huge. With a well-organized General Staff, most actions are meticulously planned and thought out. A large group of scientists and engineers are always ready and waiting to work on the latest technologies and can turn ideas into reality in surprisingly short times. Thanks to a network of diplomatic contacts and a well-staffed secret service, the Americans can study future battle areas well in advance of the fighting. The biggest problem is conducting a war thousands of kilometers away from the homeland. This calls for logistics of the first order. Indeed, the American war effort is primarily a question of transport, supply and movement.</p>

<p>Despite immense internal problems, Russia is still a military power, which must be treated with respect. Its huge military potential, built up during the Cold War, still poses a serious danger, and thus makes Russia one of the few great powers capable of decisively influencing world politics. The Russians currently possess inexpensive, reliable weaponry. In more than just a few cases, Russian equipment can measure up with that used by NATO. Constant shortages of money for equipment repair and modernization, as well as the neglected scientific research have led to organizational problems in the general staff and a freeze on new armaments. Russian vehicles are uncomplicated in their construction and operation, as neither evacuation nor repair has been planned for. If possible, vehicles are fixed on the spot by the crew, which means that all Russian tank drivers need to be good repairmen as well.</p>

<p>Iraq is no great power. It is part of the conflict thanks to its geographical location. Both the hated USA as well as Iraq's former ally, Russia, would like to turn Iraq into a pawn and use her to further their own interests. The Iraqi army is large, but suffers a shortage of modern equipment, and, in many cases, any equipment at all. What little it possesses dates back to an earlier epoch. Only in very isolated instances can it compare to what the Russians and Americans are using. Up until Desert Storm Iraq was one of the largest weapon buyers in the world. Back then, Iraq had a number of contacts to leading arms producers from Russia, Germany, France, Great Britain and the USA. After the war, there were still enough foreign companies willing to break the embargo for the right price. The strength of the Iraqi army lies in its incomparable fanaticism and pure hatred for the enemy (best example - the kamikaze units). Furthermore, the Iraqis know the terrain better than anybody, have implemented their camouflage perfectly, know how to locate oil reserves and quickly exploit them.</p>

<p>The USA is a leading economic and military power. However, in the game, the enemy units are a formidable match. The Russians have cheaper units which aren't as good. The Iraqis have developed camouflage nets which can be a pain when you don't have radar.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/World_War_III%7E_Black_Gold_5d8d.html" title="Edit section: Armed Units">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Armed Units</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>M1025A2 HMMWV</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic Unit in the US arensal. Fast and mobile, it can attack small enemy vehicles and unarmed vehicles. It can even provide a crude anti-air barrier. For better AA, you can build hummers equipped with FIM-92s or for long range bombing, use the mortar. It can even be a portable jammer with the electronic warfare device.</p>
<ul>
<li>M2 Bradley</li>
</ul>
<p>The infantry fighting vehicle of the US Army, these can be mass produced and sent to attack the enemy base from lakes/oceans. This tank should always be used in large numbers or sent in small numbers to scout. I would recommend the Camcopter or the Hummer to scout.</p>
<ul>
<li>M1A2 Abrams</li>
</ul>
<p>The backbone of the US Army, this tank packs enough firepower to take out a base. When used nicely, it will cause severe damage to the enemy. Can be equipped with FCR to extend the visibility range.</p>
<ul>
<li>AMX Leclerc</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most modernized tank in the game. Its automatic reload system allows it to rapidly punch shells into the enemy, turning them into useless scrap. It is also the only tank able to fire upon aircraft. The only drawback is that it is very expensive and cannot be massed. It can easily be used to take out small light armor divisions as for most shells bounce harmlessly off.</p>
<ul>
<li>M109 Paladin</li>
</ul>
<p>US slef-propelled, it packs a large punch to the enemy structures. If used effectively, it can even take out heavily armed units. The operators use sight to see their targets and attacks from extremely long range.</p>
<ul>
<li>MIM-104 Patriot</li>
</ul>
<p>The the anti-missile missile unit of the US, it is a mobile AM launcher. However, it requires power plants nearby to operate. It usually is a moving vehicle and when a missile is detected, it can be used into SEIGE mode to attack incoming missiles. Carries 4 Patriot missiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>AH-1 Cobra</li>
</ul>
<p>A light gunship, this helicopter can be used as a recon unit or massed up as a very effective AA unit capable of wrecking havoc onto the enemy lines and base. Very vulnerable to AA fire and will be shot down after taking 2-3 missiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>AH-64D Apache</li>
</ul>
<p>The most modernized helicopter, it packs the biggest and baddest missiles ever. Capable of using ATGMs to track and take out moving land targets (homes) or FFARs to take out non-moving structures. Is still vulnerable and can be shot down after taking 2-6 missiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>RAH-66 Comache</li>
</ul>
<p>The stealth heicopter, it cannot be detected unless a radar is nearby. It can use AGM and AGR missiles too but not as much capabilities as the AH-64.</p>

</ul>
<p>Plants and destroys enemy mines. Has no arms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering Unit (Challenger)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can be used to raise/lower the terrain, flatten/ roughen the ground and even build a wall around your base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camcopter</li>
</ul>
<p>The spy unit of the US, it is cheap to use and effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>UH-60 Blackhawk</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplies your troops with ammo by carrying it from the supply depot to the designated unit(s).</p>
<ul>
<li>CH47D Chinook</li>
</ul>
<p>Carries units over lakes/mountains. Can also air-bridge all units in an area to another area. Can also drop the unit (poor thing&#160;:() over another enemy to cause some splash damage.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pillbox</li>
</ul>
<p>Fires AGM missiles at incoming land targets wrecking havoc and chaos upon the enemy lines. Heavy armor makes it resistant to some of the most persistent attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turret</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the AA structure of the USA. Fires STINGER missiles at enemy air targets and shoots em down fast. Very vulnerable and can be destroyed by rockets/missiles/or just plain shell/MG fire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nest</li>
</ul>
<p>A classic barricade used for years, it is a MG mounted inside a lightly fortified structure. Good for light MG carrying units. Cannot withstand much fire. Can be massed to create a good effect and be placed next to enemy bases for siege effect.</p>
