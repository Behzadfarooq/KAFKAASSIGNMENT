<p>Impressive scholarship, ethics and technical expertise. Gives me some hope for the future. For a start, I hope against hope that Bush hangs his head in defeat tomorrow.

<p>Hi candidate blankfaze,</p>
<p>I have chosen to endorse your candidacy for the Arbitration Committee.</p>
<p>I think the best way to insure that your candidacy is successful, is to help to increase voter turnout.</p>
<p>One of the technical people on this site, who goes by the name Danny, helped me to make a very convenient tag that makes it super easy to place this "get out the vote" banner on your user page:</p>

<p>Please consider adding this tag to your user page, as a great many pages link to your user page.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance if you choose to help out. If there are any issues which prevent you from doing so, please let me know - I would be happy to make a custom version of this tag just for your page if that's what it takes for you to proudly display it.</p>
<p>If you choose to display this banner, please put the tag as near to the top as your aesthetic sense will permit.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>I fail to see how you can possibly be considered for an arbitration role when my experience of you is 1) that you revert articles without giving any reason, and 2) the articles in which you interfere are obviously something you are emotionally involved in, and as such should declare a conflict of interest, and leave arbitration in such cases to a neutral party. --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 11:29, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>The only instance I can recall in which ever coming into contact with you was about an hour ago, when I reverted your edit to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> - you changed "popular votes" to "votes". The edit was so ridiculous that I assumed it was vandalism and reverted without giving a reason. I apologise if that was mean to be a legitimate edit. However, in the United States, there are two kinds of votes - the popular vote and the electoral vote. It appeared to me that by removing the word "popular", you were attempting to infer that Bush somehow "stole" the Presidency (which I myself agree with, but HISTORY does not record it as such). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 11:57, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Blankfaze. I apologise. I completely was not aware that you had two different types of vote in the US. In the UK we have just one vote. What is the purpose of the popular vote please? Is this given at the same time as the vote to say which person they want to be president? When would someone give different answers for their popular vote and their other vote? What does one call the vote that isn't the popular vote? Thanks, --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 19:07, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rebroad: No worries, I apologise for treating you as a vandal. Let's put it behind us, I hate getting off on the wrong foot. The votes thing is sort of hard to explain but I'll give it a go. The U.S. Presidential election process is a bit BIZARRE:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the United States, Presidents are elected by a body called the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_College_1b27.html" title="Electoral College">Electoral College</a>. Each state has a number of electoral votes totalling its entire representation in Congress (i.e. number of Representatives to the House + number of Senators). Additionally, the federal District of Columbia (which has no representation in Congress) is alotted 3 electoral votes.</li>
<li>A state awards all of its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state (with the exception of two states who have the option to split their votes amongst different candidates).</li>
<li>There are 538 electoral votes (the total number of Representatives to the House (435) + the total number of Senators (100) + DC's three votes). A simple majority, or 270 electoral votes, is required to win the election.</li>
<li>The way the Electoral College works is: The different political parties select Electors who then pledge to give their votes to their party's candidate. Whichever party wins the state, those electors cast their vote for their candidate.</li>
<li>Thus under this system, it is possible for a candidate to lose the national popular vote, yet WIN the electoral vote (and such has happened three times in US history, most recently in 2000). This can happen if a candidate carries a number of states with high electoral vote counts, yet loses states with smaller electoral vote counts. For an example of this see <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2000_85ca.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2000">U.S. presidential election, 2000</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well I tried my best, but I don't know how well I did. The system was established in the Constitution and IMO it's bizarre and outdated. See <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Electoral_College_5364.html" title="U.S. Electoral College">U.S. Electoral College</a> for more information. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 22:43, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Blankfaze, thanks for your explanation. I think I understand how it works, and I suspect we have a similar system in the UK, where we have constituencies representing a seat in parliment. There can be a situation in the UK where the majority of the voters votes for one party, but the other party can end up getting the majority of the seats due to the varying sizes of the constituencies. Does this sound like a similar thing to what you have? We don't refer to people's votes as "popular votes" though, just "votes", so even if The Conservative party won, we could still say "The Labour party got more votes" and this wouldn't necessarily indicate any "foul play". Hope this makes sense! --<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebroad_730a.html" title="User:Rebroad">Rebroad</a> 10:22, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are a brave soul for trying to reorganize the Endorsements page yet again!</p>
<p>However, I support your "endorsement" and "disendorsement" dual-page edit. (Although I'm not so sure about the word "disendorsement" - my dictionary doesn't have that word - are you sure you wouldn't care to rename "disendorsement" to "opposition"?)</p>
<p>For my part in authoring this page, I will admit that it was starting to creak under its own weight.</p>
<p>Now that I can see the unified opposition on the "disendorsements" page, without a bunch of "support" entries interleaved that dilutes their overall effect, I think the opposition would do well to leave this new organization as is.</p>
<p>The problem I had with Michael Snow's subpage organization onto many user pages was that one would conceivably have to click through dozens of links to read everyone's comments.</p>
<p>You have only added one additional link, so it's still possible to read everyone's comments without getting out a compass to navigate your way around.</p>
<p>There is one caveat to making this change - if another candidate, whose listing was populated mostly with "oppose" entries, had made such an edit, it might have looked a bit unseemly.</p>
<p>Good luck. I think you will manage to do some good if you are elected onto the Arbitration Committee.</p>

<p>What exactly mean by "valid" information? That is a true news story, well then yes it is valid. Should that sort of US-centric news be on the front-page of wikipedia, definitiely not. Labelling me a vandal is not the sort of cool-headedness I expect from would-be arbitrators. The Dan Rather appears neither on BBC world news, or CNN international. I don't think the American community understands that outside of America he is <i>completely</i> unknown. Not only that, but his resignation is of no international significance whatsoever. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 13:10, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Right, and for the other 110 million people for whom English is a first language, and 350-1000 million for whom it is a second language, they will have never heard of this guy, and they never will.

<p>Blankfaze,</p>
<p>After reading the comments by Jimbo and many others (including you), I decided to remove all my disendorsements. Your response to my disendorsement would have seemed confusing if I would have left it in, so I removed your response as well. I'm not sure whether I should have done that or not – your response was fair and showed your acceptance of criticism, and you may have wanted it kept. Feel free to re-insert your comment, and you may re-insert mine if you wish – just strike it through if you do. Or you can leave it as is, which is my preference.</p>
<p>On a related note, I want you to know that my non-endorsement isn't mean as a disapproval of you or your editing. The way I see it, an arbitor is just a wiki-job, like tagging images or greeting newcomers. For an arbitor, the requirements for my endorsement are (1) to have proven they can admit when they're wrong (2) to have shown restraint in a situation where they could have made a snarky comment but didn't, and (3) to treat everyone – even trolls – with respect. Some of the people I endorsed, such as Neutrality and Theresa Knott, were borderline. Others who didn't make the cut, like you and Charles Matthews, were very close. You're a great admin, but I've seen you unable to resist taking a verbal swipe at an annoying user.

<li>I am grateful for your decision to remove disendorsements, not because of your sentiments against me, but because I feel disendorsements in such things, in general, are, as Jimbo stated, not what this community is about. As far as your criticism – I didn't take offence to it, it merely surprised me. But I suppose I understand what you mean. I promise you, however, that my fairness is uncompromised, even if I do take a swipe at a troll or a vandal every once in a while. I really truly want the best for this project, and if elected I will do my absolute best to make fair and unbiased decisions. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 22:11, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>IMO the <i>Jimbo's urge to not make them</i> and supported by the weight of him beeing the founder of Wikipedia is not appropriate.</p>
<ul>
<li>It not such a crucial issue. I can't find any such <b>strong</b> statement by Jimbo.</li>
<li>It casts bad light on those who allready made dis-endorsements, who may look as if they were disregarding organizers and Jimbo's recommendation. (Which was not the case, statement against dis/endorsements was made ex post.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Statement of organizers distandcing themselves from (dis)endorsements and explaining the page allready had been there when they made the statement is IMO fair and enough.</p>
<p>I hope you can rephrase it somehow - I dont want to simply revert it / start yet another useless dispute on endorsements talk. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimol_736e.html" title="User:Wikimol">Wikimol</a> 23:20, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's completely wrong if, as it seems to me, anyone is saying we can only have candidates praising themselves, and endorsers praising them, but no comments from opposers of candidates. Just the chance to vote. (In an "election" that's not even been mentioned on the front page and will probably be totally unknown to most of the quarter of a million Wikipedia users. And which has other faults too.) The candidates have already had an advantage given to them by censoring/moving "disendorsements", which has given them a headstart on people who oppose them. Imagine a presidential election where you can support the candidates but not campaign or speak against them. That's not democracy it's fascism.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 18:14, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed that your signature has been broken in many places where I have seen it over the last two days.</p>
<p>Is there a technical issue which is preventing your "sig" template from expanding reliably?</p>
<p>No big deal, but I was thinking about using one as well, and now I'm having second thoughts when I see your signature failing to expand correctly from the template in so many places.</p>

<li>I'm not sure, it mostly happens on this talk page and a few others. It seems kind-of random. It's kind-of annoying me. I may switch back to old style soon, I dunno. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 10:09, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This data point might interest you - I've noticed that on some very long pages, your signature is broken, but if I click the Edit button on a subsection where your signature appears, and then click Preview, your signature is then fixed! (As a matter of fact, the problem is exhibiting itself right here in this section.) When I earlier clicked Save on such a section (on another page), your signature then went back to being broken on the full page.<br />
This behavior indicates that there may be a problem with signature template expansion on pages over 32K in length? I'll test that theory out and get back to you if I find solid evidence that page size is the problem. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 11:19, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>The reason is, transcluded content (such as your sig subpage) can't be repeated more than five times on a page. Observe:</p>

<p>Hello. I used your user page as inspiration for how I wanted to lay out my user page. I've messed it up somehow. I don't know the markup and was trying to basically copy what you did and tweak it a little to personalize. Instead of occupying the right-hand part of the page, the Wikistress section stubbornly persists in staying below the main-body text section. The WP help pages I've looked at use a different markup than you used. If the problem is something simple, could you enlighten me? If it is a bit complicated, I would appreciate it if you could you point me to a page that explains how to use that particular markup. I'm willing to RTFM, if I can find it. &#160;:-) Thank you. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 09:15, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Friend,</b><br />
The Arbitration Committee elections are almost here. I humbly ask for your vote in this election cycle. I have been a user of Wikipedia for over a year. I was here before the Community Portal, categories, or &lt;tt&gt;{{stub}}&lt;/tt&gt;. I know how Wikipedia operates, and I am prepared to do my part to deal with problematic accounts. I wish to cut out the bureaucracy that makes our website stagnate. We need solutions to our problems now. If you want an arbitrator who believes in action, frankness, honesty, and fairness in every case, <i>I am your arbitrator</i>. Thank you for your time. You are under no obligation to answer this message.<br /></p>
