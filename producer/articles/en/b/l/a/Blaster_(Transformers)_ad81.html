<p>Blaster's transformation is a AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player, commonly referred to as a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boombox.html" title="Boombox">boombox</a> or <i>ghettoblaster</i>, hence the name. Blaster was a popular character from the original series while not featuring as prominently in the modern <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformers_Universe_efdf.html" title="Transformers Universe">Transformers Universe</a>.</p>
<p>The toy that was to become the Autobot Blaster was originally released as part of the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micro_Change_99f6.html" title="Micro Change">Micro Change</a> subset of the Japanese <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microman.html" title="Microman">Microman</a> series.

<p>Blaster, like the Autobot <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_%28Transformers%29_de41.html" title="Jazz (Transformers)">Jazz</a>, has a great love of Earth culture, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a> and other forms of music as long as it is "good, hard and loud". He's normally at the forefront of any given situation. As an AM/FM stereo cassette player, he can perform as a deck, plus receive radio signals on a variety of frequencies. Acting as the Autobot communications center, he can transmit signals within a 4,000 mile radius. Blaster also carries four cassette tape warriors within his deck (Steeljaw, Ramhorn, <a href="../../../r/e/w/Rewind_%28Transformers%29_41d9.html" title="Rewind (Transformers)">Rewind</a> and <a href="../../../e/j/e/Eject_%28Transformers%29_f22d.html" title="Eject (Transformers)">Eject</a>).</p>

<p>Blaster's first appearance was in episode 30, <i>Dinobot Island Part 1</i>. He had several important appearances in season 2, most notably in <i>Blaster Blues</i>, where his love of rock music and transmitting it to the other Autobots meant they were unable to respond to a Decepticon attack and prevent them from stealing a powerful decoder. He redeemed himself when he was able to transmit the location of the Decepticon base despite being captured.</p>
<p>In the episode <i>Prime Target</i> the big game hunter Lord Chumley captured a secret <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> jet, leading to panic of possibly war. Chumley then set his sights on the ultimate trophey, the head of <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. In order to lure Optimus in Chumley captured the Autobots <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracks_%28Transformers%29_9705.html" title="Tracks (Transformers)">Tracks</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_%28Transformers%29_cee6.html" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_%28Transformers%29_de41.html" title="Jazz (Transformers)">Jazz</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beachcomber_%28Transformers%29_ae92.html" title="Beachcomber (Transformers)">Beachcomber</a>, Blaster and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inferno_%28Transformers%29_fe31.html" title="Inferno (Transformers)">Inferno</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windcharger.html" title="Windcharger">Windcharger</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/f/Huffer_%28Transformers%29_6390.html" title="Huffer (Transformers)">Huffer</a> were able to avoid being trapped. When <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmos_%28Transformers%29_3cd8.html" title="Cosmos (Transformers)">Cosmos</a> learned of the location Chumley was keeping the captured Autobots Optimus Prime accepted Chumley's challange to meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrotrain.html" title="Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzwing.html" title="Blitzwing">Blitzwing</a>'s attempt to ally the Decepticons with Chumley, Optimus defeated the big game hunter and freed the Autobots. Chumley and the stolen jet were given over the the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions.</p>
<p>He also had a prominent role in <i>Auto-Bop</i>, where he faced off with his Decepticon counterpart <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundwave_%28Transformers%29_9a71.html" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a> in a sonic duel.</p>

<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Transformers%7E_The_Movie_6230.html" title="The Transformers: The Movie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></i>, set in the year 2005, Blaster was assigned to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_City_86ab.html" title="Autobot City">Autobot City</a> on Earth. During the invasion by <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron.html" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>'s forces, Blaster was responsible for sending a distress signal to <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> on Moonbase One. Blaster's transmission was jammed by <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundwave_%28Transformers%29_9a71.html" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a>'s cassette minions to prevent him from establishing contact with the Autobot Moonbase. However, the signal was received and Optimus Prime was able to arrive with reinforcements to defeat the Decepticons.</p>
<p>In episode 78, <i>Madman's Paradise</i>, Spike and Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Daniel got bored and wandered off. <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a> followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the Red Wizard's side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the Golden One. <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a>, Blaster, <a href="../../../e/j/e/Eject_%28Transformers%29_f22d.html" title="Eject (Transformers)">Eject</a>, Rewind, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramhorn.html" title="Ramhorn">Ramhorn</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steeljaw.html" title="Steeljaw">Steeljaw</a> followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard.

<p>Blaster was destroyed in the Japanese <a href="../../../h/e/a/The_Transformers%7E_Headmasters_a378.html" title="The Transformers: Headmasters">The Transformers: Headmasters</a> series during a fight with <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundwave_%28Transformers%29_9a71.html" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a> (who also perished in the fight) and rebuilt two episodes later as <b>Twincast</b>, with a blue/yellow color scheme as opposed to the red/yellow previously. His last appearance was in episode 4, <i>Operation Cassette</i>. The Twincast toy was recently re-issued by eHobby. Aside from the blue/yellow color scheme, the Twincast toy also differs from the Blaster/Broadcast toy in that the tape compartment can hold two cassette Transformers simultaneously.</p>

<p>Their luck didn't improve as they were attacked by <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron.html" title="Megatron">Megatron</a> and his troops on arrival, only being saved when Megatron decided to attack the Autobot bases instead. <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_Breaker_%28Transformers%29_2b30.html" title="Circuit Breaker (Transformers)">Circuit Breaker</a>, a super-powered human whose crippling in an attack by <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a> had left her with a pathological hatred of all Transformers, then attacked and defeated them, mounting their heads in <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapid_Anti-Robot_Attack_Team_ca18.html" title="Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team">Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team</a> headquarters. After capturing the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerialbot.html" title="Aerialbot">Aerialbots</a> as well a new problem arose - the Decepticon Battlechargers <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runabout_%28Transformers%29_18bb.html" title="Runabout (Transformers)">Runabout</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runamuck_%28Transformers%29_6381.html" title="Runamuck (Transformers)">Runamuck</a> had been causing mayhem all across America. Using the parts from all the captured Autobots she created a giant Autobot with herself in control, striking a deal with them that if they would co-operate she would let them go. Circuit Breaker then used them to oppose the two Decepticons, who were attacking the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Liberty_c55e.html" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. After defeating the Decepticons with Circuit Breaker the Autobots were released and rebuilt into their original forms.</p>
<p>After a brief side adventure in the UK comics, in which Blaster's group were attacked (and almost killed) by the insane future Decepticon <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvatron.html" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a>, Blaster and his men joined up with the main Autobots on Earth - just in time to witness the death of <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. Blaster would deliver the eulogy at his funeral, and was considered important enough that he was among the Autobots convened to choose Prime's successor. After an attack by the giant Decepticon <a href="../../../t/r/y/Trypticon.html" title="Trypticon">Trypticon</a>, the successor was chosen - <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a>. He would soon regret this. After a mission where their cover had been blown by the human the Mechanic, he and <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_%28Transformers%29_cee6.html" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Goldbug</a>, appalled by Grimlock's willingness to sacrifice humans to achieve their goals, deserted rather than face the wrath of the increasingly unstable <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinobots.html" title="Dinobots">Dinobot</a>.</p>
<p>After more adventures facing the Decepticon <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_Changer_8da5.html" title="Triple Changer">Triple Changers</a> and a plague of Scraplets, as well as facing off with a Decepticon strike force sent to destroy Galvatron and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Magnus_ca80.html" title="Ultra Magnus">Ultra Magnus</a>, Blaster (himself getting more callous) would be robbed of his ally when Goldbug and the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Throttlebot.html" title="Throttlebot">Throttlebots</a> when they were betrayed by humans and captured by RAAT. He was subsequently attacked by both the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Combaticons</a> and the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectobot.html" title="Protectobot">Protectobots</a>, who had been sent by Grimlock to arrest him. The two combiner teams battled, with Bruticus beating Defensor. With aid from some human children Blaster took out the giant Decepticon. As a reward, he locked Blast Off into his Decepticon shuttle mode and took them into space - only to be attacked by Grimlock and the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Ark_%28Transformers%29_7395.html" title="Ark (Transformers)">Ark</a>. Surrendering to save their lives, Blaster discovered he was not alone in his discontent, especially after Grimlock had tried to have the kids executed.</p>
<p>Events came to a head when <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortress_Maximus_22fd.html" title="Fortress Maximus">Fortress Maximus</a>'s group of Autobots linked up up with Grimlock's group, informing him that Prime had been resurrected via the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powermaster.html" title="Powermaster">Powermaster</a> process. Grimlock was not pleased, and it was quickly realized he had to be defeated. A freed Goldbug convinced Blaster to fight in Maximus' place. In the midst of their duel <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratbat.html" title="Ratbat">Ratbat</a>'s Decepticons attacked, and the two put aside ther differences to lead the Autobots to a partial victory. Prime soon returned and retook command, sending Blaster to investigate the Decepticon island resort Club Con, seemingly run by Buster Witwicky. Accompanying Buster's girlfried Jessie, he soon had his cover blown by the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seacons.html" title="Seacons">Seacons</a> and was forced to flee. Being displaced to an alternate limbo realm by the arrival of future Autobots to deal with Galvatron in the UK comics, Blaster was soon freed - only to be deactivated by the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underbase.html" title="Underbase">Underbase</a> powered <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starscream.html" title="Starscream">Starscream</a>.</p>
<p>This was not the end for Blaster - he was one of the Autobots revived by <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleon_%28Transformers%29_543c.html" title="Nucleon (Transformers)">Nucleon</a> by Grimlock and the other <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinobots.html" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a>. Returning to Cybertron, he battled against the coming of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>. After the betrayal of the Decepticons, the Autobots followed them to the planet Klo, were they were ambushed. Blaster was one of the few survivors - until he was blown apart by <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake_%28Transformers%29_6fbc.html" title="Quake (Transformers)">Quake</a>'s tank mode while <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prowl_%28Transformers%29_34e7.html" title="Prowl (Transformers)">Prowl</a> berated Grimlock for inept strategy. He was resurrected when Optimus Prime returned with the Last Autobot and routed the Decepticon forces.</p>
<p>The future Blaster from the Movie continuity would also appear in the UK comics, as one of the crew of Autobot city. <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcee.html" title="Arcee">Arcee</a>'s unintentional dereliction of duty allowed a <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quintessons.html" title="Quintessons">Quintesson</a> sneak attack to catch the city unawares, and Blaster was killed trying to radio for help. His body was later strung up by the Quintessons as a taunting gesture to the other Autobots. However he would still help his comrades from beyond the grave, allowing his cassettes Steeljaw, Eject and Ramhorn to assist in taking back the city.</p>

<p>Blaster was among the Autobot resistance during the age of interment, show in the third War Within series.</p>
<p>In the second Generation One mini-series from <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamwave_Productions_d154.html" title="Dreamwave Productions">Dreamwave Productions</a> Blaster was part of a resistance group led by <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Rod_%28Transformers%29_9776.html" title="Hot Rod (Transformers)">Hot Rod</a>. He accompanied <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> during his attack on Iacon.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaster_%28Transformers%29_ad81.html" title="Edit section: Transformers: Binaltech Asterisk">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transformers: Binaltech Asterisk</span></h2>
<p>In 2005, Takara launched a sub-line from the <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binaltech.html" title="Binaltech">Binaltech</a> series, called <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binaltech.html#List_of_Binaltech" title="Binaltech">Binaltech Asterisk</a>, which paired Binaltech characters with female co-pilots. The third figure in the line is called Broadblast. Although it is a radical change from Blaster's previous form, it is implied by the color highlights and the character's name (a combination of the US Blaster and Japanese Broadcast names), that this is Blaster's new form. He is paired with news reporter Lumina Hoshi. Broadblast is a silver repaint of Binaltech <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skids.html" title="Skids">Skids</a>, and does not have an equivalent in the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternators.html" title="Alternators">Alternators</a> line. Like Binaltech Skids, Broadblast is unusual among the Alternators/Binaltech toys, as he comes with a set of stickers which can be applied by the purchaser. The sticker set is similar to that supplied with Skids, but does not include Skids' characteristic red stripe stickers.</p>
