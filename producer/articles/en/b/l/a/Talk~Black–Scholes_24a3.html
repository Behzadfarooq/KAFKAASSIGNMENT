<p>The derivations refer to N() as the cumulative normal distribution function, but what is the mean and variance of this function? If the mean is zero and the variance unity (one), then the correct term would be "standard cumulative normal distribution" or "cumulative standard normal distribution."

<p>The derivation of the Black-Scholes PDE is wrong. If P=V-SdP/dS then dP=dV-dS(dP/dS)-Sd(dP/dS)-dSd(dP/dS) NOT dP=dV-S(dP/dS).</p>

<p>It completely miss understands all of the logic of option pricing theory --- specifically the arbitrage argument. See any book --- reall ANY book.</p>
<p>I'd simply erase the derivation, exept that I hope (and trust) that someone will take the time to fix it.</p>
<p>Now, in a moment of contrition... I know that someone took the time to write this and relied on the knowledge that he had. This is an honorable thing.</p>

<p>Let me add some remarks on the Black-Scholes theory. It seems to me, that the economists and even the authors of this excellent (LOL) article, are not aware of the complete physics behind it. Which I know only because I originate from the chair of Arnold Sommerfeld in Munic. Sommerfeld, being the first of the three great teachers in physics (the other two being R.P. Feynman and L.D. Landau, sorry I do not accept anybody else in this category) did some fundamental work on this theory in his books on electrodynamics and partial differential equations. Let me shortly summarize it: There are the fundamental symmetries of space and time (mathematically described by the invariance group of classical mechanics and special relativity) and associated with each one parameter subgroup is a conservation law (theory by Emmi Noether). Since conserved quantities cannot be created or destroyed, they can be transported only. To any conservation law there is a partial differential equation of the form of a transport equation, containing a first derivative of time. So it is a transport problem, and not a wave or a potential problem. Note that a first derivative of time is not invariant against time reflections. Therefore transport problems are not invariant in this sense, making them statistical phenomenons. The physics of the space time symmetries is: Charge conservation =&gt; Ohm's law, mass conservation =&gt; diffusion, time invariance =&gt; energy conservation =&gt; heat transport, momentum conservation =&gt; inner friction, conservation of center of gravity =&gt; I don' t know, conservation of angular momentum =&gt; phenomenons overlooked in physics. Many times in lectures on theoretical physics it is stated, that these are the (only) conservation laws and transport problems. Wrong, the Black Scholes Fischer theory comes in here. They deal with a partial differential equation of transport type, look at this article, and come up with a valuation theory for options (please note that the trivial valuation theory of options with premium and leverage has its benefits too). So we may reverse the above physical line of arguments, asking: What is the conservation law, leading to this partial differential equation of transport type? Answer is - I think it's clear - the conservation law behind Black Scholes is money! Which means the conservation of money. The limitations of Black Scholes therefore are the limitations of the conservation of money in an economy. But if there is a conservation law, inverting E. Noether, there must be a one parameter invariance group. Which group is it? Since E. Noether deals with transformation groups on space-time manifolds - what is that "space-time" for money. It seems to me that behind economics there is a completely unknown mathematical formulation, like behind physics there is a Newtonian, special and general relativistic formulation. One may ask at which state of physics is economics now. I think there is an economic Galilei, if Black Scholes and the physical conservation laws are united. And there is a economic Tycho Brahe. But no Kepler, no Newton yet. --Hannes Tilgner</p>

<p>While many of the ideas behind the Black-Scholes model are nearly universally accepted by practioners, I find the statement that <i>The use of the Black-Scholes formula is pervasive in the markets.</i> is somewhat hyperbolic. I have never, in my entire professional career, come across a trader using a simple Black-Scholes model to trade from. Doesn't happen. At least in the U.S. equity derivative markets, the interest rate derivative markets, the credit derivative markets, the FX option markets, etc. Am I missing something? Unless someone provides a counter-example, I'll rephrase.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, you miss nothing. Still... one does use the BS formula as a transformation to unify the strikes and maturities, via to one numbe "implied volitility"</dd>

Nor will any quant groups use BS. It's because you just need about one day to see that BS is too far off the market to use. Now, let me toss you a bone. There will be corp-fin guys and accountants who will "use" BS but they are "using it" to write reports to stock holders and the government.

Assume that X = ln(S/S0) is a normal random variable with mean μT and variance σ2T. It follows that the mean of S is E(S) = S0e^(rT)"</p>
<p>The correct result is E(S) = S0e^(mu T).</p>
<p>To avoid introducing the concept of risk-neutrality, one may derive the Black-Scholes formula with mu, then use put-call parity to find mu = r.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The formula E(S) = S0e^(rT) is correct by definition of r. That is what it says in plain English: that the formula is true "for some constant r (independent of T), which may be readily identified with the interest rate" (which you did not choose to quote). The formula E(S) = S0e^(mu T) is not correct because r is not equal to mu. mu does not mean what you think it means. Its meaning is clearly explained: "Assume that X = ln(S/S0) is a normal random variable with mean μT and variance σ2T" (which you did quote). To find the correct formula for r follow the instructions: "use the corollary to the lemma to verify the statement above about the mean of S".—Zophar 16:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we change the name of this article to Black-Scholes-Merton. We could have Black-Scholes redirect to this.

<dd>I would vote against. Predominant usage remains <i>Black-Scholes</i>, it should take more than one cite in a text book to change this. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonnotel_7468.html" title="User:Ronnotel">Ronnotel</a> 20:29, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the EMH reference. The Black-Scholes model does not require the EMH. It requires (completeness and) absence of arbitrage which is much a weaker condition than efficiency. No-arbitrage requires that is not possible to make a guaranteed profit. Efficiency requires that is not possible to make a profit on average (compared to some risk-adjusted benchmark).</p>
<p>Most obviously, B-S can still be used in cases where there is strong mean-reversion.</p>

<p>Sorry, I had to remove Kruglov's article in Derivation and Solution parts. I won't discuss its technical merits, but it simply doesn't sound right in Financial part. Consider the first paragraph in Concept of Arbitrage part: "Concept of arbitrage says that when the future price of investment asset is unknown it is assumed that the price of asset today with its delivery in the future is determined by some other asset whose future price is deterministic." This is an unusual definition. -- Argyn <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.204.133.208_318d.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.204.133.208">198.204.133.208</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/User_talk%7E198.204.133.208.html" title="User talk:198.204.133.208">talk</a>) 15:59, 6 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I reverted a couple of changes. In the introductory paragraph, "The fundamental insight of Black and Scholes is that the option is implicitly priced if the stock is traded" had ben changed to "The fundamental insight of Black and Scholes is that the option is implicitly priced if the stock is traded, and that for the purposes of calculating the price of the option, the return on the stock, which is unknown, can be replaced with the <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk-free_rate.html" title="Risk-free rate">risk-free rate</a>." This seems unnecessary detail for the introductory paragraph. Additionally, if we were to have details about the model here, it is perhaps more surprising (to people unfamiliar with the subject) that we need to know the volatility than that we don't need to know to the drift.</p>
<p>Secondly, this SDE, which seems to have unnecessary prominence, even if it was necessary for it to be included:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/c/1/9c12e2489c52d7501e1e38cac82d7cf5.png" alt="dS_t = r S_t\,dt + \sigma S_t\,dW_t \," /></dd>
</dl>
<p>In order to make sense of this equation, one needs to understand both the PDE approach, and the risk-neutral / equivalent martingale measure approach (the measure under which this SDE is valid). I think it is easier to present the PDE and EMM approaches seperately, in the hope that people who struggle with one may find the other more comprehensible. In view of the EMM background required for this formulation, I'd be surprised if it was commonly used - does the author have cites for it? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardLockhart_8d1d.html" title="User:EdwardLockhart">EdwardLockhart</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EdwardLockhart_f1f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/EdwardLockhart">contribs</a>) 05:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
