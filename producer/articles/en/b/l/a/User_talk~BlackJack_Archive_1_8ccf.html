<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biography of statisticians</span></h2>
<p>Jack, if you have time to spare after these projects, it would be great if you could write any biographies of cricket statisticians and historians. At the moment, only <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Frindall_38bf.html" title="Bill Frindall">Frindall</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Frith_eb28.html" title="David Frith">Frith</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Ferguson_84f1.html" title="Bill Ferguson">Ferguson</a> have atleast a few lines about them. Haygarth, Ashley-Cooper and Sir Home Gordon (and Rowland Bowen too&#160;? not sure) have decent obits in Wisden. About the rest, there is nothing available. It would be most useful if you could do something on these lines. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 10:10, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Reply on Tintin's page</b></p>
<p>Hello, Tintin. Yes, that's a good idea. I have quite a bit of biographical material re the likes of Haygarth, Waghorn, Ashley-Cooper and others though nothing at all re G B Buckley, who to me is the mystery man of cricket writing!!</p>
<p>I'll add it to my list of things to do and I'll start off a few stubs in due course.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>

I was going to add it back, but I figured I'd see what your reason for erasing it was.

<p>The new article titles here are <i>really</i> unfortunate. Someone stumbling upon one of these articles (as I did from New pages) will have absolutely no clue that they have anything to do with postal authorities (my first guess on <a href="../../../s/a/a/Saar_-_Saxony_3700.html" title="Saar - Saxony">Saar - Saxony</a> was that it might be on a town called Saar in Saxony). Please consider moving them back (but take the opportunity to get rid of the capital A in "Postal Authorities:", there's no point in that). If the list in the category is an issue, why not just <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html#Category_sorting" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">pipelink the categorizations</a>? -- <a href="../../../j/a/o/User%7EJao_0764.html" title="User:Jao">Jao</a> 12:08, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll consider it after I've uploaded the rest of the pages. It might be better to suffix each title with something like (Philately) to prevent confusion with other topics but I am keen to have a proper A-Z structure, otherwise everything will be under "P". Thanks anyway. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 18:33, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the reply. Now, the entire point with pipelinking the categorizations is that everything doesn't have to be under P just because the articles start with P. This situation is exactly what the method was devised for. Please have a look at the link above to see how it's done (it's really simple). -- <a href="../../../j/a/o/User%7EJao_0764.html" title="User:Jao">Jao</a> 19:09, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Stumbling on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain_-_Szeged_f793.html" title="Spain - Szeged">Spain - Szeged</a> on the New pages list, and not understanding anything until I checked "What links here", I was going to write something similar to the above. I absolutely agree with Jao that your title scheme does not work. Please remember that your articles might be found by people not familliar with the context, e.g. through clicking "Random article". Also, I don't think renaming this article Spain - Szeged (philately), as you seem to suggest above, would be the best solution. An appropriate title would rather be something along the lines of List of postage stamp issuers (Sp-Sz) or possibly List of postal authorities (Sp-Sz). (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28precision%29_9b4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Naming_conventions" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Naming conventions</a> offers some useful general advice on article naming.)</p>
<p>To further clarify what the articles are about, I think it would be appropriate to have a one- or two-sentence lead (supposedly, the same text for all the lists) explaining what the article is about.</p>
<p>Note that in order to sort List of postage stamp issuers (Sp-Sz) under "Sp" in the category you use the following in the text of the articles:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[[Category:Micro entries for all known postage stamp issuers|Spain]]</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is what is meant by "piplinking the categorizations" above.</p>
<p>While we're on the topic of categories... Please also consider renaming the category Category:Lists of postage stamp issuers or simply Category:Postage stamp issuers. That would make it fit better with Wikipedia's general naming practice for categories - mainly, to keep them concise. "all known" is definitely unneccessary, and it seems as if "Lists" describe the articles better than "Micro entries". / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 22:15, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for answering. I promise to have some patience, but I hope to see you revisiting the issue as soon as possible. As for the term "list", I don't think that it demeans your work in any way, I just find it an appropriate description of the articles as they stand. Although each entry may contain a lot of information, and link to other entries, the <i>article</i> is still an <i>alphabethically ordered list of entries</i>. (Since Wikipedia is not paper, it might even be a good idea to break up the lists, making all the entries into separate articles. But I guess that is a long-term project.) But I might not understand the subject properly, since I don't know much about philately. But in case you're not happy with my title suggestions, what kind of titles do you think would best describe the articles and their category? / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 22:54, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
This has all been done now. I decided that their advice about pipelinking was the best solution and used the naming convention suggested by Alarm. (Sp-Sz) makes more sense than (Spain-Szeged) because there is always the possibility that an earlier Sp or a later Sz might need to be added. The only thing I can't agree about is the use of "list" but I think this is because, being English, I have a different concept of this word than Alarm has. I have chosen "compendium" which is the appropriate English word for a work of this kind. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 08:17, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cricket bat</span></h2>
<p>Ah, well, the picci was uploaded by SmokeDog, but I think it's an interesting (although not a good) one. The shape of the bat has changed as the game has changed. Of course, in the period about which you are writing, all bowling was underarm, pitches were poor, wickets were lower than nowadays (and with two stumps) and batsmen had no pads. So you needed a bat for low-down play, and needed to play away from your legs (as you probably know, there was no lbw rule as no-one would be looking to put their legs in the way of the ball). I do find the old (say pre-1850 or so) history of cricket very interesting, and look forward to your future contributions in the area, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:16, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments on the template. Hopefully it will be a useful navigation tool and encourage more readers to your articles too. I also need to tip you the wink on the Wikipedia Players of the Season. Wikipedia policy requires that we report on things neutrally, which means we do not take a position ourselves. We shouldn't even say Don Bradman is the greatest ever batsman or Garry Sobers is the greatest ever allrounder. Instead we just report what others say. So we can report on Wisden Cricketers of the Year, and we can say X, Y and Z have said Don Bradman is the greatest ever batsman, but we do not say that WP says Bradman was the greatest. I don't want to lose your useful text about the early cricketers, so I have just removed the heading. In a way, it's just a game to get into WP style - just list what others have said are the most notable cricketers of the year rather than say that WP thinks they are notable.

<p>&gt;&gt; If you are unhappy with the use of the term first-class cricket in connection with 18th Century cricket, I would suggest you change "first-class" to "major" or even "top-class" so that the terminology is vague without losing the impact. I would have no problem with that at all.</p>

<p>You removed Dickie Jeeps and Johnny Wardle from the famous players list at Cambridgeshire. Jeeps was England rugby union captain for several years across the 1950s, so maybe you're right in that he's famous for reasons other than cricket. But Wardle played 28 Tests for England and caused arguably the biggest ruckus ever in Yorkshire cricket (probably surpassing Master Geoffrey). Surely he qualifies as famous for cricketing deeds. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 15:07, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. I sort of agree about Jeeps, but it's a shame if there's no record that he played (fairly) high standard cricket. Maybe we should start a List of people famous in other fields who also played cricket, starting with Samuel Beckett and Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and then I could slip Jeeps in without anyone minding. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 22:09, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Jack: what was wrong with that category? It is a factual award - currently there's only three people who has won it, but it'll probably increase by 1 each year. Doesn't detract from the Cricketer of the Year, either, as that's something different. Oh, and please don't "orphan" categories that you've made redundant - having empty categories nowhere in the categorisation system without them actually being deleted just confuses people.

<dd>OK, fair enough to me. And I agree on most of what you're doing. If you want a delete, though, you should really request the delete before removing all articles in it - since the closing administrator will do that job - but if you're sure what you're doing I guess it's ok to remove and then request delete, as it's a cumbersome process. Please use an edit summary when you do so, though - it's tiresome but it helps people see what you're doing. (As another note to help you, if you haven't seen them already, the categories with Category:Cricketers at the 1999 World Cup and similar really ought to either get its ODI cricketer category removed (since they're already in the subcategory) or be deleted). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 22:39, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have just added the category <i>International cricket competitions</i> to Bombay Pentangular. But it is a domestic championship. AFAIK, the occasional English cricketer (Rhodes, Hirst, Larwood etc) took part in it because they were already in India on other business (usually on invitation of one or the other Maharaja to coach or play for him). <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 04:45, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not really. Deletion is to be centralised because it's such an important part of the encyclopedia, apparently. I will note, however, that people voting on CFD are more likely to be convinced when the project is speaking with one single vote, preferably with some link to the discussion that has gone before. In the case of the categories that were nominated on June 24, it probably went through a bit too quickly, with removal of the categories and so on (as you may have noticed already), and several people within the project as well have voiced their concerns. So I think the best course of action right now is to leave things to simmer for a little bit, let people come up with comments on the cricket project talk page, draw up some kind of structure for the categories, and THEN go to CFD to do the cleanup work. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 12:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Jack. Among all your good works, you've amended the cricket style section on WP Cricket to suggest seasons that cross years should be referred to as 2005-2006, rather than 2005-06. I don't agree with this, and have put it up for discussion on the project discussion page. The convention in cricket outside Wikipedia is for 2005-06, and that is true of other sports such as soccer and rugby too. Anyway, I'm happy to abide by the consensus, but my vote would be for no change. Should we, by the way, indicate on the project page that this is up for debate? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 08:17, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually my primary interest is in stub sorting, with a secondary interest in CFD which I visit only on those days that I've nominated a category for renaming or renomination, or come across a renomination while doing a renomination. While removing articles before or during a nomination on either CFD or SFD is considered bad form because it makes a category or stub type look unpopulated when in fact there are articles that could make use of it, this is the first time I've heard anyone even suggest that adding existing articles that fit a stub type or category is bad form. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caerwhine</small></a> 16:07, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
