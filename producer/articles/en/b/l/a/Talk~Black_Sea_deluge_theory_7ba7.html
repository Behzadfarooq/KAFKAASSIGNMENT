<p>I did some major editing, because this article was not up-to-date. I see this as work in progress, to which I intend to contribute more information. Perhaps we can get the quality up to a level where it can be the feature article again. PH 2006-12-23</p>

<p><a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a>: Despite what <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">user:DreamGuy</a> says, this is not <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_science.html" title="Pop science">pop science</a>, unless he would care to clarify that term. I don't think it has ever been bad if good science is popular. There is good science here. I don't know if this flood is exactly the Genesis flood and we may never know. I think it is clear that it "might be", because the flood did happen, there were people there, the dispersion of the myths, and other factors.</p>
<p>Perhaps together we can work some things out here (below) before editing the page. Edit these items directly as need be, and try to keep the framework consistent.</p>
<p>RPT = Ryan-Pitman Theory. Or call it BSDT.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Actually, the concept that this flooding explains the myths of a world-covering flood in the cultures of many people (and the twists they turn to their science to try to support this foundation) very much so is <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_science.html" title="Pop science">pop science</a>, and simply looking at the wikipedia article explaining the term shows that it clearly is. It's a sensationalized topic full of hype that is far more famous than other science for the reason that it's proponents package it for popular entertainment media. Look at the title of their book, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think it's pop science at some of its worst. I've asked the people who forwarded me links on the current scientific opinion disputing this theory to see if they could find them again, as i haven't been able to turn them up in the last 24 hours. (Why is that? Because a search on the topic finds all the pop science references in USA Today that are full of fluff but no science.) I already found a couple of short references, but I'm looking for the big fully detailed ones I had before. Hopefully I'll have those fairly soon and I can start adding the con side so we can have NPOV on this thing instead of just the happy go lucky makes a good soundbite stuff.</p>

<p>Which points are agreed and which are disputed?</p>
<p>TF (flood). There was a Black Sea flood 5600 BCE (Ryan-Pitman dating).</p>
<p>TPD (people displaced). People were living by the lake shore and were displaced by the flood.</p>
<p>TS (spread). These people spread out and were the source of the myths, including the Genesis myth.</p>
<p>TG. The Genesis myth comes from the Gilgamesh myth</p>

<p>P0. <i>Nat. Geo.</i>: In our last dispatch of July 21, 1999, we reported that Ballard and team dredged the Black Sea floor and hauled up shells and other detritus. During the intervening months, the samples were tested and dated. The following conclusions were announced by Ballard at the headquarters of the National Geographic Society. NG.</p>
<p>P1. “Nine distinct species of mollusks were identified by Gary Rosenberg of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia. Seven of the species are saltwater mollusks; the other two are extinct freshwater mollusks, similar to species found today in the freshwater Caspian Sea.” NG.</p>
<p>P2. Samples of each shell species were radiocarbon—dated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. It found that the saltwater species ranged in age from 2,800 to 6,820 years. The freshwater species ranged from 7,460 to 15,500 years. These tests support the theory that the Black Sea was a freshwater lake until it was flooded by the Mediterranean Sea about 7,000 years ago. The tests suggest the inundation of the Black Sea occurred between 6,820 and 7,460 years ago. NG</p>
<p>P3. Among the shells his team collected in 1999 was a piece of obsidian "that had no business being there," indicating, Ballard said, "the possibility of human presence on the ancient beach.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's rather circumstantial. I could throw a tire iron into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. 10,000 years from now, someone could salvage it and say, "hey, this isn't supposed to be here; the Atlantic seabed must have been completely dry around 10,000 years ago."--Acefox 30 June 2005 19:27 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may be circumstantial, but it is also more valid than your analogy would be given that boats and barges are going over the atlantic all the time, many of which carry cars and people who might have a tire iron and be willing to toss one in. That was far less likely to be the case with a person 7,000 years ago and a piece of obsidian. Ballard's reasoning is perfectly valid, and he was nice enough to include the word "possibly" so as not to appear to be making an invalid statement of certainty. In other words, Ballard was taking into account the possibility that the obsidian got there by other means, though that possibility may be less likely than the possibility of human presence on an ancient beach.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>P4. Ballard is a believer. He says the 1999 expedition is “a complete success. We were able to document the existence of an ancient shoreline exactly where Ryan and Pitman said it would be.” NG -- end <i>Nat. Geo</i>.</p>
<p>P5. Pitman and Ryan estimated that the shoreline of the flooded lake today would lay at a depth of about 155 meters (510 feet) below the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>P6. Ballard and his team of experts zigzagged back and forth across the area, pinpointing the region of this ancient shoreline using the ship’s echo sounder and global positioning system (GPS) navigation. Pointing at a sonar display on the ship’s computer monitor, Ballard painted a picture of the Black Sea floor. As the sonar image of the sea floor scrolled by, he described the flat plain in view, extending outward from the present coastline to a distance of about 20 nautical miles (37 kilometers). As the image continued to scroll, the curve of a coastline became apparent. Ballard also theorizes that a river fed the lake. NG.</p>
<p>P7. The samples were found below the berm of the coast—the highest place on shore that the gnawing action of waves can reach. Says Ballard, “There was a flood. Absolutely. I’m convinced of it. Now we’ve got to take it to the next level. We’ve got to find evidence of human settlement.” <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/blacksea/8.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/blacksea/8.html" rel="nofollow">NG99-8</a></p>
<p>P8. Ballard found: well-preserved artefacts including carved wooden beams, wooden branches and stone tools. He also said he located a collapsed structure ‘clearly built by humans’ in a former river valley beneath the sea. (AiG3)</p>

<p>C1. AiG believes Noah's flood should be dated 2300 (2348) BC.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Who cares? AiG is from a religious perspective. It can't be a "Con Point" if it's not admissible evidence.--Acefox 30 June 2005 19:35 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>C2. Ref. GSA says (paraphrased): new geological investigations (seismic surveys, drill cores, radiocarbon dating and fossil studies) in the Marmara Sea, especially the exit delta, show that water has always flowed south from the Black Sea and not north as required by Ryan and Pitman’s hypothesis.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This finding isn't absolute (as most analyses aren't). Besides if you read the book by Ryan and Pitman, you will understand that what they claim is that there are two currents in the Black Sea. An upper one flowing south, and a lower (more ancient) one flowing north. They also give some rather strange and interesting historical accounts of this. Read the book, it's quite interesting.--Acefox 30 June 2005 19:35 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>C3. The Biblical Authority Argument: Bible says a) Flood worldwide, b) Flood above highest mountains, c) 40 days of rain. None of these points are supported by RPT (AiG3).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again religious arguments are hardly admissible as evidence.--Acefox 30 June 2005 19:35 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>C4. AiG3 points to Native American and Australian aboriginal flood myths.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More speculation purely on guesswork and biased judgement. There is no geologic evidence that the entire world was simultaneously flooded or even a whole continent for that matter. I would think even the Pope understands this.--Acefox 30 June 2005 19:35 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is far more likely that the Native American and aboriginal flood myth has the same origins as the genesis flood myth. The Native Americans and Aboriginies were most likely among the group dispersed by the black sea flood, or they integrated groups of people who were dispersed by the black sea flood. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.63.93.196_0048.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.63.93.196">69.63.93.196</a> (talk) 16:47, 6 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Hu: The AiG agrees with TF (flood). But they disagree that it is the source of the Genesis story (TS). Their page seems to have a bottom line: "God said it. God doesn't lie." The second AiG page (AiG2) muddies the waters (sorry, couldn't resist) by waffling on TF and by saying that the flood would have been 1650 BCE, if at all, which would put it into historic times and make it easier to dispute. AiG3 dates are squarely in historic times (see N1). Why didn't the Egyptians write about an ice age? AiG3 accepts TPD (people displaced).</p>
<p>I don't see why the existence of Native American/Australian Aboriginal flood myths would necessarily have any bearing on where the <i>Genesis</i> flood myth comes from; the three cultures had no contact with each other. They could well have had their own local dramatic floods (and in fact <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deluge_%28prehistoric%29.html" title="Deluge (prehistoric)">Deluge (prehistoric)</a> has candidates for each), or they may have made them up without a historical basis, or whatever - it doesn't matter. The issue here is only one of whether this particular local flood occurred, and if it did, whether it coincided with the start of this particular local myth. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 17:46, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know (or care) what the religious-based critics claim (as the AiG people appear to be and the only critics Hu looked at), but the point as I see it here is that the Australian and Native American flood myths expose the fatal flaw in the entire assumption behind the RPT: There were myths about a cataclysmic flood, so there must have been a real world cataclysmic flood they were based on. This is silly. Myths don't form that way. You might as well be arguing that because there's a wide-spread death of a religious leader dying, returning, and then getting eaten by people to commemorate it that someone really did return from the dead and then got cannibalized. It's this pop science fascination with overly dramatic explanations for things that have mundane well-established explanations already. Flood myths came from cultures that lived on flood plains. Cultures that aren't on flood plains don't have flood myths. It's pretty much that simple. What Ryan and Pitman appear to have done is look at very ambiguous information on flooding that appears to have been gradual and then assumed it must have been fast so they could explain the myth. Then Ballard came along and found some wood and declared against all common sense that it was a city. It's pure hype with no susbtance.</p>
<p>And I'm slowly pulling together the scientific criticism against RPT. It's too bad they didn;t get just as much publicity in the popular media, as it'd be easier to get at all of it and maybe people wouldn't be so in love with this story. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 07:47, Nov 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good edits, I'm still trying to dig up all the alternate scientific viewpoints on this. From talking with many in the field, a lot of the rebuttals are still awaiting publication. One major critic that I'll work into the article at some point is archeologist (and noted author) Brian Fagan, who seens to be the most outspoken critic. He claims something along the lines that no scientists take the theory (that the Black Sea incident caused the Noah's Flood myth) seriously. I'm hoping to find something from him a little more usable than that for the article. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 18:47, Nov 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I changed the name of the external link from creationist to biblical fundamentalist, though I'm wondering if this external link should be there. It doesn't seem very useful. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrice_398c.html" title="User:Grice">Grice</a> 22:46, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, bear in mind that the question of whether this flood was the basis for the Biblical flood story or not is a separate issue from whether the Black Sea flood actually <i>happened</i>. It's quite possible for there to be plenty of scientists that take the flood theory itself seriously even if they don't think it's connected to the myth. Be careful not to link those two opinions too closely. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:33, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ahem...Those who quickly apply the "fundamentalist" label are generally giving warning of fuzzy thinking. Take another look at the page y'all are calling fundamentalist. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 01:45, Nov 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The referenced page does address Biblical Literalist interpretations, but does not in and of itself present a christian or fundamentalist point of view. I think that a neutral title should be used. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 06:35, 2004 Nov 27 (UTC)</p>

Secondly, Biblical literalism should be linked to an article, or done more specificly (ex. is this a Catholic position, an Eastern Orthodox position, Nestorian, one of the Protestant sects?), since as it is, it smacks of weasel wordism like a number of phrases used in this article. Thirdly, it is not at all clear what "non-deist science" means- looking at the <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deism.html" title="Deism">Deism</a> article doesn't help, since Deism is sort of belief in God based on natural and empirical evidence popular among the intelligentsia back in the 1700s and 1800s- would non-Deist science refer to belief in God on irrational, non-empirical grounds, and science conducted accordingly? But this presupposes a particular religion's irrational beliefs, and so would at the least need further qualifiers (ie. science conducted within the strictures of Confucian belief would come to different conclusions than such science done by a Muslism or Buddhist). If this is trying to say "science which does not presuppose the tenets of any particular religion", then what is meant is usually phrased similarly to "secular science", and is usually considered redundant; scientists can be religious, and see their science as furthering particular religion (see the work of the physicist <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_J._Tipler_310c.html" title="Frank J. Tipler">Tipler</a>), but science itself is not usually thought to be relgious/a religion itself. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">Contribs</a> 18:06, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would have predicted, blindly, that there would be theories about Atlantis, Proto-Indo-Europeans and Noah. That's just the noise that will automatically surround any discussion of events in that very rough area, at that very rough time. The Atlantis stuff is by economic scientists with a penchant for ancient history. The PIE assertions were not sourced; I'm cleaning up so this article can remain focussed on the actual <i>geological</i> debate. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:51, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be a date discrepancy in the first paragraph, either that or I am reading the article wrong. The chronology seems to be about 2500 years off.</p>
