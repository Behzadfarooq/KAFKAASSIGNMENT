<p>Hi, and thanks for running for the ArbCom and taking questions here. I'm considering my vote, and I read your statement. I have a question for you: what is your opinion of the Three Reverts Rule? What would you recommend as punishment for breaking the rule? How about for breaking it repeatedly, over a number of articles? Thanks again. - <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScooter_ac1d.html" title="User:Scooter">Scooter</a> 23:22, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi! Thanks for considering me, and thanks for asking. Well, if you weren't aware, a <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree_revert_rule_enforcement_20b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Three revert rule enforcement">new policy</a> recently passed a public vote and went into effect allowing sysops to temporarily block (for up to 24 hours) those who break the Three Revert Rule. That's the punishment I support, as it is the one accepted by a majority of the community. As far as repeated breaking of the 3RR, depending on the level of repetition and the time period over which they occured, I would perhaps support limiting a user's reverts (i.e. allowing them to be blocked for 2 or 1 reverts) as has been done in past cases. If a user significantly violates a punishment on that, I would perhaps even support banning them. While we should allow for reform of problem users, when it becomes apparent that they have no interest in doing anything other than causing problems, then we shouldn't waste our time with them. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><small>BLANKFAZE</small></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">(что??)</a> 23:35, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<p>I'm all for it (I'm assuming this means I can post on your Talk: page again).

<ul>
<li>Sure, I'd like to bury any hatchets, be civil, assume good faith, etc. I'm quite open to anti-Israel POVs, so long as they're properly sourced, and balanced with properly sourced opposing POVs. I'm fairly certain that's what NPOV is all about, and I think the record of my edits, when you examine it, is pretty much in line with that; if I've warred, it's been against POV warriors. Anyway, I'm glad we worked this out. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 05:15, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Heya, seeing as you're one of the editors who's been hard at work trying to improve our deletion system, I wonder if you could have a look at my proposal. It still needs some fleshing out, so I'm not quite moving it into <i>Wikipedia:</i> or announcing it officially yet (it's hard enough to get people to eyeball these proposals once, I'd rather they do so when it's done), but I would like to get some comments from other people working with the current deletion system. Feel free to edit to your hearts content, as long as you leave the general idea behind it intact.

<p>Of course Blankfaze, there's no need to remind me. As with all Wikipedia policies, I take the three revert rule quite seriously now, since it has become an official policy. I assume you take it seriously now as well. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 06:16, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've always taken it seriously. I consider it one of our most important policies and I've only broken it perhaps three times in my entire tenure here, and those times were necessary in my opinion. They were before we had procedures developed to curb edit-warring. Anyhow, I'm aware you take it seriously, but when I happen to notice edit wars, I generally notify people when they are getting close, so that if they have to be blocked, they can't say they weren't warned. Just a precaution. If it makes any difference, you should know it was nothing against you; I actually agree with your edit in this case. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><small>BLANKFAZE</small></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze">(что??)</a> 06:24, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just got that, sorry, everything I put in just gets reverted. The letter by Chris Patten deserves a mention, and t would be stupid not to, but it gets reverted, and the 'talk' page is ignored. --Is Mise le Méas, Irishpunktom 01:09, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, he reverted 4x and I put the links on your talk page, including what he reverted to each time. And it was actually 5x if you include the original revert under his ip. I actually did post Talk on Arafat a few days ago to dialogue with him about which edits of his edits I agreed with and which I disagreed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3AYasser_Arafat&amp;diff=8685336&amp;oldid=8684261" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3AYasser_Arafat&amp;diff=8685336&amp;oldid=8684261" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, and I made changes here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Yasser_Arafat&amp;diff=8693843&amp;oldid=8683385" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Yasser_Arafat&amp;diff=8693843&amp;oldid=8683385" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<li>It is clearly 5 reverts, and if you exclude his edits as an IP, 4 reverts. He keeps reverting his own material in, and taking other material out.

<p>In answer to your question on my talk page, I'm copying my answer here (thank you for asking, btw. That means something to me):</p>
<p>The way you blew me off when I sought your help with a situation was frustrating, and I'm not sure your manner will be very helpful in diffusing mediation situations. For that reason, I withdrew support. I'm not opposing, I just don't presently feel I can extend that extra boost of endorsement, based on my experience so far with you. That said, I'm sure I was too impatient with the editor I brought to your attention for 3RR. However, that will be the reality of mediation situations, people will come to you in heated situations, much more worked up than I was I'm sure. Let me ask you then, what will be your basic strategy in trying to bring frustrated parties to resolution? --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel">MPerel</a> 16:53, Dec 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>All due respect, I did not blow you off. I politely explained (or so I thought) that I simply decided I'd rather not get involved in that particluar situation. That said - My basic strategy in mediation is simple - I intend to encourage the parties to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> and consider the merits of one another and their contributions, and hopefully by extension the possibility that the other party has something good to offer. I find oftentimes disputes are caused and then exacerbated by the refusal of one or both parties to assume good faith. I intend to remind parties that Wikipedia is a freely-editable, community project, and as such, no one person owns any article; you have to allow and accept other people's contributions sometimes. I think when an editor puts a lot of hard work into an article they get perfectionisty and lose sight of that. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankfaze_d3eb.html" title="User:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size: 74%;">BLANKFAZE</b></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankfaze_e367.html" title="User talk:Blankfaze"><b style="font-size:90%;">(что</b><b style="font-size:70%;">??</b><b style="font-size:90%;">)</b></a> 20:56, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for your vote. But you must have misread my request: I am not "intolerant" of British spelling, though in my earlier months that was how I seemed to come through as. After late September this attitude gradually diminished in my editing, since now I prefer to use alternative constructions to avoid the biases of either American or British spelling habits.</p>
