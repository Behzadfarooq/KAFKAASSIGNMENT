<p>Could you take a look at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Chalukyas_a768.html" title="Western Chalukyas">Western Chalukyas</a>? I was copy editing it and the footnotes suddenly became junk.

<dd>Nevermind -- I managed to find what the vandal did and fix it without undoing intermediate edits. And the Fred guy banned him. Plus Dinesh was happy. So, O.K. for now.

<p>It has been drawn to my attention that the word <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongrel.html" title="Mongrel">Mongrel</a> in Wp itself is defined as "For humans (often an insult); a mixed-race individual", Although it indicates that its use can be insulting it does not indicate that usage is racist. This is consistent with definitions in most non-US disctionaries that I have consulted and in US dictionaries the flagging as racist is recent.</p>
<p>I also draw your attention to the quotation from Zackary in the Mongrel article which indicates that the usage can in fact be positive.</p>
<p>Absent any other evidence that you can produce that my use of the term in relation to Pauline Hansen was racist in intent I ask that you withdraw your accusation as unfounded and to me personally hurtful (see previous emails on this). <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 12:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This term is usually used by non-indigenous males in respect of indigenous females in "colonial" situations. As such it does not find its way into print. That is whilst there are dictionaries of English slang etc. and the slang finds its way into other books and articles and can be cited, this term is used in circumstances which are not well documented. I myself have heard it used in Papua New Guinea in the 60s and 70s referring to unmarried indigenous females who were suspected of being promiscuous although such usage might have been quite localised. Would it not be better to err on the side of caution in this regard? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbatross2147_b76b.html" title="User:Albatross2147">Albatross2147</a> 02:15, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Actually, I've never tried to make a bowling graph. I'm just not sure how I would best go about it. Obviously the wickets would be easy to do, but I'm not sure how to work the bowling average into the graph. Doing it just like the batting graphs wouldn't look all that great, as a bowler can of course never take more than 10 wickets in an innings but the bowling average might frequently be up around 30 or more. I don't know how I could get that looking good, but I'm happy to fiddle around and see if I can come up with something.</p>
<p>Thanks for telling me about Stan McCabe too, but I can't really take any of the credit.

<dd>Ah, well maybe wickets as the vertical bars and an average line, although that would mean that the worm bends down when the wickets go up (generally speaking, although you could take many wickets for many many runs in some cases....).

<p>When I lecture, some want bio info and I have generally referred folks to the wiki article what was listed here. I was going to do a lecture at the University of Houston on gender issues and the professor informed me that the article wasn't there. I checked tonight and sure enough, I found that you chose to remove it. So, I have to ask why? Was it that I lecture on gender issues? Was it that I run most of the medical and social services for transgendered people in Houston, TX area? Did you feel that being the first person in America to open a shelter for homeless gender variant individuals wasn't noteworthy? Was it the whole transgender thing that pushed your button? I noticed some folk had vandalized it in the past, so were you just taking down an article that had been vandalized? Just curious about your motive.</p>

It might sound a little idosyncratic, but I feel that it is somewhat useful to myself, that's all. It was there from before the issue was brought up on ANI as well.

<dd>Yeah, myself and Daniel Bryant sent emails to Sarah as well as the other guys on that talk page. I waited overnight Australian time to see if she was away or not, and I thought that she was away, by not replying, so I unblocked Michael because I thought there was a consensus that the removing the block might be the best way of moving on. I do not mean it to be a condoning of Michael's comments, or that I felt that Sarah to be a bad administrator or that the block was improper.

<dd>I'm sure you didn't. But I guess you see why people are interpreteting it that way. Well, not that you think that she is a bad admin, but that you think she made a mistake in blocking him. My preference would have been for her to flag the block at WP:AN, and maybe even let someone else make it. Dito in spades for your unblock. This morning I was of the opinion that Michael ought to serve the remainder of his block. Now, I'm not sure. But I think it is important that he be given the message that his behaviour was unacceptable. Wikipedia works best when various editors hold different view-points, but only if they respect each other's right to hold different view-points, and IMHO, Michael forgot that for a moment.

<p>She <i>did</i> make a mistake in blocking him. We don't block people we're involved in a dispute with, not even when they're treating us like garbage. Yes, I think Sarah is great, and I don't want her to leave, even temporarily, and yes I agree that Michael's treatment of Sarah was not acceptable.

<dd>No, she wasn't. She's made a handful of edits to Talk:Pauline Hanson recently and none to the article that I can see. She's supported Michael and Skyring in one of those edits <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109555042" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109555042" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. She's gently warned Michael about NPA a couple of times, eg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109553222" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109553222" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=109634539&amp;oldid=109555042" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=109634539&amp;oldid=109555042" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> to which his response was "I've always skated NPA, [and] I'm well aware that it's our very own OR" and then he really let fly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109673111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Hanson&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109673111" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.

<dd>If Michael had let fly at anyone else, I'd back Sarah to the hilt. But he let fly at <i>Sarah</i>, so <i>Sarah</i> shouldn't have applied the block.

<dd>Um, Nobleeagle is the main owner of that page, but I think the main issue is to write a comprehensive history section that shows the evolution properly, then fork most of it to the child article. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to convince FAC reviewers to pass it, but to get a comprehensive history complete with all the politics etc, crowd control etc, might be rather difficult. I'd say that Tintin has the best knowledge to be able to do it however, Nobleeagle's and my knowledge of Indian cricket seems to be heavily 1990s centric. Nichalp is also interested in cricket.
