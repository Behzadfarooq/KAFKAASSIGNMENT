<p>Hello, can you please explain the reason that you locked that page just now? I am aware of the long history of unconstructive edit wars, and so I would understand if you did not have the time or think it worthwhile to look into the reasons behind the latest, but at the same time I think that if you had done so you would have found that at this time we are engaged in a more positive and wikifriendly (can I say that?) approach to editing the articles. I would like to draw attention to the blanking and what I consider rather hostile additions of unsourced and quite biased content by Samuel Luo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critics of the Chinese government, who are unaware of the Falun Gong's attacks against critics in China before the ban and the cultish nature of this group, has suggested it was the Zhongnanhai demonstration of April 25 that led to "fear, animosity and suppression".[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that [1] is a reference to "American Asian Review, Vol. XIX, no. 4, Winter 2001, p. 12" - where the final words come from.</p>
<p>This paragraph replaces a photo of an alleged victim of the Chinese governments campaign, as well as several paragraphs of neutrally presented material drawn from academic journals. Another graphic image was removed, too.</p>
<p>It is probably not your role to get involved in the substance of what I am saying, but I just want to point a few things out. These are not my opinions, I am just describing the editing behaviour of Samuel Luo. So, in the end I feel that you did not need to lock the page. One editor was behaving poorly and breaking rules, and others were resisting it. It's a really clear cut case. Had you left the page unlocked I think maybe he would have given up after a little while. I will try to do some mediation or something. It is rather problematic editing and stunts growth of the articles. No attempts at discussion were made on the edit pages. My reason for communicating with you is to request that in simple cases like this that you do not lock the page, as it prevents us from adding anything further to the articles. Sorry if I am not supposed to bother you with this, and you just did what you were supposed to. There must be other avenues for dealing with this kind of behaviour. I will ask around. I am a little new to wikipedia. Thanks --<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EAsdfg12345_de8a.html" title="User:Asdfg12345">Asdfg12345</a> 01:54, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>He's still causing problems, not only is he engaging in personal attacks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Obligations_in_Freemasonry#Just_for_the_record" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Obligations_in_Freemasonry#Just_for_the_record" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> here, he's got a sympathizer jumping on board something she has no clue about. He doesn't understand that I wanted to note that the IP was Frater, and that the IP was used when he was blocked - it's one less way Xyzzy can use a sock on WP. Anyhow, since Xyzzy was the IP, that means he rm'ed the prod off the article he started in the first place w/o disclosure (He edited as an anon user, and clearly had a vested interest). He then tried to create a problem on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Obligations_in_Freemasonry" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Obligations_in_Freemasonry" rel="nofollow">the AfD of said article</a> as the anon by claiming COI because Masons were voting and not disclosing (we all have userboxes, BTW). He has since gone back to the AfD and changed the IP edit comments to his username (thus obliterating the dates), and has disclosed he is the author, as well as voting on said AfD. In the latest edit summary, he again accuses the Masonic editors of lack of disclosure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Obligations_in_Freemasonry&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Obligations_in_Freemasonry&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">see the history</a>). I'm really not sure how much more disruptive he needs to be to be bliocked, but he's certainly toeing a lot of lines as far as I'm concerned. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 04:17, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, he was originally blocked after <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Starwood_778f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Starwood</a> raised some issues and Dmcdevit and UC showed that they were linked, initially. Given the editing patterns, there was also suspicion that these guys had multiple computers or were meatpuppets of some banned users. So I blocked Frater Xyzzy. It turns out he was evading that block, as he later admitted using an IP, and then re-signed the IP address using his username. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 00:37, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You missed the fact that his original block was invalid, since a RFCU proved that he was not a sock, which was the reason for his unblock. You should unban him again, MSJ mislead you by leaving out the reason the Xyzzy account was unbanned, and presented it as a simply block evasion. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 21:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>More info. MSJ went admin shopping for this re-block on the morning of the 4th, as you can see by his posts on various admin talk pages, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jpgordon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105528692" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jpgordon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105528692" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105530007" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:William_M._Connolley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105530007" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamla&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105595474" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamla&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=105595474" rel="nofollow">here</a>, then after 11hrs passed and none of those admins agreed to re-block him he posted here asking you for a reblock. The fact that 3 admins, including WMC who is known for his agressive policy on blocks decided not to block him, and another admin Theresa knott came here asking for reasoning as to why you reblocked him, should be a red flag. Also i'd like to point out that his anon ip editing consisted of him asking quite a few times for someone to RFCU him to get his main account cleared, someone evading a block wouldn't go back and re-sign all their old stuff especially when in a massive content dispute with an obsessive wikilawyer like MSJ. Please re-evaluate your block on him. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimXI_248e.html" title="User:SeraphimXI"><font color="#FF3399">Seraphim</font></a> 21:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm aware he was cleared, but my first block occurred after I asked UninvitedCompany and Dmcdevit to RFCU him with JA and a link was discovered. So my block was technically merited when I encated it. It is one thing to appeal properly, but to circumvent the system vigilante style is not acceptable. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 00:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My only real problem is the fact that MSJ admin shopped around to find someone to re-block him. After 3 admins (including WMC) declined to block him you decided to.

<p>Hi. I was looking at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Category%7ERequests_for_unblock_4c8c.html" title="Category:Requests for unblock">Category:Requests for unblock</a> on a lazy Friday afternoon and noticed <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrater_Xyzzy_9687.html" title="User talk:Frater Xyzzy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Frater_Xyzzy_83ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/Frater Xyzzy">contribs</a>). You blocked him/her twice - once as a sock and once for block evasion. The RFCU cited cited on the talk page states that the two users are unrelated. Could you examine the block and, if you still believe it to be proper, for my edification, help me to understand it?

<dd>Sure. Whilst he was waiting for a follow-up check, he evaded the original block. At the time, the original block was based on CU info from Dmcdevit and UC. That's why I reblocked him.

<p>hi there Blnguyen -- I made a change to the Darrell Hair post this morning which I think accurately describes the umpire. I am a cricket lover based in South Africa and often change wikipedia posts. I do it via a mobile 3G card so it assigns a new IP or a generic IP so I am often identified as other users... so I have registered this time. I'd just like to take issue with you regarding your change, as I think he is a controversial man and has brought cricket into disrepute and also sowed division, whereas the wikipedia entry does not reflect this. So I do think we need to ackowledge this. I'll edit it again but perhaps I'll tone it down a little... I'd love to hear your reasons why you diagree with me. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mattattakk (<a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattattakk_5fc1.html" title="User talk:Mattattakk">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mattattakk_fc61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mattattakk">contribs</a>) 07:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

The same would apply to the likes of Ranatunga, Murali, Shane Warne, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Randell_27a0.html" title="Steve Randell">Steve Randell</a>, etc. Nobody says that <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>, etc are controversial, even though they are because it is not in line with the encyclopedic protocol.

From this day forward, we will strictly adhere to Wikipedia policies, penalize the vandals, and start constructing articles that comply with encyclopedic standards.

<dd>Despite a pro-FG view being aired currently on at least two of those four pages, I disagree with unblocking until Olaf vows not to abuse Wiki policies for his or his own views' benefit. Unfortunately his recent insistence on additional rules including his interpretation that all criticisms of FG are necessarily opinionated and violate both WP:NPOV and WP:NOR are worrying. This will lead to another edit war. Until Olaf recognizes that even WPs can be misinterpreted and abused for one's own benefit and promises not to do this, there is little justification for unblocking the articles. <a href="../../../j/s/w/User%7EJsw663_4769.html" title="User:Jsw663">Jsw663</a> 21:16, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> is on a capmaign against me. Because, I disagree with his POV he is doing everything he can to get me in trouble. As for the Dravidian topics template, there were no problems until <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> started removing parts of the items off the Dravidian topics template. We then got into a heated debate where he asked for sources to back my claims and in regards to the template. I have provided referenced sources every step of the way. On the other hand, <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> was not able to even show one source. He has also been engaged in personal attacks against me and against my ethnicity. Another administrator brought to our attention to perhaps change the name of the template from <i>Dravidian topics</i> to <i>Dravidian and South Indian topics</i>. I have agreed to do so. But, the others demanded it be called <i>South Indian topics</i>. Where is there any fair and balanced justice? It was only <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> and another user <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnanapiti_b22e.html" title="User:Gnanapiti">Gnanapiti</a> who are against this template. If there are any violations of the template, please work with me and let me know how to go about it. Is it too many listings of topics? Or anything else? The sole purpose of this template is to link users to Dravidian related topics. Also, as an educational tool of interest to topics which are not heard of much or deserve attention. If there is anything I can do to fix this situation, please let me know. I have reported <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> for his incivility towards me and others <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Problems_with_user_Sarvagnya" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Problems_with_user_Sarvagnya" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>There are aspects of the template which are useful in separate pieces, but not in one single piece. For example, separate templates for South Indian dance, South Indian cinema, South Indian martial arts are OK, but to combine them with geography, ethnicity all at once, is pulling too many unrelated things together. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 03:33, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Firstly, I would like to take care of this picture situation. I have used the colored map (blue and yelow), from a book cover. As for the black and white map, I have taken that from one of the pages from a book. I am not an expert in these matters and would like to take care of this situation. Please tell me how to go about reporting where I got the pictures from in a correct format. If I am not allowed to use those pictures, I will be more than happy to draw out the maps. Next, on the Dravidian topics template. I understand the ever growing love amongst the Indian wikipedians for their country. However, there are people that are feeling threatened by that template including the map. That should not be the case. Dravidians are not only in South India, but are also in parts of Central India, parts of Sri Lanka, parts of Pakistan, and parts of Bangladesh. You see, this template is basically a linkage to various sites on various topics of different Dravidian civilizations (Kannadigas, Malayalees, Tamils, Telugus, Gonds, and Brahuis). Tamils are both in India and Sri Lanka, while the Brahuis are in Pakistan, and tha Malto are in Bangladesh. Dravidian is the same in classification structure as that of Malayo-Polynesian (Malays, Javanese, Timorese, Samoans, Tahitians, etc.) I hope you understand my explanation. If there is anything that is going against Wikipedia policy, I would like to clear that up. If having a Dravidian topics template goes against Wikipedia policy, then please tell me another way of doing this. Perhaps a Dravidian civilizations series template?

<dd>If you look at the template, there are similar groupings for similar dances, similar martial arts, cimilar scripts, similar music, similar language, geography. In a separate form, they may be alright, but together, they connect too many weakly connected materials, and would not stand. Separately, they may stand. Secondly, the maps, they are from books, so they are not permitted in this case, because they are not used to describe the textbook, but rather to use their cartography work for our purposes. So those cannot be allowed. So I would have to delete them. As for the artwork of the people, where did that come from? <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:51, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So, from what I understand is that this template is too broad? Would you say it would be like having a template on all Southeastasian topics?

<p>You are right on all of that; I was not thinking of non-native English speakers at all back then. Having worked on a lot of Filipino, German, etc., bios has corrected me of such behavior. If I need to do a grammar and copy edit, it now reads something like "Typo fix; grammar twiddle." I don't expect or intend this to influence your oppose vote in anyway, it's just an FYI that my Sept. 2006 era edit summary style is a thing of the past. I'm taking oppose votes as <i>constructive</i> criticism, regardless of the RfA outcome, and genuinely appreciate the feedback. <s>PS: I don't seem to have had anything to do with the Isabella V debate at all. Maybe I did somewhere, but the links you put in never mention me, and the article/debate honestly doesn't ring any bells.</s>&#160;:-) — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 17:35, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(edit conflict) Howdy -- I was going through <a href="../../../r/f/u/CAT%7ERFU_768d.html" title="CAT:RFU">CAT:RFU</a> and found that you'd blocked this user for a 3RR violation on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28geographic_names%29_f177.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names)</a>. Apparently, he only reverted 3 times, not 4 (a 4th edit reverted something different, apparently not controversial). While 3RR is an electric fence, the user had also started engaging in discussion on the talk page, so I don't see an in-spirit violation.

<p>Howdy Bl,</p>
<p>RubberS here. I noticed you have been fighting vandals/unsourced rape allegations about Mr. Gandhi. I commend your editing efforts elsewhere on WP, however I am opposed to the removal of this "controversial" section for 3 reasons:</p>
<p>1. The story is now larger than allegations of rape. It involves Government of India censorship, Congress Party legal actions, and the general sense anyone who follows Indian life gets that the big guys get away w/ murder (literally). 2. While its true only "blogs" like Indymedia and the clearly biased HinduUnity site jumpstarted allegations of rape charges on the Net, in a place like India it is extremely difficult for the "truth" (whatever it may be) to get out via traditional media, especially for the son of a popular politician. 3. As a potential "future PM" (which I find highly unlikely btw) Mr. Gandhi will have more than his fair share of controversy. You cannot act like a judge on this matter nor should you act to protect his political career. Act as the messenger of truth that you are, that is it.</p>
<p>For the reasons of plausibility I am against removing these allegations. Let the world make their decision by labelling the section disputed/factual accuracy in question (like I did when I wrote that section). Removing it as if it doesn't exist is not in the spirit of WP. Maybe the form it was in was terrible (I admit I'm not an expert by far). It should at least be mentioned somewhere because "it" happened already, to Mr. Gandhi, and its significant.</p>

<dd>What matters is that you follow the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy. <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_Unity_3ab8.html" title="Hindu Unity">Hindu Unity</a> and blogs do not qualify as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, so rumours like that, especially defamatory ones, will be removed immediately. I'm sure Gandhi will become controversial in some way, like via his politics, but we would have sources for what his policies, speeches are, but to peddle defamatory rumours is unacceptable.

<p>Okay I'll read it cheers. Yeah I know what you mean, we are working on it. We realise there are many problems, and they run quite deep. It is hard to do things because this kind of activity is constant. Most time is spent arguing about this kind of thing or minor other revert-battles, so genuine improvements to the articles have been put in a secondary place sometimes. Those are just my thoughts. We are coming up with new strategies and things, so the situation should improve. Thanks, and please get back to me about what we can do to prevent further behaviour like Samuel's. One editor has proposed additions to the locked page. I think it is a request to put the blanked stuff back in. I'd be curious about what kind of justification Samuel provides for his editing. --<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EAsdfg12345_de8a.html" title="User:Asdfg12345">Asdfg12345</a> 15:48, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a>, since you have stopped revert wars on FG related pages, I thought I should provide some background info on edit conflicts on these pages. Basically editors on FG pages come from two camps: Falun-Gong-practitioner editors and non-Falun-Gong-practitioner editors. And their editing style is drastically different. Practitioner editors are here on a mission to promote their group, non-practitioner editors are here to inform the public about the core teachings and practices of this group. Practitioner editors have repeatedly removed statements and teachings of their leader as well as reports from major US media such as the Times and Wall Street Journal. Their blanking of info has always been rejected by editors on the other side.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because <a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EAsdfg12345_de8a.html" title="User:Asdfg12345">Asdfg12345</a> is complaining about me here I hope you can give me a chance to defend myself. My parents are both long term Falun Gong practitioners and because of that I have an insider’s view of this group which is considered a cult by prominent American cult experts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_and_controversies_about_Falun_Gong#Is_Falun_Gong_a_cult.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_and_controversies_about_Falun_Gong#Is_Falun_Gong_a_cult.3F" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I have revealed well concealed core beliefs of this group on Wikipedia and I believe my contributions have helped make these FG pages more educational rather than Falun Gong propaganda. <a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EAsdfg12345_de8a.html" title="User:Asdfg12345">Asdfg12345</a> is a Falun Gong practitioner and a self-proclaimed edit warrior, the following is his latest declaration: “I will continue to remove all edits which misrepresent Falun Dafa and force a POV on wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EAsdfg12345_de8a.html" title="User:Asdfg12345">Asdfg12345</a> 11:59, 5 February 2007” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Falun_Gong#Strike_One_for_Asdfg12345_.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Falun_Gong#Strike_One_for_Asdfg12345_.3F" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. There is a whole section on the Falnu Gong talk page regarding his destructive edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Coming to the issue of a recent revert war on Suppression of Falun Gong page. Asdfg12345 and his fellow practitioner editors started rewriting the whole page at this time 17:04, 3 February 2007. The following example will give you a sense of the POV they were pushing. The Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident section had this neutral beginning: “From July 22, 1999 to the end of 2002, tens of thousand of Falun Gong practitioners had protested in the center of Beijing--Tiananmen Square. None of these protests was more shocking, revealing, controversial, or tragic than the incident on January 23, 2001.” It was changed to “The campaign of government suppression of Falun Gong was considered by most observers to be largely ineffectual until January 2001, when persons whom the government claimed were Falun Gong practitioners, among them a 13-year-old girl named Liu Siying, set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Despite the fact that these self-immolators who were badly burned attested that they were practitioners and third party observers have confirmed their identity, the Falun Gong has denied them practitioner status ever since the incident. In their attempt to push their denial, practitioner editors removed statements like this one: “All but the twelve-year-old girl had protested the ban in Tiananmen Square previously, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy<a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/fa_lun_gong/falun214.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/fa_lun_gong/falun214.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are right about the dreadfulness of Falun Gong pages. There have been too many revert wars and people don’t bother to polish these articles. We have demanded mediation and Armedblowfish is finally agreeing to look into the dispute. Hopefully he can solve the deadlock.--<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Luo_b505.html" title="User:Samuel Luo">Samuel Luo</a> 22:06, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
