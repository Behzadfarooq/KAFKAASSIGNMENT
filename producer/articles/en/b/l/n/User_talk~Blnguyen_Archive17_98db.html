<p>Personally speaking, it appears that <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">User:Bakasuprman</a>, <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">User:BhaiSaab</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">User:Holywarrior</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangerous-Boy_5f44.html" title="User:Dangerous-Boy">User:Dangerous-Boy</a> have had a coming together due to the activities surrounding religious debates at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Talk%7ECalifornian_Hindu_textbook_controversy_75a5.html" title="Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy">Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy</a> and the subsequent activity surrounding the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User%7EAMbroodEY_Fundy_Watch_984d.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:AMbroodEY/Fundy Watch">Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:AMbroodEY/Fundy Watch</a>. I didn't see any interaction prior to this (correct if wrong), but Bakasuprman and Holywarrior seem to notice one another after an incident at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Talk%7ECalifornian_Hindu_textbook_controversy_75a5.html" title="Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy">Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy</a>, where the talk page descends into off-topic discussion about the wrongs of Hinduism and Christianity - no personal attacks or inflammatory jibes are made, but there are some rather blunt and frank comments about how some users feel about the other religion. After this, <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">User:Subhash bose</a> adds Holywarrior (after made negative comments about Hinduism) to the now deleted User:AMbroodEY/Fundy_Watch/Watch_List, along with a few other people, whom he has already listed on his similar "reminders" section on his talk page. When BhaiSaab nominates the Fundy Watch page for deletion, users from various religious groupings make comments which are inappropriate to the merit/validity of the content, by pointing out the religious biases. Dangerous-Boy recommends <b>Strong Keep</b> without giving a justification, and BhaiSaab takes the unnecessary step of pointing out that Dangerous-Boy called another user on <a href="../../../c/a/l/Talk%7ECalifornian_Hindu_textbook_controversy_75a5.html" title="Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy">Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy</a>, who was declared as being from a missionary organisation as a "bible-thumper". Later, BhaiSaab notes that Dangerous-Boy had messaged other users regarding the MfD, as is the normal practice in deletion debates where users have been messaged, as was routinely done when the notorious and now banned evangelist <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">User:Jason Gastrich</a> persistently messaged users in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Category%7EChristian_Wikipedians_8817.html" title="Category:Christian Wikipedians">Category:Christian Wikipedians</a> to vote of Christian biographies. Possibly due to the earlier questioning of D-Boy's comment, Bakasuprman declares that BhaiSaab is on a "crusade" against D-Boy and D-Boy questions BhaiSaab's bias in the failed AfD nomination of the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_Unity_3ab8.html" title="Hindu Unity">Hindu Unity</a> page, and whether BhaiSaab is stalking him. Despite the fact that many administrators are already present on the page, and without discussing or attempting to resolve the matter personally with D-Boy, BhaiSaab takes the unfortunate step of lodging a report at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, which given the nature of that board is bound to generate negative publicity for users who are reported there. From my glancing at the contribs, I don't see any evidence that BhaiSaab had been in editing conflicts with the users in question, let alone stalking them (please correct if necessary). Just speaking personally, his username is generally associated with editing Islamic theology type articles or Middle Eastern political-religion material.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Monday 7 August, I left a comment on BhaiSaab's talk page (archive 2) suggesting that his recent scrutinising of D-Boy was excessive. There seems to be a ceasefire now. The two users don't edit in the same areas, so regardless of what bad feelings are between them, this shouldn't matter, but hopefully it won't affect their morale towards participating within the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>BhaiSaab and Bakasuprman later engaged in a revert-war at <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_caste_system.html" title="Indian caste system">Indian caste system</a> over the addition and deletion of a section about caste systems amongst Muslims. Both parties cited "vandalism", which was unhelpful and doesn't serve any useful purpose except possibly spitefulness. In fact the section added by Bakasuprman was a copyvio subset of a few websites. A 3RR report against BhaiSaab was dismissed by Stifle, and (aeropagitica) blocked Bakasuprman for the cited reason of "vandalism". In this case it is correct to remove the copyvio pending a rewrite, not the other way around, but the characterisation of "vandalism" is inappropriate and inflammatory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please do not cite "vandalism" unless there is deliberate addition of wrong info, wilful destruction of article content (not POv disputes), addition of nonsensical material, obscene material, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, Bakasuprman has been walking around to various user_talk pages, proclaiming that BhaiSaab is stalking him, that Holywarrior is racist and that the two of them are liars/lying. This is an inappropriate way of lodging a complaint, to claim a character flaw without substantiation. In the case of Holywarrior, I cannot see the foundation for this, as the diffs lodged were regarding the expression of his religious opinions at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Talk%7ECalifornian_Hindu_textbook_controversy_75a5.html" title="Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy">Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy</a>. As stated below, this is what happens when people show their strong opinions towards other religions. Aside from whatever one may feel about Holywarrior's response and behaviour towards Bakasuprman's activities in the last few days, in his questioning of Bakasuprman's barnstars and the ongoing RfC, I can't see that he is being hostile to Hindu editors in their attempts to edit the encyclopedia (excluding the airing of general political and religious opinions which make others uncomfortable) - unlike say for instance <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">User:Anwar saadat</a>'s obstructionist voting at Indian RfAs, FACs, FLCs, and trying to delist Indian featured material at any opportunity. As for the complaint that BhaiSaab is stalking him, I cannot see any evidence of BhaiSaab stalking him, interfering with his edits, (the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_caste_system.html" title="Indian caste system">Indian caste system</a> doesn't count as it is a clear copyvio), aside from BhaiSaab's desire to have the last say by responding to all of Bakasuprman's claims. An example of stalking would be the antics by <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">User:Anwar saadat</a> in early May when he decided that in response to the changes to the <a href="../../../a/j/i/Ajith_Kumar_f3b8.html" title="Ajith Kumar">Ajith Kumar</a> article, he would walk to Hindi film articles edited by <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">User:Zora</a> as well as the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_cricket_team.html" title="Indian cricket team">Indian cricket team</a> by <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle">User:Nobleeagle</a> and revert their edits, for which he was blocked by <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">User:Nichalp</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please cite the diffs which are relevant and the quote policies - <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a> which have been breached, without using emotive terms. Engaging in launching emotive accusations without providing diffs, constitute personal attacks, as perviously mentioned.</li>
<li>BhaiSaab has been advised to not to respond unnecessarily and incessantly to Bakasuprman, especially in the case that there are no diffs or evidence presented. (<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">User:Haphar</a> has been blocked for repeatedly behaving in such a manner to <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">User:Subhash bose</a>)</li>
<li>Given that there are many users from a variety of religious backgrounds and differing opinions, engaging in airing negative personal sentiment about other religions etc, can only have a negative impact in the ability to work colaboratively with one another, and is to be avoided.</li>
<li>As before, none of the users involved appear to edit the same material, so hopefully regardless of what bad feelings are between them and do not dissipate, this shouldn't matter, but hopefully it won't affect their morale towards participating within the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the MfD, Holywarrior suggests that those involved in the creation of the list ought to be blocked, to which Bakasuprman retorts that Holywarrior uses personal attacks, is anti-Hindu and calls for a block. Personally, I didn't see interaction between the two of them prior to this incident either from a quick glance (Bakasuprman made his first edit on July 23), but the complaints lodged by Bakasuprman regarding Holywarrior's conduct relates to the expression of his religious opinions at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Talk%7ECalifornian_Hindu_textbook_controversy_75a5.html" title="Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy">Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy</a>, which do not constitute personal attacks. What it does show is that the expression of one's negative personal opinions towards other religions, rather than discussing appropriate content in articles will cause ill-will with other users and hamper efforts to co-operate with one another, which is why the public airing of such types of opinions about religion, race and politics are discouraged. Having said that, I don't think that Holywarrior and Bakasuprman edit similar pages at all, as they did not appear to conflict prior to this. Since then, Holywarrior has lodged a personal query, suspecting whether <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruebaka_56f8.html" title="User:Truebaka">User:Truebaka</a> is a sock of Bakasuprman, awarding himself barnstars. As noted above, there is nopolicy violation regarding self-awarded barnstars, but to publicly express suspicion over a user conduct matter which is irrelevant to formulation of article content borders on paranoia and is not a tactful move - it is likely that if anything, it will result in further development of a siege mentality and erosion of good-will. Personally, I feel that in the current circumstances, as I noted on the RfC, that such a move may not be conducive to getting a fruitful resolution to this conflict - most RfCs are based on a user whose conduct has caused disruption to a wide number of users through their disruptive editing tactics. In this case this is restricted to only two users' attitude towards one another, and is an unnecessary escalation of the conflict in my opinion, especially as user talk page contact between the two users have only taken place in the last three or four days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suggest withdrawal of RfC. Since users do not appear to deal with each other editorially, hopefully, the problems should die off.</li>

<p>Thanks for the note.

<dd>I'm quite sure that he isn't a sock because socks do not tend to have similar names as they tend to try and get under the system and cheat and vote-stack, etc. Only reincarnated vandals use the same names over and over again in order to irritate and spite users - like User:Armking, User:Armsex, User:Armkong, User:Armsock, User:Armheezeh...etc.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have not participated in the RfC, nor do I have any plans to at this point in time. I agree with your summary, except with the following: "Despite the fact that many administrators are already present on the page, and without discussing or attempting to resolve the matter personally with D-Boy, BhaiSaab takes the unfortunate step of lodging a report at WP:ANI, which given the nature of that board is bound to generate negative publicity for users who are reported there" This gives the impression that I lodged the report against D-Boy; I made it against Bakaman, and there was already plenty of discussion with him. Also, as I pointed out earlier WP:Vandalism states knowingly inserting copyrighted material is indeed vandalism - I don't see why there is disagreement over this. If you don't like this part of the policy perhaps you may want to get it changed. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 16:50, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologise for making the incorrect observation that that you started that thread, it was Timothy Usher, who I have informed about this. I still maintain that using the user talk page was the most appropriate form of communication for discreet resolution (if possible). Secondly, I am not trying to "disagree" with policy but simply advising to use the most uninflammatory language as possible, especially in sensitive issues, it is for your own benefit. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also one more statement: "Dangerous-Boy recommends Strong Keep without giving a justification, and BhaiSaab takes the unnecessary step of pointing out that Dangerous-Boy called another user on Talk:Californian Hindu textbook controversy, who was declared as being from a missionary organisation as a "bible-thumper". I have not been involved with the Californian Hindu textbook controversy article - my comment was made about D-Boy's statements on the talk page of Fundy Watch, not anywhere else. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 16:56, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That argument is quite nonsensical. I posted the report on personal attack intervention board - I did not request any specific admin to review the case. It just so happened that it was Tom Harrison, so there is no conspiracy here. Tom was not at all "hostile."

<dd>Except you also made attacks in the fundywatch one already documented. I merely responded to your accusations. Anyways D-boy wasn't exactly right in calling people bible-thumpers but on the textbook article, he was perfectly justified. I have better things to do than dig up dirt on a user who does little more than harrass others for different POV's. As Blnguyen stated above USer:Anwaar sadat is a documented anti-Hindu, pro-Muslim wikipedian. Other people referring to him as a "Jihadi" (probably would not my choice of words)are justified since he attacked Netaji (the user) and Hindus on RFC, RFA articles etc. I participated in two others, and didn't need to. If you're going to dig up the anti-Brahminism AfD, you might see that Holywarrior questioned a certain Brahmins knowledge of Hinduism. Its obvious Babub knows much more than Holywarrior about Hinduism, but Holywarrior already has a checkered history, as does Timothy Usher (on probation). <font color="red"><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a></font> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 17:40, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've already dealt with Holywarrior's inappropriate mocking of Babub on that AfD. It looks like he is trying to move on. Meanwhile you two guys are still dragging your feet. I did not say say above that Anwar was a "anti-Hindu, pro-Muslim" - I noted that he had a period when he went and reverted other people's edits to annoy them (stalking), and nothing more. Please keep in mind that at no stage, did I agree that it was OK to call Anwar a "jihadi" - if his edits are inappropriate then explain why, and debate; don't sit there and discredit the other person with personal judgments. I noted that he went around obstructing everything, and not just involving Hindus, but also Christians, Sikhs, atheists, all candidates - see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Joturner_2_7794.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Joturner 2">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Joturner 2</a>, a declared Muslim convert, Anwar said something like that Joturner had "issues. Period". He also opposed the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Tamil_Nadu_02ec.html" title="List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu">List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu</a> despite being a Tamil himself, so I wouldn't read anything into it. Anwar also drinks, according to his userpage. Anwar is on a one month block due to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_Case_Anwar_saadat_0e49.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Anwar saadat">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Anwar saadat</a>, and one of the offences his sock committed was calling Netaji an "illiterate hindu fundamentalist" in the edit summaries. The reverse of calling Anwar a "jihadi" will get similar treatment. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason that I talked about an amnesty/ceasefire is because I'm well aware of the existence of a lot of testy comments and inappropriate dialogue, and instead of condemn you heavily, or "rank" or "rate" the severity of the inappropriateness of your conduct is that this was meant to be a learning experience, to have a think about how to resolve problems using different manners of dialogue that would increase your rapport with one another as editors, and that way to increase your productivity as editors here. There is not really a grievous stand-alone example of extreme bad behaviour, so I have tried to avoid a block, but mainly lots of continual scrapping and an apparent desire to always have the last word. As I have said before, such scrapping is bad. I have pointed out the situations where I feel that you can employ better and more diplomatic and productive methods of debate, focusing on article matter and not the religious ideology of users, and situations on AfD debates where unnecessary allegations of bad faith have made the situation worse. I have reached a stage where I feel that if you can't see anything useful in what I have said which you can use for self-analysis to modify your behaviour, instead of being defiant and continually tagging the other user, then there is no further point in my repeating it, due to your continued mutual niggling of one another. Holywarrior seems to have moving on somewhat, do you want to continue getting irritated in this way? As I have already said, I am offering an "amnesty" so to speak to encourage you to change your style and move on, but if you continue in this way, then I won't be trying to point things out and mould your dialogue, debating and grievance technique anymore, I will simply use the block facility to stop further inflammation when the need arises. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I told the IP address not to make personal attacks (even though I agree with what the IP said) then holywarrior acted in bad faith and said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACalifornian_Hindu_textbook_controversy&amp;diff=68786617&amp;oldid=68648978" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACalifornian_Hindu_textbook_controversy&amp;diff=68786617&amp;oldid=68648978" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. I accused dab of making personal attacks (he's known to do that) but when I tried to assist a user, Holywarrior bacame hostile. He is using his sparring partner Yeditor to vandalize Hinduism pages, and putting strings of unwarranted warnings on talk pages of at least 3 people (me, Bharatveer, Netaji) probably more when "blatant Hindu vandals" see the crap they put on Hinduism pages. <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 15:16, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you told me to stop handing out vandalism tags. I placed the last one on Timothy Ushers page before I saw your message. BhaiSaab provoked me to do that. Also, I believe BhaiSaab's "warning" was unwarranted. Can I remove it? I cited the reason I "vandalized" Netaji's talk page, because netaji did not vandalize the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_caste_system.html" title="Indian caste system">Indian caste system</a> page. Also I will not respond to his bait above the "Proposed findings" section. You are right, he is now involved in a content dispute with myself and Netaji and I'm not going to give a reason for an admin to block me. I have tried to patch up my relationship with Ragib for said reason and am working to build a contributing relationship with Thunderboltz and Rama's arrow (both of whom should be admins).<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 04:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took the action of issuing both of you with a short 15min block because I felt that your issuing of robot-messages to each other and warning-warring was inappropriate, as I had noted earlier. You were having a productive discussion on article content, so I was concerned that this could be damaged by a possible silly escalation in this warning-warring. I think in future, I'll take the responsibility of deleting the appropriate warnings myself.

<p>He is now invading the India realted articles. I believe you told him to mind his own business, he forced Netaji to go 3RR and he violated 3RR on <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh_4db7.html" title="Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh">Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</a> himself. He asked me if I owned the articles when I cited that you told him to not engage in disputes with me again. I believe in archive 17 you stated that he has not been interfering with my edits. Now you have clear evidence he has. Anyways, I wouldn't care about his edits on the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_violence_2006_revision_c685.html" title="2002 Gujarat violence/2006 revision">2002 Gujarat violence/2006 revision</a> but the RSS is a totally <i>Hindu</i> organization. Can you ask him why he is undoing Netaji's edits? I would take amnesty but only if BhaiSaab stops messing with the Hindu/India based articles and sticks to his area of expertise. As per your recommendation, I removed the npa warnings on his page which were a response to his vandalism templates. I would find an indian admin, but Bhadani treated the case like a hot potato and gave it to you, using very vague language for justification. Rama's arrow and deepujoseph are good, but they unfortunately are not admins.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 20:22, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm still looking into it to see how it develops. If it appears that activity may be motivated by dubious reasons rather than a genuine wish to improve content, then he will get into trouble. Probably it would be smart for him to stay away for a while in the interests of goodwill, instead of taking up this new interest, but there is nothing wrong with it to just begin with. If he just did straight reverts for the hell of it and didn't explain when asked like Anwar did to Nobleeagle then things are clearcut. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I was away for a week and just saw your comment in my talk page. It would seem that LkAdvani has changed his userid. When I used the term 'libelous' to describe a personal attack against myself in his talk page I did not mean it in a legal sense.</p>
<p>From Dictionary</p>
<p>Libel \Li"bel\ (l[imac]"b[e^]l), n. [L. libellus a little book, pamphlet, libel, lampoon, dim. of liber the liber or inner bark of a tree; also (because the ancients wrote on this bark), paper, parchment, or a roll of any material used to write upon, and hence, a book or treatise: cf. F. libelle.] [1913 Webster]</p>
<p>1. A brief writing of any kind, esp. a declaration, bill, certificate, request, supplication, etc. [Obs.] --Chaucer. [1913 Webster]</p>
<p>2. Any defamatory writing; a lampoon; a satire. [1913 Webster]</p>
<p>The legal definition:</p>
<p>3. (Law) A malicious publication expressed either in print or in writing, or by pictures, effigies, or other signs, tending to expose another to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule.</p>
<p>Was not meant here. Therefore, there is no threat of legal action (I know that this is not allowed on wikipedia). I hope you understand why it was necessary as, at best, it was a blatant personal attack.<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 20:27, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I looked at it again and it states that Netaji would <i>report you</i> (Lkadvani) for defaming him? So he is stating that he will report you for committing a legal offense against you? Does that imply a counter-legal threat on the part of Netaji. It seems ambiguous and probably damaging to both of you so perhaps deleting both the irrelevant stuff on Lkadvani's page and that comment by Netaji would be the most convenient, rather than an escalation.
