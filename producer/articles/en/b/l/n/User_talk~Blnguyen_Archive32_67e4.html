<p>It has been suggested that you may be able to offer me some advice or assistance with a page I created on Police Rugby League in Victoria. It was deleted shortly after creation even though in my opinion it is notable enough to remain on the site and no different to many other sports related pages. Please see my talk page for more information if you can help. Thanks.VPRLC 01:45, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, but it looks bleak as far as notability goes.

<p>Someone suggested to approach you for content war and edit wars on Hinduism. Though, it may not be proper for me to tell you to go through talk pages of Hinduism, I am inclined to urge you to do so considering voluminous nature of discussion. The same would give you a good picture of problems.</p>
<p>If you could be of help in the matter, I shall feel grateful to you.</p>

<dd>Hello. The problem is that your edits were not written in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral tone</a> but rather bordered on <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertising</a>, especially the section about how to subscribe, and the contents of the latest magazine, are in a manner which is not appropriate for an encyclopedia.

Oh, and I'm happy to say that the list <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming_World_Swimmers_of_the_Year_d1b4.html" title="Swimming World Swimmers of the Year">Swimming World Swimmers of the Year</a> about your publication's much respected and coveted awards which I wrote was awarded <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">featured list</a> status<a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_list_candidates_Swimming_World_Swimmers_of_the_Year_d9ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/Swimming World Swimmers of the Year">Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/Swimming World Swimmers of the Year</a>.

<p>Gotcha. I'm new to the magazine, and am taking a look at the various places that link to us online. Part of the problem is that our brand changed from swiminfo.com to SwimmingWorldMagazine.com. I'm trying to make sure that the change is made. Also, I am new to wikipedia, so I don't really have a true idea about what to post and what not to post. From reading your response, it looks like the only things that are allowed on wikipedia are those things not already on another web site like ours? Is that correct? Other than that, I just wanted to make sure that people could see the various services we offer to the swimming community. If that is considered marketing or promotional by wikipedia, I'm more than happy to just leave everything as it is. Just not sure exactly what you all would be looking for.</p>
<p>On another point, I did see your World Swimmers of the Year list. I loved it.</p>

Unfortunately, one cannot get near the nets when there isn't a match on, and people are generally not allowed in during training.&#160;:( If I'm there at some stage I'll see if I can snap some shots, but I'm not optimistic I'm afraid. Nice to hear from you, sorry I couldn't be of more help.

<dd>Yeah sadly things are quite a bit tighter over here, tis a pity. And the nets don't help much either, even if I was able to get near them. Wrong uniform indeed! Don't get me started on how the Cricket Board of South Africa messed that one up, they wouldn't let the fellow into the team so he just went off to England!

<p>Hello Monkeyman, I see you've been busy. Those photos are amazingly difficult to take aren't they. I do like your Terry Jenner shot. It makes you appreciate prof photographers who manage to get a classy shot seemingly with ease - I wonder what the secret is? When they come over my way in a couple of weeks, I intend to have a go myself.

<dd>Ah, well it's not so easy for those guys either. They were taking multiple shots and then muttering expletives when they didn't work out as they planned either.....The problem is that the bowling nets are protected by a metal wire fence and then another cloth fence. You can poke the lens past the metal fence, but you'll still get the black fuzz of the cloth fence about 1m in front. I used a digital camera with a maximum aperture f=5.6, whereas for the proper family camera, you can get 1.6 - (small f number -&gt; large aperture) and the pros probably have an even larger aperture. Then with a larger aperture, the field of view is smaller, so you the length at which the object is focussed is smaller....that's why the pros can take a picture through the netting and it only looks like a grey cloud. Of course, if I used the family camera, I could have gotten a better pic, but I don't think my parents would be happy, as the "success rate" would probably decrease from about 1/8 for these "pseudo-amateurish" digital snaps to maybe 1/20 for the manual film which requires more discretionary skill......and likely triple figure bills for a few photos. The ones which turned out OK, of Cook, Read and Jones practicing catching were only because there was no netting in the way....and the same goes for the photos of Jenner, Aggers, CMJ and Graham Cornes and Roger Wills (don't have an article for him yet). Most of the journos and pundits were rather bewildered when I took photos of them....And judging by the way Pietersen was training against Panesar, I'm guessing he has a few big hits in mind this summer, as well as attempting reverse-sweep sixes like he did against Murali. England were batting for 2 hours but the Redbacks only trained for 30 minutes so I could only get Cosgrove and not Cullen, Tait, Lehmann and Gillespie...perhaps that explains why they never win anything....<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:13, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consensus?? What consensus?? On the Vande Mataram page, Sameer explained that the song was partly in Sanskrit or something like that, so the use of Devanagari to represent <i>Sanskrit</i> seemed valid and I <i>agreed</i>. On Jana Gana Mana, opinion was divided down the middle. Later the 'other side' materialised a 'citation' which said that the 'Hindi version' of the song had been adopted. Based purely on this citation was the Nagari transliteration allowed. I asked them what "Hindi version of a Bengali song" meant and I am still waiting for an answer with a citation. On Saare Jahan Se Achcha, neither does the song have Sanskrit in it nor is it the "Hindi version" of some song. The only citation the 'other side' has been providing is to a flimsy blog of a nobody which has anti pakistan anti muslim puke all over it.

<p>Hi I noticed your comment on the deletion review of chicken and rice. As you may already know I feel very strongly about this subject even though I am in no way working for this company. I have worked very hard to included this article because I have personally witnessed its impact on the tristate area.

<p>I was just wondering why. In the section of my article Vendor Achievements I showed that it has won notable awards, have been cited by a notable chief in Food &amp; Wine Magazine, and has resulted in a murder directly involving the demand of the food. It seems to pass WP:NOTABILITY "In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that it will be described by multiple independent reliable sources." - which this does.

<dd>Yeah, well I don't think I'll get sanctioned for being reluctant to get involved, seeing as my understanding of this stuff extends no further than the fact that some people like Koonraad Elst and the opposite side likes to quote Witzel. If you are talking about the Gujarat riots, there are three Gujarat admins on en.wiki and they too are reluctant to get invovled in this fight - I can certainly sympathise with this, since, I am also reluctant to edit too much in the religion tension areas on australian related stuff lest I get pilloried. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 06:06, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
