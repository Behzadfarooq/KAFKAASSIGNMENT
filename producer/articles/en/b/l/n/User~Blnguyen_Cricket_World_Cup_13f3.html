<p>The first cricket <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test match</a> was played in 1877 between <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">England</a>. Cricket was contested at the <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900_Summer_Olympics_98eb.html" title="1900 Summer Olympics">1900 Summer Olympics</a> where <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> defeated <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> by 158 runs.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> From then on, The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Olympic_Committee_e5dd.html" title="International Olympic Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> cancelled cricket as an Olympic sport.</p>
<p>The first attempt at arranging an international cricket competition was the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912_Triangular_Tournament_4a9b.html" title="1912 Triangular Tournament">1912 Triangular Tournament</a>. It was a <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test cricket</a> tournament played in England between the only three <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test playing nations</a> at the time, which were <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">England</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_cricket_team_2ad2.html" title="South African cricket team">South Africa</a>. Due to poor weather and a lack of public interest, the experiment was not repeated.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> From then on, international test cricket teams only generally engaged in bilateral series's as opposed to tournaments or leagues involving more than two nations.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, English <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_cricket.html" title="County cricket">county cricket</a> teams began playing a shortened version of cricket, which only lasted for one day. Starting in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> as a 4-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> and the <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillette_Cup_994b.html" title="Gillette Cup">Gillette Cup</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_cricket.html" title="One-day cricket">one-day cricket</a> grew in popularity and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> a national league called the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_League_47c4.html" title="Sunday League">Sunday League</a> was created. The first <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_international.html" title="One-day international">one-day international</a> came about from a rain-aborted <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test match</a> at <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> between <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_cricket_team.html" title="England cricket team">England</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> and was played on the final scheduled day.

<p>The Cricket World Cup was first held in 1975 in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> because it was the only nation at the time that had the resources to stage an event of such magnitude.<sup id="_ref-ENGHOST_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENGHOST" title="">[7]</a></sup> The first three tournaments were officially known as the Prudential Cup because the financial services company <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prudential_plc.html" title="Prudential plc">Prudential plc</a> was the main sponsor in each event. The matches played consisted of 60 overs per team and were played in traditional white uniform and red balls. They were all played during the day and hence started early. Eight teams participated in the first tournament: <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">England</a>, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indian_cricket_team_6ec3.html" title="West Indian cricket team">West Indies</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_cricket_team.html" title="Pakistani cricket team">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_cricket_team.html" title="Indian cricket team">India</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_cricket_team_b7ed.html" title="New Zealand cricket team">New Zealand</a> (the six <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test nations</a> at the time), with <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_e5c9.html" title="Sri Lankan cricket team">Sri Lanka</a> and a composite team from <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_African_cricket_team_c3b0.html" title="East African cricket team">East Africa</a>. One notable omission was the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_cricket_team_2ad2.html" title="South African cricket team">South African cricket team</a> who were not competing due to the international sports boycott. West Indies won the first Cricket World Cup when they defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final.</p>
<p>The next two World Cups held in 1979 and 1983 were again hosted by <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_Cricket_World_Cup_3887.html" title="1979 Cricket World Cup">1979 tournament</a> saw the introduction of the <a href="../../../i/c/c/ICC_Trophy_8748.html" title="ICC Trophy">ICC Trophy</a>, a competition used to determine which <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">non-Test playing</a> teams qualified for the World Cup.<sup id="_ref-ICCTROPHY_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ICCTROPHY" title="">[8]</a></sup> Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe qualified through the <a href="../../../i/c/c/ICC_Trophy_8748.html" title="ICC Trophy">ICC Trophy</a>. West Indies again won the tournament, defeating England by 92 runs in 1979.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_Cricket_World_Cup_c90f.html" title="1983 Cricket World Cup">1983 event</a> was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this time, Sri Lanka became a <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test playing nation</a>; Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. India were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_Cricket_World_Cup_8737.html" title="1987 Cricket World Cup">1987 Cricket World Cup</a> held in India and Pakistan was the first World Cup hosted outside of England. It was also the first tournament where the West Indies were unable to reach the final. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings because of the shorter daylight hours on the subcontinent when compared to England. Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs, the closest margin so far in World Cup final history.</p>

<p>The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. The first four tournaments comprised of eight teams each, divided into two groups of four. There were two stages, a group stage and a knockout stage. In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_Cricket_World_Cup_76e9.html" title="1975 Cricket World Cup">1975</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_Cricket_World_Cup_3887.html" title="1979 Cricket World Cup">1979 Cricket World Cups</a>, each team played a <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round-robin_tournament.html" title="Round-robin tournament">round-robin</a>, while in the following two tournaments, each team played the rest in their group twice. The top two teams in each group advanced to the semi-finals and the winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_cricket_team_2ad2.html" title="South African cricket team">South Africa</a> returned to <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_cricket.html" title="International cricket">international cricket</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, which meant that nine teams participated in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_Cricket_World_Cup_8217.html" title="1992 Cricket World Cup">1992 Cricket World Cup</a>. All teams were in one group and played each other once. The top four qualified for the knockout stage which was contested in similar fashion to the previous events. In the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_Cricket_World_Cup_224f.html" title="1996 Cricket World Cup">1996 competition</a>, the number of teams increased from nine to twelve and they were allocated into two groups again. The top four teams of each group qualified for the knockout stage this time, which also included quarter-finals.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_Cricket_World_Cup_b5ca.html" title="1999 Cricket World Cup">tournament in 1999</a> has a similar group stage format to its predecessor but there was a dramatic change in the second stage. A "Super Six" round replaced the quarter-finals. There were still two groups of six but only three teams from each group went into the subsequent stage. In the Super Six round, each qualifier from group A played with each qualifier from group B. The teams earned points from their wins in the Super Six and also brought points scored against the two other teams who qualified from the same group in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super Six entered into the semi-finals and the rest of the tournament followed in similar fashion to its predecessors. The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Cricket_World_Cup_0bad.html" title="2003 Cricket World Cup">2003 event</a> had a similar structure to the 1999 competition except that the number of participants rose to fourteen, which meant that there were now seven teams in each pool in the group stage. The Super Six qualifiers also carried forward one point for each win in the group stage against non-qualifiers, a complexity which was dropped for the next world cup.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>A new format to be introduced in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_Cricket_World_Cup_cb74.html" title="2007 Cricket World Cup">2007 tournament</a> will feature 16 teams allocated into four groups of four. Eleven teams had <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_international.html" title="One-day international">one-day international</a> status and automatically qualified for the tournament while the other five teams were selected from the ICC Trophy. Within each group, the teams will play each other in a round-robin format and the top two teams will advance to the "Super 8" round. The eight remaining teams will again play in a round-robin format, except that they will not play the other team that advanced from their respective group.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[13]</a></sup> The top four teams from the Super 8 round will advance to the semi-finals and the winners of the semi-finals will then compete in the final.</p>

<p>The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is the prize presented to winners of the Cricket World Cup along with cash prizes. The current trophy was created for the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_Cricket_World_Cup_b5ca.html" title="1999 Cricket World Cup">1999 championships</a> and is the first permanent prize in the tournament's history.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[14]</a></sup> A team of craftsmen from <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrard_%26_Co_1c20.html" title="Garrard &amp; Co">Garrard &amp; Co</a>, the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom_366f.html" title="Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom">Crown Jewellers</a>, designed and produced the trophy within two months in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>

The trophy weighs approximately 11 kilograms and has the names of the previous winners inscribed on its base. There is still room for another ten teams to have their name inscribed.</p>
<p>The actual trophy is always kept by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">International Cricket Council</a> but a replica, which is identical in all aspects apart from the inscription of the previous champions is awarded to the winning team and remains in their possession.</p>

<p><a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> hosted the first three competitions. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">ICC</a> decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to put the resources needed in organising the inaugural event.<sup id="_ref-ENGHOST_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENGHOST" title="">[7]</a></sup> <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> eagerly proposed that they should hold the third Cricket World Cup. In spite of this most of the ICC members believed England was a more suitable venue because longer period of daylight in June. This meant that a match could be completed in one day.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[18]</a></sup> The first competition hosted outside of England was the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_Cricket_World_Cup_8737.html" title="1987 Cricket World Cup">1987 tournament</a>, which was jointly held in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.

<p>Thereafter an unofficial rotation system was introduced so that each cricket playing region of the world would have the opportunity to host World Cup about every twenty years.
