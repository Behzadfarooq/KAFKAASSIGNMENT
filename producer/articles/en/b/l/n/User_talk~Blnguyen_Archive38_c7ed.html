<dd>Unfortunately, he retired after a dispute over the fair use policy with a person who appears to be something of an authority on fair use images who interprets the policy much more strictly than Wikipedia.

<li>Am I missing something? How did this qualify for DYK?

<dd>Hmm...for some reason the DYK articles seem to be getting worse and worse. I think <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Pathan_b760.html" title="Irfan Pathan">Irfan Pathan</a> is a good article but in the last couple of days ive seen a bunch of stubs get on. Its sad to note that some of us spend time writing articles like <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mangalkavya.html" title="Mangalkavya">Mangalkavya</a> while we could merely get away with a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Var_%28poetry%29.html" title="Var (poetry)">Var (poetry)</a>. In this instance, I wouldnt even complain if u, geejo and nish pick ur own DYK's. At least u guys make good picks. Look into the stubs thing though, if something is going to show up on the main page, it might as well look like a B class article.<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 04:10, 25 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think we have different concerns, mine is that DYK is for new articles, or ones very recently expanded from stubs. The point of DYK has never, afaik, been to showcase "good" articles, but to inspire editors to start new ones. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 14:08, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it was 5kb before the expansion, and was 32kb afterwards. So effectively it was 80%+ new content, so the article was mostly new and I threw out most of the 5kb that was already there so even more than 80%. Personally I don't mind having expansions of non-stubs if the vast majority of the article is new, and in this case it is, as the article is effectively "new". I decided to use the Christmas lack of supply to see how it would be received....Personally, I would say that 80%+ new articles should be allowed even if the 20% old stuff is already non-stub, as it is a proportional thing...

<dd>Extreme indecent and uncouth behavior of Mr.kannambadi. Marathi is a official language of India. Why are Marathi citations challenged? Mr.Kannambadi must explain his dubious citations rather than challenging mine. My translation is full-proof, I am a native Marathi speaker. Manasollas does have Marathi songs and that is clear in the citation. Mr.Kannambadi is warned to mind his words. 59.95.6.80 17:13, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Is this an acceptable citation?. Its a web page completely in Marathi. It claims a Sanskrit work by a Chalukya king Someswara as "Marathi songs", and that it was a stepping stone to Marathi Literature. Can we get a native Marathi speaker to even validate the page and its contents.</p>

<dd>Hi PageantUpdater, sorry for the delay, I appear to have been on break for a while and am catching up on all my paperwork. I removed the template for know, as the trends suggest that the article would survive an AfD and people are able to try that if they want, but putting a tag there for a while isn't likely to do the article any good either way. If Brightideasguru wants to, then she can start her own page at Victoria Davis (educator) and see what people think of it, as even if she was notable, you can't put two biographies in the same place, which solves the problem she expresses right above. The reason that <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> exists is that people can have their judgment affected by conflict of interest, so it is discouraged - I have had a few people attack me strongly and then spam <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> after I deleted their autobiography, so it's nothing to be alarmed about. I'm happy to talk to her as well, although the queue is a bit long at the moment.

<p>Oh esteemed Bananabucket trust you rested well free of wikipedia - and of course you must know the result of the test in the eastern states - first time in 83 years (moondyne is still absent -&#160;: 0 probably been watching every minute of it) . As for the orang utan - things happen a lot even in one day here (viz hesperians latest adventure)- there is a much larger wider generic issue re trivia and 'in popular culture sections' in biological articles - some eds are vicious - some more mediating - the thing there is now a collection in the category of animals in popular culture which appear to have been created to avert the adhoc unsystematic lists of things from tv and film in the usa that some feel compelled to add willy nilly - there is no overview general article for the category - but I had tried in the orangutan in pop cult to add in a ref or two from the academics - the problem is that the arts are of very varying qulaity. length and standards - the oa pest hasnt returned - despite invitations - but If I had the time I would try to create a parent article for the animals in popular culture category with some general issues (am intrigued by the rats in flushed away, charlottes web and chicken run -I have three children) - to try to stop too much variation between the arts - but ah I haves too many threads I pursues - projects - pages here and there - and not the capacity to endure creating a good art about the curses of mainly us-centric popular culture and the animals that inhabit them - I hope that sort of answers the message in a sort of way - I had resolved to try to reduce talk page acitivity for the new year but it fell apart on the 2nd - so be it.

<p>Dear Sir, The usage of non-English language material is growing on English Wikipedia in utter abandon. User:Utcursch has already adviced user:Vishu123 (user:Mrtag, user:Itihass) that English language works sould be given importance on English wikipedia but this is beign treated with utter disregard by him who sees the inability of wikipedia admins in bringing clarity into this matter. The problem has now spread to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukya.html" title="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> page (see Chalukya discussion). If this issue is not solved now, it will grow into a huge problem for English wikipedia.

<p>I sincerely suggest we bring together a large group of admins/wiki seniors etc. to decide if non-english language citations and self translation are allowed.

<dd>Replies, I didn't even know that they tried it in 2002. I thought the 2005 ICC SuperSeries was the first, which is why I thought it couldn't have been Tendulkar, since he was injured. Anyway, anybody up for a few cricket FAs in time for the CWC2007 (specifically those related to this year's event)? <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 03:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>How do you feel about getting the opportunity to serve on the ArbCom?
<dl>
<dd>I feel honoured and surprised to be appointed. Also, it is a large responsibility, so it makes me more conscious of my actions.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>What do you think of the election? Do you think they were conducted properly? What could have been improved, in your opinion?
<dl>
<dd>I thought they were conducted properly according to what was agreed beforehand, and given the system which we have at our disposal, it's surprising and very pleasing that distasteful practices were much less widespread than they could be, which is a credit to the community and something to be proud of. Aside from the unregulatable phenomena of negative campaigning, one thing which I feel can be remedied is that of people posting misleading and false statements in oppose votes to generate negative momentum and scare off the electorate (eg, of pushing POV on articles the candidate did not edit, organising sockpuppets, etc). I personally feel that having a system where the voter submissions are made invisible until after the voting period would make this tactic mostly obsolete.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>What would you say to those who supported you? Opposed you?
<dl>
<dd>I hope that I can fulfil the expectations of those who supported me. I thank the opposers for being frank and giving me a piece of their mind, as a more comprehensive understanding of community sentiment can only help yield better results. I hope I can allay the concerns as to my suitability via my performance, and people are welcome to give me feedback, advice or criticism very liberally on my talk page or privately, especially if they did not give an explicit reason for their opposition.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>What do you think of the other Wikipedians who were appointed along with you?
<dl>
<dd>I have never worked with any of them previously, but I have observed them in action from afar over the last year and have been extremely impressed by and respect them for their judgment, maturity, article contributions, organisational skills, work ethic and wisdom. I think the elections produced a very good result.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>After about two weeks on the job, what are your initial thoughts?
<dl>
<dd>It seems like a large responsibility and a lot of work, especially because of the changeover, but I am confident that it will smooth out over time.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>How active a role do you plan to take on ArbCom workshop pages, and in writing ArbCom decisions, a role that has historically been handled mostly by just a few individuals?
<dl>
<dd>I do think that the workshop pages can be useful, so I intend to use them perhaps more than has been done historically, as I think it's useful to have discussion prior to the final decision. I do intend to help write the decisions on the new cases.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>What do you think are the strengths of the ArbCom? Weaknesses?
<dl>
<dd>I think that the strengths are mainly diverse representation as well as the community and arbitrators viewing its role seriously and thus examining things comprehensively to try and get the most effective solution. Speed is often a problem, mainly due to slow processing.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>If you could change anything, what would you change? Why?
<dl>
<dd>As far as the arbitration process goes, it's too early to tell.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Do you plan on finishing your term? If you had to make a choice right now, when your term expires, would you run for re-election? Why or why not?
<dl>
<dd>I do intend on finishing my term, and am not thinking about the December 2008 election.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>If there's one thing you could say to the Wikipedia community, what would you say, and why? Is there anything else you would like to mention?
<dl>
<dd>I would like to say that irrespective of what "positions" anybody holds on Wikipedia, the objective of the project is to write quality encyclopedia articles. Thus, everybody is an editor, first and foremost, and everything else is secondary and should be geared towards this. I certainly think of myself first and foremost as an editor and hope that the community thinks in the same way also. I guess the saying "It does not matter who is right, but what is right" is relevant here, as it is the content the world sees which is important, and that we would become a lot more efficient in getting closer to our goal if disputes were not framed in terms of personality, politics, winning and losing, etc, even if it is unspoken and psychological. I don't think that there is room to be complacent about the future success and growth of Wikipedia and everybody should always be looking for improvement.</dd>
