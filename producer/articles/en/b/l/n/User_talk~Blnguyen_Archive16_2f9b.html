<p>Dude Truebaka is my friend in real life. He only edits videogame articles. And Blnguyen he's your Vietnamese brother, so you wouldn't put a brother down would you? Tell Holywarroir to lay off.

<dl>
<dd>I'll reply here, since both of you seem to be looking around. There is nothing in <a href="../../../b/a/r/WP%7EBARN_563d.html" title="WP:BARN">WP:BARN</a> that prohibits the self-awarding of barnstars, and as far as I can tell, there is nothing that stops you from creating a sockpuppet to award yourself barnstars either, since self-awarded barnstars are not prohibited. For example <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">User:Anwar saadat</a> tried to remove "fake" barnstars from <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrin_f3e4.html" title="User:Prin">User:Prin</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Man%27s_Plans_291d.html" title="User:The Man's Plans">User:The Man's Plans</a>, but this was reverted. In general, it doesn't really matter, because barnstars are not the most accurate measure of one's contributions to the site, as some editors quietly contribute a lot, while others seem to get barnstars from their friends for things which may seem a little soft. However, barnstars are usually held in higher regard when "acknowledged" by more experienced and established editors. Of course, this is based on the assumption that Bakasuprman is being vain, which isn't a very good idea, eg see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. So no, there is no grounds for an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>, and persistently doing so may give you a poor reputation or a perception that you may be harassing other editors over frivolous matters.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 01:47, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, in case Holy is watching TrueBaka is NOT my sockpuppet. He's just my best bud and Baka was our clan name in videogames, which we transferred to Wikipedia.

<dd>If Bhaisaab did not see this quote, "it may not be the best idea to complain too much in case you do not want others to complain about yourself." By complaining about D-boy and Netaji, he invited us to scrutinize everything he says. D-boy told BhaiSaab to lay off and Netaji isn't here (wikibreak) so he asked me to represent our interests.

<dd>Well, coming from a person that violated 3RR <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:BhaiSaab_reported_by_User:Bakaman.25.25_.28Result:_No_block.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:BhaiSaab_reported_by_User:Bakaman.25.25_.28Result:_No_block.29" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Yes I know he did not get blocked, but I got blocked by an admin (unfairly, BhaiSaab never notified me of the copyright case) for "copyright vandalism" before I could make my case. He was confronted by three users on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_caste_system.html" title="Indian caste system">Indian caste system</a> page. At first he stated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indian_caste_system&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indian_caste_system&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> "this is all copyvio from <a href="http://www.boloji.com/history/018.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.boloji.com/history/018.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.boloji.com/history/018.htm</a>". Then in the talk page he starts to unravel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indian_caste_system#Vandalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indian_caste_system#Vandalism" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> when he starts spitting out the other pages it is sourced from. User:Pecher stated that there was "no reason given to delete well-sourced and relevant material" while D-boy reverted it. BhaiSaab vandalized the page while stating in the talk section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indian_caste_system#Vandalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indian_caste_system#Vandalism" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> "I am under no obligation to rewrite the material" after being confronted by myself and Pecher. Just yesterday, <a href="../../../k/r/s/User%7EKrsont_b3c0.html" title="User:Krsont">User:Krsont</a> and I almost went into an edit war but managed to discuss the issue in a constructive manner <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indian_caste_system#origins_section" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indian_caste_system#origins_section" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Krsont#Regarding_AIT" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Krsont#Regarding_AIT" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. Unlike Krsont who contributed to the page, BhaiSaab did nothing but VANDALIZE it, then sneakily get me blocked for "vandalism" while he made 5 reverts and took off the whole section on the Muslim caste system (something I doubt even the "pak" would do). <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub> 03:10, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the first four diffs cited by BhaiSaab, I can see that there is an inappropriate attempt to discredit other user's arguments based on their perceived religious bias or editing bias (which may or may not be true). Regardless of whether it is true, it is inappropriate to use a person's personal attack habits to create a diversion from the debate on whether content of the Fundy Watch page is appropriate or not. If you have a problem with someone's conduct please report it in the appropriate forum for dealing with personal attacks rather than as a leverage in a content debate.

<dd>Not a good idea to accuse other people of lying. It may be an honest mistake, eg, have you seen how difficult it is to prove that people have lied in court, senate inquiries, rather than give incorrect info out of ignorance. It is quite difficult to prove that someone has provided knowingly false info, and constitutes a personal attack.

Some of the sentences of the website aren't used, and some are used with half the sentence cut off, but definitely, everything that was in the article, was in the other website. Yes, the material should be rewritten, but copyvios need to be removed, so it is the correct thing to remove the copyvio pending a rewrite, rather than keep the copyvio pending a rewrite. Regardless of who is willing or unwilling to do the rewrite, the copyvio should be removed in the meantime.

<p>Hi Stifle. Could you point me to the info for this 3RR issue please? Bakasuprman and BhaiSaab have been sparring for a while now, the subcontinental religious stuff has flared up lately and I have a lot of notices on my talk page (from around 10 people) to intervene in a range of disputes and it gets hectic trawling through the edits of a dozen editors every day for possible misdemaenours. Its good to be careful since in this region of editing, there have been a lot of bogus reports like "vandalism" against "opposition" editors in an attempt to discredit them (one person even asked me to do a checkuser to see if another had been using socks to award themselves barnstars&#160;!?!?!).

<dd>Hello! It's very late here in the UK and I have had a long day, complete with needing to be in two places simultaneously and a three-hour trip to ER/ Casualty (no breaks or fractures to the metatarsals, just a lot of bruising that should disappear in a week). My Talk page seems to have turned in to a debating chamber for a couple of Indian editors, so I will give a comprehensive reply tomorrow afternoon UK time after work.

<dd>Hello again! Clearly the relationships between the Indian editors are contentious and contain many points of equivocation. I was not aware of this when the request for admin attention was posted to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. My reason for the temporary block was to cool the debate down, as the language used seemed hotter than I usually encounter in such matters. As you observe above and I now appreciate, this language usage is more common between this group of editors than in the general population. My reasons for the block were the copying of material from two websites on to the article:
<ul>

<dd>This does appear to have been blown out of all proportion by the editors concerned. I now appreciate that what originally appeared to be a relatively simple case of cooling off has some history behind it and that this group of editors and the nature of the material to which they contribute is rather more devisive than could be appreciated on a first scan.

<dd>Yes these are definitely not acceptable, and I have told him before many times to stop insinuating that other Indian users are "pak". Does "Paapistan" have any meaning or just something he made up. Also, it would be helpful to explain to me what "Dhimmitude" and "ajraf-hood" means.

<dd>Paapistan - Land of Sinners - ridicule of Pakistan which means Land of Holies</dd>
<dd>Dhimmitude - Dhimmi means protected - persons under Islamic rule who were obliged to pay a tax different to the religious tax - Zakat applied to Muslims.This is a popular terminology among Islam bashers like Daniel Pipes</dd>
<dd>Ajraf - I dont know but I remember seeing in the factlet pushed by one of the authors that it has something to with the alleged lower caste among Muslims.</dd>
<dd>Hindu right wing in India suspect Muslim's allegiance to the country hence the term Pak or Paki against them</dd>

<dd>Yes, there should be a notification of when the RfC is posted, did he do this? The RfC needs to have two people trying to solve the same problem with you. There is no evidence that two people have the same problem with you. In any case, the RfC isn't formatted properly and definitely the first two entries aren't even diffs and also, the first is a resolved content dispute, not a personal attack, the second is personal attacks by <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">User:Subhash bose</a>,and are formatted as sections not diffs.

I think perhaps a ceasefire would be in order and perhaps I get a few other Indian admins to look at the stuff on that talk page for a second opinon. And after your own testy dialogue it is not the best way to respond to another person's claims of impropreity by launching into more hostilities, which may prove their point.

<dd>He was notified of Third party arbitration on my talk page,where he pasted npa warning---I had tried to get other user to file the RFC,after which he would have been notified properly.But because nobody cosigned it---It was incomplete---and let us see if someone joins it in 48 hours---after which it automatically dies out.Regarding issue resolution ,this person was told many times at many ocassions to mend his ways.At Cal.TExt by Dab,In Afd by Rajib(where he abused everyone who voted against his will),here too you are almost daily feeding him.With so many people who had disputes against him and so many people trying to resolve with him,I thought it was proper to go for RFC,when he started testing the limits of my patience.<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior"><font style="background:red" color="white">Holy</font></a>|<a href="../../../h/o/l/User_talk%7EHolywarrior_488c.html" title="User talk:Holywarrior"><font style="background:silver" color="white">Warrior</font></a> 09:28, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No I suspected you were up to something. He never notified ME at all. He kept it on his talk page. In fact, if I hadn't suspected he was up to no good, I would not have seen the RfC.

<dd>The first block, the wording is unfortunate, I do not feel that copyrights are vandalism, but it was a clear infringement. I feel that the second block, clearly shows that the admin only took into account the latest stuff or went light, because 3 hours is a very short block for anything. I feel that you have been abrasive, making comments accusing others of being "liars" is inappropriate whilst you are seeking sanction against other users and seeking mediation. Also I noticed on Haphar's page in the last two days, since this mediation started, that you claimed that Lkadvani had taught him how to lie, which is a pretty big personal attack. So I'd say that you've been getting off lightly so far, although I still haven't gotten around to investigating what Holywarrior has said since this process began - I was thinking of an ceasefire/amnesty/parole agreement for the stuff that happened before then where there has been a case of two sides exchanging fire (except for the serious stuff of course). <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 03:41, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Blnguyen. I spent a little while reviewing the situation. It was good of you to lead the attempts to resolve this. Looks like all the major contributors were de-escalating somewhat until recently. I'd let the relevant RfC continue, and block particulars preventatively for egregious behaviour. My guess is that the California textbook talk page will cool down quickly. Beyond that, I don't know what to say. It's a tough one for sure. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">धर्म</a></small> 04:41, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
