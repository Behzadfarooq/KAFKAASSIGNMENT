<dd>If you think that the article can be made less dramatic, I have no objection, but I do not think some of your phrasing style makes the article smoother, and you divided one of the sentences into two, including a very short one about his father being the muezzin, which makes the prose less flowing. I retained the "mockingly applauded" because Pathan not only mocked Martyn, but sardonically clapped him. I just felt that "rose to gain selection" is smoother, but perhaps I am missing something.

<dd>No, the case would automatically involve all those who are arguing on the FLG pages, which is why the name should be changed to FLG. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:47, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I saw that you changed the ArbCom case against Samuel Luo to "Falun Gong", stating that "this case is a battle between a group of users who are single-issue editors who are either proponents or critics of FLG in real life". In my opinion, that reflects a misunderstanding of the meaning of the request. We've had real content disputes on the Falun Gong pages, but they're not to be mixed with this case. These articles have suffered from serious policy violations, and this question must be resolved before any further progress can be made. It is no accident that Samuel Luo has been banned five times already, whereas none of the other involved editors have received such penalties to my knowledge. Even though I don't completely oppose to extending the case, we must make sure that it focuses on these policy violations instead of any content disputes, and that the ArbCom clarifies this principle to all involved parties. Falun Gong arbitration has been refused once because the editors hadn't understood what the ArbCom is all about. ---<a href="../../../o/l/a/User%7EOlaf_Stephanos_b3d3.html" title="User:Olaf Stephanos">Olaf Stephanos</a> 02:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've pointed out the the clerks to consider changing the title, not because Samuel is the problem or not the problem, since I have not looked at the issues enough, but merely to maintain a sense of not prejudging who the problem is. Do see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_India-Pakistan_Proposed_decision_974f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/India-Pakistan/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/India-Pakistan/Proposed decision</a> where it seems that four Pakistani editors will be banned; the naming was changed from "Pakistani nationalism" so as to not pre-empt or pre-judge what the result may be. That is all. The first arbitration was refused because the parties did not spell out policy violations beyond a standard conflict over what content should be in the article. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:47, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Pardon my interjecting, but speaking as one of the clerks who help maintain these cases under the arbitrators' direction, we probably would have changed the casename anyway if the case was accepted. In fact, I had raised the question yesterday. There is a preference for casenames based on article titles or other things other than individual users whenever possible. This doesn't in any way restrict the arbitrators from examining all the evidence presented and making whatever decisions are appropriate. And you are right that ArbCom generally focuses on user conduct rather than content issues, but that also has nothing to do with the casename. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 02:44, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to interject too. I think that there is certainly a case for changing the name of the article and expanding the range of investigation, but I think Blnguyen's comment was a little off the mark. I think the mentality of characterising the problems raised in the request as a battle between two sides is exactly the mentality that we need to get away from. There is only one battle here, and it is between editors who conform to wikipedia policies and those who flaunt them -- that should be our criteria for evaluating this case, nothing else. If the case is accepted and the range of investigations expands from Samuel to every editor involved in the article I think that would also be useful. Whoever has been really breaking the rules in a bad way and refuses to change should be dealt with. It should be clear that this is about: <i>constant and unrepentant blanking of legitimate and sourced info with no discussion, inserting unsourced material and weasel words consistently, reverting deletions of these kinds of edits, refusal to discuss productively, consistently leaving misleading edit summaries,</i> etc. etc. This is what we are talking about here, and for whoever was doing that, including if it was meant to advocate for Falun Gong somehow, I too would want them to change their behaviour ot get booted off this project if they couldn't get up to speed. That kind of thing helps no one and needs to be unequivocally stamped out. The terms of discourse need to be very clear in dealing with this, and particularly in this ArbCom case, they need to be <i>super</i> clear. The users responsible for this kind of thing are doing all they can to smudge them, so it does not help to go along with it. It would be enough for Samuel simply to undo his latest series of edits and state clearly that he promises not to do those things again. Why doesn't he do it? --<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EAsdfg12345_de8a.html" title="User:Asdfg12345">Asdfg12345</a> 18:15, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blnguyen: here's the question that you should know the answer to regarding your involvement: Did you block/lock the editors on the grounds of edit warring, etc? If that is the only reason, then I see no reason for you to recuse from the case. - <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenwhale_84fe.html" title="User:Penwhale">Penwhale</a> | <a href="../../../p/e/n/User_talk%7EPenwhale_46c7.html" title="User talk:Penwhale">Blast the Penwhale</a> 23:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the blocks were for edit-warring and that's why I locked the page as well. That is usually enough to recuse - and is generally the standard used by arbitrators.

This was nothing but a stupid mistake on my part, and if you go through my posts on the evidence section, you will see that I hadnt even realised this until now. You should know me. I admit the mistakes I make, I dont deny them. I always back up my edits with sources and facts. Why would I make a change under a false edit summary when I am right about Jinnah being a Pakistani?

<p>In the light of neverending the hue and cry that Wikiraja has been raising with regards to our(mine and Gnanapiti's) so called 'sockpuppetry' case and also considering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=109228139&amp;oldid=108883800" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=109228139&amp;oldid=108883800" rel="nofollow"><b>this</b></a> comment by Blnuyen, I'd like to request the following from the admins.</p>
<p>Like it has been proved, I and Gnanapiti are neither sockpuppets nor meatpuppets. We both are independent editors and have our own interests too when it comes to editing articles. It is just a coincidence that we also share some interests. Like Blnguyen notes in that comment, both of us have always edited in good faith and contributed usefully.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that we were punished wrongly and come to think of it, Gnanapiti effectively served an extremely harsh <b>near one month block</b>. Thinking back, I feel that it was an atrocious thing to have subjected him to that. I dont think there is a precedent of this sort anywhere on Wikipedia. A one month block is something that I see handed out in the rarest of cases and only to people who are repeat violators, trolls and vandals.</p>
<p>People have gotten off with all sorts of nonsense. Even Wikiraja has. His template was patent nonsense and he kept edit warring with multiple editors on dozens of pages until it got deleted. And he doesnt even get a token punitive block! If Gnanapiti could have been subjected to a one month block on the basis of erroneous checkuser results, Wikiraja ought to serve atleast 6 months for his disruption. If anything, the community owes an apology to Gnanapiti. It is to his eternal credit that he continues to contribute handsomely and in good faith to Wikipedia. How easy it would have been to kill someone's enthusiasm and zeal with such draconian blocks.</p>
<p>And on top of all this, I dont see <i>any</i> reason that we should be suffering this ignominy of having to bear all the nonsense that the likes of Wikiraja have to offer. I request that all constraints on us be lifted. Its difficult to edit articles and contribute usefully if you have to be looking over your shoulder all the time.</p>
<p>I for one, atleast, cannot and will not keep watching my step to see if Gnanapiti is editing an article or not before I get down to edit it. I have always edited in good faith and will continue to do so. And, so has Gnana. Even when it comes to voting, I refuse to be held accountable. If one of our votes was invalid anywhere, it is for the admin to strike it off. I cannot be expected to scroll up and down a page looking for Gnana's name.

<dd>I actually haven't really read the article carefully and inspected all the language one by one. The detail of the international career looks as though it covers every Test series in detail, (seems like each of the 20 Tests are accounted for) And it appears that it summarises each ODI tournament, but I'll probably stop and take a look at the statsguru series summary to compare that a summary of each tournament is there. I guess I'll have to research the county stuff to see if anything really big happened there,....and test out each of the qualitative claims as well. I just tweaked one of the claims in the lead about the fielding which seemed to be a bit overoptimistic. Perhaps I must be a dire kind of guy or have a morbid fascination with badness, because <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbhajan_Singh_dba0.html" title="Harbhajan Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> is one of my favourite bowlers and the article seems to mention all manner of calamities! Aside from that, I have an ideological objection to including punditry from tabloid sources, so I am inclined to object to quotes by idiot tabloid commentators. That includes <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28Western_Australia%29_c966.html" title="The Sunday Times (Western Australia)">The Sunday Times (Western Australia)</a> which is a <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Murdoch_2da1.html" title="Rupert Murdoch">Murdoch</a> tabloid which has a certain writer Robert Craddock known for posting sensationalist drivel. After the 2004/05 Aus ODI season in which Australia defeated Pakistan 2-0 (both were closely contested 30 run wins in which Australia had a few umpiring benefits) he posted an article "can anybody give us a decent game" - After Lord's 2005 "Vaughan again losers" - After Ashes 2005 he described Australia as "flat-track bullies" and "pie-hitters" and said that it would take "10 years" to recover from "the depths" - and then two months later is going on about "the world" being "no match for Australia" and then after Ashes 06/07 and midway trhough the CB Series posted more drivel about how Australia were the "greatest ever team" going on about how Australia has plenty of quicks to replace McGrath, and then two weeks later said "Australia's WC campaign in disarray" and today as I speak moaning about Australia's death-bowling about how bad it was that Australia had 3 of the 10 most expensive death bowlers in ODIs. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 06:49, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
