<p>It is a widely circulated internet rumor that Shah Rukh did in fact father a child in Cambodia. Also on his behind the scenes DVD he specifically states that he married his wife before fame.

I'm not quite ready to submit myself to the nomination buzzsaw and, if I succeeded, to assume the responsibility. If SlimVirgin HAD left permanently, I probably would have, just to help fill in the gap, but since she's back, I can put off that decision for awhile (which reminds me, I should go over and leave her a message). --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 03:58, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, whatever. I still don't like being accused of vandalizing when I was at least attempting to follow Wikipedia's guidelines. I've run afoul of Wikisnob-powertripers before and without exception they violate Wikipedia's rules by claiming ownership of a certain article or subject and then delete-delete-delete everything I try to do. One of the aforementioned jerks even put a vandal tag on my talk page when the only alteration I've done was to correct the spelling of several words in the article. I'm getting just a bit tired of Wikians who feel they own Wikipedia and that I'm an intruder that can be squashed like a bug on a whim. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanr451_4a47.html" title="User:Seanr451">Seanr451</a> 20:59, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That inspired me to make 2 more articles in 2 days - see <a href="../../../m/r/i/Mrinalini_Sarabhai_fa99.html" title="Mrinalini Sarabhai">Mrinalini Sarabhai</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu_Narayan_Bhatkhande_c22c.html" title="Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande">Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande</a>. I have nominated some nice facts from both the articles at <a href="../../../d/i/d/Template_talk%7EDid_you_know_8ba7.html" title="Template talk:Did you know">DYK talk</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>...that Indian classical dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai was married to Vikram Sarabhai, considered to be the Father of the Indian space program?</li>
<li>...that Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was a Hindustani classical musician widely acclaimed to have brought in a rennaisance in Hindustani music by his reorganisation of Ragas?</li>
<li>...that the well known Hindustani classical musician Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was born on the auspicious Hindu festival called Janmashtami and died on another auspicious Hindu festival called Ganesh Chaturthi?</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look if you have time. Thanks once again. Will also consider those things which you mailed me after I finish my quota of interesting stuff.

<dd>Actually your comments might be useful. Baratveer's interventions in this article are questionable.

<dd>This user has a history of good-faith contributions interspersed with over-the-top remarks (though nothing approaching this photo). I think he's spent too much time at Little Green Footballs or something, and doesn't understand the proper limits of Wikipedia discourse. As the proud nominator for speedy delete, the photograph was a disgrace, compounded by the lack of legitimate copyright data. This kind of thing just <i>can't</i> be on or associated with Wikipedia. However, I see no reason to assume that he won't comply with WP policies in the future, particularly now that he knows they're enforced. The goal here should be not to punish him per se, but to bring him into compliance. I don't believe he's ever received so much as a warning. I'm curious to see what he'll have to say (if anything) when he sees he's been blocked, and reserve judgement until then.Timothy Usher 03:44, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, I am interested to know why it is that you keep removing the info on gangs in Narre Warren South. There is more to this situation than you realise. There is verifiable information on these gangs and I am trying to get these users to understand about how wikipedia works and how academic referencing in general works. These kids are extremely marginalised and having someone come along and just delete stuff that they have done in an attempt to engage with society is just devastating for them. Instead of just deleting stuff, how about you engage with these users by leaving comments on the talk page? This will help them to learn and to feel included and not continue to feel that they are being rejected. You are asking them to validate their existence. They are saying they exist and you are saying they don't. Think about this for a bit and consider why they should not just flat out laugh at you. Wikipedia works by people communicating with each other, not just deleting things with no comments.</p>

<dd>I still believe you are not backing up your support of a separate Melbourne Uni Football Club article with any great attention to detail. Your perception of the strength of the article is coloured by considering the VFL of the 1910's to be the same as the AFL of the modern era. The VFL has undergone a metmorphosis from a provincial competition to a national one. At the time of the MUFC involvement it was not the premier league in the country. I have added more detail to my arguament on the discussion page for <a href="../../../m/e/l/Talk%7EMelbourne_University_Football_Club_181d.html" title="Talk:Melbourne University Football Club">Talk:Melbourne_University_Football_Club</a>. <a href="../../../o/z/d/User%7EOzdaren_c4de.html" title="User:Ozdaren">Ozdaren</a> 14:32, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You recently blocked me for 24 hours for reverting repeated blanking by ER MD. In the future, I will be careful not to break the 3R rule even in the case of blanking. I thought it was justified in this case under the "all points of view will be represented" clause.</p>
<p>I don't know if you want to involve yourself in the case further, but you suggested I try the talk page. Prior to reverting the blanking, I tried to talk with ER MD for a month without any progress. I offered repeated compromises, he blanked. I did repeated rewrites, he blanked. I repeatedly asked him what he wanted, he blanked.</p>
<p>I used a quote from Roman historian Livy. He called it POV and OR and blanked it. I used a quote from Pulitzer Prize winning historian Will Durant. He called it POV and OR and blanked it. Now, I am back from my 24 hour block, only to find the entire section blanked and protected.</p>

<p>You speedied this article although the notability was contested wiht sourcing in the AfD. Isn't the assertion enough to keep it from being speedied?

<dd>Well, I'm a bit sorry I didn't notice that external link, but I deleted it because the article itself didn't assert anything, and it appears to have been speedied before by two other admins. Although I'm open to reopening if you tell me what the website claimed, as many bands have been deleted despite claiming "well known" - it would seem normal procedure that it is speedy deleted, unless it asserts to having an album/deal which meets the criteria.

<p>As the pig image was massively <i>beyond the pale</i> and this editor had also engaged in other hate speech on his user page, I've proposed that he be indefinitely blocked.

<p>Yes, I know, you're probably sick of hearing about this, by now. <i>But.</i> I'm here to let you know that someone has requested that the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">Mediation Cabal</a> attempt to calm down the situation. If you're not interested, feel free to disregard this message. If you are interested, I'll ask that you try to put any harsh feelings behind you, and remember that you and all of the editors around you are all trying to build the best Wikipedia possible; disagreements in how to do so shouldn't get in the way of our <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> towards each other. Wikipedia is not particularly accessible to newcomers, and as beneficial new users are arguably our greatest resource, we would <a href="../../../d/b/t/WP%7EDBTN_1b88.html" title="WP:DBTN">do well to remember</a> that they can have thin skins. Likewise, I've known firsthand how tiresome it can get, reverting vandal after vandal, and I see that you have a history protecting this article in particular.</p>
<p>Now, the link in question does have some issues, for and against it; I find things to sympathize with and things to fault in all parties, here. For the time being, my interest is in calming things down. I would appreciate it if you (along with any other involved editors) would agree to set aside hard feelings in the pursuit of a better Wikipedia -- our reputation on an encyclopedia depends heavily on interactions between editors. All that much better if we can all agree to work side-by-side, and do so in a public, transparent forum for all to see. Let's try to make this a positive experience for everyone.</p>
<p>I am of course aware that you are an administrator. I have nothing but respect for your position, your experience, and your contributions to Wikipedia. Thank you for the time you've taken to read my message, and any subsequent time you might put into this case.</p>
<p>The particular case page can be found <b><a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-06-16_alumni_link_78f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-06-16 alumni link">here</a></b>.
