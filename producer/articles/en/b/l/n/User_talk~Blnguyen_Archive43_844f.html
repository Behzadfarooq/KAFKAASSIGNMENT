<p>Hello. I just stumbled upon a whole series of open proxy edits involved in vote-stacking AfD's, harssing users, etc. Would you mind having a look? Due to the context, I think it is a user you blocked. I started noticing all sorts of them stemming from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMattisse&amp;diff=107303703&amp;oldid=107252041" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AMattisse&amp;diff=107303703&amp;oldid=107252041" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. I verified all of these are Tor open proxy editors, but there are probably more.</p>

Talk about self hatred, ( after accusing the world of it). You have been claiming that you do not attack islam but protect Hinduism from attacks. The language above is very much attacking Islam.

<dd>Here I am accusing Shiva’s Trident of attacking a religion and there is no "reservation of rights " for me to attack any religion.&#160;? Where have I attacked any religion&#160;? The passage "All this, combined with the fact that India is a stinking hellhole of a country compared to America, Israel, or even SAUDI ARABIA (wtf!)". is a quotation from Shiva’s earlier post that I am quoting back to him.</dd>
<dd>This is not the kind of interpretation one expects from an admin, much less from an Arbcom admin&#160;!. So I would want you to take back your comments on "attacking religion". If you want a translation of the Punjabi couplet recited above and an analysis of it’s meaning, I would do that also, it comments upon the other User’s intelligence and has no religious connotations. If you want exact meanings please let me know and I would oblige.</dd>

<p>Hi, I noticed that the title of Rama's arrow's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Pakistani_nationalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Pakistani_nationalism" rel="nofollow">Request for Arbitration</a> had been changed to "Pakistani Nationalism." I think the new title unfairly tilts the balance in favor of the initiator, Rama's arrow. I am not sure if everyone knows that the RfArb was initiated by Rama's arrow at 16:59, 12 February 2007 (UTC), a full 16 minutes <i>after</i> (and therefore likely in reaction to) an <i>incident</i> at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, <i>against Rama's arrow</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive198#admin_abusing_his_privileges|See" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive198#admin_abusing_his_privileges|See" rel="nofollow">See here:"Admin abusing his privileges"</a>) filed at 16:43, 12 February 2007, by the other editors (Pakistani) now involved in this RfArb. As a neutral editor who has battled both sides in this dispute at different times and occasions, my own view is that nationalism exists on both sides of the Pakistan-India border and both sides are equally prolific in edit-wars on Wikipedia. In my perspective, Rama's arrow has been selectively aggressive towards Pakistani editors and, correspondingly, selectively benign towards Indian editors. I think the way that this RfArb is framed, Rama's arrow comes out looking as a concerned, but, perhaps, neutral administrator and his <i>interlocutors</i> as somewhat rabid nationalists. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 20:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi you deleted some external links i put on the Bill Clinton page, blocked my account and labled me a spammer. i understand why--i violated the rule of not posting links to a site you are affiliated with. However, i did not violate the spirit of the rule. I run the library at the Miller Center and make available online literally over 3,000 hours of multimedia resource related to the presidency. One of the links you deleted was to a speech page that makes available to the public complete audio of 10 of Bill Clinton's speeches. This material is not available online anywhere else as far as I know. It is a resource we make avaialble for free. The Miller Center is part of the University of Virginia and is non-partisan. Nobody who visited the page would ever consider it spam and any reasonable person would consider an ideal external link. Here is the link for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.millercenter.virginia.edu/index.php/scripps/digitalarchive/speechDetail/34" class="external free" title="http://www.millercenter.virginia.edu/index.php/scripps/digitalarchive/speechDetail/34" rel="nofollow">http://www.millercenter.virginia.edu/index.php/scripps/digitalarchive/speechDetail/34</a></p>
<p>It has been suggested to me to request that editors of the pages add links via the discussion pages. In theory this sounds fine, however in practice this does not work. I have a wealth of information on all 42 presidents that i would like to make available to the wikipedia audience. I realistically do not have the time to engage in a discussion about every link that i would like to put on these pages (this assumes that editors of pages even respond to my request). Furthermore, links that i have come accross in the past posted by other users are often quite inaccurate in their description. These are honest mistakes but mistakes none the less. according to the posting rules i do not have the right to even fix those mistakes but rather must go back to the discussion board and request that someone fix them for me. The Miller Center is considered the foremost authority on the American Presidency. We have a treasure trove of material that cannot be found anywhere else in the world (e.g. over 150 hours of complete audio of presidential speeches, over 3,000 hours of secretly recorded conversations from presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon; the authoritative oral histories of the Carter and Reagan presidencies, and a number of in depth bibliographies on each president). It would be a shame that these unique and free resources cannot be made available to the wikipedia audience because of a rule that was clearly NOT put in place to stop the type of actions that i am attempting. I would appreciate your suggestions on how to proceed. Many thanks.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recall seeing a statement by you making a statement on sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sarvagnya/Archive_7#Email" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sarvagnya/Archive_7#Email" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This was due to <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> confirming that both <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> and <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnanapiti_b22e.html" title="User:Gnanapiti">Gnanapiti</a> are sockpuppets <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser%2FCase%2FSarvagnya&amp;diff=85077436&amp;oldid=82981280" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_checkuser%2FCase%2FSarvagnya&amp;diff=85077436&amp;oldid=82981280" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The account for <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnanapiti_b22e.html" title="User:Gnanapiti">Gnanapiti</a> was warned not to edit on a same page as <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a>. However, after being warned, both accounts were used in a vote fraud <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=106859491&amp;oldid=106859337" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=106859491&amp;oldid=106859337" rel="nofollow">here</a> by user acount of <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=106849442&amp;oldid=106849097" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=106849442&amp;oldid=106849097" rel="nofollow">here</a> by user account <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnanapiti_b22e.html" title="User:Gnanapiti">Gnanapiti</a>.</p>
<p>With all due respect, I have reported <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> for his incivil behavior, trolling, and abuse of accounts on the Admin Notification of Incidents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive198#Problems_with_user_Sarvagnya" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive198#Problems_with_user_Sarvagnya" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Instead, I have been bombarded for improper uploading of images. I understand that per procedure as an admin, it is your duty to see to it that editors follow the rules and have accepted your requests and questions to my uploading. Furthermore, I have taken care of that situation. However, it seems that regardless of the report I made, it has been left undone. As administrator of Wikipedia, I ask for justice and equality in dealing with the editors on Wikipedia. Please look into this situation regarding <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> and take the appropriate action. As it shows, I am not the only one who has requested a check user on <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Sarvagnya" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Sarvagnya" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>And it has been refuted. They are free subject to the restrictions above. These were stated after the first positive check. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, bascially it is not ok to conduct sockpuppetry, but it is ok to be involved with meatpuppetry? I thought you had stated the same thing against that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=85191446&amp;oldid=85093631" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;diff=85191446&amp;oldid=85093631" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I do not understand why some people can get let off the hook so easy. What does it matter if both accounts are used on lines of Kannada language or not? What if it is on the lines of Tamil language, would that count? Well, it looks like the two user accounts have engaged in a battle on Kannada lines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yakshagana" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yakshagana" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 05:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, they are allowed to collaborate to improve an article etc, etc, it means that if they revert in a group, they only get three reverts together, so to speak. Yeah, they aren't supposed to vote together on Kannada or topics which are based on linguistic lines. In this case that means the Sarvabhaum ban, although it had no effect on the outcome. You can point this out to them I suppose, or if they do it again, simply point out on the voting page that they are under these restrictions so that the administrator who closes the debate doesn't double count (although it strictly isn't a count). <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:00, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm fully aware of the past checkuser results, and Sarvabhaum has already told everybody he introduced Gnanapiti to Wikipedia when Gnanapiti visited him. After the second check, they were in two different places after Gnanapiti went home to a faraway location. So they are free to edit, except if they team up in a linguistic battle upon Kannada lines, they don't get counted as two people, since Gnanapiti was introduced to Wikipedia by Sarvagnya in that context. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Wikiraja, let me please clarify something for the last time in the admin's presence. I and Gnanapiti(we are two different people, not me with two accounts) were <i>accused</i> of sockpuppetry by Bakasuprman a few months ago. The initial checkuser upheld it. But both of us appealed and upon further investigation, we were <i>cleared</i> of sockpuppetry charges. Btw, 'sockpuppetry' is when <i>one</i> person uses multiple accounts in <i>bad faith</i>.</p>
<p>Now the other concern that then cropped up was of 'meatpuppetry'. Meatpuppetry is when, two or more people in cohorts with each other act in bad faith to push their POV. Now, let me clarify something here.</p>
<p>I <i>introduced</i> Gnanapiti to wikipedia(en.wiki). I only taught him how wiki works, how to edit and inane stuff like that. This does <i>not</i> constitute meatpuppetry by any stretch of imagination. If anything the project needs more people like me who will bring in more editors to build this encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I did <i>not</i> implant any 'ideology' in his head. Whatever his views are, they are <i>purely</i> his own. I have no control over his thought processes. He is a responsible adult and is certainly more than capable of taking a stance about anything. As for my own views, needless to say, they are <i>my</i> own.</p>
<p>So there we have it. Sockpuppetry accusations were hogwash. And meatpuppetry concerns misplaced. And in spite of this, Gnanapiti was effectively <i>blocked</i> for almost a month for no fault of his or mine.</p>
<p>As for Yakshagana, stop giving it a spurious spin. Let me tell it the way it is. Gnanapiti has an interest in Yakshagana and has been editing that article for a long time. As for me, that article was not even on my watchlist. However, I have an interest in what you call 'Dravidian' topics and few of them are on my watchlist. I therefore happened to come across your templates and therefore I landed on Talk:Dravidian topics or one of those 'Dravidian' talk pages. The discussions there went on and on and on with you stubbornly stonewalling. It then started spilling over to multiple talk pages with you leading me from one page to another. I myself had been a part of the discussions on few of them. It was then that I happened to observe that the discussion had reached <a href="../../../y/a/k/Talk%7EYakshagana_3ee1.html" title="Talk:Yakshagana">Talk:Yakshagana</a> too. It was <i>then</i> that I landed on Talk:Yakshagana. <i>You</i> led me there.</p>
<p>As for your charge of votestacking (1) neither Sarvabhaum nor the template votes were 'linguistic' (2) the extra vote <i>hardly</i> mattered. Decision was almost unanimous (3) <i>like I said, we are neither sockpuppets nor meatpuppets. So it is not very easy to keep a track of what the other is doing. When I vote somewhere, believe me, I dont bother(and cant be expected) looking up and scanning for Gnanapiti's name each time. I just go and vote. Thats all. If anybody(admin or anyone) has concerns about both of us voting, it is upto them to keep an eye out and strike out one of us.</i></p>
<p>So stop your crowing and get back to doing something useful. Your non stop tirade against me, your vague templates or your copyvios are of no use to wikipedia. So stop it and stop it NOW! <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 17:06, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Dear Blnguyen</b> - I think I've clarified this as best as I could. I will not respond to any further trolling on his part. If he again uses terms like vandal, votefraud, votestacking, sockpuppetry, meatpuppetry etc to describe me or Gnanapiti, I request that you block him for disruption. I think I've explained enough. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 17:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>To Blngyen:</b> What do you have to say about this? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 09:02, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd prefer it if they did not vote together or double-revert on things that are divisive along linguistically/regional lines, as that was the agreement I believe. Sarvabhaum is an example of a Marathi editor who was involved in fights against Kannada users, so that qualifies as a linguistic/regional dispute, and thus I don' think they should have voted there or on the Dravidian template. As it was, it caused no issues. This does not mean that they cannot collaborate productively to improve an article, it only applies to team-warring and double voting. If they both help to simply improve an article is no problem. The other thing about the question of meatpuppetry is that both people are working properly on articles in their own right, rather than simply being recruited as a tool of convenience for an extra revert-vote quota, so I wonder what Dmcdevit an Aksi_great would think about whether the restrictions should eventually be relaxed entirely. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 04:13, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No offence to you or anything, but I feel that is favoritism towards Sarvagnya. There were a few times you have contradicted yourself. Now, Sarvabhaum is brought up. Is this another excuse for not dealing with Sarvagnya? I am not trying to start any trouble or anything, but I thought rules were rules. There was nothing productive in trying to get rid of the Dravidian topics template, accept for a productive POV. I understand your interest in the Kannadiga culture which I admire. However, that does not make it right to take a particular side because of interest in that group. Once again, that is called favoritism. Sorry to sound harsh, but I had to tell it like it is. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 04:21, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think that is the case. Sarvabhaum the Marathi was blocked because he broke 3RR and then evaded it and create sockpuppets and continued over and over. I nominated the template simply because I feel that it links too many weakly related things together. I also blocked Sarvagnya once last year. I don't think it is accurate to say that I have a special interest in Kannada culture at all; it is simply that the wars that occurred on Wikipedia were in that topic. As for my editing interests, a look at my records <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_Contributions_088e.html" title="User:Blnguyen/Contributions">User:Blnguyen/Contributions</a> doesn't show anything much in India apart from some cricket and Buddhism articles.

<dd>I saw that you have blocked Sarvagnya sometime last year. Anyways, Sarvagnya has a very rude, incivil, and bullyish attitude towars other editors on Wikipedia. Furthermore, it seems that he is treating you like his personal genie.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 06:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
