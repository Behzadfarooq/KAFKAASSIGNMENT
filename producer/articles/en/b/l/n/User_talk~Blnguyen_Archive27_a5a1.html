<p>Dear admin, I request u to take some steps against this vandal,Sarvagnya.He has been lost his battles in Belgaon or Kaveri and hence he is coming on Marathi people page to show its colors.I am naming it battle because this guy is extraordinarily rude and arrogant to work with. If he can vandalise Marathi people article,I can vandalise Kannadi people article also.I request u mediate. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 10:08, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Admin, I request you to take this continuous accusations of vandalism on me with great seriousness. You know what edits I had made on the Marathi article. If I had to be frivolous I could add fact tags for every line on the article. But everyone knows its not so. Also note Mahawiki's edit son the <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri.html" title="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> page. Even there like everywhere else, he knows zero about the subject but is simply trolling to his heart's content. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 14:23, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear admin, Please note that Sarvagnya has made some nasty comments about Chhatrapati Shivaji, of whom we are extremelely proud of.Who the hell is he to question the greatness of Shivaji Maharaj?Ask him to go and develop article on that Bangalorean amma rather than defaming our idols. He has posted some idiotic comments about Rama and Krishna on <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri.html" title="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> page.He is deliberately hurting our sentiments.How can he ask for citations for each and every sentence on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi_people</a>?Plz see the Kaveri talk to see how this guy blabbers all nonsense original reaseach and assumes our nod for that.</p>
<p>To be very frank,working with these kind of ppl is a headache.These ppl are marketing Karnataka everywhere.Note,that we have removed all <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> statements on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi_people</a> on ur insistance,but Kannadised <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">rashtrakuta</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri.html" title="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> and belive me, many others are still continue to be advertisements of Kannadi culture and language.See <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> talk page,these ppl are busy promoting it as a classical language when Kannada is perhaps a dialect of Tamil! MANY EDITORS have questioned it. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 14:33, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I must add that Sarvagnya is being quite uncivil in his approach. Earlier, he didn't use to comment on me, but since I added my comment on Kavery talk page he is stalking my edits and openly attacking me. See talk page of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi people</a> for instance. Another thing is he is deliberately insulting us. Check out his comments on Rama and Krishna. Also, see the edit summaries on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi people</a> history page. He typed <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">Shivaji</a> as "<b>Sevooji</b>". Check it out here - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marathi_people&amp;curid=4841708&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marathi_people&amp;curid=4841708&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>. It's extremely insulting for us. He also questions the greatness of Shivaji. In short, he is provoking us without any reason. I never went to talk with him, nor have I edited any of the articles he's edited. Still he is making insulting remarks about our culture. Apart from this, I second what Mahawiki has said about Kannada propaganda.</dd>

<p>Dear sir, the same wikipedian <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> is back to throwing prolific quantities of <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> includes.

It would not bee too difficult for me to do the same on pages of his interest also, but out of civity i have decided to bring you in at this point.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, the last message left by Mahawiki shows a clear "Tit-for_Tat" mentality that robs wikipedia of its real purpose, to bring reasonable info to the public. What someone does to one page cannot be used as a reason to throw grabage on another totally unrelated page. Please block him.</p>
<p>Dinesh Kannambadi</p>
<p>Dear admin , I am reverting back Rashtrakuta.Plz advice that guy against his revenge and Tit-for-tat mentality.Just because I edited Kaveri he added <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags everywhere on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi_people</a>. And its Dinesh who needs to be blocked with sarvagnya for their sheer narrow minded mentality of thinking Kannada is best, Tamil and Marathi are crap!Admin,once again let me request u to check the articles which I have been mentioning from long back.These Kannadis choose biased sources and then 'kannadise' it.Dont forget that <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solapur.html" title="Solapur">Solapur</a> have been rectified by u,but <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">Rajkumar</a> <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri.html" title="Kaveri">kaveri</a> and many other articles along with <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">rashtrakuta</a> are NOTHING SHORT OF ADVERTISEMENTS . This guy Sarvagnya is rediculuous!!I think he thinks of me all 24 hours and perhaps I haunt him in his dreams!</p>
<p>To add,his friend has already reverted the article.Plz ask Sarvagnya not to create trouble at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi_people</a> unnecessarily. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 14:40, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly I am getting really busy IRL, so I can only make some quick comments</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi people</a> had some lots of hyperbolic/hagiographic assertions and adjectives which are inappropriate, and violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which I have pointed out today</li>
<li>Although POV, it would not be so clever for Sarvagnya or Dinesh point this out so much given the past history - it would be better a third party do this - If Mahawiki and Arya Rajya Maharashtra sudmitted this to <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">WP:DYK</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">Featured Articles</a> any passing editors or admins would oppose due to the current inadequate level of the article.</li>
<li>A tit-for-tat citation nit-picking war is bad - wrt those Karnataka pages</li>
<li>Using a Wikipedia article as a reference is circular reasoning and is considered invalid - you cannot cite yourself!</li>
<li>I will hopefully look at the articles myself soon</li>
<li>Comments implying vandalism are wrong, and nonsensical and innappropriate threats to engage in counter-Kannada vandalism is disruption and will result in a block - also see <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation</li>

<li>The heated talk and words like "warmonger" are not acceptable. Blocks will be coming if this does not stop.</li>
<li>Scrutiny in cleaning up <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi people</a> will lead to a good article educating the world about Marathi people <i>sooner</i> . This would increase the likelihood that the article gets on the front page so that people can read about the culture of Maharashtra.</li>

<dd>Though I think KNM is is right, I dont see Haphar or Sarvagnya as a quotable user on the matter. They both have indulged in name-calling. Dineshkanna... is a party to the ongoing dispute so he shouldnt be quoted.

<dd>What name calling? And party to what dispute? Dont mix issues. If you have anything to say about this particular issue, say that and end it.

How low does this sarvagnya stoop!I am sorry for my poor English,I wanted to write it 'BUT'.He is trying all the techniques to woo admin!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;*Yeah,U know what, i dont have any personal grudges against him.Nut he's surely gave in to those Kannadi vandalisers and he surely thinks I am a mindless roudy vandaliser!I feel very bad when he is being partial.&lt;&lt; This is the whole para,go through it again,Replace N with B,and see.I didnt have any intentions to defame admin.Sarvagnya is trying hard to get me blocked! <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 04:12, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Mahawiki has not been that much uncivil. If these Kannada fanatics provoke us what will be do. We do get angry. But you can see that it is almost always initiated by Sarvagnya. Check out my contribs. I have never edited anything which Sarvagnya is working on (although I do wonder what he works on....apart from badmouthing others and stalking others). Mahawiki was blocked once, but Sarvagnya was never punished for his constant badmouthing of Marathi leaders. As for Kannadi term, he also uses Marati,etc. Anyway, Kannadi was never a slang.</dd>

<p>I think the important reason why Sarvagnya stalked mahawiki is that he did not want the article <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi_people.html" title="Marathi people">Marathi people</a></i> to be included in DYK. We, me and mahawiki were rapidly expanding the said article. But Sarvagnya didn't want anything Marathi to go to DYK. That's why he deliberately poked into the article and added fact tags everywhere. We, simple people, got trapped in his evil games and tried to answer him but he again started distracting us. And now he has sent his buddy <a href="../../../v/g/o/User%7EVgowda_edde.html" title="User:Vgowda">User:Vgowda</a> as <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirtinat_Kamat_ac96.html" title="User:Kirtinat Kamat">User:Kirtinat Kamat</a> to again start ranting anti-Marathi comments.

<p>Dear Admin, It is very unfortunate that the troll Sarvagnya has vandalised Marathi people article and kept us busy arguing with us to stop making that article into DYK status.Yes he deserves to be called as troll and vandaliser.Its high time u should do to this guy who's unnecessarily bothering us.He is following my contribs and ruining every other article which i touch.Obviously he looked into my discussions with Arya, u and Bhadani about making that article of DYK status and then jumped in there.U and other users had notified us about POV and we were more than ready to correct it,but this guy started a war there.Everything cannot be backed by citations on wikipedia.His interference provoked us and article lost its way.I request to take strongest possible action against him.Why is he filling up ur talk page ranting against me?Why does he unnecessarily create issues??Plz look into the matter.Sarvagnya's behaviour is highly objectionable.I plead u to sort out this matter.</p>
<p>I genuinely intended of contributing to make Marathi people article a DYK.I knew there were zillions of issues which needed to work upon and we were ready to do so as u had suggested.Arya has been working hard on this article.Since 5 days have been passed,can we still attain the 'goal'?It will be very sad if ur answer is no..I demand strongest possible action against Sarvagnya. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 08:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sir, Mahawiki is back to tagging. The page <a href="../../../s/e/u/Seuna.html" title="Seuna">Seuna</a> which has been develpoed by me with a reliable source reference had been tagged without even a hint of discussion. He has called it Kannadaization again without taking the trouble to read up on history. I have told him I shall also include material from a second scholar for purposes of credibility. You may be required to intervene if he continues to Tag it. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 14:43, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reliable source that Dinesh refers to is <i>"Kamat's Potpourri"</i>, a totally Kannada nationalist forum with an equally fanatic author/owner infamous in Maharashtra for his anti-Marathi bias. And to say he is reliable is tomfoolery. Mahawiki did the right thing by tagging the article. In fact, I only informed him about this. I didnt tag the article myself since I wasnt so sure about Yadavas but that was only because of this article by Kannadabadi. We have been taught in school that Yadavas were Marathi, and what is this&#160;? This guy seems hellbent on propogating Kannadi culture everywhere. Look at the articles he has created - Great Kannada Expansion, and so on... The scholars he qoutes are total Kannadi fanatics. Please stop this Kannadization, for God's sake</dd>

<dd>First of all, Dinesh hasnt quoted from <a href="http://www.kamat.org" class="external text" title="http://www.kamat.org" rel="nofollow">Kamat's Potpourri</a>. And second of all, the Kamat of Kamat's Potpourri and Suryanath Kamath(who is the one who has been cited) are <b>not related in any way</b>. Number three, the Kamats who run Kamat's Potpourri are highly celebrated and respected historians in their own right. Number four, branding anybody who has views opposed to yours(never mind that your views are uninformed at best and novice or worse at worst) as fanatics is and will certainly be considered incivility on Wikipedia. Refrain from doing that. If you have any sources to cite other than your own POV, please do so, discuss on the talk page and we can certainly make any changes if warranted. Until then, stop raising a hue and cry about every article that mentions the word "Kannada". <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:13, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear admin, This is a classic case of cultural invasion.i intend to prepare a new article for Yadava dynasty.I request u to see the article <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauna.html" title="Sauna">Sauna</a> and see how Kannada is being glorified against Marathi and Sanskrit.Instrestingly all articles created by Dinesh has that notorious books 'of history of Karnataka' by some Kamath.He seems to be a good fiction writer than historian.Note that <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telgu.html" title="Telgu">Telgu</a> wikipedians have also objected the rediculuous premise of <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara_empire.html" title="Vijayanagara empire">Vijayanagara_empire</a> article.This is the worst case of POV pushing in Wikipedia.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 09:11, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi dear Admin,</p>
<p>This is to bring to your notice the wiki-feud I've been having with <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> for almost one month now. It started with the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> page which went to mediation, warnings were handed out to both parties, and when Mahawiki's incivil ways continued, Admin:Bluyugen handed him a warning and then a block. Find that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mahawiki/Archive/Archive_01&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mahawiki/Archive/Archive_01&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>I do not want to turn the clock back and go through all those content disputes again. Infact, I dont want to present to you the details of <b>any content dispute</b> we've had. All I want to present to you is the brazen incivility and personal attacks being committed by <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> either in the course of his content disputes or even simply just out of spite.</p>
<p>All the diffs(exhibiting his incivility and personal attacks) I provide below are from <b>AFTER, <u>I REPEAT, "AFTER"</u>. ADMIN BLUGYUEN INTERVENED, WARNED ALL OF US, AND HANDED MAHAWIKI A BLOCK.</b></p>
<p>Please find below dozens of instances of blatant incivility and personal attacks by <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> either on me or on <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">User:Dineshkannambadi</a> and all <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadiga.html" title="Kannadiga">Kannadigas</a> in general. His remarks are in extremely bad taste and counterproductive resulting in undermining of the good faith efforts of the other editors to carry on editing their articles.</p>
<p>While I dont want to go into each and every diff and explain it, just to give you a sample of his incivility, he has made edits where, even if only in jest or sarcasm, he makes atrocious claims like, I am on a <i><b>kill Mahawiki</b></i> mission, that User:Dineshkannambadi is the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> (Bin) Laden(sic). In another edit, even if only for jest(which I certainly dont find amusing nor appreciate esp., when it comes from him), he has threatened to <b>sue me</b>. He has called us <i>cultural</i> <b>TERRORISTS</b>, losers, notorious, shameless etc., etc. He uses the word vandalism like one would use 'Hi' and 'Hello'.</p>
<p>Find all the above and much much much more in the diffs I've provided below. <b>Whats worse is his antics are going unchecked because Admin:Blugyen who knows about our feud is on a wikibreak and Admin:Sundar whose intervention I've sought more than once, is busy with other things(I presume, in real life) - which ofcourse, I dont hold against either of them.</b></p>
<p>But wikipedia will be a poorer place if brazen incivility like this goes unchecked for weeks simply because many admins dont know about it or the ones who know are by force of circumstances, too busy to deal with it.</p>
<p>I request immediate and harsh action on Mahawiki.</p>
<p>Once again, let me remind everyone that in the links below, <b>none</b> of them pertain to any content disputes. I belive in dealing with the content disputes on the relevant talk pages and dont usually bring it out on user talk pages.</p>
<p>Infact, I have even not listed below, the atrocious claim he made a couple of days ago that I had <b>deleted and later undeleted</b> an article. Also not listed below is his blatant removal of {{fact}} tags I had added in a couple of articles without even clarifying or providing a citation for the claim which I had tagged. Also not listed below may be umpteen other instances of incivility and npa violations on his part that I might have missed.</p>
<p><b>All the diffs</b> below deal <b>purely and only</b> with his brazen incivil comments and personal attacks not just on me, but on User:Dineshkannambadi and also highly respected historians like Mr. Suryanath Kamath et al(who have been cited in some articles by Dinesh) whom he has trashed and dismissed in the most uncivil manner possible.</p>
<p>Apart from this he also makes disparaging remarks on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> politicians who he keeps claiming are oppressing and torturing <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> speaking people in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>. This is not a content dispute, this is plain nonsense and insanely belligerent language.</p>
<p>His incivility apart, he has made it a habit and a routine to go around all over wikipedia branding me and Dinesh as 'Kannadi' vandals bent on <i>Kannadizing</i> all articles we touch. Ask him if we have included any uncited material or if we has ever cited any references for his numerous claims or whether he has taken it up on the article talk page instead of on a random user talk page. His answer will be negative. And yet, that doesnt stop him from going around shouting that we have been vandalising articles!!</p>
<p>Anway, I dont want to veer this towards the 'content disputes' which is a whole different matter altogether. Content disputes can always be discussed and agreements reached. Let me present to you just his brazen incivility and personal attacks.</p>
<p>Here we go -</p>

<p>File an RFC/ RFA for the language dispute. My two cents can be found at <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_Langwar_eb0c.html" title="User:Bakasuprman/Langwar">User:Bakasuprman/Langwar</a>.

<dd>Seems pointless with these inquiries. I think best to look and content as personal inquiries have only lead to fights.

<p>Hello, Why did u disassociate from our dispute.I mean its too teadious and stressful for me to plead innocence to evry admin which my dear friend sarvagnya approaches.Unfortuantely ppl are giving in to his sweet talks.Our new mediatator has started the paece process with labelling me as 'more serious trouble maker'.This is very unfortunate.U had also started by blocking me.I dont jhave grudges about that but Sarvagnya is taking help of that block to malign me.He's posting msgs against me on each and every admin's talk.His lies about Belgaon issue continues.I think there's no justice here.One who's proficient in wiki policies and gets along with admins well is the winner.</p>
<p>And as sarvagnya is continuing his crucase against <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha_empire.html" title="Maratha empire">Maratha_empire</a> I think I should stop being civil and counter these guys who are insulting Maharashtra with vandalism.In any ways,perhaps Sarvagnya would be able to get me blocked so why not teach him a lesson and then spade off?<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a></p>

<dd>I've had conferences, and university deadlines for posters, etc for this week, so I can't do any big investigations. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 08:09, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
