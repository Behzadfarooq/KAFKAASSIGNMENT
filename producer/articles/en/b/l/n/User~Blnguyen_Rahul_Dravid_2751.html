<p>Born in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indore.html" title="Indore">Indore</a>, Dravid's family relocated to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, where his father worked for Kissan, a company known for <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jams.html" title="Jams">jams</a> and preserves. This lead to him earning the nickname <i>Jammy</i> from his teammates at St. Josephs High School, Bangalore. Dravid first came to prominence whilst attending a summer coaching camp at the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinnaswamy_Stadium_923b.html" title="Chinnaswamy Stadium">Chinnaswamy Stadium</a> where his talents were spotted by former cricketer Keki Tarapore who was coaching at the clinic <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_TIME"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_Rahul_Dravid_2751.html#endnote_TIME" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_Rahul_Dravid_2751.html#endnote_TIME" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span>.

<p>Beginning with the reputation of being a defensive batsman who should be confined to Test cricket, he was dropped from ODIs as he was slow in making runs. Of late, however, Rahul Dravid has defied early perceptions to become the mainstay of the Indian batting line-up in ODIs as well as in Tests. His nickname of 'The Wall' in <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reebok.html" title="Reebok">Reebok</a> advertisements was treated by ODI fans as a derisory comment about his inability to rotate strike as he tended to hold up one end playing his front foot defence, neither scoring runs nor getting out. The nickname has now become a tribute to his consistency. Dravid has scored 23 centuries in <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test cricket</a> at an average of 58.75, including 5 double centuries, whilst in <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_International_5936.html" title="One-day International">one-dayers</a> he has an average of 40.16 at a strike rate of 70. He is one of the few Indians who average more at away matches than at home, averaging over 10 more runs a match abroad than on Indian pitches. As of 9 August, 2006, Dravid's average in overseas Tests stood at 65.28 as against his overall Test average of 58.75, and his average for away ODI stands at 42.03 as against overall ODI average of 40.20. In matches that India has won, Dravid averages 78.72 in Tests and 53.40 in ODIs.</p>
<p>Dravid's sole Test wicket was that of Ridley Jacobs in the fourth Test against the West Indies during the 2001-2002 series. While he has no pretensions to being a bowler, Dravid often kept wicket for India in ODIs, an 'experiment' that continued for several seasons. He has since delegated the wicket-keeping gloves, first to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthiv_Patel_d281.html" title="Parthiv Patel">Parthiv Patel</a> and more recently to <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahendra_Singh_Dhoni_21c6.html" title="Mahendra Singh Dhoni">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a>. Dravid is now purely a batsman, one who has averaged 63.51 in matches played since 1 January, 2000.</p>
<p>Dravid was involved in two of the largest parnerships in ODIs: a 318-run partnership with <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sourav_Ganguly_6b4a.html" title="Sourav Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>, the first pair to combine for a 300-run partnership, and then a 331-run partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, which is the present world record. He also holds the record for the greatest number of innings since debut before being dismissed for a duck. His highest scores in ODIs and Tests are 153 and 270 respectively. Uniquely, each of his five double centuries in Tests was a higher score than his previous double century (200*, 217, 222, 233, 270).</p>
<p>Also, Dravid is the current world record holder for the highest percentage(%) contribution of runs scored in matches won under a single captain, where the captain has won more than 20 tests. <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/221152.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/221152.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> In the 21 Test matches India won under <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sourav_Ganguly_6b4a.html" title="Sourav Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>'s leadership, Dravid played his part in every single one of those wins, scoring at a record average of <b>102.84</b> and piling up an astonishing 2571 runs, with nine hundreds - three of them double-centuries - and ten fifties in 32 innings. He contributed nearly <b>23%</b> of the total runs scored by India those 21 matches, which is almost one run out of every four runs the team scored. This amazing consistency of Dravid was the single most important reason behind India's Test victories under <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sourav_Ganguly_6b4a.html" title="Sourav Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>.</p>

On the subsequent tour of Australia, following a 1 and 42* in the first Test at the <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabba.html" title="Gabba">Gabba</a>, Dravid and Laxman came to the crease with India at 4-85 in the following Test at the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Oval_4c84.html" title="Adelaide Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> after Australia had posted 528? The pair went on to post another triple century partnership <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/125764.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/125764.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>, with Dravid scoring 230. He later scored 70* in the second innings on the final day to guide India to it's first ever Test victory in Australia, for which he was awarded the Man of the Match award <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/125850.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/125850.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. Despite scoring 49 and 90 in the Third Test in Melbourne, India lost the match. Dravid scored 38 and 90* but was unable to force a victory in the Fourth Test at the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Cricket_Ground_b665.html" title="Sydney Cricket Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>, nevertheless he was named the Man of the Series for his 500? runs at ~100 <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/engine/match/64062.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/engine/match/64062.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>.</p>
<p>Dravid was later fined by match officials after being shown on television rubbing a cough lolly onto a cricket ball in order to polish it <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/137707.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/137707.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>.</p>
<p>With Ganguly again sidelined with injury on the tour to Pakistan, Dravid lead the Indians in the First Test in <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multan.html" title="Multan">Multan</a>. Dravid attracted some criticism when he declared the Indian first innings late on the second day, with Tendulkar just six runs short of a double century. However, this was softened when an innings victory was secured on the final day <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/134068.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/134068.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. He later expressed regret for the decision <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/134675.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/134675.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Pakistan fought back in the Second Test in <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a> to level the series <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/engine/match/64082.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/engine/match/64082.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, with Gnaguly returning for the final Test in <a href="../../../r/a/w/Rawalpindi.html" title="Rawalpindi">Rawalpindi</a>. Dravid found himsefl batting in the second ball of the Indian innings after the first-ball dismissal of Virender Sehwag, but batted for almost two days in compiling his Test best of 270, being the ninth wicket to fall <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/134425.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/134425.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>. This set up an Indian victory, and the first away series victory by an Indian team in&#160;?20 years.</p>
<p>He was subsequently named as the ICC International Player of the Year and also the Test player of the year, and was named in the ICC team for Tests <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/143090.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/143090.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>.</p>
<p>Bad series here.... Ganguly was again injured, leaving Dravid to captain India in the Third Test in <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagpur.html" title="Nagpur">Nagpur</a>, in which they were resoundingly defeated by ~350 runs to become the first Indian side to lose a series at home to Australia in 34 years.

<p>The emergence of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahendra_Singh_Dhoni_21c6.html" title="Mahendra Singh Dhoni">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a> in late 2004 saw Dravid permanently cease wicket-keeping duties in one-day internationals.</p>
<p>The 2004 Indian ocean tsunami lead to a onde day international fundraising match at the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground_93ce.html" title="Melbourne Cricket Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, which saw an <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Cricket_Council_992e.html" title="Asian Cricket Council">Asian Cricket Council</a> XI play a World XI. Playing purely as a batsman (Sri Lanka's <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumar_Sangakkara_c81d.html" title="Kumar Sangakkara">Kumar Sangakkara</a> was the wicketkeeper), Dravid topscored with 75* as the Asian XI fell short of their target.</p>
<p>In 2005, Dravid scored centuries in both innings 110 and 135 against Pakistan in the home series in the second Test in <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>.</p>
<p>He was again selected in the ICC Test and ODI team of the year, and was a member of the ICC World XI for both Tests and ODI against Australia in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_ICC_Super_Series_b863.html" title="2005 ICC Super Series">2005 ICC Super Series</a>. He had a lean series, scoring 19? runs in the Tests and 50 in the ODIs?</p>
<p>Dravid was named as captain for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Indian_Oil_Cup_f478.html" title="2005 Indian Oil Cup">2005 Indian Oil Cup</a> in Sri lanka following the suspension of Ganguly due to the team's slow over rates. Ganguly resumed the captaincy upon his return for the tour of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>&lt;Zim tour&gt;</p>
<p>Dravid was appointed as the ODI captain for the series against Sri Lanka following the falling-out of Ganguly and coach <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Chappell_5894.html" title="Greg Chappell">Greg Chappell</a>, with Ganguly injured. Even once Ganguly had recovered from injury, he was left out as the selectors persisted with the squad, which defeated Sri Lanka 6-1. Ganguly was again ignored for the series against South Africa, which saw Dravid's team tie the series at 2-2, as well as public acrimony as the team were booed by the crowd in Ganguly's hometown of <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>.</p>
<p>Dravid was appointed as Test captain for the 2005 series against Sri Lanka which followed the ODIs, despite Ganguly's retention in the team. The first two Tests resulted in a rain-affected draw and a win, before Dravid was forced to withdraw from the Thirs Test in <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmedabad.html" title="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a> with illness. This ended a streak of 94 consecutive Test matches since his debut in 1996, and left Sehwag to lead the Indians to a 2-0 series win.</p>
<p>Following the decision to include both <a href="../../../y/u/v/Yuvraj_Singh_49c7.html" title="Yuvraj Singh">Yuvraj Singh</a> and Ganguly in the Test team, opener <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gautam_Gambhir_2b21.html" title="Gautam Gambhir">Gautam Gambhir</a> was dropped, forcing Dravid to open with Sehwag. In a drawn First Test, the pair put on 403, just 7 runs short of the world record opening partnership in Test matches, with Dravid scoring 128*. Dravid scored another century in the Second Test in <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faisalabad.html" title="Faisalabad">Faisalabad</a>, which was also a hgih scoring draw. However, the Indian top order collapsed on a green pitch in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karachi.html" title="Karachi">Karachi</a> and defeat lead to the scrapping of Dravid's experiment as an opener. <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasim_Jaffer_a9a7.html" title="Wasim Jaffer">Wasim Jaffer</a> was drafted into the team and Ganguly dropped for the England series, which was drawn 1-1. After a drawn first Test in Nagpur, India won the second in <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohali.html" title="Mohali">Mohali</a>, before losing the third in <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. This attracted criticism after Dravid had elected to bowl on a dry pitch in his 100th Test match.</p>
<p>Dravid then lead his team to a 1-0 victory over the West Indies in the Carribean in mid-2006. It was the first series victory by an Indian team since <a href="../../../a/j/i/Ajit_Wadekar_2e15.html" title="Ajit Wadekar">Ajit Wadekar</a>'s team in 1970?</p>
<p>Dravid had scored a century in the second Test, but victory was denied after a day's play was washed out and the hosts being reduced to being 8 down at the end of play. Dravid then topscored with 81 and 68 in both innings of the final Test in a low scoring affair to see his team to victory.</p>
<p>Dravid's reign as the ODI captain has seen better results. The Indians defeated Pakistan 4-1 away and England 5-1 at home. His captaincy has been marked by the increased flexibility in the batting line-up which has seen swing bowler <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Pathan_b760.html" title="Irfan Pathan">Irfan Pathan</a> and wicket-keeper <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahendra_Singh_Dhoni_21c6.html" title="Mahendra Singh Dhoni">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a> regularly batting as openers or at No. 3. A selection policy geared towards youth has also seen players such as <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suresh_Raina_bcd3.html" title="Suresh Raina">Suresh Raina</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanthakumaran_Sreesanth_13d5.html" title="Shanthakumaran Sreesanth">Shanthakumaran Sreesanth</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munaf_Patel_ec89.html" title="Munaf Patel">Munaf Patel</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudra_Pratap_Singh_4636.html" title="Rudra Pratap Singh">Rudra Pratap Singh</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Uthappa_b2a7.html" title="Robin Uthappa">Robin Uthappa</a> playing on a more regular basis. Victory in the 1st ODI against the West Indies on the May tour, set a new world record of 17? consecutive successful ODI run chases, breaking the 14 previously held by the West Indies. Dravid was teh captain for 15 of these. This however was followed by four cosecutive defeats to lose the series 4-1.</p>
