<dd>I'd still say that the Ruslana entry is misleading as all the songs were selected irrespective of what the artist's attitude to appearing was, and I don't think that she was selected and refused her song also. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:44, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Hello BigHaz. Can you look at this template that <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandru_Busa_bb99.html" title="User:Alexandru Busa">User:Alexandru Busa</a> created please? I think that Alexandru is a big <a href="../../../r/u/s/Ruslana.html" title="Ruslana">Ruslana</a> fan judging by his contribs and the POV is shown in this template. AFAIK, the 14 most popular songs were selected irrespective of whether the artist was dead (<a href="../../../d/o/m/Domenico_Modugno_c08d.html" title="Domenico Modugno">Domenico Modugno</a>), in seclusion/refused (<a href="../../../a/b/b/ABBA_de88.html" title="ABBA">ABBA</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_Gall_5b08.html" title="France Gall">France Gall</a>), so I feel that Alexandru gives us the impression that Ruslana snubbed the show when she was in fact not selected for the show. I feel she should not be there as she was not even selected and I think the template gives us the false impression that she was...unless I'm wrong and she was selected and refused them permission to use her song...<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>It certainly looks that way to me. A reading of the article would of course show that Ruslana wasn't involved in the show, but the template itself seems a trifle POV as written. I'd make the following changes to it:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Not all the "participants" participated anyway - Nicole, Celine and Cliff were physically not there (Celine didn't even do a prerecorded message as far as I remember) and Domenico is of course dead and thus couldn't do anything</li>
<li>The middle category should be reworded to something less ungainly in English - I know what it means and so do you, but the average punter probably won't</li>
<li>The final category is superfluous - France Gall and ABBA are already mentioned and Ruslana wasn't involved at all. If all non-participants are eligible for that list (they shouldn't be, but the presence of one of them suggests that they could be), we'd have one of the largest templates in history.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>If Alexandru <i>does</i> have proof that Ruslana was selected but turned them down (I can't find any with a quick skim around the net, and it seems odd since she then appeared at Best of Eurovision AFAIK), then we'd need that category to cover <i>every</i> winner - and possibly every <i>participant</i> who was selected but turned them down. I don't know about you, but I'd be hoping there was a central repository of names on this one if we went down that road. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 03:44, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>I know from sure sources that Svante Stockhelius called Ruslana and invited her to perform some seconds of her song playback (like Helena paparizou and Sertab Erener) but she refused because she wanted to perform her entire song LIVE. If you saw Congratulations maybe you remember that they didn't show a video with Ruslana like they showed with all the winners of ESC. Do you remember that petition of Ruslana's fans??? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandru_Busa_bb99.html" title="User:Alexandru Busa">Alexandru Busa</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexandru_Busa_7b22.html" title="User talk:Alexandru Busa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alexandru_Busa_6a56.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alexandru Busa">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Sorry if I'm jumping the gun here, but I just saw the comments that Alexandru (presumably) left on your page here about the sources to do with Svante inviting Ruslana to give her permission for some of her song to be performed. In order to pre-empt you asking me if I know anything about it, which I rather thought you might, here's my take on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obviously if these sources can be cited, they trump anything I say here</li>
<li>As far as the petition he mentions, I've certainly never heard anything about it and I keep my ear relatively close to the ground when it comes to the ESC. Certainly in the leadup to the special, I never heard anything about a petition about this or that thing.</li>
<li>I have the special on tape and will re-watch it at some point to confirm my suspicions, but certainly as broadcast in Oz it didn't have this montage of winners he mentions.</li>
<li>Even if what Alexandru claims is in fact true, there's the world of difference between having a few seconds of the song played as part of a montage and having the song played with full orchestra and dancers as one of the 14 greatest entries. If we want to identify every single performer featured in a montage, I guess we could, but it'd be a massive template. As currently written, there is a <i>strong</i> implication that Ruslana was in fact named in this top 14 - which can only be POV if the only issue up for debate is whether or not she had her song played briefly in a montage. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:49, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Svante (in his capacity as the EBU chief - his smiling face turns up at least in the final of the ESC2004, can't think of any other appearances) may have been responsible for signing off on the final vote counts and things, but I doubt he has the power to invite or uninvite performers. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 01:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I listened to your recitation and had several problems with it. Firstly, it's done by a male in a Southern accent, not very apt for this poem. However, what made it unacceptable to me was that it sounded like somebody was just reading the poem word-by-word, and was not pausing at the right places (it sounded like you recorded each word individually, then pieced them together). I feel that leaving that clip there will give the reader a bad impression of the poem. <a href="../../../d/h/n/User%7EDHN_4cb4.html" title="User:DHN">DHN</a> 01:42, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, it's great to see you back on Wikipedia again.&#160;:) While your contribs on the BSB mainpage will of course be missed, one does not of course have to be a member to hand out the awards. You are still a very kind wikipedian who hands out plenty of awards, and wether or not you are a member of some project, the result is the same. Again, welcome back! See you around -- <b><a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanes_f250.html" title="User:Banes"><font color="darkblue">Bane</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanes_bff7.html" title="User talk:Banes"><font color="darkblue">s</font></a></b> 08:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Azskeptic is a self proclaimed consumer advocate for nothing less than Medical Education and has tried to sabotage as you can see by negative postings here and on valuemd.com, the college of SCIMD, for some unknown reason. However, Azskeptic has no known affiliation with a health education/services association and doesn't have any known medical, health or even sciences education or professional background. He is as i said before a self proclaimed consumer advocate, (I wish to be explained what this bakwas means once)... I hope you understand and get to the heart of the matter before assisting him.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm writing to you because you have been objective and unbiased in many matters on wikipedia in the past and I trust your judgement. I believe that I am being harassed by an admin who is abusing his powers to make POV edits on the articles on Michael Witzel and the California Hindu Textbook Controversy (he has admitted that he is a student researching such issues and so has a partisan bias on this matter). He has threatened me with blocks and bans and, based on his past history, may do so very soon. Right now, he has only made empty threats in my talk page, so i's not a problem. However, if he blocks me, then I request you to arbitrate this issue. I am informing you in advance because I will not be able to contact you if I am blocked by this admin. His name is dbachman and his user page is&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dbachmann" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dbachmann" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dbachmann</a>.</p>
<p>The threats are on: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Subhash_bose#Michael_Witzel" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Subhash_bose#Michael_Witzel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Subhash_bose#Michael_Witzel</a></p>
<p>His accusations are baseless as all my edits are directly quoted from references I have cited.</p>
<p>If this potentially volatile situation comes to a head, I request you to be a neutral third party arbitrator on this matter. Thank you.<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 23:30, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Koongamia is a locality in Swan and Mundaring shires (check a Perth Metro map) but is not in this list. And MUndaring Weir is no longer designated as a separate locality from Mundaring, as far as I can tell&#160;:) Also Mundaring shire has placed expensive signs last month at the border of each with "Locality of xxx" so the suburb label does not correlate _exactly_ any more.

<p>Hello, BInguyen, about the SRK pics: the Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge-picture was the same one I loaded up (and provided with a fair use rationale), but User:Mana.ustad just turned it around, aka mirrored it. S/he did the same to the Kank picture (you can see it on SRk's tatoo on the arm -&gt; Mana's pictures had the letters Victory mirrored). I have no idea why anyone would do that. I included the un-mirorred pictures again and provided the Kank-picture with a fair use rationale. Also, I added the picture of Khan, smoking, because it illustrates that he didn't keep his promise and, well, it's a free pic. --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumcouch_6211.html" title="User:Plumcouch">Plumcouch</a> 16:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, regarding your block of <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakasuprman</a> I was wondering whether it may be too hasty. He seems to have offerred an explanation as to his earlier "sockpuppetry" on his talk page. Perhaps a reduced time block would be better. I'll keep an eye on him and discourage him from messing up articles with unsubstantiated POV edits (he has been known to do that, I'll admit).

Your recent contributions to Wikipedia are very much appreciated. However, please take a moment to look over your contributions for spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors before submitting them in final. This will help lessen the amount of copyediting work that fellow Wikipedians need to do, and will help improve the overall appearance of Wikipedia.

<p>I think it is a bit unfair that you took away the links that I had put up, considering that there are tons of links to so-called personal websites that have pictures up of various cities, places, and personalities. I want to *share* my pictures with people. Wikipedia is a good outlet for that, considering that I'm not asking for money. Additionally, I linked the places where I have taken photographs of to Wikipedia's site so that people could get more information on the particular place at hand.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia is going to forbid the use of external links to 'personal websites' then I will make it my mission to go through various pages and delete every single link in accordance with what you had told me about 'spam'. Of course, if I understood you correctly, that is.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you decide, since you feel that I am providing Wikipedia with spam and not content that is useful enough for people who can't actually go out and see the various places and sights in the world.</p>

<p>Why are there tons of links to personal sites on Wikipedia? You did not answer my question the first time, so I am asking again in regards to external links being put up.</p>
<p>If external links for self-publicizing aren't allowed, that's understandable. However, such links do exist on Wikipedia. Additionally, there are links to commercial websites on cities and other places as well; why are they allowed? Again, why isn't a link to a free gallery allowed?</p>

<p>Not to speak out of turn, since this user's been doing some very useful stuff (adding in information about national finals and things on the song articles), but he also has a tendency to recategorise articles as "[country] Eurovision songs" or "Eurovision songs of [year]", marking the edits as minor. If this is the new project standard - which it may be, although there's no discussion on the project page itself and the user in question doesn't seem to be a member anyway - then I'll adapt. As it is, though, it's serving to muck up my counts of song articles which gets me mightily suspicious that someone might have deleted one or two (in the event, of course, someone <i>had</i> deleted one, but that's neither here nor there). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:32, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have no way to properly express how grateful I am to you for all you've done for me, and all I can tell you is, I'll try not to disappoint you nor anyone else with my use of the buttons... and if I mess up, make sure to <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel">come here</a> and give me a good yell!&#160;:) Seriously, tho, if you ever need my help, either for admin-related stuff or in any other way, you'll always be welcome to message me, and I promise I'll try my very best.<br />
Your congratulations note has moved me no end, dear B. I was worried about your absence, considering your recent stress, and seeing you return was an enormous joy. I hope your illness is completely over - you were sorely missed. Once again thank you - for everything you've done for me, and everything you are&#160;:)</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the barnstar! I am greatly honoured; really, I should get around to doing more spoken articles, and probably will in the near future. Once again, thank you very much, and best regards, --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholasTurnbull_9d8a.html" title="User:NicholasTurnbull">Nicholas<b>Turnbull</b></a> | <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholasTurnbull_45f8.html" title="User talk:NicholasTurnbull">(talk)</a> 04:15, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
