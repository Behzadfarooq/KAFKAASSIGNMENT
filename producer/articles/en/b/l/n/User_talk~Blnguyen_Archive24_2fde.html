<dd>A content/neutrality dispute has taken place between me and Holywarrior. I tried to discuss with him but he threatened me with accusations of policy violation. I am thus filing an RfC.

<dd>Thanks for dropping me a note regarding my RfC. I did not see the rule that said that 2 users are required to initiate an RfC. I'm sorry if that was wrong of me. I was looking at <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> and I thought that it said that, failing negotiation, a user may request mediation through RfC <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html#Discuss_with_third_parties" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes#Discuss with third parties</a> and thought that RfC was the way to achieve that.

<dd>I think I understand. Yes, I would like extra pair of eyes to opine about the dispute which I do not think I will be able to resolve with Holywarrior by myself. Can you endorse the RfC, making it two people, or is there a conflict of interet issue on account of your status as an admin?<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 00:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>OK. So what are the exact criteria for another user to get involved? If a user sees the RfC and wishes to comment, is that enough? Based on what you said it seems to me that the RfC in it's present form is not illegitimate. Can I contact another user and ask him to look at the rfC and, if he agrees that there is a problem, endorse it?What advice can you offer regarding this situation?

<p>Hello Blnguyen,</p>
<p>Regarding the request to block edits to the mauryan empire page and ashoka. The issue is that individuals are positing side-theories as main-stream opinion. Moreover, they are expounding upon that and making insinuations that are tantamount to sneaky vandalism. I was the user who was making reverts on account of their ignoring my questions and requests. As seen on the discussion page, other users also expressed concerns. I even suggested a compromise such as creating a separate article wherein theories could be posited and the main page spared. These were also ignored--there was not even a response to that. This has been done for origin and ancestry theories before (i.e. Chandragupta Maurya, Vijaynagar empire). If you could please arbitrate, and request that a compromise along such lines be put into place, that would be greatly appreciated. My concern is the historicity of the article and nothing else. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<p>Hello Blnguyen,</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt reply. I would like for just that section to be deleted because it misinforms wikipedia users. I know you are very busy, but I can go into exactly why historians don't embrace this hypothesis (primary indigenous sources, polygamy in indian monarchies, dating issues, etc), and will do so if you'd like. The contributor, PHG, takes an hypothesis made by two colonial authors and then takes liberties to construct and entire historical construction that no mainstream modern historian embraces, because even the originators state that it is far-fetched. This user has previously taken primary source edits and interpreted them himself on wikipedia pages. My only concern is historical accuracy, which is why I appealed to you on this count. However, in the interest of finding a fair solution to all, and in order to observe wikipedia's aims of community harmony, I suggested a compromise. While I definitely believe those sections should be deleted, I would be just as happy if you could consider this suggestion (as there was a successful precedent for it with the Chandragupta debate). Thanks again for your time and consideration.</p>

<p>I do believe it requires someone(s) who is/are impartial to arbitrate the brewing dispute. PHG and Devanampriya have been at it for a while, but PHG especially seems unwilling to concede on any point. Even when it is apparent to everyone reading that Deva and Vastu have both shown him to be wrong. I have tried rephrasing their arguments and reasoning with him, but to no avail. Even that does not bug me so much though. It is just that he has a penchant for drawing his own conclusions based on information derived from his sources (which are horrendously biased anyway, even by his own admission), and then attributing his conclusions to that source and crying "foul" whenever someone proves it wrong.</p>
<p>On a side note, something needs to be done about Aldux. His comments are wholly inappropriate and border on bullying anyone who disagrees with him.</p>

Why are Moslem admins refuting the fact that <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> was six when she was married to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>?

His edit in <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara_Empire_059b.html" title="Vijayanagara Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a> page and its talk page are not according to Wiki policies (one is a possible vandalism and another is a direct personal attack on another contributor and a community).

<p>In the case of User Subhash Bose, his diatribes against Islam ( despite being pointed out to you) did not even get him any request to tone down.In the discussion you are asking me to tone down there was also an accusation of my being a troll by Baka, which has not commented upon by you. Whereas in the past I have got rapped ( again by you) for even responding to a taunt( by Subhash). You have been more than zealous to implement wiki policy on all users who get into a discussion with User Subhash and his coterie. The reverse does not seem to have the same zealousness. There are other admins watching the page, I would request that whenever User subhash or his talk page is involved you do ask the other admins to take action as I feel you have taken a stance which is not neutral. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 07:44, 11 September 2006 (UTC)<br />

<dd>Once again you assume that I have read his edits and willfully ignored his transgressions again and that I have been protecting him. A comparison of the block logs tells the truth. As to my warnings, it is just a warning, rather than a block as Subhash gets when he crosses the line. Referring to your self-justification for your counterattack to Subhash, please direct me to the part of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> where counter-attacks are permitted - and also any reader can easily see that Subhash was blocked for longer, and frequently by myself. Anybody who isn't blind or completely mentally polluted or biased can see that Subhash has been taken to account more than you have.

<p>Hello Blnguyen,</p>
<p>Regarding your recent message: my reference to aldux being a "thug" was on account of PHG's enlistment of him to use charged language and to intimidate me. It was not meant to be a personal attack but to emphasize how the other party was not attempting to discuss the subject matter but was seeking to coerce others to accept the inclusion of the edit. I will point out the Indo-Greek map debate/edit war between Aldux and Vastu.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I respect your opinion and wikipedia NPA, and will not refer to him as a thug in the future. But I would beseech you to encourage Aldux to avoid attempting to threaten people by noting that they "will pay the consequences" and used other phrases that are not in line with civility on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Also, I was wondering what your thoughts were on my compromise suggestion, since I am not the only wikipedia contributor who is concerned with that edit. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Devanampriya</p>

<dd>Hi Blnguyen, I'll just add a few words. First, Dev. says I was "enlisted" by PHG; this is completely untrue, as I arrived instead by glancing at PHG's contributions. I've always much appreciated PHG's featured articles, and in particular his last one, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasekura_Tsunenaga_6793.html" title="Hasekura Tsunenaga">Hasekura Tsunenaga</a>: and when I saw that there was a dispute at <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurya_Empire_d691.html" title="Maurya Empire">Maurya Empire</a>, with Dev. deleting reliably sourced, and relevant material and PHG trying to conserve it; so I made my first edit, a revert to PHG's version, at September 3, 15:53 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurya_Empire&amp;diff=73588111&amp;oldid=73542651" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurya_Empire&amp;diff=73588111&amp;oldid=73542651" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>; for this edit PHG, that was obviously online, thanked me, sending me a message <b>after</b> my first edit, at September 3, 16:01 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAldux&amp;diff=73589171&amp;oldid=73431740" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAldux&amp;diff=73589171&amp;oldid=73431740" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>; and no, before Dev. says this, PHG didn't send me a message by e-mail, as he never has (strangely, considering our common interests, our wiki interaction has been generally quite low, probably because my hellenistic interests are more "traditional" - Egypt, Greece, Syria, Anatolia). Before PHG's message, I had posted at September 3, 16:00 this warning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADevanampriya&amp;diff=73589079&amp;oldid=73540051" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADevanampriya&amp;diff=73589079&amp;oldid=73540051" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, that reads <i>You are in danger, if you haven't already done it, of violating the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Also, remember that removing sourced material is considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>. Now it's up to you to chose: respect the rules, or continue breaking them and pay the consequences (that is, getting blocked).</i> This was a due message, as there was no 3RR warning on his user page, and, well, blanking is considered vandalism. What was unnecessary, I admit it, <i>mea culpa</i>, was the last period: while true (violation of the 3RR does generally bring to a block), the tone was too harsh. But too call sending a 3RR warning "intimidation" and calling using the term "thug" three times <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMaurya_Empire&amp;diff=73602703&amp;oldid=73556235" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMaurya_Empire&amp;diff=73602703&amp;oldid=73556235" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADevanampriya&amp;diff=74560042&amp;oldid=74481298" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADevanampriya&amp;diff=74560042&amp;oldid=74481298" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARagib&amp;diff=73599014&amp;oldid=73588071" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARagib&amp;diff=73599014&amp;oldid=73588071" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> "not meant to be a personal attack", shows, IMO, little knowledge of wikipedia rules.

<dd>Since Dev. couldn't find any support (even if he says: "I am not the only wikipedia contributor who is concerned with that edit"; I'd like to know where are the other users so concerned), he started violating systematically the 3RR, but being careful to use anon. accounts, so to not be seen; but he hasn't been very careful, and had forgot that in previous occasions he had used these accounts to write comments in talk pages, often leaving his signature, "Devanampriya". When the article was locked, a brand new editor emerged, User:Pavanapuram, editing only on <a href="../../../m/a/u/Talk%7EMaurya_Empire_926f.html" title="Talk:Maurya Empire">Talk:Maurya Empire</a>, that interestingly, not only voiced the same opinions of Devanampriya and appeared here on your talk to strengthen Dev. and, he too (how strange) attack me; he is also, and <b>this</b> is of particular interest, always editing, I've controlled, in exactly the same time periods in which Devanampriya was.</dd>
<dd>From this I awnser that we shouldn't abide to a single editor who is trying to impose his will and erase sourced information; sources that have behind them authors still respected in academia, and that are regularly mentioned in the hellenistic history books bibliographies. I'm no fan of Tarn, quite the opposite: but it's one of those authors that even his opposers feel they have to mention, was it only to counter him with other arguments. Obviously, this theory is just a theory, to mention among other theories; which is done by PHG's edits, and other theories can be added when sourced. I also disagree on creating a new article, in which to throw all Dev. doesn't wan't; there is no reason why fully sourced edits must be exiled for motives that are almost declarately nationalistic.</dd>

<dd>Hello Aldux. I don't think for one moment that your conduct towards other users has been of ill-will. I don't support the excising of the information, but can we get more info from Buddhist oriented sources or Jain sources to make it bigger. Because it does seem as though there is not much detail about Ashoka and Buddhism and Ashoka the conqueror, and the same in the Maurya Empire - at the moment there is lots of information about the Greek connection, which inherently there is nothing wrong, but it may give the impression that Ashoka was a Greek reprentative or something - it just feels a bit too oriented on his bloodline and not what he nor the Mauryans achieved. In any case it was interesting that I got <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahinda.html" title="Mahinda">Mahinda</a> (his son, who brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka) and <a href="../../../m/o/g/Moggaliputta-Tissa_2eea.html" title="Moggaliputta-Tissa">Moggaliputta-Tissa</a> (his spiritual adviser) to DYK in the week leading up to the locking - could we put more stuff about Buddhism into the articles to balance it out as well as his stuff about the Kalinga conquest etc. The Greek stuff is still interesting of course and I don't see a reason to cull it unless there is POV or weaselly stuff compromising it. Anything this old, of course cannot be certain, so as long as we give both a fair hearing then it should work out OK. This could be an interesting case as I am interested in learning more about Asoka. Perhaps I can find more about his Indian activity (religion and miltary) to balance it out. Tell me what you think.

<dd>Thanks for your prompt and kind response. IMO, what you propose is exactly what should be done; not remove text, but expand the other sections, possibly bringing Ashoka and Maurya Empire to feature status. I'ts very interesting to hear you're interested in Ashoka; I hope you'll find time, as you propose, to add material as you said, on the buddhist and military activities. Unfortunately my knowledge on India tends to start with the Moghuls, so I can't be of much help; but PHG had an important role in writing the feature <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Buddhism_215c.html" title="History of Buddhism">History of Buddhism</a>, so I think he'll be able to say quite a lot on the buddhism section.</dd>
<dd>Regarding an argoment that doesn't involve Maurya-Greek relations, what do you think of the section <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurya_Empire_d691.html#Historical_Comparison" title="Maurya Empire">Maurya Empire#Historical Comparison</a>? IMO, this section stinks quite a lot as a violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and especially <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, offering a quite overtly anti-chinese pov as estabilshed truth. Should this section be removed? Or tagged as OR while we wait for sources, trying in the meanwhile to npovize it? Or keep it at it is? Tell me your view.

<dd>Personally I think it should be removed, I can't see how it is useful in any way as at that stage China and India had no contact with each other and it could have comparisions with any other random empire.

<p>Well, firstly he was on at about 6 UTC, which is about 10-11pm Texas time, so he would have required security cards to get into uni. It would be a big move to take this risk of being caught breaching security regulations by taking an unauthorised person into a physics lab with expensive equipment at a higly regarded physics school for a wikipedia stunt. Also I looked at the student list and there are about 220 students <a href="http://www.ph.utexas.edu/physics_grad_students.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ph.utexas.edu/physics_grad_students.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> in the Physics Dept and 8 are Indian. PhD students need to help supervise lab classes (I do so myself) and share the same lunch room, and are required to attend the weekly afternoon tea and reaserch seminar, so you end up talking to everyone all the time, even though when you are in undergraduate you only talk to a few specific friends, as you now live in the same office 50 hours a week. It's quite likely that 2 out of the 8, at least 25% will be BJP supporters. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">BLabberiNg</a> 04:42, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your behaviour is rather unrealistic. You blocked Crculver for rolling back nonsense added to articles? I am sorry, but I think you need to review your notion of 'content dispute'. A newbie account adding random nonsense and refusing to negotiate does not constitute a 'content dispute'. It is difficult enough to keep these articles in half decent shape without your blocks. I cannot see that Crculver has violated the 3RR at all, he reverted various additions, but even if you consider the 'Spritindia' incident a bona fide content dispute, he only reverted three times there. You seem to be handing out blocks rather liberally and rather erratically, and I would strongly recommend you post your decisions on WP:AN/I for review. People investing their time in rolling back nonsense are not in unlimited supply, and if you go about blocking these, you should be asking yourself, do your actions benefit the project? 'Spiritindia' should not have <i>got</i> as far as he did, he should have been {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}}ed after his first edit.</p>
<p>Regarding your other question, yes, Bharatveer is clearly a bad-faith editor and has proven so in numerous instances. Until he is banned I still acknowledge his additions fall under 3RR, but I see no reason not to roll him back, especially since there <i>was</i> debate (or what passes for 'debate' in Bv's case) ongoing on the talkpage. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 06:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I never said YOU attacked Maharashtra.I know ur not a Indian and hence neutral.I was apprehensive about a user badmouthing against me in ur talk page. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 09:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed all the POV sounding statements. I have also added references and citations, in case someone wants them. Also, Zaheer plays for <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroda.html" title="Baroda">Baroda</a> team but he is originally from <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> from a village in between <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pune.html" title="Pune">Pune</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashik.html" title="Nashik">Nashik</a>. He speaks fluent <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> at his home and many times with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> media as well. He has a restaurant in <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pune.html" title="Pune">Pune</a> as well.</p>
<p>Thanx for the help.</p>

<p>Bl, I spent about 20 mins reviewing the article and adding tags and removing POV. It is not upto some user to simply do away with the tag and continue building the article. I dont have problems if the article grows, but the editors should atleast have the basic courtesy and manners to keep the tags until they've provided proper citations. And why should I keep spending more and more time adding the same tags. Let Arya who removed the tags pay for it and do the hard work. I just want my tags back on the article. Or I will go ahead and delete entries for which I had asked for citation and Arya simply deleted those tags. And as for your entry I think you only entered Wadekar there, I'll put that in myself if you want but Arya cannot take WP audience for fools by simply doing away with legitimate tags. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 08:13, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>See the diff between my ver+Wadekar and Arya's ver <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marathi_people&amp;diff=76751082&amp;oldid=76746475" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marathi_people&amp;diff=76751082&amp;oldid=76746475" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Things like "Director extra ordinaire", "Greatest" of Satavahana kings etc., are blatantly POV or need to be referenced. Same goes for titles like "goal poacher" etc., which is certainly not 'common knowledge'. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 08:22, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the talk page of <a href="../../../b/a/j/Bajrang_Dal_c063.html" title="Bajrang Dal">Bajrang Dal</a>, <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> brought up an issue regarding to the meaning of a sentence. I'll give you the context first: a few activists of Bajrang Dal were killed in the process of bombmaking, and many other people are accused of aiding the bombmaking, etc. Here is the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However we have come to know from the police sources that police has seized maps of a few Mosques situated in nearby districts from the houses of the accused which give credence to the rumors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question: Is it clear that the maps were found <b>exactly at</b> the houses of the accused (my view), or would you think the statement is ambiguous (Hkelkar's view)?

<p>(reply on my talk page) Do you like to get in India debates. The troubles with subhash bose dragged me in and Holywarrior and the fundywatch fiasco + aftermath. But they were all asingle thread of enmity, that wove itself in different ways. You seem to find all the blown-up disutes to play with. Why?

<dd>I know NOTHING about any of his anti hindu rants. I havent come across any and I just checked his contribs and couldnt find any either. Bak, post links to the appropriate diffs if what you are saying is true.
