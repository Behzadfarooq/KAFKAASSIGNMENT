<p>Can you just clarify, Konrads imigrated to Australia in 44, but lived in Germany till 49, then were moved to a camp in Wagga Wagga? Am I reading that wrong?

<p>I noticed the article <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Devitt_36a7.html" title="John Devitt">John Devitt</a>, and you cited a book called "Australia at the Olympic Games" by Malcolm Andrews. Is it a published book with an ISBN and all that? Do you happen to know if it covers the Winter Olympics as well? (I recall one book with the ABC logo on it that covered the Summer Olympics only, so I may have come across this book).</p>
<p>Good on you for the work you're doing - one reason why I work on Winter Olympics is that it's a managable task! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndjam_08d6.html" title="User:Andjam">Andjam</a> 12:38, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. I reverted your removal of the {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-reason_8c33.html" title="Template:Db-reason">db-reason</a>}} tags from the Orange County page move remnants. The redirects are not useful because the areas in question are not part of the respective cities. What's more, the person who moved them has admitted to moving the pages to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">illustrate a point</a> (see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnaheim_Hills%2C_California_d49b.html#Straw_poll" title="Talk:Anaheim Hills, California">Talk:Anaheim Hills, California#Straw poll</a>, near the bottom).

<p>G'Day</p>
<p>I have been adding some information to some of the southern Sydney suburbs and Sydney Regions.</p>
<p>I would like to request a change to the suburbs categories box for 'City of Rockdale'. This box should be linked to Southern Sydney rather than South-Eastern Sydney. Just like Kogarah and Hurstville already do. It would also be really good to have an extra link to the 'St George' region (if possible) for all 3 local govt areas of 'City of Rockdale', 'Municipality of Kogarah' and 'City of Hurstville'.</p>
<p>Also, in 'Regions of Sydney' category box there should be a link to Upper North Shore. We already have Lower North Shore and North Shore there. I have created the page but can't link it.</p>
<p>In the 'City of Rockdale' can you please include the suburb of Kingsgrove? Also, in the 'City of Hurstville', I think the suburb box would look neater without the localities (which aren't really that well-known anyway). A minor edit for local government area of Hunters Hill. It should not have an apostrophe in Hunter's.</p>

<dd>I'm not really sure. I'm not in Sydney (from Adelaide and have only spent a month in Sydney but it was at <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonnyrigg%2C_New_South_Wales_5ca0.html" title="Bonnyrigg, New South Wales">Bonnyrigg, New South Wales</a> the whole time) so I don't know much about geographic accuracy. When I created the templates, I just copied the list of suburbs from <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Rockdale_e03a.html" title="City of Rockdale">City of Rockdale</a> and used "South-Eastern Sydney <i>because the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Rockdale_e03a.html" title="City of Rockdale">City of Rockdale</a> article said so - actually it didn't I did a copying error so I fixed it to southern. If you think there are suburbs missing then add them and discuss at <a href="../../../s/y/d/WP%7ESYD_52ca.html" title="WP:SYD">WikiProject Sydney</a> or <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">User:Nickj</a>, the Sydney suburbs guru.

<p>Justin Langer shows up as an Australian Roman Catholic, Mark Taylor as " People of Wagga Wagga" , Clive Lloyd as Freemason, all the Australians have the state/city cat and this cat is APART from the state cricket cat,Phil Tufnell has a Winner of TV program category, David Gower has "people living in Kent" . So all these categories are not "relevant" from the cricket point of view and not from the individuals personal life point of view either. So where does one start or stop with such categories, why stop at religion and say state/ associations alumni categories not related to cricket are OK&#160;? One should then look to remove all these categories. But then clearly the number of categories impacted would have a large number of people who would want them back, so why are we playing god and saying we cannot put categories related to religion for the cricketers and allowing all these superflous to cricket categories&#160;? The aim is not to remove these categories as they clearly mean something to people who can identify with them, but to be more inclusive. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 13:50, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Congrats on your RFA!

Fix that and I think you're there: it's certainly extensive and well-researched. I just discovered Charles Floyd (conductor) - yet another part in the great Ron Sorensen spamwave of 2005. (Aren't "user contributions" and "what links here" great for this kind of thing?! Probably worth doing just before you speedy anything...) I slapped a speedy tag on it, there's a prod on Ron Sorensen's sole album, and there's a CFD debate on his "albums" category... this seems to cover the entire series of articles now. But just because it's wonderful and it's all about to be removed from Wikipedia otherwise, I think it's worth including a quote from one of the articles:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">This is the first recorded offering from this singer/songwriter. It has heartfelt lyrics that are drawn from personal experiences, past love's, heartbreak's and triumph. Every note skillfully painted into the final masterpiece. If ever there was an album that could be listened to daily, one that contained excerpts mirroring current individual inner trials and tribulations, this is it! A must listen to for all whom have ever experienced heartache, passion for life, and most of all a hunger for change. <b>Ron Sorensen</b> is a hidden treasure among faux talents in a world of mass distributed coffee cup coasters. This CD also offers wonderful artwork designed by Rich Smith <a href="http://www.richsmith.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.richsmith.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, a talented musician in his own right and creative force behind the look and feel of the CD's graphic design.

<p>That many huh? Well the figure might be a little bloated due to the fact that deleting images record a log entry for every revison of the image, if an image have 10 versions when you delete it it will generate 10 entries in the deletion log. I also mostly delete images rather than articles (orphan fair use, no source, redundantes etc), but thanks all the same&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 07:59, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why thanks. As you might have guessed, it's mainly images. I use a script, so it takes only a few seconds per image for most of them. Editcounts arn't everything. But thanks anyway.

<p>Since this user has a history of exacerbating and retaliating for everything I say anywhere, here is the deal. He knows me from another forum called "<a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>" where my primary account is "YINever" and he is known as "Fenriswolf". He is a staunch Maoist and Chinese nationalist who has followed me from arguments on that site pertaining to politics to here, where he shadows every contribution I make. He will likely cite several articles where at best there are content disputes, but in which he does not have any interest in achieving consensus or good content but merely summarily reverts my changes. As for my alleged insults, he will not be able to provide them. The "communist spy" stuff is his inference from my restoring comments he deleted on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Epoch_Times_1c91.html" title="Talk:The Epoch Times">Talk:The Epoch Times</a> from another user, and I never insulted anyone in his family and this apparently is in reference to a comment he has imagined on GameFAQs, not here. He made this charge the first time he vandalized my user page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TJive&amp;diff=22587933&amp;oldid=22185264" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TJive&amp;diff=22587933&amp;oldid=22185264" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Incidentally, this is another demonstration that "PatCheng" has been known by other aliases/IPs, all used for the purpose of stalking me. --<a href="../../../t/j/i/User%7ETJive_a615.html" title="User:TJive">TJive</a> 03:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is obvious you're using sockpuppets. So am I. "TJive" and "YINever" are the same people, on both sites.

<p>See, it's like dealing with a robot. Just makes reports, restates his premises, and never provides real evidence for anything. I provided links to four reverts within the same 24 hour period, he posts a retaliatory report where the reverts are <i>not</i> within the same period, and administrators just ignore <i>both</i>. <a href="../../../y/i/n/User%7EYINever_743d.html" title="User:YINever">YINever</a> 06:09, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've looked at your userspace for the first time since I started editing seriously and I thought it badly needs a lot of decorating. Why are the Australian editors so stingy?</p>
<p>I also have experienced my first kerfuffle as an administrator - two users, pro and anti- Chinese Communist Party, strongly appealing for the other to be banned on my talk page.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 07:02, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for the dispute on your talk page, you should advise them to take it somewhere else, someone else's talk page is not really the appropriate place for a dispute. You also might like to advise them that Wikipedia doesn't want personal disputes that started elsewhere and you'll block them all if they don't grow up. But that's kinda harsh, so you could try looking for someone who knows something about the subject area. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 07:41, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With respect, you were in error to say that there were mutual claims of stalking. I have not been bothering him; he has openly been following me. Now I fear that under "RevolverOcelotX" he is going to utilize a second account to evade 3RR on every single article. He has complete contempt for the rules of this site, which he has just made plain on that forum from which we met:</p>

You're right, it's named after a game, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Jennifer_Government%7E_NationStates_7777.html" title="Jennifer Government: NationStates">NationStates</a> (<a href="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi/" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>), but not something that has anything to do with GameFAQs unfortunately. Good luck in clearing the mess though. <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSL</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">E</font></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../n/s/l/User_talk%7ENSLE_f7ec.html" title="User talk:NSLE">T</a>+<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NSLE_ad4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/NSLE">C</a>)</sub> at 04:35 <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinated_Universal_Time_e510.html" title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</a> <small>(<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_6.html" title="June 6">06-06</a>)</small></p>

<p>Yep, I am a long-time member of the forum, although I haven't been very active in quite sometime. What can I help you out with? Just as a warning, I can't really commit to anything big until after 00:00 Wednesday as I have a busy day tomorrow (Tuesday). If it is something small, I can try to help sooner than that.--<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 05:44, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi there. Sure. Allow me a moment to read over properly and I'll be back. Do you have the screenshot? I don't see it anywhere here. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 07:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks.

As per Rebecca above, I'd lean towards an indefinite block pending a review. If the user account can be proven to be one and the same author of that forum post then there's nothing to be gained by having that attitude around. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 08:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>From where I'm sitting and seeing the situation, I wouldn't land a block yet, but then I'm outside of the problem. If it's advice you're after, I'd give it a little time to see if a course of advice develops at AN/I, giving you the backup of a little more community support. I'll keep an eye on things and assist where I can. - <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 08:18, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<dd>Sorry I was typing whilst on the phone. You have my 100% attention now (human multitasking still has bugs). I read the ArbCom comment back to front sorry during a distraction. Is <i>Fenriswolf</i> correct? I couldn't find a user with that username. Yes, I also recommened an indefinite block pending the outcome (if any) at AN/I. The editor is probably at a University or a workplace with a largish network, and would more than likely come undone if using IT resources for this purpose. I know they would if they were working for me. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 08:33, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's clearer now. Thanks for the clarity update. On one hand, I take the threat seriously, and on the other I see it as bragging and talking up a situation to win with words. Perhaps before a block, keep an eye on the user, and the articles concerned. Blocking without hard evidence is something we generally don't like to do. If you can show me hard evidence the two users are the same, I'll block them myself. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 08:41, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've got your evidence. I've unfortunately now got to pop out for appoximately 3 - 4 hours, but upon my return I'll look into it and act accordingly if nobody else has by then.

<p>This is rediculous. I indeed have several accounts at Gamefaqs, but most of them I have are newly created ones either closed or banned by Gamefaqs moderators. If you look at the details of this Fenriswolf person:</p>
<p><i>User Name Fenriswolf</i> User ID 538693 Board User Level 34: Icon Awarded to users with at least 1000 Karma. No posting restrictions. <b>Account Created 11/3/2002 5:39:52 PM</b> Last Visit 6/6/2006 2:59:12 PM Public E-Mail Address Ask me IM MSN: Ask me Signature Secret boards: -1, 9, 250, 486, 542, 622, 709, 417148, 8535937, 8675309, 20040401, 123456789, 314159265, 909090909 Quote Wishlist: Neverwinter Nights 2, Dragon Age Karma 1168 Contributor Page Contributor Page</p>
<p>Fenris has been at Gamefaqs for nearly 4 years, whereas I have only stumbled across Gamefaqs in early 2005. I have seen Fenriswolf's posts in the Asia and Japan regional boards, and from the nature of them he seems to be a loyal, unquestioned admirer of the Chinese communist government. Myself however, is an Australian citizen. Although I do not oppose the Chinese government, I support eventual democracy in China, and can at least acknowledges its negative aspects. If I was indeed a mindless follower of the Chinese government, then why didn't I remove entire sections of articles such as Falun Gong and Epoch Times regarding negative aspects of the government? I reverts some of TJive's edits due to his choice of wording, such as his insistance in calling certain governments "regimes", and his tendency to edit without discussion, dismissing me as a stooge of the Chinese government on his user page.. If you look at my edit history, I do not delibrately start any vandalism or edit wars, and has contributed lots to science-fiction and videogame related articles. It's unfair to judge me as a vandal based TJive's hearsay, as I do not have such resources this Fenriswolf person claimed, other than my home computer. What concrete evidence do you have to block me indifinitely, other than TJive's hearsay?--<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatCheng_566b.html" title="User:PatCheng">PatCheng</a> 13:07, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My thoughts today? I'm wary, as other editors are, but lacking solid hard evidence matching the two editors, I'm not 100% convinced a block has been earned. That said, I'm not saying I don't belive you, just that the evidence isn't clear. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 04:10, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in support of your block now. I see your block in place, and fully support it on the grounds that a) he's either who you say he is, or b) the account has been comprised. In either event, the account should be indefinetely blocked. Sorry it wasn't a clear case of abuse with an easy answer, but the recent post to AN/I made things a lot clearer. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 06:32, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
