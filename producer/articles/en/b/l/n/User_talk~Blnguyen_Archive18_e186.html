<p>Hi there! Thank you very much for your comments regarding the Panesar entry. It was getting a touch silly as an article, and i had noticed more and more conjecture and supposition creeping in. I'd be delighted to get involved in the wikiproject you speak of. How do i do that? I'm very much a newbie to wikipedia, but i believe in it as a concept and would be happy to be involved. I noted also that you have 111 members. It would be my pleasure to take the score past nelson...</p>

<p>snottygobble the admin has had a message (number 1 on his talk) from what i think is a s-poppet wondering if you could have a look if youre not too busy. thanks <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatuSuro_ccea.html" title="User:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 14:22, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi SatuSuro. I noted that Bpazolli the puppetmaster posted the contents of his failed RfA on his userpage, with his own commentary, in which he labels <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">User:Aksi great</a> a terrorist. So I took the liberty of extending the block indefinitely, as I can't see anything remotely serious about his article contribs or his debating on AfDs. I also blocked the other gentleman you referred me to on Snottygobble's page. From his contribs he can only he a scok, a meatpuppet real-life friend from high school or a spoofer. Thanks, <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 01:37, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is me taking the first step towards resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>1) You deleted me without time for me to respond I was blocked and if I logged into my account my IP is blocked.</p>
<p>2) I was unaware that posting a failed RFA on my user page was not allowed.</p>
<p>3) Someone added an edit warning to my user page, I couldn't edit it I was blocked.</p>
<p>4) User Pages have an allowable level of humour, look at your user page. If you felt I went too far, I would of been happy to change it, but I didn't have the chance.</p>
<p>5) You say that I have made no serious wikipedia edits, but I have look at my contributions. I admit that I am still fairly new but I am making a good amount of edits or at least were.</p>
<p>6) Not a point about the reason you deleted by account, but claims that I started a hoax RFA don't make sense. I started it for me, I thought I had a reasonable chance. As well, the 3RR rule I was not aware of and I had a question about why it kept being taken off, see the RFA discussion page.</p>
<p>7) I want to apologize about my terroist remark, I did not know anything about this user when I made it and it unfortunate that he comes from that part of the world. However, his comments about my beliefs and the queen were inflamentary and unhelpful, if he can't take a bad response when he posts bad comments, then he souldn't say anything. I'm afraid that all of you are taking a bit too seriously. However, I take comments about the Queens very personally.</p>
<p>Finally, please respond, and don't delete this account I will not make any posts unrelated to the reinstatement of my account. One more thing, deleting accounts, mainly Lord Protector and HRH MJW, as sockpuppets of me, just because we agree on a couple of matters isn't fair. HRH MJW was created before bpazolli and Lord Protector was created as a result of his deletion and he has made his own contributions and articles. Though I do enjoy, you thinking that I have such a large influence. -- Bp2000 13:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have noticed some serious edits mixed amongst all the tomfoolery, so I am going to lift the indefinite block and replace it with a 14 day block (extended from the seven day blocks). If you don't evade it with sockpuppets, then the block won't be reset and you can start participating again in 14 days. User pages are allowed to be humourous but attacking other users is not permissible, which is why your commentary about Aksi_great is not acceptable. I am not worried about posting your RfA on the userpage. Your RfA was not a "hoax" but many people are wondering as to whether it was in good-faith/serious, or a joke.

<p>I am writing on behalf of User:Alniko who has been unfairly blocked. He never got a chance to say what he wanted to.

<p>Several times User:Alniko had pointed out this, but he was confronted with false accusation of vandalism and threats of being reported as a vandal.</p>
<p>As User:Alniko pointed out to me users <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajithmohan_b66d.html" title="User:Rajithmohan">User:Rajithmohan</a> supported by <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">User:Sathyalal</a> and at times <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaleks_7ba9.html" title="User:Samaleks">User:Samaleks</a> went onto revert to this FALSE version many times as you can verify by following the edits after 09:03, 6 July 2006 of the Thiruvananthapuram page.</p>
<p>However they forced to edit out the vandalism after this manipulation of Wikipedia reached websites.</p>
<p>The reason for this edit as User:Alniko told me is that there is lot of parochial political activity in Thiruvananthapuram against Kochi. User:Alniko is ready to send you news reports available at websites of established Indian newspapers. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajithmohan_b66d.html" title="User:Rajithmohan">User:Rajithmohan</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">User:Sathyalal</a> seem to be acting with this motivation.

<p>User:Alniko got to know about this distortion of <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi.html" title="Kochi">Kochi</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiruvananthapuram.html" title="Thiruvananthapuram">Thiruvananthapuram</a> pages from User:Manu krishnan and has been active in neutralizing the vandalism spread by <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajithmohan_b66d.html" title="User:Rajithmohan">User:Rajithmohan</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESathyalal_150b.html" title="User:Sathyalal">User:Sathyalal</a> and a couple of others.</p>

<dd>Blnguyen, actually, the largest city stuff isnt disputed. Kochi is indeed the 2nd largest city in Kerala.

<p>Apparently he doesn't know when to quit. You blocked him for 96 hours. So.

Either that's the case and it's a meatpuppet situation or KALM is simply a sock of Alniko. Going to block KALM indefinitely and double Alniko's block.

<p>Hi Blnguyen, Thanks for the help exerted to stop the vandalism in the pages of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiruvananthapuram.html" title="Thiruvananthapuram">Thiruvananthapuram</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/c/Kochi.html" title="Kochi">Kochi</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>. But now he has created a new id KALM and started the same job again, mocking all of us.</p>
<p>Also what he has reported is not correct. Even if you look at the edit history the issue was not relating to 1 million or 1.3 in the talk he has mentioned. I was seeing the same as 1 million for many days before this real issue has started. I do not think I have ever edited this part. What Alniko was trying to do was to remove many other positive facts about Trivandrum, including the technopark pictures, information on RGCB etc. Also he has started this largest city editing racently. We have already discussed this in Kerala Talk page months before(still the information is there). We have added the largest city and largest UA based on those discussions and also based on the populations from official data. Most of the data is given there with citations. Also please go through the edit history for past two weeks, observe what he was editing. Many times he was trying to warn the users saying that if he was not allowed to edit what he wants 'things will go back to where it started', some kind of threat.</p>
<p>See Kerala Talk Page to learn more on this issue..</p>
<p>Also Alniko is running several blogs with hate against the city. Please look at the blog sites mentioned by the users in his(Alniko) talk page. Those blogs will show his hate against the city. In those hate sites also he has mentioned this wiki issue.</p>
<p>And also many of the users warning him are not from either of those cities/or some are from Kochi itself.</p>
<p>I do not think that the majority of users are trying to put one city up or down. I think what Alniko should understand is that this is a fact box and not promotion box. Also he is accussing others for non existing matters, at the same time he is doing what he is accussing against the others.</p>
<p>Also whatever data he claims to have can be put in wiki for discussion so that all users can comment on those or expose the truths.</p>

<dd>Hi Sathya. Yes, looks like he removed the blog, but now that he has shown such strong feelings (which I didn't read), people will scrutinise him a lot more and he has probably made it more difficult to get the changes to the three articles that he wants. Looks like Woohookitty has taken care of the sock. He looks hopelessly outnumbered anyway so why worry? <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 03:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know you're often quite busy, so I hat to have to bother you. I was closing TfD nominations, when I came across Template:Libdempic. I know nothing of image copyright, and normally avoid it like the plague. The consensus of the nomination is to delete the template. However, it is transcluded in many image pages.

If you could please let me know which license should be used in the images where this template is transcluded, I could go and change them all before I delete the template.

<dd>While "promotional" does cover these images, the summary needs to give the source of the images. Template:Libdempic made it clear the image was from the UK Liberal Democrat party. If you are replacing the template with the generic promotional image one, surely you need to also add a note that the image is from the Lib Dems? <b><a href="../../../j/r/a/User%7EJRawle_83db.html" title="User:JRawle"><font color="blue">J</font><font color="navy">Rawle</font></a></b> (<a href="../../../j/r/a/User_talk%7EJRawle_7d9c.html" title="User talk:JRawle">Talk</a>) 16:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Blnguyen,</p>
<p>Congrats on your elevated status as an administrator. I don't know if you saw the treatment that the article SGGS on Meat has got. Please have a look:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point 1: This article is being pushed for deletion while the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Wise_and_the_Foolish_Builders_61ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Wise and the Foolish Builders">Parables</a> articles are being kept. Now, as far as I can make out the group of two articles are similar – So why the different treatment – Is it bias?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Point 2: Some of the comments on the SGGS on Meat article say that - quotations are POV? Well if they are then why are they OK on <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> article?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Point 3: Where is the fairness and unbiased attitude in this? And then we have an Administrator threatening to block me for a simple Afd on an article? Is that how Admin should behave.</li>
</ul>

<li>(1) People in Wikipedia often <i>vote</i> along religious lines. This is unfortunate. If you put the article in an encyclopedic manner it should and will be safe, although if you have the numbers then often you can keep stuff which does not deserve to be there. I feel that this has a good potential to stay if it is fixed up</li>
<li>(2) Quotations aren't POV, I don't think anybody said that. I have given my suggestions on how to improve this so that it is kept.</li>
<li>(3) Actually, if you do an AfD on a very famous person which has no chance of succeeding, you will be blocked for being disruptive. I recall some guy doing and AfD on <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> and he got blocked and another guy who didn't like the Italian soccer team did <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Fabio_Grosso_e4cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fabio Grosso">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fabio Grosso</a> and got blocked as well. It is an inappropriate thing for you to nominate such a renowned philospher in such a way although some admins do have a more confrontational style of expressing their concerns. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 08:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Background</b> Many articles in response to my article SGGS on Meat are being deleted in view of the quotations contained within them – see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Wise_and_the_Foolish_Builders_61ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Wise and the Foolish Builders">Parables</a>. Several Users have made the comment that using quotation was POV and against the policies of Wikipedia. In June 2005, I created a template called Quotation which is widely used – So this created a dilemma for me as according to me, quotations are a tool to discuss the various POVs and support this differing views.</p>
<p><b>Bias or Not</b></p>
<p>Of the two groups of articles for deletion, a bias is present if you look at SGGS on Meat and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Wise_and_the_Foolish_Builders_61ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Wise and the Foolish Builders">Parables</a>. The underlying articles are basically quotes from holy scripts. However, a distinct bias against the <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> article can be seen.</p>
<p>So as several comments regarding the unacceptability of quotation have been made, I felt that as the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> had nearly 20 quotes, this may be a good candidate to continue this deletion policy.</p>
<p>As soon as I had marked this article for AFd, I had the following reaction from the above administrator on my user page:</p>
<p>1). Your tagging of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> for AfD was clearly improper. I suggest you not try something like that again. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 03:59, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>2). Followed by the entry below on the SGGS on Meat article:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy delete</b>, not an encyclopedia article in the current form. If you want to write an article <i><b>about</b></i> the text, then do so, but extensive quotes from the text are not encyclopedic. Neither are your interpretations. That would be Original Research. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 04:01, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The user has failed completely to read the various comments made and has just reacted to my innocent Afd process.</p>
<p>3). To which I asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I see you have selected this article and chosen to leave out the parables? Why is that, I wonder? --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 04:07, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not received a reply to this question. The Administrator has clearly shown bias and prejudice and if was based in the UK would be liable to prosecution. You cannot show a bias on a racial, ethnic or religious basic.</p>
<p>4). Very soon the administrator put this message on my User page:</p>
<p>It was clearly inappropriate and retaliatory. <b>Try it again and I'll block you.</b> <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 04:05, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So apart from showing aggressive mannerism and reactions, he has shown clear blatant bias and aggressiveness. Where is the civility that you recommend to your users? Where is the rationality and courtesy?</p>
<p>I await your response to my initial complaint. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 05:34, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Reply</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Is appropriate on Zoe's behalf. You don't go around sending philosophers like Bertrand Russell to AfD - that would be like sending a Nobel prize winner to AfD. If we keep articles on professors then we don't try and delete world famous ones from 100yrs ago, so if you do this it will be viewed as wilfully disruptive, which is blockable.</li>
<li>(2) Speedy deletion isn't a valid criteria, so don't worry about invalid "votes" - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Felix_Eldridge" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Felix_Eldridge" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Rose_Jackson" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Rose_Jackson" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Felix_Eldridge_703b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Felix Eldridge">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Felix Eldridge</a> where Zoe did some illegitimate speedy deletion - in the first case it was undeleted twice and when I started a proper debate, he recommended <b>speedy delete</b> again and got into a big argument with another admin <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">User:Rebecca</a>. Don't worry about this speedy delete. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion - some people vote keep on POV-soapbox articles because they agree with it. Basically only when there is a copyright is there a rock-solid policy.</li>
<li>(3) Nothing much can be done about this stuff. I see left-wing editors voting to delete non-notable Conservative politicians, but when the exact Labor version comes along they vote keep. and vice versa.</li>
<li>(4) Administrators who using aggressive phrasing are an unfortunate fact of life, as admins generally as a rule do not block each other unless something horrible happens, or there is a clearcut numerical criteria for doing so like <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. It's pointless complaining about admin civility unless they use racist/bigoted language or swear and use personal attacks. Try and maintain high personal standards for yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't try and analyse other people's bias on deletion debates, simply improve the article or argue its merit. If you can effective debunk another argument, then the administrator who closes the debate will usually ignore the wrong argument as it is not strictly a vote. Questioning motives leads to horrible fights. Please see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_User%7EAMbroodEY_Fundy_Watch_984d.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:AMbroodEY/Fundy Watch">Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:AMbroodEY/Fundy_Watch</a>. I've made my comments on how to improve the article. I think that is what you should focus on as this is the outsome you want. Don't bother trying to report this, being abrasive isn't really punishable (not for admins anyway).<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 08:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
