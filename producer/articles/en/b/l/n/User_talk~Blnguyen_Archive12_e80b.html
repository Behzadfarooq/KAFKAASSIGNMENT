I'm sorry you had to listen to the foolish thoughts of a silly girl while you were stressed and having a tough time, my beloved B. Your words have relieved me, but your absence is saddening; and not only because of our friendship, but because it's Wikipedia's loss as a whole to have you away, even for a short while. I'll be waiting for you to return whenever you feel the time is right; please, relax, you've worked so incredibly hard in the last times, that you desperately need a soothing rest. I'll always be around in case you feel like talking.

By the way, I saw you were stressed and hope you know that while this project is extremely lucky to have such a dedicated and kind contributor like you, we all need some time off to relax as well.

<p>I saw your spreadsheet about new admins, and it's interesting data, but I think you had a methodological flaw. Instead of raw support-oppose*3, that column should probably be equalized to a percentage system (support/support+oppose). Then people who had less voters aren't penalized, and your top placements shift a bit (although not in most of the lower cases). Also, Deletes/day is probably a better sort key than raw # of deletions, since the latter is prejudiced toward people who have been around longer (this puts Jaranda in first place by the way, instead of you). -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 16:30, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well I had three sheets on that spreadsheet, with the ranking via three measures, total deletes, delete rate and also delete rate per unit net support. You can have a look using the other two sheets. The reason that I think the percentage system isn't as true as the net support, is that the guy who gets 100-0 is presumably more hardworking or has contributed more than the person who got 25-0; hence I'm using it to work out which admins seem to be overrated or underrated. Just to see who got lots of votes and hasn't been doing much.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 02:58, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blnguyen, are you ok to take on a new trainee? I being so close to the last one I would have normally assigned a new one automatically, but I'm not sure how much of a wikibreak you are on (per note at top of page). Actually taking a glance at your contribs suggests not much of one&#160;:) Let me add to the others- try not to get too stressed at the backlogs. I'm trying to do my bit over at RFA getting some more admins through the system, so hopefully that will help. I did a load of I5 deletions the other day as well- wow there was a lot! <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 10:54, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>well let me address this, first of all i was accepted and started a PhD course at the university of Greenwich London computing and mathematical sciences, and Plymouth university (planetary colligium) uk with supervisor Roy ascott- I’m not doing that PhD no more, not because i quite or sat on my ass and smoked weed, but because i could not afford it. im only 24, yet my artworks all over the world, ive performed my music in 4 countries, Ive published research, ive spoke at the Technarte 2006 art &amp; technology conference, ive written and produced a double concept album, ive taught and lectured at various university’s, im dyslexic but i play guitar, piano, sing, paint, carve stone, engineer music and produce performance and sonic art, yet your very rude and offending comment gives a very narrow mindset for someone of yr supposed stature(remember your a STUDENT). several people are working on that page of me and are not happy and very disappointed by yr "up your own ass attitude comment"</p>
<p>That page was an ongoing work and not a promo or selling spam. it was the start of a 3rd person perspective on my work.</p>
<p>please could you put that page back and MAIL ME BACK ON THIS MATTER</p>
<p>best regards</p>

<dd>Firstly I have to say that <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> tells us that Autobiography is a poor move, and your doing so is inappropriate. Secondly, I deleted it under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">Speedy deletion policy</a> criterion a7, and stated a summary of why this is the case. The basis of the article was that you were a music academic, but your substantiation of being a PhD student is not sufficient for this, as it is far from being a sufficeint grounds for inclusion - although you may feel that I am behaving snobbishly, yes I am a PhD student myself, and no, I am not even remotely close to being notable and thirdly I have no intention of writing about myself. No, I did not accuse you of dropping out, as the article did not say that that had happened, and secondly I did not accuse of smoking marijuana either. If you rewrite the article with an explanation of why you are notable, then we'll see what happens. And you might want to disclose if you were the IP that anonymously blanked my userpage yesterday as that IP also spammed various articles with you self-promotional site. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 04:18, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't worry about it. This is the second time in a week, though, that my tactics have been misread. I was attempting to be polite to the fellow and to mollify him and pat his head. I <i>hope</i> that I indicated that Random J. Professor doesn't pass the bar and that he would need to do considerably better to get the article to stick. I absolutely agree with A7 on doctoral students. We shall have the poor with us, always, and doctoral students. Basically, although CV's aren't mentioned explicitly in the CSD criteria, they generally are. Anyway, I had no doubts and really wanted to keep the complainer from souring. I <i>hope</i> (twice I've hoped) that we can turn these people away without turning them against us by excessive politeness without encouragement. (And, by the way, the article also fails Geogre's law: "Any article with a miniscule surname is already in trouble.") <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Likewise, you'll see that once Hit Bull figured out which article it was, the issue was dropped. I found a couple of self-promoting art gallery refs on google but nothing of real value, and Shem seems to have disappeared as well. So nothing going on here but the usual from a failed vanity author. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 04:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am coming to you rather than the AIV page because you would understand the situation better than other admins. This user's sole intention is to cause trouble. I gave him his final warning for personal threats, yet he goes and makes a sarcastic remark which insults my work as an RC patroller. I am asking for you to take action in the interests of the community. Although he may not have broken any specific rules with the last comment, he has, however, caused disruption to the community, and it would be in the best interests of the community if you blocked him. I ask for a 24 hour block.

<p>I feel a little let down by your decision to delete crossthepond, because as is detailed in the wikpedia guidelines, the keep/delete is not a vote but a discussion. Also the fact that some of the people who voted were there for the first time doesn't make what they say any less of value, as the administrator is meant to gauge the validity of the objections and the arguments for the piece, rather than give precedence to the number of people who think one thing or the other. I don't think there is any real reason not to include the piece, and the reason given, that all the 'keeps' were by first time wikipedia editors isn't really being fair. I would be grateful if you could have another look at the article and the reasons for keeping it, or in particular the reasons for deleting it, which I don't think are based on any reason that fits in with the wikipedia guidelines for deletion. Thank you, Thomas Muirhead--Thomasmuirhead 11:56, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Thomas. I have deleted the article basically for the reasons stated in my closure and in the notes provided by other users as to the new users who came to <b>keep</b> with their first edit - it is traditional to ignore these because it is usually someone associated with the article who has just cruised by, rather than the opinion of a person who has contributed material to the encyclopedia.

<dd>Hi Blnguyen - I have to admit that I share a number of concerns that you have. I have contemplated many times about the sort of leadership that is needed on this site. Sometimes, the best to do is simply what one does best. I have found that if one observes very carefully, those users who we respect tend to do things rather consistently. It is not a burden for them to be professional. I think it is rare for a Wikipedian to come to this site to learn to behave differently - admittingly, I have not seen a user edit fundamentally differently after being informed of something here. I can't speak for the others, but for myself, I know I have held back at times the quality and quantity of contributions I make to Wikipedia, simply because real life takes priority. I suppose to make up for it, I tend to devote some time in real life to promote this site as a potential resource for the sharp and curious.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think becoming an administrator changes a Wikipedian's perspective on how this site works. Sometimes, I have found myself in very complicated situations where there is no guide at all. Other times, I suppose I go out and look for interesting things to do. In either case, it's quite useful to know how to be flexible and creative - I find there is also quite a bit of subtleness that goes along with a "good" administrator. It's amazing how far a bit of observation and careful analysis goes!</dd>

<dl>

<p>Fair enough. I'll remove the adjectives, but the places in question should be mentioned. There is no specific business being advertised. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EVietGrant_2ab1.html" title="User:VietGrant">VietGrant</a> 07:20, 19 July 2006 (UTC)VietGrant</p>

<p>Hey man what's up?

I noticed you also submitted one for Anwar saadat after him. Do you know of anyway to get the ball rolling that I might not know? Maybe I'm being impatient, but hey figured if anyone would know you would. Thanks man! <a href="../../../o/s/u/User%7EOSU80_d26b.html" title="User:OSU80">OSU80</a> 00:18, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
