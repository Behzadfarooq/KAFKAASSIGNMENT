<dd>Well, it's up to you what you make of it really. Depends one how you choose to get involved in things.

<dd>My jihad comment was absolutely correct. Bhaisaab states on his user page that he is a muslim wikipedian. Using crusade would been incorrect since he is not an xtian. I should have been more specific stated that he was pursuing <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">jihad</a> bil lisan which means Jihad by the tongue instead of jihad. the ignorance at the time for not being accurate enough was on my part.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangerous-Boy_5f44.html" title="User:Dangerous-Boy">D-Boy</a> 06:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm looking into it. Sorry, seems like I've caught myself into a moderation of a messy personal attack campaign on some Indian religious articles, I was mentioned in a bogus arbitration case (though not named as a party), and also had to resign from Esperanza, and reply to a complaint as to my comment on an RfA.

<p>Blnguyen, Long time-no speak. Its good to hear from you again. That's quite OK, I don't have a strong view on it at all, merely a suggestion. Like you, my to-do list just seems to get longer. personally, I find that I need to occasionally refocus on straight article editing and totally avoid admin chores, else it just doesn't happen.

<p>I am disappointed by your decision in the closure of the AFD discussion but more importantly, I am very disappointed that you chose not to explain your reasoning when closing the debate. AFD closures are not mere vote-counts. In this case, I believe there were some substantive issues which made this an ambiguous decision. I think there are also some timing issues that deserved noting. I believe that there is some significance to the fact that no one argued to delete after I added my evidence to the discussion and in fact that several users returned to the discussion to remove their "delete" opinions. That kind of comment pattern is generally an indicator that the discussion needs careful analysis before rendering a closing decision.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing for you to change your mind but I would appreciate it if you would return to the AFD discussion page and document your reasoning more fully.

<dd>Is this Wikipedia's guidelines. I think that they don't differentiate between textbooks for university courses and other books like Self Assessment and Board Review.

<dd>I feel so, a five page paper is five papers of new results, and with full derivations can be transformed into a 20 page chapter in a textbook with new info. To be honest, most first year textbooks are recycled copies of one another, and would be less of an achievement than to do new research.

<p>YOu should note that My wish regarding my article is immaterial. But as far as I am concerned, <b>as per the current norms which is given in the pages dealing with notability</b> I am notable.</p>
<p>What is worrying me is the fact that users give a hasty judgement and then try to search reasons to justify that and in <b>that process</b> (of justification) slander me. If you see the whole arguments, you will see that I have been able to substantiate my points far better than those opposing it</p>
<p>To summarise</p>
<p><b>1. Notability of Books.</b> THe books have an ISBN Number. 5 books are published by reputed firms. 4 of those are published by the biggest medical publisher in India. In such a case, one user who gave a knee jerk comment in the first place has choosen the 6th (1 out of 6 minority) and say that it is self publishable. He has ignored 5 because his ego prevents him from going back on his earlier words</p>
<p><b>Notability (people)</b> 1. Published authors - 6 books is more than enough to satisfy this criteria</p>
<p><b>Notability (doctor)</b> May be there is nothing called as exam preparation in western world, but here it is a budding field. I did not give these links it that page as it will amount to "self-glory", but since you seem to understand, I am giving you few links. You can search at www.rxpgonline.com <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.rxpgonline.com+bruno+help&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.rxpgonline.com+bruno+help&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> www.aippg.net/forum<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.aippg.net+bruno+help&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.aippg.net+bruno+help&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and www.netmedicos.com <a href="http://www.netmedicos.com/contributors/default.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.netmedicos.com/contributors/default.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> You may think me of some one obsessed with self glory, but the point to prove is that, unless some one is regarded as an expert in that area, you will not see students from the length and breath of a country with 1000 million population to ask for my help</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>Regarding the counter points</p>
<p>1. The article was not written by me. When this controversy erupted, I read the guidelines regarding autobiography and has followed what is given in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO#If_Wikipedia_already_has_an_article_about_you" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO#If_Wikipedia_already_has_an_article_about_you" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO#If_Wikipedia_already_has_an_article_about_you</a> Even without going through the debate, when users accuse of vanity (as if I have created the article) it hurts a lot</p>
<p>2. WP:BIO clearly says that you can have articles on published authors. There is no talk about Junior/Senior, Undergraduation/Post Graduation, Fiction/Nonfiction etc.</p>
<p>My main concern is that all these points come out only after I put a counter question. They are not the real facts, but are made up as the users ego prevent them from stepping back. In order to substantiate the hasty vote, they invent new guideline. Wounded by these new "self invented" guidelines, I even deleted the article my self, but that has been restored<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 07:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Blnguyen</p>
<p>You have explained well. Now I understand that even though my books have been published, I may still fall short of the notability criteria as the books are not "textboks" or well known (throughout the world) If some one had said this on day one, it would have been nice. Instead, I had comments like Junior doctor/ limited shelf life etc and quoting one book while ignoring the other 5 that made be irritated.

<dd>I asked about his exam credential because he said that he is "a doctor with extensive education and major contributions to two international textbooks." and "never read this particular author's "books" to prepare for my PG entrance exams in Delhi, nor heard about him from my extended group of doctor/medical student/PG friends all over North India." When he is using his education to argue a point against me, I feel that it is appropriate for me to ask about his academic qualifications. Please note that I did not ask whether he is a MBBS or not. I just asked his rank for which he has not answered, but is going around talk pages discrediting me.</dd>

<dd>About the copyvio thing, <b>unlike the previous years, they do not get the question papers back after the exams(they used to do this before 2002). The question papers are released after the exam. Hence there is no problem at all. This has been very well verified by the publisher before coming out with the book</b> By the way, please see what he himself says "doctors like Salgunan, Bhatia et al could claim to be much more widely read authors of such "best-sellers", with an evidently much wider circulation." Both of these doctors (as well as a host of others) have done the same thing as me. In fact they even did that prior to the era when the question papers have to be returned along with the answer sheets and were not released after the exam. They publish a guide with the questions and answers (only answers) where as I give references and explanation etc. The very fact that he does not care to question Bhatia and Salgunan (I don't say that he should do that !!!) but is worried about the copyright vio only with me substantiates the fact that this user has malicious intention against me. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 02:47, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is very simple. Let me explain a bit. He says that my books violate the Copy Right. <b>It is not at all related to Wikipedia. It is about the 3 books I have published.</b> One more thing you have to note is the fact that it is not mentioned anywhere that I have written a book for AIIMS. I have so far written only for ALl India. THe AIIMS book is not yet released. But he has also included that in his message. That means the guy has some personal agenda (in real world - may be another author) against me. Initially he said that there are no books at all authored by me. After the existence of books were proved, it was the Notability Issue. Now since it has been proved that the books are notable he has stepped further and says that my books may violate the copyright and hence should not be included. The bottom line is clear. He (and few others) want my article to be deleted for reasons other than Wikipedia. This proves the fact that he has some personal malicious intention against me. I wish you (and other Genuine Wikipedians) understand the issue and revise your opinion accordingly.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 03:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is what I am telling from day 1. The main aim of nominating the AFD is to slander me in the debate. If they write something wrong or defaming in the article, it can be deleted citing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> Instead they have choosed to defame me in the AFD.</dd>
<dd>They did not expect me to take the bull by the horns and reply myself. Once I did that, they kept changing the stands and others like you were also misguided. You can now see a opinion from an anonymous account. How many AFD pages do you see an anonymous account giving such a lengthy explanation for "spirit of the rules"</dd>

<dd>Sorry for the delayed reply - I was busy in real life. Well, the question on copyvio was made to ascertain facts in relation to the AfD on his biography, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_dc24.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas</a>, which was an ongoing activity at the time of asking my question. Anyway, his labelling my query as questionable behavior is akin to his ongoing rule lawyering as pointed out by multiple editors on the AfD and I don't want to inflame the issue any further, since I have no personal interest in this issue. That preserved page on AfD is a stark reminder of challenges of countering an editor with a subjective point of view along with major ego issues, using rule lawyering as an iron rod to try and browbeat fellow editors leaving their comments on AfD. <a href="../../../e/y/e/User%7EEyeMD_e9c0.html" title="User:EyeMD">EyeMD</a> 10:07, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As it has been pointed out, his questioning me about <b>the contents of my book, when it has nothing to do with Wikipedia was my concern</b>. He initially said that you know nothing about my book and have not heard about my books(see the debate please) inspite of his extensive education and unverifiable claims about contribution to books. He later questioned about the specificities which can be done only if he had read the book (and that means this guy has cheated the entire wikipedia community with his first message that he has not heard about the books). Any how, for any doubts regarding copyright issues in real world, he should have mailed me directly (I have the mail option enabled). The question of that AFD debate was verifiability (that was proved clearly) and notability (a subjective criteria regarding which there were varied opinions). <b>None of the issues had any relation to the contents of the book</b>. That preserved page on AFD is also a stark remainder of how few useless criminal guys can write <b>unverifiable deliberately false propaganda about some one whom they may not like in real life</b>. And our EyeMD is one of such persons who <b>use wikipedia for their personal gains</b> and in my opinion, <b>wikipedia will be a better place if such irresponsible users are weeded out</b><a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctorbruno_d35f.html" title="User:Doctorbruno">Doctor Bruno</a> 17:38, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. You reinstated the RfA section in the above template when it was removed by Crzrussian. He has again removed the section with the summary: "<i>once again, and for the final time, I have rmved the inappropriate RfA section. Such electioneering is beneath you, Wikipedians</i>". I find this charge to be baseless as that template was never intended to be an electioneering tool. So should the section be reintated again or should we leave it that way? - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 05:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Aksi. I dont know how that is an electioneering tool. There is enough evidence on your talk page that all Indians dont see eye to eye with each other. The information on the template only helps all concerned people to voice their opinions -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush">Lost</a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:33, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'll ask him to discuss this. Obviously you can see from the contents above and in the previous archive you that there are many Indian editors who are on extremely bad terms with one another, so putting the template would likely lead to more scrutiny of below-the-belt behaviour on a plethora of religious and historical related articles. Also there is a the same thing at the Australian noticeboard and they are of the opinion that the RfA notice provides an opportunity for more informative comments, as I know that the Australian editors never chack RfA and only look at the noticeboard for Australian discussions, and strongly rebuffed calls to remove the section from the AUS board. It's likely the same here, as most Indian editors focus on the Indian RfAs and could do with a notice. For example I can recall that <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Sukh_5d41.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Sukh">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Sukh</a> did get an opposition from Nobleeagle, because of his activity on the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalistan.html" title="Khalistan">Khalistan</a> page I think, and I don't think the non-Indian editors paid attention to this, for example. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 06:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the prompt reply. Obviously discussing the issue with him would be better than revert warring. Wanted to say that you are doing a great job. I have been following these debates (pro-Hindu vs. anti-Hindu) for 2-3 days now and it really amazes me to see this these people bickering on so many talk pages at the same time.

<p>I recreated the Shadowclan page about a month ago and it has been up since then. Suddenly it was deleted again. I assumed that you didn't have a problem with that page and that it made an appropriate claim to importance.

<p>Since you are the only other admin i'm aware of I was hoping you could direct me. Another admin, Kimchi, is deleting a wiki article I created. In the process this admin is using ad hominem attacks against me '<b>Lastly, there's no need to automatically write something in response to every delete comment - it makes you look silly.</b> calling me silly for no apparant reason. I havn't written a single response (To my knowledge) to any delete comments and yet i'm being called names for trying to provide the evidence this admin asked for.

<p>Hey.. This is concerning the editing of the Student Newspapers in Mallya Aditi International School page. Im not sure if you know anything about our school or not, but The Scribbler is infact an official magazine that has been approved by the principal of our school. I've edited the page again and I hope you understand the fact that our school has more than one papers in circulation.</p>
<p>'The Joke' is a satirical paper which unlike ours, was never granted the permission to be circulated or sold in school.</p>
<p>Our paper, The Scribbler, does have the principal's permission, and before it releases, it's proof-read by one of our teachers. So... in the future, please remember that The Scribe isn't the only School Newspaper. =)</p>

<p>All too often you seem a comfortable voice of sanity around here. Any chance you'd be able to attend to a problem I'm having?</p>
<p>I wrote a message on <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">User:Aranherunar</a>'s talk page regarding the spelling of 'civilisation' He took offence to what was blunt, but not offensive and subsequently placed a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> warning on my talk page. I removed this warning (considered by me to be an insult, and a waste) with the edit summary 'rmv crap'. Aranherunar then placed the warning back, stated that he was going to remove the original warning anyway, but was now going to continue to insist on it being placed there due to my edit summary of 'rmv crap' which he considered offensive. A tit-for-tat revert war is now taking place on my talk page. I stated that "All you're doing is playing tit-for-tat. A endless shit-slinging match goes nowhere. Spend your time contributing to Wikipedia instead." and got:</p>
<p>"Yes, I was going to remove that NPA warning, which I deemed unnecessary until then. However, an abusive edit summary, under any circumstances, no matter you are right or not, is completely unacceptable. I would have thought you had more sense than that. Your removal of warnings is completely childish. Rather than telling me to spend my time contributing to Wikipedia, why don't you? The removal of warnings is completely unnecessary. They do not in any way hinder your ability to contribute. Instead, you have decided to start an edit war on the warnings. This is completely immature, forgive my frankness, and I would suggest you to stop it right away before an admin has to come to solve this dispute which isn't needed at all."</p>
<p>Can you please offer an outcome?
