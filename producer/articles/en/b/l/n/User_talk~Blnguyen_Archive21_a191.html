<p>Hi Blnguyen. Sorry to not reply earlier - I had quite a good day nowhere near a computer yesterday. I would be happy to have an RfA. I would be honoured if you would write a nomination up, although I am sure it could not be as flattering as some of the others you have written! <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 11:20, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! I hope you are doing fine. I would like to humbly ask you to analyse critically and without any reservations about the edits I made for the past one or two weeks. Please inform me about the areas which I need to improve. Your comments would be deeply appreciated as well. Hope that you can help. You could also refer this message to other admins that you think could help me as well. In this way, I would be having the different opinions from various admins. Thank you for your kind attention!

<p>Hi Blnguyen, you blocked <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">User:Netscott</a> recently for one week for persistent 3RR violations. Unfortunately, an editor who was involved in the content dispute on Netscott's side unblocked him and reduced the block to 24 hours. Netscott has spent the last few days doing almost nothing but troll regarding the same issue, and it has now gotten out of hand. I can't take admin action myself as I'm involved in the dispute. Would you please take a look at the situation and consider reinstating your block? <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#User:Netscott" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#User:Netscott</a>.

<dd>Thanks for your note. It's probably best to keep it centralized on AN/I. The only reason I didn't bring up the block shortening before is that the admin who unblocked said he had discussed it with you. This is no longer about the shortening in itself, but about the further trolling that has taken place, which is among the worst I've seen on Wikipedia, so it's best to put it on AN/I.

<dd><i>Hi again. Actually, Bastique discussed it on IRC with Pschemp and a few other admins, unblocked, and then notified me on my talk page, then I went to IRC, was shown the parts of the conversation, and didn't wheel war because I've already had my "serving" so to speak and there was a consensus to not do so, although I am still puzzled that 5++ 3RR blocks only incur 1 day. JoshuaZ and Bakasuprman thought the block was OK though. Unfortunately, it was never disclosed to me that Bastique had himself edited the article in question.

<p>Not sure what you meant when you mentioned the source, but the problem is that the paragraph read quite POV. I am especially disturbed by the notion that the Ireland's wins were "out of touch" - I remember that this kind of music was very popular at that time, and Irish flutes were absolutely everywhere. Katrina's winning song in 1997 isn't that different, actually, and Ireland still came strong second.</p>
<p>Secondly, not every country did a televote in 1997, it was a gradual process. I believe there were quite many reasons for the inclusion of televote, so this hypothesis, even sourced, seems quite suspicious to me - perhaps somebody really didn't like the Irish songs (I mean, I don't either, but I don't think it's the right way to pursue one's agenda). I guess the only reliable source would be one officially linked to the ESC or EBU - for example, there are official sources stating that some countries skipped one contest in the 70s because they were dissatisified with the four-way tie. If there is an OFFICIAL source saying that televoting was introduced because of the dissatisfaction with Ireland's fourth win, this can be included (though I believe the song's article is not the right place to do do, it would be better if the general Eurovision article and the 1997 Contest one said that). But by no means should the expression of somebody's dislike of a musical genre have place in any article.</p>

<dd>Hmm, how about I publish a book and say that Ruslana won because she was wearing no underwear (this was a very widespread rumor among detractors), as I really hated her winning over the fabulous Lena Philipsson (if you'd ask me, Brian Kennedys and Johnny Logan should perish without a trace but Melodifestivalen artists should be worshipped daily). Even if he calls his book "official history", he is no EBU, or no national broadcaster. I guess as every author he is trying to add "flavor" to his story. I see that the (featured, after all) Eurovision article quotes the same book when saying that the 1997 was the first year of televoting, but all else is skipped. I would say we should follow this good example. Regards, Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 00:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi blnguyen, user JFD is actually not uncivil... the other user(s) have had a serious issue with POV and a serious issue with being uncivil on the page Indian martial arts... look at the last discussion and the archives and the wonderful headliners... basically, the article before JFD and i intervened stated that India was the birthplace of all martial arts, it stated taht the british were the cause of the downfall of indian martial arts, and it quoted the birth of martial arts from a generic sanskrit term for wrestling... without any citations of any article... i have tried to place disputed tags on the article in the past but user Freedom skies then removes them and denies that the dispute is ongoing... <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKennethtennyson_9c48.html" title="User:Kennethtennyson">Kennethtennyson</a> 22:56, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>regardless, you recently blocked me for 3R on the article indian nationalism... just wanted to explain myself. I was merely attempting to leave disputed tags on an article that was blocked prior to this and remains in dispute... the problem with these tags for disputed articles and POV articles is that the people writing them are POV and thus tend to move the tags off the article... and then deny the existence of the dispute... wikipedia should have a policy where someone who is a member for at least 6 months can place the tag for 12 hours and if it is placed, it cannot be removed for 12 hours by anyone except the person placing the tag. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKennethtennyson_9c48.html" title="User:Kennethtennyson">Kennethtennyson</a> 22:56, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Never mind. I'll ask around elsewhere. Incidentally, I would like to mildly object to the closing of the afd on Vindhyachal House, though, in which you merely said that sockpuppets never prosper or something. There may have been a couple of socks there, but I think a few important points about notability were being raised -by more than one established user, incl myself - and should hsve been addressed by the closing admin or through relisting. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 07:52, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that both Netaji and Holywarrior have been blocked. While I'll talk about Netaji later, I am troubled by Holywarrior's constant defiance to admin authority. Here, in the diff I provide, he has stated that he will ignore admin warnings and continue to vandalize the articles. I believe that his sentence should be extended for threatening vandalism so that he may have some more time to cool off and contribute meaningfully to wikipedia. Please let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Well the tone of the comment is sarcastic and unhelpful whilst discussing touchy topics. I didn't feel that it was defamatory, as these are usually when you make comments which besmirch the integrity or character of a person, or claim that they did something which they didn't etc. Here you are expressing your opinions on the work done by a historian, saying that you think it is non- serious. Also BLP is to prevent slanderous claims being put on the article, rather than people voicing their opinions on the talk page, although to be sure, it's better not to make potentially inflammatory comments on talk pages either.

<dd>Yes, there was a conflict of interest there although I did not create those things myself. However the RfA started before the AfD and I was approached by about 10 different editors to run in the month before that as well. I have since undertaken a policy of not closing any Eurovision AfDs - I could have blocked User:Stanfordandson on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Du_Bist_053c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Du Bist">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Du Bist</a>, but chose not to. Having said that, if you see my userpage for my contrib list, I have written some 100+ articles on swimming, and maybe 20 on cricket, but I am still relentless in deleting nn cricket and swim clubs - pls see <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_AfD_f457.html" title="User:Blnguyen/AfD">User:Blnguyen/AfD</a>. So there is an issue there, yes, although I see people closing AfDs on religious/political things when they have edited analogous stuff also. Since the songs are at the same level as the xxx in ESC year, then it isn't obvious so I would abstain from doing so. In this case, seeing as the deletion was clearly in the minority, I don't think it remotely came close to being a factor, but I've avoided doing as such ever since.

<dd>I read your comments several times, and I don't completely understand. I'll paraphrase what I'm guessing that you mean. I think you mean that you are refraining from making admin decisions on article types that you have been a contributor on (such as Eurovision, cricket, and swim clubs)? And that it was a single decision that you have avoided since? If so, then I think "Let bygones be bygones". <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 03:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
