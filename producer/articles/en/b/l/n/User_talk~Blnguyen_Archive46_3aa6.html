<dd>Well, as a newbie who wrote that in December 2005, who did not know about OR, etc, I just decided it to be the case as he was the youngest of the guys on an A-grade contract, and nobody else born later than 1981 was even on a contract at that stage. Yuvraj (81) and Kaif (80) were on a B-grade contracts, and even if they became captain they might retire before Pathan does. Apart from that, well I couldn't see Harbhajan ever being captain of any team, not even the most volatile Pakistan team, and aside from that the next youngest guy on an A-grade contract was Laxman, who is ten years older.....Well I guess it'll probably be Karthik once Dravid, Sehwag and Yuvraj are all retired. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 07:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi there. You made some comments (indeed objections!) to Monaco's FAC some time ago. Believe it or not it's still on the list. I think your point about the writing still stands, but I'm not even going to start on that until I've sorted the structure. We disagreed about the validity of having a list of 'notable races', but I've proposed an approach on the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Talk%7EMonaco_Grand_Prix_aa72.html" title="Talk:Monaco Grand Prix">talk page</a> which I think might address your concerns anyway.

When I first became aware of him he was trying to add content to high school articles. Since then he seems to have headed towards a vandalism only account (although not a very active one), but I just became aware of this now. I saw the latest addition to his user page, which seems to violate <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and checked his other contribs. Since he hasn't edited in main space in almost a month, I am not sure what harm he is doing now. If he were active more, I would just report him at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, but I was not sure what to do in this case and hoped you could take a look or steer me in the right direction if there is somehwere to notify about users like this.

<p>I have already done the usual combing last weekend. Saw the FAC but I usually don't comment on them unless it is to register some concern (last support vote IIRC was in the Ashes FA in May 2005). Only suggestions for improvement (not serious ones, so may be ignored) is that more prominence should be given to the chucking affair and less to the whiskey business which is one of the things media stirred up because they had nothing better to do. Throwing, IMO, should be included within his description of his career because it is one of the first things that you would remember when you think of Harby. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 06:41, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I did lookup "coi" in an online dictionary for the "testicles" so I think that he should have retracted it after the concerns were raised. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 03:31, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sir, regarding this article which was much vandalised and seems to have stabilised now after the exit of Sarvabhaum, I am concerned about his POV on citation #34. From past experience with Sarvabhaum and Mahawiki I feel this citation may be a fabrication. No historian of repute (Altekar is well known) will make such a sweeping statement given the evidence from so many scholars to the contrary and mention things like "heart of Maharashtra" etc. I hate to remove a citation no matter how flaky it looks and hence this message.

<p>Arbitrator:</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Walter_a72e.html" title="Richard Walter">Richard Walter</a> seems to have been created with a large amount of false information, perhaps gathered from a phony/ anonymous press release posted at <a href="http://www.richarddwalter.com" class="external text" title="http://www.richarddwalter.com" rel="nofollow">"www.richarddwalter.com"</a>. Walters's false testimony was actually confirmed in NY v. Robie Drake. In 2003 and again in 2006 his testimony was determined to be false, misleading and could be presumed perjurious on at least one point (perjury being a very specific type of false testimony) by a fedeal judge.</p>
<p>This is all confirmed in the judge's ruling at: <a href="http://www.corpus-delicti.com/drake_v_Portuondo_2006.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.corpus-delicti.com/drake_v_Portuondo_2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">"NY v. Robie Drake"</a> (2006). The acrobat file here was obtained from <a href="http://www.nywd.uscourts.gov/decision/decision.php" class="external text" title="http://www.nywd.uscourts.gov/decision/decision.php" rel="nofollow">United States District Court, Western District of New York</a>. Just select judge John Elfvin's rulings for March 2006 re: the Drake case. You'll need to select more than 100 documents per page to see it. Get the drake file.</p>
<p>I editted the many factual inaccurancies in the page with references to the court record online and articles regarding Mr. Walter's false testimony. However an anonymous editor immediately swooped in and removed those edits. I have reverted the page and posted a warning to the anonymous editor. Now Buzzle45 (<a href="../../../b/u/z/User_talk%7EBuzzle45_f037.html" title="User talk:Buzzle45">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Buzzle45_a0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Buzzle45">contribs</a>), an original anonymous creator of this false information page designed to rescue Walters flailing credibility, has stepped in to replace anonymous editor <span class="plainlinks">24.240.17.187 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.240.17.187.html" title="User talk:24.240.17.187">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.240.17.187_e7f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.240.17.187">contribs</a> â€¢ <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=24.240.17.187" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=24.240.17.187" rel="nofollow">WHOIS</a>)</span>. I am not certain these are two separate individuals.</p>
<p>At any rate, I expected that whoever created the page would change the edits and that this issue would become something that needed an official look - as there are quite a few dedicated and obsessed people determined to keep the actual substance of this court ruling from being public. It hurts Walter, and it hurts more than a few because of their association with him.</p>
<p>Anonymous editor 24.240.17.187 has removed the Richard Walter page at least six times aleady and has also removed this section from the Talk: Richard Walter page at least six times, since 3/18/07 to prevent me from even having a civil discussion about it with others. Buzzle45 (<a href="../../../b/u/z/User_talk%7EBuzzle45_f037.html" title="User talk:Buzzle45">talk</a> <small>â€¢</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Buzzle45_a0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Buzzle45">contribs</a>) has done the same. Not exactly actions that are conducive to resolution, let alone communication. They just don't want the ruling public because of their hero worship (that's assuming that one of the individuals is not actually Richard Walter -this a very distinct possibility).</p>
<p>This informaion is not libelous. It is corrective. It is the posting of a court's ruling using the court's own document. The Wikipedia entry currently states that Walters was exonnerated by the judge in the Drake case. This is not just false, it is beligerantly deceptive at this point.</p>
<p>Note please that I am the only person in this dispute who must testify in court on a regular basis, under oath - and that I am also the only one willing to be identified.</p>
<p>As it stands, the article is full of false and bloated information about Walters that is designed to prop him up despite the court ruling - so that those who use Wikipedia as their primary nfo source (and there are many too many) will be misled. It is a disgrace to the professional community, and it is the furtherance of a weakly crafted fraud.</p>

<p>Why is Mr. Turvey so relentless in trying to slander Richard Walter?</p>
<p><br />
To accuse someone of perjury is a serious charge. Mr. Turvey makes that claim on his own websites, but that is a matter between Mr. Walter and Mr. Turvey to settle in civil court.</p>
<p>I hold Wikipedia to a higher standard.</p>
<p>In reading the court document, in the final ruling in the Drake case, the judge overturns the appeal.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the judge states that Mr. Walter "may" have committed perjury (which he did not), but he rules that such an issue is a moot point because Mr. Drake does not have the basis for appeal.</p>
<p>Thus, Drake's appeal, and all of its allegations are ruled false.</p>
<p>I welcome you to read the decision on Lexis-Nexis and not Mr. Turvey's version on his websites.</p>
<p>While on Lexis-Nexis, I would also encourage you to read about Mr. Turvey's false statements under oath in Mississippi last year and his previous false statements under oath regarding his employment by the Sitka, Alaska Police Department as a detective. (Mr. Turvey lost in court in his bid to claim that he was employed as a detective in Sitka).</p>
<p>Because Mr. Turvey was not allowed into the AAFS, he has spent his short career creating his own organizations and schools. His organizations are nothing more than him and a few of his former "students" posing as a substitute for the AAFS.</p>
<p>Still, the bitterness of rejection has never been exorcised from his soul. He maintains a website that lists several well-respected forensic pathologists as "frauds" (Mr. Walter is not his only victim).</p>
<p>With all due respect, his situation reminds me of a jealous child in the playground who wants to "take his toys and play on his own".</p>
<p><br />
I suggest that the Richard Walter page remain permanently locked in its pre-March 17th state.</p>
<p>Please disregard Bturvey's threat to "show why wikipedia can't be trusted as a source in my class". He has many more enemies than friends; no one will stand in his defense.</p>
