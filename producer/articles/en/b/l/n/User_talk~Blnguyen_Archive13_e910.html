<p>I've seen Subhash Bose in a number of other articles and while he may seem POV-Pushing at first, he has the potential to become a good Wikipedian. He has a good grasp of things happening in India and doesn't hold the "Get out of this page if you are anti-Hindu" or something POV even though I have seen him get agitated because of some anti-Hindutva edits. Perhaps he just needs encouragement and needs to learnt to conform to Wikipolicy. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 07:27, 7 July 2006 (UTC) You have blocked another user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Subhash_bose" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Subhash_bose" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> because of WP:NPA. While I <i>strongly disagree</i> with this user's personal attacks and his userpage, a user must be warned before being blocked. Looking at his talkpage, I see he wasn't warned, and the dispute resolution process wasn't followed. The incident should rather be reported first at WP:PAIN. I think a weeklong first block without any prior warning and for a relatively mild case is too harsh. He should first be warned for personal attacks and the first block should be shorter. Please point me to the policy that justifies a weeklong block without prior warning. Especially since in many other cases, users weren't blocked for worse PA's even after warnings <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Irishpunktom&amp;diff=56347919&amp;oldid=56301217" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Irishpunktom&amp;diff=56347919&amp;oldid=56301217" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<p>You blocked <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">User:Subhash bose</a> for one week. It usually not done so with new users. People have different habits before joining wikipedia. I suggest you to reblock him for a shorter term, unless you have specific reasons for long block. (e.g., a suspected sockpuppet. Simply very strong language is not a valid reason: different cultures have different tolerance to words; it is a matter of education of new users, rather than punishing them. Long blocks are for persisting violators). Thank you, `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:26, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I reviewed the uncivility of user:Subhash bose and I must say that his attacks are very mild in comparison what I've seen in wikipedia. Of course, they are inacceptable, but I think the user must be mentored, rather than blocked. I think he may be given another chance, with heavy warning. I am unblocking him, but will watch his behavior. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:58, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

If this is the case, good for him. I am not aware of any other possibilities. On the other hand, I don'd do much blocking and I see that blocking/unblocking tool changed.

<dd>Bear in mind that LKAdvani here uses CENSORSHIP of the STALINIST UPA government as a justification for retaliating against my own humble self. Why should wikipedia give a rat's rear-end whether the Indian government bans a website or not? eh? A government that practices censorship of FREE-SPEECH is not a democratic government and is automatically suspect in all it's 'disseminated facts' *cough propaganda *cough. Pro-Hindutva am I? Maybe. But LKAdvaani here is equally biased if you look at his edit histories calmly and objectively. His disturbing screed against hindus (NOT hindutva people, ALL Hindus) in various talk pages, combined with his glaringly Hindu userid, indicates either a level of personal dichotomy that borders on schizophrenia, or a deep loathing for all things Indian. What about HIS BIAS? Am I not a counterbalance to his quasi-communist ravings?<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 02:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If User Subhash is not highly right wing POVed.His knowledge of the topics he is editing is perverted and of the type usually called as misinformation - some call it ignorance and an encyclopoedia in such hand s will be disastrous for Wikipedia.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61349527&amp;oldid=61286591" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61349527&amp;oldid=61286591" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61349527&amp;oldid=61286591</a></p>
<p>Here he adds: The United Nations International Human Rights Commission has not recognized the Gujarat riots as a human rights issue.</p>
<p>Now user 62. something changed it to read: The United Nations International Human Rights Commission has recognized the Gujarat riots as a human rights issue adding links to UN articles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61353881&amp;oldid=61353537" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61353881&amp;oldid=61353537" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61353881&amp;oldid=61353537</a></p>
<p>Pat comes Subhash with the change: The United Nations International Human Rights Commission has not yet fully recognized the Gujarat riots as a human rights issue. However, campaigns to recognize it have been made by Islamist organizations like the world muslim congress demanding expediency in the process</p>
<p>And take a look at what he writes to the user 62.</p>
<p>Removed a redundant link. Oh, and to 62.189.60.30, get a login. That way the NSA can know which school you plan to bomb next</p>
<p>Encyclopaedia under such perverted mind - does not add value to wikipedia.Subhash should better avoid these words as they give him away from any login - zeitgeist,adhominem,mein freund.</p>
<p>There has been an explicit use of fowl language towards Muslims - many talk pages like the one below using (Netaji) Login --Note that "Netaji" and "Subahsh Bose" or "Subhash Chandra" are the variants of the name of Indian freedom fighter Subhash Chandra Bose.</p>
<p>Here he calls the dead in Gujarat as terrorists:</p>
<p>The death toll of Godhra was 3000 terrorist jihadis and their sympathizers. Big difference,see? On, and I know that muslims find loyal allies in left wing liberals (like the organizations above) and self-hating hindus(like you, maybe). Like I said, you may post the link if you wish, but then I have evidence to balance it out with an endless litany of muslim genocides and atrocities in Gujarat itself. The truth about Islam is something you muslim-lovers don't want on wikipedia. Netaji 16:39, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>and the use of "be" in Hindi is similar to provoking one to fight. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERushdie_6ab3.html" title="User:Rushdie">Rushdie</a> 12:37, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi: I noticed that on the Administrator's Noticeboard you said that you had noticed that Subhash Bose has not made any pronounced POV edits. I would direct you to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_Gujarat_violence_54bb.html" title="2002 Gujarat violence">2002 Gujarat violence</a>, which I have stopped editing precisely because of his constant POV-pushing and unpleasantness on the talk page. In particular, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61353881&amp;oldid=61353537" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=61353881&amp;oldid=61353537" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=57428098&amp;oldid=57427497" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=57428098&amp;oldid=57427497" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=58678826&amp;oldid=58631983" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2002_Gujarat_violence&amp;diff=58678826&amp;oldid=58631983" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. He also tends to remove references and hyperlinks that do not agree with whatever POV he wishes to push at the time. Its not such a problem, because I think he basically is capable of understanding what NPOV actually is, he just acts out a lot of anger in the way he edits. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 08:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reply, and I hope you're back soon. I just wanted to say that I was not in any way comparing the length of disbarring handed out to Subhash Bose and Wikiskeptic, as I dont know anything about the latter's case. Also, I read the various posts above from other admins criticising the ban on the grounds that Bose is a newbie, and I have to say I disagree strongly. This editor does not need to be gently introduced to protocol, he needs no mentoring; he knows exactly what he is doing and thinks he can get away with it. Two different problems, two different approaches, and yours was correct. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 11:42, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your support, especially on my stance against religious and personal attacks. I'm not stressed by holding personal attackers to account, it's mainly the deletion backlog.

<dd>I acted out of anger because I AM angry. Nonetheless, those who wish to add edits that don't defame and denigrate hindus in the style of Der Ewige Juden propaganda films are welcome to do so, even when it involves legitimate criticism. Unlike people of a certain 'religion of peace' we don't froth in the mouth when faced with legitimate criticism. If you notice my recent edit of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manu_Smriti_5188.html" title="Manu Smriti">Manu Smriti</a> I have kept all criticisms of it's Brahministic supremacy while removed ridiculous claims of anti-feminism (bah! Feminism is a modern movement and doesn't apply in this context) or racism (racism is a European ideology, what it was was ethnocentric which is different from racism). These details are where the anti-Hindu propaganda begins, and I merely chose to contest that. The reason why I got angry was the clear bias that many admins (not binguyen) showed in favor of muslims like this Anwar saadat chap and Christian Fundamentalists like Wikisceptic. If you're impartial and fair like Binguyen has been (for the most part anyway) there won;t be problems even with punitive measures.(<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 10:30, 18 July 2006 (UTC))

<dd>There is no room for anger on Wikipedia.Secondly, I believe your sarcasm will not be easily digested by whoever you target.May I remind you that you have shown much more froth at mouth than the people of the certain religion of peace and I suspect certain contributors who have supported you in your suspension have done an equal damage to the articles by introducing Weasel wordings in the articles on Hindutva,Ram Janmabhoomi,Babri Masjid and Gujarat riots.</dd>

<dd>Hi. Just wanted to point out that anti-Hindu elements have been citing human rights watch reports in the 2002 Gujarat Violence article. Human Rights watch is a controvertial org that has been accused of anti-semitism and biased portrayal against USA and Israel in favor of muslim countries (see their article on wikipedia).

<p>To Blnguyen (what a concept: something directed at <i>him</i> on <i>his</i> talk page...&#160;;-)): No problem. I just thought I'd remind you. I always just double check before doing stuff like that, you know... just in case. But hey, anything is better than nothing which is what we get every now and again. Perhaps I'm slightly to blame, as I checked a bunch and didn't comment on the suggestions page... I just <i>didn't</i> take them. Oh well. I'll try and be more helpful in the future.

<p>Just saw your post on the Sean Black RfA. Quite impressive self reflection. Anyone that knows their own faults is worth ten of those that know it all. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I also opposed that RfA which took a lot of time to consider. Sean is obviously a very able admin. But at the end of the day the civility issues are the ones that really hurt wikipedia. There is often misscommunication without incivility, not really surprising given the no body language interface we have to interact through. Incivility sets off chain reactions of mistrust, not to mention huge amounts of wasted time and effort in RfC's. Any admin should know not to be transparent with their thoughts in their admin tasks, even if people are really acting stupid. There is no doubt it takes more skill and thought to be civil ALL the time, but as admins they should, and need, to have the experience and maturity to achieve such a task.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_Archive13_e910.html" title="Edit section: Castes and Tribes of the Punjab">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Castes and Tribes of the Punjab</span></h2>
<p>Dear Sir, I am asking your opinion on this festering dispute that has developed between myself and Satbir Singh since the past few days.</p>
<p>The facts of the matter are like this:</p>
<p>I created a template called Castes and Tribes of the Punjab with a view to studying the caste and tribal groups that exist in what was the ancient Punjab region (Punjab (Pakistan), Punjab (India), Haryana and Himachal Pradesh). My intention, unlike any Ibbetsons, Todds or Cunninghams was to study these groups from a purely anthropological perspective sans any controversy so that people visiting this portal would get to know about the huge mosaic that my province (I am a Punjabi) is.</p>
<p>I started with a few groups. But soon enough the groups began to increase. For the sake of brevity, I grouped them under Categories. As the template evolved, I learnt not to name any category speculatively.</p>
<p>The final categories were:</p>
<p>Brahmin groups. Dalit groups. Jat clans. Khatris and other groups. Rajput clans. Shaikhs and other groups. Tarkhans and other groups. Others (groups to which i could not attribute any specific status). In the last (Others), I also included groups such as Kamboj, Khasa, Ahir and Gujjar. However, Satbir Singh separated them and bunched them under a new category called "Surviving Ancient Kshatriya Tribes".</p>
<p>Since that day, a revert war has been on between the two of us. According to Satbir, these groups such as the Ahirs (the ancient Abhiras), the Gujjars (Gurjaras), the Khas (the Khasas), the Kamboj (Kambojas) and Yadav (Yadavas) are ancient Kshatriya tribes mentioned in a number of ancient Sanskrit texts.</p>
<p>My own personal opinion is that all this is true. However, some points must be noted:</p>
<p>The Varna System is a topic subject to a lot of controversy and dispute. I have been noticing this in recent weeks. Pages such as Khatri, Rajput, Kayastha and Bhumihar have been vandalised because many people don't agree with the Varna status of these groups. If the Ahirs, the Gujjars, the Khasaa, the Kambojas and the Yadavas are Kshatriya groups, then so are the Rajputs, Jats, Khatris, Tarkhans et al. I did not create a category entitled "Kshatriya groups" in the first place because I knew I was treading on soft ground. All the above mentioned castes claim Kshatriya status. But we all know, how disputable these claims are. The rigmarole that is the Varna System is known to us all. For example, the Jats, who in the Vedic and Mythological periods were workers should be placed in the Shudra Category under the Varna System. But many Jats clans consider themselves the equal and perhaps the superior of Rajputs as adhrents of Kshatriya Dharma. My own caste, the Khatris and related groups such as Aroras claim Kshatriya status. But we have seen on the Khatri page as to what became of that claim. Ahirs, Gujjars and Yadavs are considered to be OBCs in most Indian states inspite of their being the descendants of ancient Abhiras, Gurjaras and Yadus. There is a controversy raging on the Yadav page presently if I am not wrong, on the status of the caste. Taking all these points into consideration and being aware of the fact that there are users (say Sanjay Mohan and Holywarrior, who have caused great disputes on various caste pages, I proposed categories such as "Kambojs and related groups" (Kamboj, Kamboja, Kamboh and Khasa) and "Gujjars and realted groups" (Ahirs, Gujjars, Dhangars and Bakarwals). But Satbir Singh and another user named Sze cavalry01 objected to it. They returned to "Ancient Kshatriya Tribes". I did a little compromise by making it "Ancient Warrior Tribes", which I later realised would also be POV. Therefore, I changed it to just "Ancient Tribes" - A completely unspeculative term.</p>
<p>However, Satbir Singh does not agree. He calls it a "gross suppression of known historical facts", "a crime against history" and "a political agenda" and has termed me a "Vandal". I have put forward my points. But both of us are yet to agree.</p>
<p>I have fighting a revert war with him for almost a week now. Have a look at the template's history page and Satbir Singh's talk page to get a complete idea of the whole fracas.</p>
<p>This fight has become downright silly. I surely don't expect myself to spend my time, money and energy on such a silly matter. And I am sure neither does the other party.</p>
<p>Therefore, I urge you to have a look at the whole matter. Whatever is you opinion would be agreeable to me.</p>

<p>Hello there, I'm curious as to why you deleted the Connecticut state seal. It is clearly public domain since it is over 400 years old. It seems a bit hostile to delete an image instead of simply changing the licence. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 14:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Blnguyen, I was really sorry to see your comments on the esperanza talk page (i'm posting here in case you wish to leave quitley, as Redvers did a while back). I know that on the talk page we disagreed, but that doens't mean that I don't have lots of respect for you and think that you're a great, kind, committed user. I for one am sorry to see that you thought it best to leave Esperanza, and I would love to see you back, if or when you feel you would want to come back. And if you do start up a project with the ideas about protection and help you outlined on the talk page, I would be glad to help you with it.</p>
<p>I really do look up to editors like you, those who are so committed and good at making this project better, and I really hope that you know that I don't think you were trying to push POV, as I hope you know I wasn't. We were just both being bold in our edits, and had conflicting views. I am sorry if I was the main cause for you leaving, because Esperanza needs good, caring editors like you, and more importantly, I think you're a good person.</p>

<p>Blnguyen, my friend, I'm so sorry if I've caused you to leave Esperanza! (A fat lot of good I'm doing as AG so far). It was never my intention to alienate you, and I never felt like I was being undermined - nor should it have mattered anyway! You were letting us know your opinion, and should not feel attacked for it, and I'm very sorry that you do, especially if I've caused it in any way. I never meant for my comment to cause you to think that you were undermining Esperanza or weren't wanted here, because that's simply not true. I was attempting to help and diffuse the situation, though it seems I've just made it worse. You have always been a model Esperanzian, going above and beyond the rest of us in recognizing quality editors and brining them some happiness. I am so sorry that you are leaving, and hope that you may reconsider. And if not reconsider, at least except my most humble apologies. Your friend always, -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_459d.html" title="User:Natalya">Nataly</a><a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalya_Esperanza_9860.html" title="User:Natalya/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a> 16:50, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Blnguyen, I just saw that you had left Esperanza.&#160;:( I missed your presence most at the Barnstar Brigade, where you were by far the leading member in terms of contributions to the project. I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry to see you go, and although I cannot convince you to come back, the door is of course always open. Anyway, I hope this note finds you well.
