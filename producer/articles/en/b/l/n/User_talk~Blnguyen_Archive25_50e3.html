<p>I'm surprised you got the meaning so well out of Vgowda's statement. Good job.

<p>Well my response was to Arya about possible duplicate id of Dinesh.I asked him to keep cool as he(gowda) is provoking us(to get us banned by kind-hearted admin).Further I said,I checked the rashtrakuta article for any possible bias against Maharashtra,but didnt find one and I asked him to check it himself.</p>
<p>Btw Mahawiki01 was my id,i had made it to give explaination and prostest against my unfair ban.I never tried to hide it,dear!BTW what did u mean by ur near-threat on Rashtrakuta page.Kannadi is the word for Kannada speakers,check <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> and u shall find <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> wikitag on that page which is 'Kannado.I urge u to get rid of prejudices!</p>
<p>I also request u to check <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">rashtrakuta</a> for any possible push of POV<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 03:33, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Well i came to this page by an accident. Since i'm half-Marathi i know a bit of the language...</p>
<p><i>Bingo!mala suddha vatate ki to gouda dineshchach duplicate id aahe.mi tula faktsangitle ki te loke aadhi aaplyala bhadkavtil nantar aapan kahi bolalo ki tyacha viparyas kartil.tyamule jara sawadh raha.BTW mi rashtrakutachi mahiti milavli,marathi va maharashtrachya babtit kahi kanndi fanaticsni 'shahanpana' kelai ka he throroughly tapasle.parantu atlease maharashtra va marathichya babtit kahi anyay zalyache vatat nahi.tu dekhil te article nit vach va bagh kahi loopholes aahet ka,aslyach tar aapan te carefully verify karu.</i></p>
<p><b>Literal Translation:</b> Bingo! I also think <i>gouda</i> is Dinesh's duplicate id (i.e Sockpuppet). I tell you, people will first inflame us, then when we respond, they will <i>tyacha viparyas kartil</i> (not sure what viparyas means but i think it means "answering back". Therefore beware of them. BTW i've gathered some information on Rashtrakutas. I've throroughly (sic) checked whether some Kannadiga fanatics have tried to slight(dunno how shahanpana translates but slighted will cover the meaning) Marathis and Maharashtra. It seems that there has been no injustice done to Maharashtra. You read the article to check loophole (dunno what they mean by it!). If they (loopholes) are there then we can carefully verify them!</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I am aware that Mahawiki does have a very aggressive mindset,&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>This is what u posted on sarvagnya's page!I wonder when r u planning to block me permanently??U have dcided and passed ur judgement,u r not intrested in hearing my plea,my differences with other users,ur just waiting for a chance to get me off here!!</p>
<p>Why dont u see <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>'s talk page.U will know how sane and kind-hearted this troll is.Just because he writes chaste English doesnt mean he is right and i am aggressive roudy.Plz get rid of prejudices,(again see Belgaum's talk page!).U have powers to block anyone,that doesnt mean u act like a god.U have a responsibilty to perform.I dont have any grudges against u for blocking me,but why spare Dineshkambaddi??How it is justified to block me exclusively.Why r u being so judgemental about me?</p>
<p>To repeat,just see kaveri water dispute,<a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">rajkumar</a>,<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>,<a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara_empire.html" title="Vijayanagara empire">Vijayanagara_empire</a>,<a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a>,<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukya.html" title="Chalukya">chalukyajust</a> see the talk pages and u shall understand there's possible pushing of POV and fabrication of facts.My dear Kannadi friends wisely choose fanatic sources and mould the article in such a way that it endorses Karnataka..Just take a look at those pages.</p>
<p>I dont know what should i say to u when u have my impression as a 'vandaliser'.I can only request u to be impartial,justified and neutral when dealing with controversial topics.With ur attitude,I fear Kannadisation of all articles in near future.

<p>Blnguyen, first of all, thanks for blocking Vgowda. He had been extremely uncivil. And even DineshKannambadi has been very rowdy. In fact, the way Vgowda came into the discussion out of nowhere, and used even more rowdy and uncivil language than Dinesh, it seems to a staged ploy. I am sure Vgowda is a scokpuppet of Dinesh. Anyway, about mahawiki's endorsement of my rants, I feel everyone has an opinion. Isn't it&#160;? Mahawiki just supported what I had commented. And I feel there is nothing wrong in that. And really Mahawiki and myself can comment on anything on our own talkpages. Those comments are not really accountable - First of all, they are off-the-record, secondly, they may be personal. And anyway, he hasn't been calling me to the heated discussions, etc. He has already translated what he said on this page, somewhere above, so no need to repeat.</p>
<p>Another thing is that, my comment on Dinesh's talk page was a result of Dinesh's extremely anti-Marathi rants on the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaon.html" title="Belgaon">Belgaon</a> page. Just check out these samples -</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Its Kannada and it is atleast a thousand years older than your language.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<i>In the 1950's, the movement to make Belgaum a part of Maharashtra was an emotional one with adequate support from the Maharashtra govenrment. However after the stunning defeat at the hands of Mahajan commission, the Maharashtra government is essentially doing to the Marathis what Pakisthan is doing to Kashmiris in that they are being used for their own election / selfish purposes with really no hope of reverting the decision of the Mahajan commission.</i>"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Also, if the Kannada people of Sholapur are not fighting to Join Karnataka, its because Kannada people are basically decent non-militant people who have shown India and world our calibre by starting and starring in India's IT revolution. The world no longer talks of Mumbai as the gateway to India, but it talks of Bangalore (Bangaluru) as its international gateway. Karnataka is too important for India and the Indian govt. is aware of this. India cannot and will not allow shallow, narrow minded sub-regional fascists to ignite a problem that could spread through out India and damage India's image as a progressive nation. <b>Nor do I believe Karnataka is weak enough to suffer a defeat like the "Battle of Panipat"</b>(This refers to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha_Empire_f811.html" title="Maratha Empire">Maratha Empire</a>'s loss at <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panipat.html" title="Panipat">Panipat</a>)."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Lets not forget that through out history, when other empires fell, it was the Kannada empires that stood the test of time to protect Indian Nationalism. The Hoysalas were the last to fall (1343 CE.)to the Khilji invasion while the Yadavas of Devagiri who actually had many cowardly agreements with the invaders were the first to fall (1315 CE.). From the ashes of the Hoysala empire rose the last great Hindu empire, the Vijayanagar empire (note that no historian calls the Maratha empire the last great Hindu empire) to keep invaders out for 250 years when our neighbours to the north were already ruled by the invaders during this period. The Kingdom of Mysore were the last to fall to the British in 1799 CE. under Tippu with the Maratha Peshwas and Nizam of Hyderabad working as agents of the British and actually assisting the British in the Third Mysore War. In return for their service provided, these English agents were given bits and pieces of northern Karnataka which later on became a part of Bombay presidency and Hyderabad presidency. we eventually go back what was ours in 1956. During the British rule, more than anyone else, it was the Kannada people who suffered, being split up into four regions, Bombay presidency, Madras Presidency, Hyderabad and Mysore Kingdom. Yet, by 1875, we had replaced Marathi and Urdu as the medium of education in northern Karnataka with our own language. We did this in a very cultured and educated way. Today we have 7 Jnanpith awards (the highest in India for any language), have won the Ranji trophy 6 times (having entered the cricket arena rather late in 1960's), started India's IT revolution. All this goes to show our resolve.</i>"</li>

<p>The above comments are made by <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">User:Dineshkannambadi</a> who has been, as mahawiki said, Kannadizing every other article. But that's not what got me angry, but the above insulting words against <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. And that's why I ranted on Dinesh's page in the first place. I hope things are clear now. But I still feel, you must check Dinesh's other edits where he has severely Kannadified neutral articles.

<p>Dear Bingyuyen,</p>
<p>If I am being uncivil so if dinesh and his duplicate id vgowda.It is very unfair and partial of u to just block me.See the talk pages of Rashtrakuta keenly and u will see I only responded to the provocations of Dinesh.Not to forget his contributuions are questioned by many editors in <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a>,<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukya.html" title="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara_empire.html" title="Vijayanagara empire">Vijayanagara_empire</a>.So its tagging is only obvious.I was just going to answer about his original research in rashtrakuta where u blocked me unnecessarily.With this id,i wont edit out anything but surely answer Dinesh for his fictional stories of Kanndi superiority.</p>

<dd>I just wrote this on <a href="../../../p/a/m/User%7EPamri_2da3.html" title="User:Pamri">User:Pamri</a>'s page. But looks like he is inactive these days. So just pasting the same on your page. Mahawiki especially has been acting in a very uncouth way for the last 2-3 weeks. He has also blanked out official warnings other editors have placed on his talk page in the past. He has not even put them back even after being asked to do so. He has also slapped me with ridiculous warnings like {defwarn} etc., which you can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=72800354" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sarvagnya&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=72800354" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</dd>

<p>User sarvagnya,after badly failing to push his POV on <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> page is just taking revenge by badmouthing me.I would request all to see <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> talk page where I was constantly giving my sources/citations about why Marathi transliteration was necessary and this user was just ignoring him.At last,when I asked for consensus,he ran away when all of Hindi experts cleared the doubts.I would request him not to take all of it personally!</p>
<p>Before the intervention Aksi_great and Amerique I was being emotional and completely unaware of Wiki policies.Just after their advice,I retained the warnings,I did stop responding the abuses by Sarvagnya.About the word Kannadi,just see <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">kannada</a> page,where Marathi wikitag clearly depicts that Kannada is known as 'Kannadi' in Marathi.Morever these ppl also use terms like Marathis and Marati which I dont take as abuse.Word kannadi is not slang but its the word residents of karnataka are recognised with!</p>
<p>Dont just see <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solapur.html" title="Solapur">Solapur</a>,see Kaveri water dispute,<a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajkumar.html" title="Rajkumar">rajkumar</a>,<a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara_empire.html" title="Vijayanagara empire">vijayanagara_empire</a>,<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukyas.html" title="Chalukyas">chalukyas</a>,<a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> and what all.See their talk pages.Many editors have questioned their claims about 'kannadisation' of those articles.These few Kannadi editors are worst than vandalisers as they wisely choose fanatic sources to market their kannada language and culture.Sarvagnya's vandalism on Belgaum page can be seen here [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098" rel="nofollow">vandalism of sarvagnya</a>] About the Rajkumar article,first see the length of that article!Its seems it is his autobiography than a encyclopedic article.Secondly they have not mentioned the fact that Telugu was his mothertongue.(see the talk page).Also look <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vande_mataram.html" title="Vande mataram">Vande_mataram</a>,<a href="../../../j/a/n/Jana_gana_mana.html" title="Jana gana mana">Jana_gana_mana</a> where these ppl are trying hard to delete Nagari transcriptions!

<p>Blnguyen, <a href="../../../v/g/o/User%7EVgowda_edde.html" title="User:Vgowda">User:Vgowda</a> has been harrasing me for quite some time. However, he crossed the limit this time, when he passed an extremely derogatory and hurtful remark on my religion. He commemted that I am not a Hindu. As a devout practising <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a>, I am deeply hurt.

<p>I request you to block this user as soon as you can. I can tolerate anything but derogatory remarks concerning one's religion does not go well with me.

<p>Dear Sir, U had blocked me for no reason as if I was uncivil so were Dinesh and vgowda.If others are being rude and uncivil what should I do?Why block me alone?</p>
<p>If u want I would back out from Rashtrakuta,as I have confirmed that these ppl have not wrote against Maharashtra/Marathi.But the point to be noted is they have claimed that Rashtrakutas were Kannadis which is not true.See talk pages of <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara_empire.html" title="Vijayanagara empire">Vijayanagara_empire</a>,<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukya.html" title="Chalukya">chalukya</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">rashtrakuta</a> u will find similar allegations made against dinesh by other users.</p>
<p>I would also like to know WHY did u exclusively banned me when other users were equally hostile?How would one behave when other users are provoking and swearing him?I request u to get rid of prejudices u have against me and act in a impartial way.Being a admin is very responsible job.I hope u dont want others to call u dictator!</p>
<p>I repeat,if u want me to stop editing Rashtrakuta I will oblige but make sure u bring truth outta it! Thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 12:13, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Blnguyen. First of all, I apologise for having been uncivil(though not uncouth) in some places in the past. I have stopped it myself for some time now and dont intend to start again. Here, I try to present to you a small sample of the way Mahawiki goes about his edits on Wikipedia. This is by no means an exhaustive compilation of all his misdeeds. I only hope that it will give you an idea of how he operates. Like you asked for, I have tried to give diffs and links to the relevant pages wherever possible. I have spent a lot of time putting this together, so I request you to go through it patiently and in its entirety.</p>

<p>A glaring example of how he operates. Notice that on May 30 he goes an writes something inflammatory on the talk page. He cites no references but just makes tall claims. The next day somebody responds like they did.</p>

</ul>
<p>And yet, a month later, without any further elaboration or discussion on the talk page, nor with any references to cite, he goes ahead and makes this change on the article page.

<p>Here is an example of how he goes ahead and removes referenced information and citations, pushes his <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> and goes ahead and indulges in an edit war badgering editors lef, right and center. And in doing so, he brands <b>all</b> editors opposed to him as 'Kannadis/Kannadigas' and vandals/chauvinists at that.</p>
<ul>

Also note that he has no references of his own to cite nor any to disprove what has been cited</a></li>
<li>And then, predictably it gets reduced to a revert war as u can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akkalkot&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akkalkot&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li>And finally, when other editors tire or just decide to 'let it be', the article ends up like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akkalkot&amp;diff=74074883&amp;oldid=60166191" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akkalkot&amp;diff=74074883&amp;oldid=60166191" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<li>And all this, while he engages in ZERO discussion on the talk page.</li>

<ul>
<li>Here again, he dives straight into the article page with no discussion on the talk page and does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solapur&amp;diff=55926719&amp;oldid=55925947" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solapur&amp;diff=55926719&amp;oldid=55925947" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<li>Impumozhi reverts it and invites him to the talk page as can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solapur&amp;diff=55929472&amp;oldid=55926719" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solapur&amp;diff=55929472&amp;oldid=55926719" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>

Note his arguments. He wants Marathi theaters to be added, but doesnt add it himself; instead he deletes what is already there.

Would he or anyone have problems if they come across a mention somewhere that Mother Teresa was Albanian or that the Prophet was Arabic?</li>
<li>ImpuMozhi tries rewriting it but still gets reverted with no explanation whatsoever.

<li>He takes no further part in any discussions on the talk page, but once again successfully reduces the page to a mini edit war as can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solapur&amp;diff=56802111&amp;oldid=56145962" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solapur&amp;diff=56802111&amp;oldid=56145962" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note the edit inflammatory and misleading edit summaries each time he reverts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you call this a content dispute or merely vandalism? I am under the impression that any 'content dispute' that happens without the concerned party gainfully and politely engaging other editors on the talk page can qualify as 'vandalism', atleast when the erring editor reduces it to an edit war.</li>

<p>Note: Belgaum district page is different from <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> city.</p>
<p>Ok. Here again, he raids the article page a full month before he condescends to appear on the talk page. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=55961409&amp;oldid=55960797" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=55961409&amp;oldid=55960797" rel="nofollow">here</a> is the frivolous edit he makes. Note that it is not so much that Marathi needs to get space as in the case of those Sholapur theaters, but he wants to stamp out any mentions whatsoever to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a>. And whats more, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_District_6784.html" title="Belgaum District">Belgaum District</a> happens to be in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> state where <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> is the official language unlike <a href="../../../s/h/o/Sholapur.html" title="Sholapur">Sholapur</a> or <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkalkot.html" title="Akkalkot">Akkalkot</a> which are in <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> where <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> is the official language. And then an anon editor makes a less than professional(actually looks like a hurried one) edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=55989140&amp;oldid=55961409" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=55989140&amp;oldid=55961409" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that I dont consider this edit as having been done in bad faith, but just a little unprofessional with the construction.</p>
<ul>
<li>And again, with loads of help from mahawiki, it ends up in a revert war. I make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72350358&amp;oldid=72349716" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72350358&amp;oldid=72349716" rel="nofollow">this</a> change.</li>
<li>He reverts immediately but asks for me to cite sources unmindful of the fact that Dineshkannambadi had already provided a reference. See that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72351022&amp;oldid=72350358" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72351022&amp;oldid=72350358" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li>Nevertheless, I add more sources which can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72352272&amp;oldid=72351022" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72352272&amp;oldid=72351022" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li>Then he outright rejects all the references because only <b>one</b> of the references happens to be in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a>! See that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72353256&amp;oldid=72352272" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum_district&amp;diff=72353256&amp;oldid=72352272" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also on both the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_District_6784.html" title="Belgaum District">Belgaum District</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> pages, he goes on to question(nay, summarily dismiss) any reports from <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan_Herald_6dd9.html" title="Deccan Herald">Deccan Herald</a> that were added as references simply because the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan_Herald_6dd9.html" title="Deccan Herald">Deccan Herald</a> happens to be headquartered in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan_Herald_6dd9.html" title="Deccan Herald">Deccan Herald</a> is too reputed a paper of long standing for anyone to wish it away. You dont wish away reports about 9/11 say, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> simply because an editor who is sympathetic to the Al Qaeda questions its veracity.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan_Herald_6dd9.html" title="Deccan Herald">Deccan Herald</a> has been cited on countless other articles and you can check with any Indian admin about its trustworthiness and reliability.</li>
<li><b>And most importantly</b> apart from Deccan Herald and a Kannada website, references were also provided to 'neutral'(if you will) sources like the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hindu_e4f3.html" title="The Hindu">The Hindu</a>, Frontline and others which are based neither in Karnataka nor in Maharashtra but concur with the reports in Deccan Herald word for word.</li>

<ul>
<li>Here again, without a whimper of a discussion he goes ahead and tags the page as disputed and an advert!! See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rashtrakuta&amp;diff=74719211&amp;oldid=74654899" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rashtrakuta&amp;diff=74719211&amp;oldid=74654899" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note that in the edit summary, he says "see talk" while in fact, he is simply bluffing. There is NO explanation from him why he was adding the tags on the talk page at the time he actually tagged it.</li>
<li>Ten minutes later, he gives flimsy reasons for tagging. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=74720307&amp;oldid=74653309" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=74720307&amp;oldid=74653309" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Note the reasons he gives. He says a concerned wikipedian expressed concern about POV on this page to him(mahawiki). Who is this 'concerned wikipedian' and why did he not express his concerns on the talk page of the article itself? Or is mahawiki simply bluffing? Then he goes on to trash the credentials of Dineshkannambadi who has put in almost a whole year creating and editing articles on history while all the while answering every single question raised on the talk page. He doesnt stop at Dinesh, he paints all <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadigas.html" title="Kannadigas">Kannadigas</a>(kannadis in his lingo) as 'vandalists'.</li>
<li>Then funnily, after pronouncing his judgement that the article had been vandalised, he 'requests' other 'experts' to take a look at the article and find cases of any possible vandalism etc!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Note here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>He hasnt given any references or citations to back his claim for having the tags.</li>
<li>Dinesh has answered every question raised by any editor on the talk page.</li>
<li>Mahawiki doesnt take exception to any particular claim in the article, but simply trashes the whole article as being pro kannada.</li>
<li>Finally, this is an article about a <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadiga.html" title="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a> empire and it is impossible to write this article without making frequent mentions of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadiga.html" title="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a>. How would you write an article about the Roman empire without making mentions of Romans? or about alexander or the greek empires without making mentions of Greeks?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, once again he uses his usual tactic of making some inflammatory edit on the article page, frays tempers all around and reduces the articles to a revert war. While all the time making no constructive edit either on the article page nor the talk page.</p>
<p>It would be too much for me to explain every diff, but I have to tell you that if you find any instances of 'less than professional' language from either me or Dinesh or any of the other editors anywhere on all the pages I've mentioned here(and many more), it is because of the tactics mahawiki uses. Yes, I agree that we are not supposed to respond in kind to bad language, but when it gets as frivolous and frequent as in the case of Mahawiki, anybody will lose their temper.</p>

<p>This is too long a story for me to explain here or now. Suffice to say that mahawiki, used his trolling and inflammatory tactics here too.

But Mahawiki seems to be in no mood to let go of his foul temper and foul mouth.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Kannadi(sic)</b>&#160;: In spite of repeated requests by many many editors not to use that term, he keeps using that term to refer to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadigas.html" title="Kannadigas">Kannadigas</a>. So much so he has rubbed it off on you and I saw you use it somewhere too. But then I dont hold it against you since you couldnt have known better. In spite of others taking exception to it, he and his friends continue to use it claiming that it is common usage in North India, which is an argument neither me nor many other editors are prepared to buy. Even if it is a common usage in North India or any part of the world, I find it less than flattering and Wikipedia certainly shouldnt encourage such slangs. I request you to ask him to stop this nonsense IMMEDIATELY.</li>
<li><b>His wanton use of the word 'Vandalism'</b>: If you look at his edit summaries they are full of just one thing 'Kannadi Vandalism'. In his view, any edit that even so much as mentions the words Kannda, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadiga.html" title="Kannadiga">Kannadiga</a> is vandalism!! This is not only frivoulous but it has the potential to mislead admins like you who might not have the time to look at each and every diff.</li>
<li><b>His browbeating tactics</b>: He and his pals like Arya Rajya and Sandipini have made it a routine to leave messages in poor taste on talk pages of other editors. He has even used {defwarn}} on me once, before another admin came it took it off my page and warned him.</li>
<li><b>Blanking out warnings</b>: He has blanked out official warnings that I had placed on his talk page. Once he even simply copied and pasted a warning from his page onto mine simply because I had 'dared' to warn him. And for all these indiscretions he keeps pleading ignorance of the rules. If he was ignorant at the time he blanked out my warning, why is it still not back on his talk page then? For my part, I had even retained the {{defwarn} warning on my talk page till the admin came and removed it. And I still retain his other frivoulous warnings.</li>

He has not raised any concern whatsoever on any of those pages and yet, that doesnt stop him from going to town about supposed 'Kanndi' vandalism on those pages!!</b> or perhaps even tagging them as disputed etc as he did on the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> page. I see this as blatant attempts to mislead people and garner some sympathy votes for himself. I am not so much worried about the sympathy he seeks as the confusion arbitrary claims like this can create. Other editors and admins may make the blunder of taking his claims at face value, go to the talk page, see the foul mouthed vitriol he engenders and be mislead in taking decisions that might eventually cost the article its quality, clarity and NPOV. <b>I request you to take his attempts to mislead very very seriously.</b> And this is not the only instance where he has done this. He does this as a matter of routine(I am tiring now of this long post, so if you want me to give you links to other similar attempts by him, please ask me. I will provide you with the links as soon as I can).</dd>

<p>I feel like a high school kid to have to come running to you everytime Mahawiki opens his mouth. But he leaves me no option. How long do the other editors have to put up with his antics? He just doesnt seem to be in the mood to let the dust settle down. Anyway, here it is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pls note his language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rashtrakuta#My_thoughts_for_developing_this_page_furtherDineshkannambadi_21:34.2C_12_September_2006_.28UTC.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rashtrakuta#My_thoughts_for_developing_this_page_furtherDineshkannambadi_21:34.2C_12_September_2006_.28UTC.29" rel="nofollow">here</a> - If its too long a read, read from the bottom, his comments are at the bottom. Note the honorifics he confers on me(and Dinesh).</li>
<li>I responded with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mahawiki#Mind_your_language_on_Talk:Rashtrakuta" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mahawiki#Mind_your_language_on_Talk:Rashtrakuta" rel="nofollow">this</a> on his page.</li>

<p>I request you to remove the frivlous warning he has given me on my page or atleast permit me to do so. Also please warn him to be civil one last time. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 19:48, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sarvagnya,its enough now.When did I have personal attacks with u today?Are u OK?I didnt even READ ur comments on Rashtrakuta,forget about replies.I replied to Dinesh,not u so when did I have personal attacks on u?Why did u give me warnings?Stop this yarr.Its enough now.Just like ur badmouthing me here,did I issue any warnings?I dont want to talk to u,let alone personal attacks.Stop behaving like a child.I have even stopped editing at Rashtrakuta and busy editing other articles of my concern.This is my last warning to u.U r purposely creating a scene.Let me again tell u stop taking revenge of Belgaon issue.Make that very clear-U dont deserve my attention and bandwidth let alone personal attacks! <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 20:10, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bl, you wrote on my talk page: <i><b>"...I think perhaps if people can put down a simple statement about what parts of the article are misleading or unbalanced I can have a look,...."</b></i></p>
<p>For my part, that is <b>precisely</b> what I told Mahawiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=75466037&amp;oldid=75460192" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=75466037&amp;oldid=75460192" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>I said, <i><b>.... if you cant prove ANY of your claims and if you just want to keep concocting theories out of thin air and use those theories to badger serious editors here, I humbly request you to please refrain from doing so and let us go about editing wikipedia peacefully. You are only wasting everybody's time and spoiling the atmosphere in general.</b></i></p>
<p>And for saying that I got called a 'brat' and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=75550804&amp;oldid=75536675" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=75550804&amp;oldid=75536675" rel="nofollow">these</a> comments from Dinesh got labelled '<b>obnoxious'</b>.</p>
<p>And that is <b>precisely</b> what I am trying to impress upon you here when I say that he is attempting to mislead. He himself cannot put a finger on something in the article that he is against. Ask him yourself what he is against in those articles. All that he has been doing is just crying hoarse that the article is written with a pro kannada bias. There is <b>nothing</b> in the article that Dinesh hasnt taken the pains to answer and clarify on the talk page. If you see that entire history of the page, you will see that there have been just 3-4 other editors who have raised specific issues on the talk page and Dinesh has answered <b>all of them</b> with his sources and references. Mahawiki landed on that page just 3-4 days ago and without <b>any</b> discussion on the talk page, proceeded to tag it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rashtrakuta&amp;diff=74719211&amp;oldid=74654899" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rashtrakuta&amp;diff=74719211&amp;oldid=74654899" rel="nofollow">"totally disputed" and "advert"(!!)</a>. After tagging, he went on the talk page and explained the rationale for his tagging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=74720307&amp;oldid=74653309" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ARashtrakuta&amp;diff=74720307&amp;oldid=74653309" rel="nofollow">thus</a>!!</p>
<p><b>He himself accepts that he knows very little about the subject,</b> but I guess just enough to conclude that it is biased!</p>
<p>Now <i>you</i> tell me who's responsible for the state of affairs on that page. On this page(Rashtrakuta i mean) he has atleast taken the pains to come to the talk page albeit in the most unconstructive manner. On the other pages he keeps crying about, like the <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri_River_Water_Dispute_a09a.html" title="Kaveri River Water Dispute">Kaveri River Water Dispute</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalukyas.html" title="Chalukyas">Chalukyas</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagar_empire.html" title="Vijayanagar empire">Vijayanagar_empire</a> etc., he hasnt even made an appearance on the talk page, but has missed no opportunity to publicise it as biased. His rhetoric needs to be taken with truckloads of salt if not summarily dismissed. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 04:46, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was conversing with Dinesh,so I think no one else have a right to issue me warnings.Even this Sarvagnya talks nonsense about me here,does that mean I issue warnings on him.I think he is hurt deeply by our earlier debates. Anyways,I can understand what u mean.As of now,I dont have any problems with <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> just a possible marketing of Kannadi arts/lit.But its a no-issue since other editors who pointed out this issue are silent as of now.I have stopped responding to that guy in question.Hereafter he would not receive any replies from me.I am least intrested even in talking with him,forget about personal attacks.Blnguyen I would suggest u keep a watch on me.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:04, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And regarding Dinesh's reply,see what reply he gave on sculptures/Marathi inscriptions..They are just playing with words.The Kannadi literature sub-section is given too-much importance when I compared to a encyclopedic entry of the same topic.So this article might be 'unbalanced'.As I said earlier,since I dont know too much of it,i stop editing there unless a learnt editor expresses his views.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:08, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After reading all these rantings of Sarvagnya,I am not feeling angry rather feeling pity on him!My god he has tracked my record as i am a deadly terrorist.I wont deny my wrongs I did before I was adviced by Aksi_great about how things work in Wiki.From than,(see the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> talk page carefully,I am talking in 'citation' lingo.This has perhaps made Sarvagnya very nervous since he has badly failed to prove about a controvesial board of Belgaon Mahanagarpalika.He tried to ignore citations,misguide editors and mediators,he tried each and every thing possible.But finally truth came out and he ran off.Ask aksi_great or Amerique if I have misbehaved after their entry.Aksi_great had requested to stop editing for 2 days and this oversmart guy logged off and did what he thought was needful!He himself calls Sholapur when its Solapur,Marati instead of Marathi,Marathis instead of Maharashtrians and when I without any wrong intension say Kannadi to Kannada ppl he gets mad!I have a Kannadi friend and he himself says 'I speak Kannadi and am a Kannadi'.Look at the Marathi wikitag on Kannada page!I dont why these Kannadis feel ashamed of their identity?Insistance of Kannadig is like insitance of 'Marathi maNase' or Bhartiya instead of Maharashtrians and Indians!</p>
<p>The modus operandi of these Kannadis is that they speak chaste English(so they cant be vandalisers or roudy!),they are well versed in Wiki policies so that they can confuse newbies by their warnings.(note that I have retained my warnings just after Sunder/Aksi_great asked me to do so)See the history,I have not done it recently.They carefully choose the citations/sources which would help him pushing their Kannadi POV and ignore everything else.This is even worse than vandalism.They are taking wiki and its readers for a ride.See Kaveri_dispute article,its all kannadised.Chalukyas,Vijayanagara,Rashtrakutas are all Kannadis according to them.Telugu editors are also opposing their kannadisation(see Vijayanagara empire).They even dont want to add info abt Tamil roots of kannada!Rajkumars article is a comedy(see the length when more great actors like MGR,NTR have a brief summary)Rajkumars article is not an article its an autobiography!They have cleverly opposed tamilnation's source about Rajkumars's mothertongue being telugu but if I oppose DH they hate it.Anyways I wont oppose them as I have got my set of citations ready now. Its hillarious that sarvagnya has taken so much pains to bad-mouth me!He is taking his failure of pushing Kannadi POV at Belgaum too seriously and personally.I mean I dont give so much importance to anyone!Nice to know that Sarvagnya thinks and cares abt me so much.Bura hi sahi hamare bare main likha to! And my advice to Sarvagnya-Stop crying for sympathy.I wont allow anyone to defame Marathi and Maharashtra at any cost.I dont give a damn about Kannadisation if its not on Marathi/Maharashtra related pages!Plz assume good faith and dont take anything personally.I am feeling flattered for ur attention!Thanks!After this post,I am not going to respond to ur literature,U dont deserve my attention and my bandwidth.plz dont think i shall get awe of ur rantings and allow kannadisation.Dont think false display of courtesy,mannerisms and chaste English can allow u to carry out ur pro-Karnataka propoganda.Can we talk in citation lingo plz?Stop personal attacks hereafter.God bless u. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 08:07, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
