I see you'r enew here... well, one of the principle to follow is to make the reader understand things at a first glance when reading an article. I read it and did NOT understant what an OAM can be.

<li>Hello. Yes, I've left the <i>OAM</i> on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Klim_e9b5.html" title="Michael Klim">Klim</a> article but I continue to disagree. When I started my presence here I read that every Wikipedia article must be immediately understandable to all people having absolute zero knowledge about the matter. I know it's typical Anglo-Saxon practice to add such acronyms after the entry's name, and that they (but only they) would hint OAM refers to some title or such. But what about a Lithuanian or an Italian reader would jump on your article? He should need to check the link to understand... Therefore I think the OAM reference should be added later in the article, with explainations. Regards, <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">Attilios</a>.</li>

<p>I've never added one of those, so I'm not too sure - but I'd imagine we went by the captain appointed for the series/tournament, not the individual match. So, for example, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Gilchrist_ed25.html" title="Adam Gilchrist">Gilchrist</a> was captain in the India Tests in 2004-05, cos he was captain for three games, while <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Ponting_9a54.html" title="Ricky Ponting">Ponting</a> only had one, so Gilchrist was captain for a short time. Whereas he was not when he deputised during one WI game in 2000-01, one Ashes game in 2001, and one Sri Lanka game in 2004. At least for the series, that info can be found on <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_cricket_captains.html" title="Australian national cricket captains">Australian national cricket captains</a>. But I'm not sure, and as far as I know, there's no convention for these things. I'm not even sure who added them in the first place. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> 10:44, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello. As the person who added most of the Australian succession boxes, I can answer the question. The principle was (which I believe <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">Jguk</a> established and used for the English captains) was that if deputising, you don't get a succession box. Where a player has deputised as captain he is denoted with a dagger (†) in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_national_cricket_captains.html" title="Australian national cricket captains">Australian national cricket captains</a>. Sam's summation above is spot on. -- <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanbrown_eb80.html" title="User:Ianbrown">Ian</a> ≡ <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanbrown_5157.html" title="User talk:Ianbrown">talk</a> 21:52, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The rule that I followed for India was that if someone was standing in for the real captain, he is not included, but if the previous captain was sacked or he resigned the new guy is included in the list. Thus <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemu_Adhikari_48e6.html" title="Hemu Adhikari">Hemu Adhikariwho</a> became captain for one Test after <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinoo_Mankad_37c7.html" title="Vinoo Mankad">Vinoo Mankad</a> was sacked is included, whereas <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandu_Borde_16c1.html" title="Chandu Borde">Chandu Borde</a> who captained one match in the absence of Pataudi and <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahul_Dravid_1ba6.html" title="Rahul Dravid">Rahul Dravid</a> who stood in for two or three matches due to <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saurav_Ganguly_abe8.html" title="Saurav Ganguly">Saurav Ganguly</a>'s injury are not. (I just noticed that I included <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pankaj_Roy_132f.html" title="Pankaj Roy">Pankaj Roy</a> who shouldn't be). I guess in principle this is the same as that for Aus and Eng. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 03:57, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again. I honestly cannot recall the exact succession paths of those ODI captains you mention, but the most cited reference is easily Cricinfo <a href="http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Records/Australia/Odis/Captains/Playing_Record_Captain_by_Series.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Records/Australia/Odis/Captains/Playing_Record_Captain_by_Series.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (Test captains at <a href="http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Records/Australia/Tests/Captains/Playing_Record_Captain_by_Series.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Records/Australia/Tests/Captains/Playing_Record_Captain_by_Series.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). There should be no need for more than one ODI succession box in a players article: if he had a broken term of captaincy, just list the two terms in the period, like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Ponting_9a54.html" title="Ricky Ponting">Ricky Ponting</a>'s Test captaincy succession box. -- <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanbrown_eb80.html" title="User:Ianbrown">Ian</a> ≡ <a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanbrown_5157.html" title="User talk:Ianbrown">talk</a> 01:40, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This occurred four years ago, so presumably the trial if there was one has happened. Was he acquitted or convicted? Either way, if you are going to add stuff like this, the outcome needs to be noted. If he was acquitted I would probably oppose including it on grounds of irrelevance. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:52, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will delete any attempt to start categorising Australian politicians by religion. This is a matter of hearsay, is not on the public record except in a few cases, and is usually not relevant to their public lives. Also you have not replied to my questions on the Roebuck matter. Unless you do I will again delete the reference to the court case. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:00, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Since we don't know what exactly Roebuck is alleged to have done or what the outcome was, I am going to delete the reference, which is highly unfair to him as it stands.</li>
<li>I am not disputing your good faith, only the wisdom of trying to categorise politicians by religion in a country where this is not generally a political relevant matter. For politicians who make an issue of their religion, like Steve Fielding or Kevin Andrews, this can be discussed in the text.</li>

As for history books, I'm not sure how good your local library collection might be, but the university libraries have some books worth looking at. For articles on suburbs, it might be best to refer to a history book on the council that governs them. I've listed some more general books on Adelaide in the further reading section of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>.

<dd>My answer would be pretty much the same as cj's, but as I'm on holidays, I answer slower&#160;:-) The state library or Mortlock Library might also be a good spot for reference books. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 04:35, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't remember where, but I've seen this issue discussed before, and the result was to stick with regional standards (ie. if the article is about an Australian subject, then the language should reflect that used in Australia). I may be wrong on this, but I'll look into it further. Actually, I'll put it to the Australian Noticeboard, as I'm sure I've seen it come up before. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 05:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Blnguyen. Great to see someone working on these. However, I was wondering whether we should go for an "adjacency template" for station articles (as per other Australian cities), rather than the all-in-one list as used for our suburbs. It may take some development, but have a look at what other editors have done with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Brisbane_railway_stations_e4c7.html" title="List of Brisbane railway stations">Brisbane</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Melbourne_railway_stations_8a19.html" title="List of Melbourne railway stations">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Perth_railway_stations_4b95.html" title="List of Perth railway stations">Perth</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_railway_stations_41e6.html" title="List of Sydney railway stations">Sydney</a> stations, and let me know what you think.

<dd>Hi again. Please make sure that the station articles are only categorised under <a href="../../../r/a/i/Category%7ERailway_stations_in_Adelaide_915d.html" title="Category:Railway stations in Adelaide">Category:Railway stations in Adelaide</a>, which is itself a sub-category of the others you have been adding. With regards to the adjacency boxes, I think I prefer how they have been done for Brisbane and Sydney (ie, uncomplicated). As for Meet-ups, I know at least two Adelaidean editors were speaking of such last year, but I don't think it went anywhere. The reason the meet-ups in Sydney and Melbourne went ahead was most likely because <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> came to town. I know that I won't have any time over the coming three months (moving, traveling etc.).

<p>I noticed you recently nominated a bunch of vanity pages for AfD. I tend to agree with those nominations, but there are couple of things conventions I should point out:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you nomnate an article for AfD, put {{subst:afd}} rather than {{afd}}. Current practice has it that the afd template is always <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubst_9cfb.html" title="Wikipedia:Subst">substituted</a>.</li>
<li>If a page is <i>clear-cut</i> vanity and makes <i>no claim of notability</i>, they can be tagged for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a>.

<p>The links I have listed are the only source I know of to show the group's affiliation with young people in the area.Moving on,I would like to say that the only reason my username is that of the group's is due to the fact that this is the only article I was going to create on this site.To keep everything organized,I decided to use my username and my page as the same identity.Finally to answer your last question,anywhere from 4 to 6 of those members have in fact been tried for various charges,but the only way you can verify that is through their personal criminal records,which I'm sure you'll be happy to do.I was hoping that with the recent increase of gang activity,that other members of wikimedia from my area would help and contribute.In no way does this page serve as a "vanity" for the gang.There are no promotions that can be seen here.The information displayed is what I know,but if you know more,please point me in the right direction.I thought this site was used to share information,not to question it.

<p>I saw that you noted on Piedras Grandes talk page not to put good/bad/small labels on the articles, and that there is an "article validation" feature being developed. Where can I find more information about this? I think it would be interesting because most of the articles I have started (labelled on my user page) have never been edited by anyone else and it would be interesting if anyone (maybe nobody?) who did drop by ticked a box or something to see if the article is good, bad or somewhere in between.

<dd>Yeah, it's a bit of a mystery to me why everything has gone so quiet on that front. Last I heard, they were planning on rolling it out to en.wikipedia.org "in January", but I think I heard that back in December, so who knows. The feature itself is (kind of) discussed <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Article_validation_feature" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Article_validation_feature" rel="nofollow">here</a>; I gather it works something like you've imagined.</dd>
<dd>It's always interesting to me to reflect on how lonely most of the <i>good</i> editing that takes place around here is. My expectation when I was a new was that the pages I touched would be immediately and constantly improved by others. Needless to say, it didn't always happen. (OK, it never happened, not quickly at least.) I guess that's what happens when you have almost a million articles. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:52, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am the contributior who started the Adelaide University Engineering Society wiki entry. This was my first major contribution to the wiki, and I thought that it was a job well done. Anyway, since discovering that it was up for deletion, I am endevouring to bring the page upto a standard that other wikipedians consider acceptable for the wiki.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could provide any assistance in that area.</p>
<p>Cheers,<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenki_dc6c.html" title="User:Shenki">Shenki</a> 05:30, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello Shenki, it is '<b>very well</b> done, and it is unfortunate because it seems very likely that this article will be deleted because the subject is considered to be non-notable. (Most articles are written a lot less neatly (layout), and have many spelling and grammatical errors). There is a policy <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> which says that clubs at universities and schools are not notable -this implies that simply being a club is not-notable, and to show notability, you would have to prove how this sticks out above other clubs, eg,
<ul>
<li>Notoriety: Criminal/Fraudulent/Drunken rampages, etc, activity perpetrated by club members (I hope this is not the case, eg <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_Blackjack_Team_1275.html" title="MIT Blackjack Team">MIT Blackjack Team</a>)</li>
<li>Social Impact: A large number of members, or how the club has had a positive (or negative) impact on a significant portion of its members (eg, educational/professional services) or if it has initiated change within the university. (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Math_Is_Fun_b8ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Math Is Fun">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Math Is Fun</a> for an initial piece of advertising that was later rectified and saved.)</li>
<li>Academic Impact: If the club organizes teams which compete in engineering competitions against other universities (what is the AUES record of success in formula SAE?), and has done so with success (see <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, some of their clubs have wiki-pages; their Maths Club does not seem to have one yet, but given their domination of <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putnam_Competition_8ebf.html" title="Putnam Competition">Putnam Competition</a>, and their concerted efforts to recruit and train maths students in regular meetings, they would most likely be entitled to a page)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can show these things, then it would be worthwhile dropping in to the talk pages of those who have voted delete and requesting them to reconsider their vote. Note that the deletion process is not actually democratic, as the following is an excerpt which is often stuck on AFD pages</p>
<p><i>If you came to this page because a friend asked you to do so, or because you saw a message on an online forum asking you to do so, please note that this is not a vote on whether or not this article is to be deleted. It is not true that everyone who shows up to a deletion discussion gets an automatic vote just for showing up.</i></p>
<p><i>The deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of Wikipedia editors; for this reason comments from users whose histories do not show experience with or contributions to Wikipedia are traditionally given less weight and may be discounted entirely.</i></p>
<p><i>You are not barred from participating in the discussion, no matter how new you may be, and we welcome reasoned opinions and rational discussion based upon our policies and guidelines. However, ballot stuffing is pointless. There is no ballot to stuff. This is not a vote, and decisions are not made purely upon weight of numbers.</i></p>
<p>Getting friends, or <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets</a> to create heaps of accounts will not work, because votes by accounts with little previous activity will be discounted by administrators as branch-stacking. It also tends to raise their ire and may damage borderline cases (eg, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Superrooters_6800.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Superrooters">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Superrooters</a>, which was clearly rubbish; a rather borderline case is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Louisiana_Baptist_University_people_%28second_nomination%29_88db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Louisiana Baptist University people (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Louisiana Baptist University people (second nomination)</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Jason_Gastrich_83a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jason Gastrich">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jason Gastrich</a> for what happened to the offender). A lot of the people voting are from Australia, so if you go to <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">WP:AWNB</a> and interact with them, they will be more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt - their opinions count for more. You could also join <a href="../../../a/d/e/WP%7EADEL_03d8.html" title="WP:ADEL">WP:ADEL</a> to interact with other Adelaide people - it will give you more credibility - I've noticed that a few prominent Australian editors and administrators have written (good, informative and concise) articles about rather obscure (but historically influential) settlers, convicts and Aboriginal warriors which have been saved because of their user credibility and the esteem in which they are held - quite possibly identical articles by newbies could be junked. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">cj</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> are Australian admins and <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">JzG</a> is a UK admin. Most of the others are regulars on AFD, <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">WP:RCP</a> and <a href="../../../w/c/_/WP%7EWC_d64a.html" title="WP:WC">WP:WC</a> which gets them a good reputation also.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is you or not (<a href="http://internal.maths.adelaide.edu.au/people/aflavel/background.html" class="external text" title="http://internal.maths.adelaide.edu.au/people/aflavel/background.html" rel="nofollow">a personal webpage</a>) because there is an inexact similarity there to your userpage, but if that's the case, then we were in the 2003 Integration and Analysis class of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathai_Varghese_fbb3.html" title="Mathai Varghese">Mathai Varghese</a>. Oh, and I went to high school with Craig Browett at <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenunga_International_High_School_423e.html" title="Glenunga International High School">Glenunga International High School</a> who appears to be one of the leading figures in AUES as well.</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>No, im not Ashley Favel - i know someone who could very well be his younger brother, but he and I are quite separate people. After a quick glance across his page, I can see why you considered us to be the same people&#160;:)</p>
<p>The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. For example, a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member - Andy Thomas that is. Several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by AUES members. The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.</p>
<p>ahh, have to run. will continue this later,</p>

<p>A nominator made a very peculiar "joint nomination" of these two persons (perhaps because they are married to each other).

I think that <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddy_Lane_93d1.html" title="Freddy Lane">Freddy Lane</a> is an uncontentious issue, but there may be some ambiguity w.r.t. Donald Mackintosh. The book that I'm using by Australia's Olympics historian admits that they only figured this out themselves in the late 1980s. It also discusses confusion between archery and shooting. I also notice that "live game shooting" isn't listed on the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooting_at_the_1900_Summer_Olympics_c508.html" title="Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics">Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics</a>, but it is noted in Australian publications.

<dd>Hey there. Thanks for the additions! I'm actually going through 1900 sport-by-sport at this point, in alphabetical order, and am currently working on rowing. Thus, I just haven't gotten to swimming/shooting yet&#160;;). I'm primarily using Mallon's work, which credits Mackintosh with medals in two non-Olympic events (both in Shooting - live pigeon type events). <a href="http://olympic.org/uk/athletes/results/search_r_uk.asp" class="external text" title="http://olympic.org/uk/athletes/results/search_r_uk.asp" rel="nofollow">Olympic.org</a> lists only the first nine events on our <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooting_at_the_1900_Summer_Olympics_c508.html" title="Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics">Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics</a> page, suggesting that the live pigeon shooting competitions are not officially Olympic events. Some mention should certainly be made of Mackintosh's performance, but his placings should not be included in medal tables. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonel_1c2e.html" title="User talk:Jonel">Speak</a> 00:41, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi <b>Blnguyen/Archive1</b>,</p>
<p>Thanks for the welcoming. I too am interested in the hard sciences and I noticed you are working as a research assistant in a quantum field. I recently applied to an undergraduate research program at Rice University (taking place this summer), so hopefully it goes well.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday, a long time from now, you and I will discover that the universe is actually contained within a jar of kitten fur and that God is a gum drop. Barring this though, maybe we'll find out if there's anything to String theory or not.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Other things I'm into include zymurgy (home brewing), zen (see <a href="http://www.galvestonZen.org" class="external free" title="http://www.galvestonZen.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.galvestonZen.org</a>) and most Japanese things (I just finished reading "The Book of Five Rings" by Miyamoto Musashi (translated by Thomas Cleary)).</p>

<p>I had not realized that you would not be interested in the history of the Department of Mathematical Physics at the University of Adelaide, its one time pre-eminence in Australia, or the influence of its founders, Bert Green and Angas Hurst, on research in Mathematical Physics in Australia (an influence that still continues today - with a large number of high ranking academics in Mathematical Physics in Australia having passed through the University of Adelaide as students of either Bert or Angas). Sorry for burdening you with this information. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 09:18, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry for taking so long to get back to you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When the University picked Paul Davies, he was already a big name, and they obviously wanted somebody who was well known, and who could attract funding easily, rather than somebody who would actually be committed to making the Department work. I think that some of the other candidates were pasr students of the Department, for example, Mark Gould from the University of Queensland.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was in Adelaide for a 1 week conference, "Confronting the Infinite", in February, 1994. I think that Paul Davies had recently started at the University at that point, and I only saw him at tea (where I got an impression of aloofness on his part), and at the public lecture on "The Arrow of Time".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Paul Davies did "go crazy". His background is certainly in Mathematical Physics, and it seems strange to see him pontificating on such topics as Astrobiology.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Paul Davies went to last December's Conference om "Quantum Field Theory and its ramifications" in Hobart, where he got back to his origins, talking about Einstein's field equations, cosmology, and the possible future for the universe (also giving a less technically oriented public lecture on the topic).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry to hear that Peter Bouwknegt has left the University of Adelaide, and that Mathematical Physics has finished at the University, especially after its auspicious start. I was last in Adelaide in December 2000, for the Lie 2000 Conference, and the doscipline still seemed like it was surviving well at that time. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_5faa.html" title="User:Figaro">Figaro</a> 13:56, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
