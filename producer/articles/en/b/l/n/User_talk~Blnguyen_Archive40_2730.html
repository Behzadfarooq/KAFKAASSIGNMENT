<p>I have to say that there does seem to be rather a concerted attack on the article from the usual direction. It's quite hard work making sure they remain aware that the article hasn't been abandoned to their predatory attacks, hard work which means the article always gets patches, never proper attention. When people treat the findings of the UN and the ICTY as meaningless it's hard to know when the loop is ever going to stop playing. --<a href="../../../o/p/b/User%7EOpbeith_4468.html" title="User:Opbeith">Opbeith</a> 00:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've put comments on the discussion page for example about the section title of Genocide deniers etc which the interveners simply disregard.

<dd>UninvitedCompany and Dmcdevit did CU on them, and it showed that they were connected, and they voted together on a few AfDs.

Please note several things: 1) I could find no evidence that this IP address edited anything that Jefferson Anderson was interested in. Wouldn't it have been better to just blocked Jeff Andersons account directly? 2) This router is part of a pool of routers for IBM North America, serving 110K employees and contractors. Blocks will be ineffective, because there are other routers in the pool. Blocks will result in all users being blocked, even those with valid logins. 3) I don't know what "CU" is, but if its based on IP addresses, it will lead to incorrect deductions of sockpuppetry. With one hundred thousand users coming from this address, most of whom are highly educated, sophisticated adults, there is likely to be a lot of overlap of interests. These are not just IT pros and engineers; you can walk the hallways and see people with interests in everything from art and poetry to ancient history and philosophy. Just because a few of them voted the same way on AfD's does not indicate sockpuppetry. 4) Vandalism and bad conduct are against the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines. Misbehaviour of employees (provided their identities can be found out) can and should be reported. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 15:52, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't. I blocked JA. The block also automatically targets his IP, which in this case was yours, although JA was logged in at the time, so there is no record of this in the IP. Afterwards, I had to undo the autoblock of the that IP, so that you could edit. The autoblock is automatic and does not reveal which IP it is. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Blnguyen. I have recently been the subject of three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/165#Proposing_community_ban_for_User:FasterPussycatWooHoo" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/165#Proposing_community_ban_for_User:FasterPussycatWooHoo" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive178#Proposed_community_ban_for_User:FasterPussycatWooHoo_on_Talk:Tokusatsu" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive178#Proposed_community_ban_for_User:FasterPussycatWooHoo_on_Talk:Tokusatsu" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive180#User:FasterPussycatWooHoo_again" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive180#User:FasterPussycatWooHoo_again" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> noticeboard incident reports in quick succession. There is more on my discussion page, and indeed, on the discussion page for the relevant article. The incident reports contain numerous distortions, I have not been informed of any in a timely fashion, have been told that I've been blocked when I haven't, etc. Since I'm sure this will be watched, I won't go into more detail right now, but have been taking notes. <b>I concede that I have been incivil</b> on a couple of occasions and made other mistakes, but don't feel that there has been any real balance (one editor and one admin have provided a little on the noticeboard pages, but everyone else involved has been very partisan).</p>
<p>I was going to use the "helpme" template on my discussion page, but realize that doing so would probably lead to a quick discussion on IRC etc.</p>
<p>Would you please have a look or recommend someone else who might?</p>
<p>Once again, I am aware that I have been at fault a couple of times, but have read the relevant policies and am also aware that this also applies to several other longer-standing users, who would have had better reason to know better.

<p>The article's topic is worthy of GA, there's been a lot of hype about these encounters in recent years so lots of sources are out there.

<dd>Hi there. It would be quite easy to get that to GA, although we would have to spend a bit of time removing the hyperbole of the people who wrote it a long time ago. I can't see any free images around the place, unless any Wikipedians have their own images they took a long time ago by actually going to the games. Having said that, you don't need pics at all for GA, and if an FA was wanted, then fair use would do in the absence of anything else. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 06:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I doubt the likelihood of finding any action pictures of the players in the BG series would be rare. However, the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbhajan_Singh_dba0.html" title="Harbhajan Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> article has a free pic of him in training gear. Many of the Australian bios also have pics as well, so we could put portraits of some of the players into the sections on series where they had a prominent role, with Harbhajan in 2001, Ponting in 2003-04 consecutive double centuries, and Martyn in 2004.

<p>Hi Blnguyen,</p>
<p>I am writing to ask that you reconsider your 'delete &amp; protect' on the entry for Sarah Hanson-Young (Senate candidate for Greens SA) on 23 Oct 2006. She seems no less worthy (in fact, she is probably more worthy) of entry in Wikipedia than the many other candidates in Australian elections (see e.g. those listed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_South_Australian_legislative_election,_2006" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_South_Australian_legislative_election,_2006" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_South_Australian_legislative_election,_2006</a>). Unlike many of these people, Sarah has been a prominent community activist for many years. I knew of her when she was involved in pro-refugee causes and, when I heard she had been preselected for the Greens, I went to Wikipedia to find out more. I was dismayed to discover that, as a consequence of your actions, she did not have a page. I understand that Wikipedia has a policy against 'speculative' entries but I put it to you that her prior activities, and the fact of her candidature, are more than enough to warrant an entry.</p>
<p>I also note that the 'deleted and protected' entry for Sarah is now the top-ranking entry for her name on Google. This suggests to me that there is interest in reading a Wikipedia entry about her, that is currently being prevented by your actions.</p>
<p>Could I ask that you lift your 'delete and protect' on her page? I am currently living overseas and have no personal interest in this matter, except that I rely on Wikipedia as an information source.</p>

<dd>It was deleted because of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sarah_Hanson-Young_2010.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarah Hanson-Young">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarah Hanson-Young</a>. The only reason I deleted it again, was because it was reposted. If you want to reverse the decision, please see <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. The reason that the people on the page you cite have articles, is because they are elected. SH-Y is a failed candidate, and has been agreed by other users that she is not at the moment entitled to an article. I am fully aware of her activities, especially outside Baxter Detention Centre, and the asylum seekers running away as well, as I attended the same university and was also canvassed by her for a vote a few years ago. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If you see the discussion unfolding on the <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara_Empire_059b.html" title="Vijayanagara Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a> discussion page (not the FA discussion), this becomes clear. This may pull out other worms from the woodwork with grouses generally against Karnataka people and articles. His IP address is 59.95.... Is there anything you can do.Thanks<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 23:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see that he is blocked, but there have been no edits to the talk page since he has been blocked. The person who runs FAC, Raul654, is an arbitrator and checkuser, so he knows when sockpuppets are gatecrashing, and he will ignore them. Don't worry. I've got a close eye on the article though. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blnguyen, Could you help to stop the repeated edit wars on all falun gong pages? Pro-Falun gong editors (<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EAsdfg12345_de8a.html" title="User:Asdfg12345">Asdfg12345</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMcconn_bf39.html" title="User:Mcconn">Mcconn</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyInGeneral_ac56.html" title="User:HappyInGeneral">user:HappyInGeneral</a>, <a href="../../../f/n/h/User%7EFnhddzs_3193.html" title="User:Fnhddzs">Fnhddzs</a>) have censored all these pages and have repeatedly removed legitimate and sourced material that they do not approve. Just now they again removed two important sections, “Depravity of today’s people” and “Sickness Karma” on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong" rel="nofollow">Teachings of Falun Gong</a> page. Also, “Interviews with Mr. Li Hongzhi” and “Li's claims of divinity” sections on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi" rel="nofollow">Li Hongzhi</a> page. Since material in these sections are from Li’s own mouth and sourced to US major media, there is no justification for their removal. Edit wars have been provoked by the aggressive and outrageous edits of Pro-falun gong editors. I am tired of reverting them again and I hope you can use your power to stop them from removing these material. Thanks --Mr.He 20:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. In the FAC discussion page, a new reviewer, <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirceus_e372.html" title="User:Circeus">user:Circeus</a> has severely criticised my style of citations (which is in the same format as earlier FA's), called the citation style "patently wrong" and has opposed nomination. He went ahead and chopped most citations into a different format then I am used to providing. He seems to be the only one with a problem.

<dd>There is a report on the block on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, which was done after a checkuser was performed by <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>, who is also an arbitrator, at my request. The checkuser said that it was "determined with a high degree of certainty" that A Ramachandran is the same as Ekajati. Manually going through their contributions, I can see that their editing is completely interleaved, with no edits at the same time. Many times one will log off and within an hour, sometimes even half an hour, the other will log on, and start editing. The fact that it is synchronised in this, with changeovers of less than an hour, yet, no intersections whatsoever, is quite dubious. Both these users have voted on AfDs with the same ideology -&gt; AfD vote stacking. I did not initially suspect A Ramachandran to be Ekajati, but rather Hanuman Das. As I noted on ANI, A.R. was created immediately on the day that H.D. "retired" when he was put into arbitration. I noticed A.R. editing <a href="../../../l/u/_/Lu_Sheng-yen_2ac1.html" title="Lu Sheng-yen">Lu Sheng-yen</a>, which was only edited by five regular editors (excluding vandalism, vandal reverts, formatting, etc) in 15 months: Hanuman Das, Ekajati, 999, Nat_Krause and myself. I looked at the article contributions of both HD and AR, and noticed that they had also frequented the same general topics, with many common articles in their ten most edited articles. Another which stood out in particular was AR was one of only about seven people who edited <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Roach_b1f7.html" title="Michael Roach">Michael Roach</a> in the last year, (mostly the same people as in the LSY article, but not myself). Thus I asked Dmcdevit to check if HD had reincarnated as AR to avoid possible arbitration sanctions. The Checkuser found that AR = Ekajati, and was unrelated to Nat Krause, 999, myself etc. However, since HD's checkuser data had expired, that left HD unaccounted for. So what is the chance that a new user registers immediately after the retirement of one of only five people who edited a given article in 15 months, and begins editing on that same article? not only that, but edit another article in the same predicament, and the general topics as well, with the same viewpoint on content and AfDs&#160;? What is the chance that a new user knows how to merge and redirect on their first edit, with an edit summary which is also wikilinked, and then creates an AfD on their 11th edit, and knows what "rvv" stands for and wiki-process in 30 edits? To further confirm this, I checked HD's edits against Ekajati. They are well known to be editing-allies, AfD allies, etc over a long period. Again, all the edits were interleaved, and even though there were often changeovers of less than half an hour, there is no overlap. Thus, it seems pretty obvious to me what is going on. HD had been blocked multiple times and has evaded it using Ekajati, as well as that, team revert-warring, AfD vote stacking, mobbing other users, etc.... I have blocked Ekajati et al, as there is no need for them to function at this time while Ekajati is under block. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 01:02, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

On November 1st, Hanuman Das startes editing at 15:43 and ends at 15:54, while Ekajati edits Tantra at 15:51 and posts on Hanuman Das' talk page at 15:52. I'm sure more examples could be found. <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 13:48, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I checked further back through all the data as I should have checked more than the last month, and found instances of four single edits wedged in the middle of two other edits, but the pause in the other account was about 5 minutes. Four instances out of 2000. But many instances of close changeovers, which were clean. I did an experiment with <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen1_b439.html" title="User:Blnguyen1">User:Blnguyen1</a> and found myself wedging edits into one-minute gaps, so a five minute sandwich isn't that remarkable.

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I wrote the section about Ralf Schumacher's private life. I admit I was perhaps a bit over-the-top in my first edit, but I think (as a long-time F1 fan) the subject is relevant to Ralf's image in the sport. I have provided a reference from British media by way of substantiation, the originals being in German and also subject to legal censure.</p>
<p>I didn't post the section to defame Ralf or cause controversy, hence my re-edit.</p>
<p>Thanks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Forzaminardi (<a href="../../../f/o/r/User_talk%7EForzaminardi_32d1.html" title="User talk:Forzaminardi">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Forzaminardi_fb45.html" title="Special:Contributions/Forzaminardi">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Generally, I was a bit skeptical about the veracity of this rumour, and although there is now a source, I'm not so sure that it is relevant, given that only the notorious <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a> appears to have carried this. If a mainstream F1 media outlet didn't talk about this, then I am inclined to say that it is not relevant and appears to be a fringe issue, unlike, eg, the Raikkonen frolics, which were reported on itv-f1, F1 magazine etc. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, fair enough. It would seem to me that the allegations in question are fairly well known among F1 fans and indeed a brief search has shown considerable message-board and forum discussion in English, Italian and German in connection with this specific story and also the state of their marriage and Cora's plastic surgery. Not that this neseccarily suggests anything, nor that are they reliable sources, but it implies that the issue was discussed and relevant to Ralf's performances at that point. The difference with Raikonnen's shennanigans is that Raikonnen did not challenge the publishers in court (for the obvious reason that he had no case) so they were not subject to legal sanction and therefore the pictures and stories are still freely available for citation. Given that Ralf and Cora have been succesful in prosecuting publishers who have invaded their privacy, the original articles in question are not available - hence why I have cited the News of the World story which effectively is a "story about the story" if you follow and is freely available. It should be noted also that while the News of the World is not noted for it's impartiality, it is a major provider of sports news. Equally, Byron Young (the author) is no Shakespeare, but he is a prolific F1 reporter with a considerable track record.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Forzaminardi (<a href="../../../f/o/r/User_talk%7EForzaminardi_32d1.html" title="User talk:Forzaminardi">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Forzaminardi_fb45.html" title="Special:Contributions/Forzaminardi">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Hi. I noticed you protected the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devadasi.html" title="Devadasi">devadasi</a> article awhile back. The edit conflict there was due to one editor, <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">User:Rumpelstiltskin223</a>, objecting to information from reliable sources. I believe this is a case of a lone POV editor, if you consider his posts on my talk page and elsewhere, where he reveals a very strong and extreme POV regarding devadasi as well as Western sources. He claimed that my sources were about "killing Hindus" and other nonsense. He also clashed with <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemongoat_df28.html" title="User:Lemongoat">User:Lemongoat</a> earlier over the issue. Even Indian sources do not appease him. Currently, he blocked for abuses elsewhere.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I would like <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devadasi.html" title="Devadasi">devadasi</a> to be unprotected, as <a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemongoat_df28.html" title="User:Lemongoat">User:Lemongoat</a> and I have decided to work on this together. I will first reinstate my version, and he will tweak my sources and coverage of them to fit mainstream Indian sensibilities. I hope that this can work out and produce a version that gives due weight without distorting the issue or offending mainstream Indians. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 06:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't mean Haizum's complaint about the blurb, else I would have simply rephrased it. It was because the article is tagged {{<a href="../../../t/o/t/Template%7ETotallyDisputed_5b5d.html" title="Template:TotallyDisputed">TotallyDisputed</a>}}. Usually DYK or ITN items with "red alert" tags like "cleanup" "no sources" "pov" and "factually innacurate" etc, are not allowed on the main page. That was my reasoning, the actual article.

<p>Dear ArbComm Member of Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University;</p>
<p>This note is to bring to your attention two issues which are creating upheaval in the article located here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>and placed on probation under the premise of "Any user may request review by members of the Arbitration Committee."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Completed_requests" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Completed_requests" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. This request is based on enforcement or remedies stated in the arbitration process and failure to follow up on it.</p>
<p>1) An article-banned user <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Proposed_decision#195.82.106.244_banned" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Proposed_decision#195.82.106.244_banned" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> orchestrated a come back through proxy IPs from Japan and then through an account "Some people" which has been blocked twice. The problem with this is that this user had modified the entire article in less than 12 hours on January 28 2007. This user partner, TalkAbout; acted in synchrony with 244 on that night and made some changes as well using "Some people" new version. User Andries had a minor edit of that version as well.</p>
<p><b>Request to investigate user Some people</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AE#User:195.82.106.244" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AE#User:195.82.106.244" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> <b>Analysis of situation</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University#Disruptive_Edits" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University#Disruptive_Edits" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <b>Suspicion of sockpuppet account</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Some_people" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Some_people" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <b>Blocks to user Some people</b> for "a reincarnation of the editor who formerly posted from the IP address 195.82.106.244"( As admin Thatcher put it) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Some_people" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Some_people" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>2) The only admin we've dealing with is Thatcher131. I would like to bring to your attention what I consider to be "lack of neutrality" and fairness from his/her part. <b>Even though, user "Some people" was blocked by Thatcher131 under a strong suspicion of him being user 244 (banned by the ArbComm for a year) Thatcher131 supported the new version of the page which are the versions of a banned user.</b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> A request for enforcement of arbitration has been submitted long time ago before user 195.82.106.244 (aka 244) made several changes through his sockpuppet account "Some people" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement#User:195.82.106.244" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Arbitration_enforcement#User:195.82.106.244" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> but the request is still sitting there.</p>
<p>User "Some people" transformed the article with over 30 + entries on 22:41 28 Jan 2007 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;offset=20070129000058&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahma_Kumaris_World_Spiritual_University&amp;offset=20070129000058&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and then User TalkAbout added some content and at that point, that was considered the new "good version" of the article.</p>
<p>I would like to request the following: 1) the article to be reverted to a state before "Some people" took over. 2) To change the "admin in charge", Thatcher131 to someone who is not emotionally involved in this issue (Thatcher131 was the clerk in the arbitration case and helped user 195.82.106.244 to file the case and presented some evidence against me but not against 244<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_riveros11" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Brahma_Kumaris/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_riveros11" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>)and that could enforce normal wikipedia procedures are taking place.
