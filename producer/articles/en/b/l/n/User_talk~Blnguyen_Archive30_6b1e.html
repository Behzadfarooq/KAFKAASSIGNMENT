<dd>Well, the article says that there are 25 lakh Konkani speakers in Karnataka and 11 lakh in Goa. Your comments seem to use a Karnataka &lt;-&gt; Kannada correlation - how do you know that the people in Karnataka are using the Kannada script for their Konkani language? As you can see, Belgaum is in Karnataka but about half speak Marathi. Can you clarify this please (What if the people live near the border and use non-Kannada script for their Konkani?) How much is one lakh anyway? And just a random comment - 40 books doesn't sound much to me....Aren't there 60 million people in Karnataka? <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 03:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Blnguyen, Please have a look at <a href="http://bhashaindia.com/Patrons/LanguageTech/Konkani.aspx" class="external text" title="http://bhashaindia.com/Patrons/LanguageTech/Konkani.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/may162005/state1930592005515.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/may162005/state1930592005515.asp" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which talk about Kannada script being used by Konakani users and authors in Karnataka. Hope this helps in clarifying the matter. - <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENaveenbm_8d5d.html" title="User:Naveenbm">Naveenbm</a> 16:07, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, Karnataka has 60 million people and 40 books is not much. But not all 60 million speak Konkani. 25 lakhs translates to 2.5 million. And all these people are bilingual(in Konkani and Kannada) and infact, some of the most popular writers(<a href="../../../g/i/r/Girish_Karnad_1285.html" title="Girish Karnad">Girish Karnad</a>, actors(<a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananth_Nag_b6f8.html" title="Ananth Nag">Ananth Nag</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shankar_Nag_07ed.html" title="Shankar Nag">Shankar Nag</a>) etc., in Kannada have Konkani as their mother tongue. Karnataka has similar linguistic minority populations that are domicile in Karnataka for centuries. These include <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulu.html" title="Tulu">Tulu</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodava.html" title="Kodava">Kodava</a> also apart from Konkani. All these languages use Kannada script as they either dont have their own scripts or because they once had scripts which are extinct now as they have fallen into disuse for the last many centuries.</li>
<li>It is in this light that <i>Sahitya Academies</i> have been set up by the Karnataka Govt., to revive and encourage literature in these languages also. Such academies exist for minority languages only in Karnataka. Though MH also has minority populations of Konkanis, there is no Konkani Sahitya academy there. Though <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> has minority populations of both Konkanis and Tuluvas(of course in <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kasargod.html" title="Kasargod">Kasargod</a> district which according to the Mahajan report should like Belgaum be with Karnataka but unlike Belgaum, unfortunately is with the neighbouring state) there are no academies for the same in Kerala.</li>
<li>I hope you see why the Kannada script is needed in that article. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:20, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes I agree now.

Which gives 17 million in Karnataka (of 25m), more than 11m for Goa. So it appears to be a <b>yes</b>.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 01:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for adding the Kannada script back. And just a quick comment about your link above. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hindu_e4f3.html" title="The Hindu">The Hindu</a> is not a <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> newspaper. It is an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> newspaper, much like its website. Nor is it a newspaper with pro-<a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> leanings in spite of its name. Infact, it is often accused of having communist leanings. They're headquartered in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennai.html" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>, Tamil Nadu and its reach, however is limited to the state of Tamil Nadu and select cities in Southern India. They might have some editions north of Southern India too, but they arent as popular as they are in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_d7a5.html" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>. Even in the South, there are places where they have wide circulation, but I wouldnt call it a 'popular' newspaper. That said, it is still one of the oldest, largest and most notable newspapers in India and I am personally a fan of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hindu_e4f3.html" title="The Hindu">The Hindu</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 05:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dear admin,I request u to have a look at <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">belgaum</a> article where few editors are doing 'original' research and putting Belgaum border dispute article below when the issue is alive and kicking and very significant chapter in belgaum's history and present scenerio. Gnanapiti is also truing to remove cited info when it has been submitted to many editors including u.</dd>
<dd>As about Konkani page,it will be nice if we have ask the opinion of a respectable Konkani editor/admin here. Kannada script is <b>NOT</b> the official script of Konkani language. Nagari, malyalam,roman scripts are also used but most important is Nagari script.Thanks</dd>

<dd>It does seem OK to put it immediately after the History section. Look at <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> for instance. Although the article is about the city itself and not governance, so the political details should be in the separate dispute article. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 03:08, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just to give you some perspective about this whole affair. The amount of heat and dust it has raised on Wikipedia shouldnt fool you. The Israel problem/dispute and this Belgaum 'so called' dispute cannot be even spoken of in the same breath. Israel dispute has ramifications for the entire region and infact around the world. This Belgaum dispute on the other hand, hogs the headlines(that too not national headlines) once every few years... when extreme Marathi leaders in <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> and their quislings in the Belgaum mayor's office lose power. That is what has happened now in the last few years with a certain <a href="../../../b/a/l/Bal_Thackeray_698c.html" title="Bal Thackeray">Bal Thackeray</a> and his <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiv_Sena_b52b.html" title="Shiv Sena">Shiv Sena</a> out of power in <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. To add to it, their quislings in Belgaum, the MES had their wings clipped and unceremoniously thrown out of office about a year ago. And no wonder, they're raising all the ruckus, heat and dust. <i>This so called dispute, unlike the one in Israel doesnt affect the lives of its inhabitants in the least. Life goes on as normal in Belgaum and the dispute is the last thing on people's minds.</i> Other than people of Ktaka and MH(that too not all), this dispute is largely unknown even in the rest of India. A person from Punjab for example wouldnt even know that this dispute even exists. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 08:08, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi admin, Perhaps its necessary to include Kannada script for Konkani.But as u see,Konkani is the official language of Goa,it uses Roman/Devnagari script.Malyalam script is also used to write Konkani so please add them.</dd>

<p>Sarvagnya's comments about Belgaum issue as usual not to be taken seriously.

<p>Dear admin, Sarvagnya is back with its rude language and misuse op popups. He is not discussing anything on talk page and just mindlessly reverting <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_border_dispute.html" title="Belgaum border dispute">Belgaum_border_dispute</a>.

Utcursh had himself checked the article 2 days back.

I was just trying to tone down 1-2 sentences when Sarvagnya without any discussion (apart from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belgaum_border_dispute#Yuvamelava" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belgaum_border_dispute#Yuvamelava" rel="nofollow">filthy comments</a> about Shivaji Maharaj which was answered back in similar manner) jumped and is been reverting the article.

I had requested the same in the edit summary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKannada_language&amp;diff=84368037&amp;oldid=84366122" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKannada_language&amp;diff=84368037&amp;oldid=84366122" rel="nofollow">my latest edit</a> in that talk page. But still the reverting goes on, and I thought its important to bring this into your attention. Also, please note that, the users wanting those talk-information have no contributions in the article or not involved in any userful discussion related to the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada_language.html" title="Kannada language">Kannada language</a>.

<p>Sir, Someone had tagged this article that has been developed from credible sources over several months as POV etc. I have reverted the tags. The user claims the Hoysalas were only a kingdom and not an empire, though many scholars call them an empire. The user does not even have a user page set up to communicate with and says he will change the name to Hoysala kingdom without so much as a discussion<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 14:52, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sir, just because I informed others of blatant tagging does not mean we are a gang. Just people with some common interests. Anyone following my work will see I go around my business doing articles of my interest with reliable sources at hand. So now I understand where the tagging of Hoysala page is coming from.

I believe that few users are taking advantage of the wikipolicies to get me banned. Incidently the checkuser has not been filed by me! Also as u might know sarvagnya is constantly posting indecent and filthy comments about Shivaji Maharaj and other issues which are dear to me just to provoke me.He is alwaysposting inflammatory stuff against Hindi and sometimes against tamil.BTW calling me shameless and Dinesh accusing me of sockpuppetry is also a personal attack!

<dd>I wonder how voting will work when there are many suspected sockpuppets.</dd>
<dd>I went the official way,i didnt took any chances, i submitted the file to u and blnguyen.I am being urging the admins to take a watch on Belgaon/belgaon border dispute.</dd>
<dd>All my demands fall on deaf ears be it u or utcursch.i am not accusing u but by now it clear that there's some kind of prejudice against me lingering in ur minds.But when sarvagnya asked for help,u were quite quick to respond.</dd>

<dd>Tarun Bharat is notable.I have presented then an authentic copy after the mindless speculation which sarvagnya had with me. Please mind ur words because <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samyukta_Maharashtra_aa4d.html" title="Samyukta Maharashtra">Samyukta Maharashtra</a> is not a <i>fringe</i> party. It literally means 'United Maharashtra'. It was formed on May 1,1960 but still few Marathi majority areas are not merged with Maharashtra.</dd>
<dd>If u mean Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti,(<i>Maharashtra unification committee</i>),which is fighting for merger of Belgaum and adjoining areas with Maharashtra. Which is again anything but a 'fringe' party.</dd>
<dd>And thank god u had a look at that page and the nonsense which u have mentioned is added by <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> troops and this is what I am trying to tell ya from day one.</dd>
<dd>Lastly thanks for confessing the prejudice u have about me.So now it is clear that no help can be expected from u. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 05:02, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is the same file I sent to u. Kannada editors doubted and insisted for the verifiabilty of the source.

<p>Sir, this is the message left behind by this person.</p>
<p>Hi, Ur citations of A conscise history of karnataka by Surkanth kamath,as u know, is contested by many. I request u to present a neutral and credible source within 24 hours.Reasons behind this request is-</p>
<p>1)Your source seems to be fanatical, uncredible, hoax, advertisement of ur culture/language. 2)You have not presented any online/soft copy of ur source and hence it is not verifiable. Failing to do so,I will be forced to remove ur citations. Mahawiki 19:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I regard this as a threat. My scholarly sources are many (I have them listed on my user page, and it is growing by the week). Every citation of mine comes from the books I own. I am in the process of adding page numbers to the citations in all articles i am invloved in , just in case someone is interested in reading it. We have been thru this with another admin also. Mahawiki keeps calling my sources names and this degradation has to stop. I am not invloved in any of his perpetual squabbles either. Please consider blocking him permanently.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 22:01, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would simply ignore this threat, as people can see Dinesh's contributions in the historic/archaeology field. You have created many articles of good detail and information without incident, and it appears that only Mahawiki has expressed concern that you are either inventing sources or making false info which are not the sources. I would ignore it. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 04:43, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Naah!admin.Sorry Mr.Dinesh's so-called contributions in history field is unfortunately based on a fanatic and biased source of a writer named Surykanth Kamath. I am sorry admin, u cant give him clean chit because his so called-scholarly sources are challenged by many. I am least concerned about his glorification of Kannada empires,but <a href="../../../s/e/u/Seuna.html" title="Seuna">Seuna</a> should be spared as it is predominantly Maratha empire. While I am waiting for a source which no one can ignore or trash, u take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Utcursch/archive7#Dinesh.27s_a_pseudo-historian" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Utcursch/archive7#Dinesh.27s_a_pseudo-historian" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and ONLY after that let ur comments flow.</dd>

<p>Hi Blnguyen, how are you&#160;? Comin to the point, I am quite dissapointed by the way you have handled the Belgaum issue. I know Mahawiki has sometimes violated some rules, but remember that he was provoked to do so. You gave a warning on Mahawiki's page but you didn't warn any of the Kannada editors. If you don't know, all four(?) of them, Sarvagnya, KNM, Naveenbm and Gnanapiti had questioned the verifiability of the reference Mahawiki had provided. But had anyone else questioned it&#160;? Still, Mahawiki e-mailed the file to everyone, then he uploaded it. Tell me wasn't all this done in good faith. Then these guys "trashed" his citation. What were you doing then&#160;? You should've warned them. Mahawiki had to provide an online link to the article, which he has now provided. I think these same rules should apply to them as well. I question the verifiablity of Suryanath Kamat. Even if Suryanath Kamat may be a good writer (which I know he is not), but is what Kannambadi filling pages with, the same thing from the book. Kannambadi may be filling something else. And references from a single book could be <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. What about that&#160;? And another thing, the way you replied on Kannambadi's page reeked of bias and partisan attitude. Really, I was never so dissapointed on Wikipedia. You know, when Mahawiki used yo get dissapointed, I would always tell him to keep faith in Wikipedia's admins. And I always believed the admins would never be prejudiced. But I've been extremely dissapointed. I had high hopes from you that you'll give justice. <span class="plainlinks" style="border: 2px solid #0001DC; padding: 1px;"><b><a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_6561.html" title="User:Arya Rajya Maharashtra"><font color="green">Arya</font></a></b></span><a href="../../../a/r/y/User_talk%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_43c8.html" title="User talk:Arya Rajya Maharashtra"><b><font style="verdana" color="BROWN">Raj</font><font color="Magenta">ya</font></b></a><b><a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra"><font color="#FF5900">महाराष्ट्र</font></a></b> 05:05, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blnguyen u know what, when the verdict about Belgaum issue will be out, then only u will know how right or wrong I am. And yeah its verdict not really depends on what blnguyen thinks about (fringy?) border issue or what wikipedia's article talks about it.Regardless what the verdict will be Karnataka is inherently at bay when a chunk of its population is in no mood to live with them.</dd>
<dd>The way u ignored my pleas and gave a verdict about suryakanth kamat is unfortunate. While I am intrested only in cleanup the Kamath dirt from Marathi history articles, if it remains here it is only wikipedia who's gonna lose.Let ur friends go the Kamath ways which says each and every great think in this universe is Kannadi!</dd>
<dd>And yeah,by now I have lost all HOPES of justice.So no warnings please. Block me indefinately and I know this is good for everyone. go ahead and ask Mr.Sarvagnya and his 'friends' to fill the article with kannada pov.I dont give a damn. i would rather want to develop <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> wikipedia rather than induldge in petty wikipedia politics here.</dd>

<p>Here are some quotes from Dinesh's talk page.Note that I have not wrote any of them and they were long before I stepped in wikipedia.The first two points are worth considering when Dinesh sings about Kamath every now and then.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Dont make rediculous statements about his mother tongue being Telugu. I know you have been reading some stupid website called "Tamil Nation" where you got this piece of rubbish from. User: Dinesh Kannambadi)</p>
<p>Note that Mr Dinesh is enraged and calls a website tamilnation.com as <b>stupid</b> and <b>rubbish</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dineshkannambadi#Chalukya_Chola_wars" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dineshkannambadi#Chalukya_Chola_wars" rel="nofollow">Here's Dinesh comments to a user Venu</a>- 'dont try to just glorify Cholas by refering to history written by just one historian (Nilakhanta Sastry). There are many more historians who have written about these conflicts and i suggest you do more reading on this matter. Some historians especially of Tamil origin tend to be very Tamil centric and try to glorify every achievement of Tamils in history and downplay those by others. These edits will go on untill we find a balance somewhere. I also intend to start editing Chola pages to reflect correct history, not the one presented by Tamil Historians.'</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the same Dinesh who sings praises of Mr Kamath and calls me illiterate and uneducated for its criticism, calls tamilnation.com as <b>stupid</b>.While Dinesh uses Kamath's book as reference widely he objects Nilakanatha Shastri only being used.He calls him <b>tamil centric</b> and <b>tamil glorifiing</b>.Now see who's talking!</p>
<ul>
<li>You said that Mr. Kamat is a pabma vibhushan awardee but I dont find his name Category:Padma Vibhushan awardees?</li>
<li>here are many historians other than Jotsna Kamat, Krishna Kamat and Mr. ArthikajePlease have mercy on them and Jotsna Kamat, Krishna Kamat and Mr. Arthikaje will not feel bad or go on a hunger strike if you stop quoting them and quote some one else for a change.</li>

<ul>
<li>Dinesh If you go on vandalising the pages to include your POV with no (authentic) references except for the ourkarnataka website</li>
<li>One more point: I'm not in WP to glorify anyone in particuar. My attempts are purely write articles on history sources from academic materials. The Internet is full of pages which have an one-eyed nationalistic view on these matters and that is why I never depend on them. I don't have an agenda to push, but I will counter your agenda.</li>

<p>You have made useful contributions, but don't waste your energy in trying to see bias where non exists. (user Parthi)</p>

<li>Precisely, you were trying to trumpet Kannada achievements at the cost of that article which had a totally different angle. Your modifications made the article completely absurd. Your narrow minded hatred against Tamils has only succeeded in vandalizing the article..</li>

<p>Dinesh says <b>. He has discarded months worth of studies by me from various sources including Dr. S.U.

<ul>
<li>He has been selectively inserting material to show that Vijayanagar empire solely becomes the heritage of Kannadigas. One glaring example is the omission of Telugu literature</li>
<li>u behave like a half baked historian, u want to prove telugu's r inferior to kannadigas by putting forward all the non sense stuff</li>
<li>dont take that if a person is from a part of state which is now in karnatake as kannadiga</li>
<li>I only question your enthusiasm to brand Vijayanagar empire as Karnataka/Kannada empire.</li>
<li>Whether anonymous or otherwise, what matters is open-minded, non-parochial and logical approach, which Mr Kannambadi is totally devoid of. That makes one suspect him even if he says something correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>(anonymous)</p>
<p>The above summary shows Mr Dinesh rubbishes the books/writers/ websites which go against his propaganda.He doesnt make bones to include ONLY those odd historians who are biased and write what he likes to read.He is busy telling everybody Marathi/Telugu words evolved from Kannada,all South/SouthWest dynasties/kingdoms were essentially of Kannada origin.Such things are even bad than vandalism.His talks and articles will immideately make u know he is here just to push his Kannada POV.I request rectification of articles.</p>
