<dd>Um, it is prohibited for an administrator to unilaterally and indefinitely ban/block such users when the user is not a pure vandalism/trolling account. If the account tries to participate seriously to article contribution, as is the case with everyone here, then they can only be blocked unilaterally for making threats against other users, such as death threats/legal threats etc. If you would like to get a ban on Netaji or Bakasuprman, or you would like to get rid of me, then you can got to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> an lodge a request for comment, or go directly to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFARB_0da3.html" title="WP:RFARB">WP:RFARB</a> and seek a ruling from the arbitration committee, or if you think it is serious enough, go to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">Admin noticeboard</a> and get a consensus for "exhausting community patience".

<p>For you to block me, after I have restrained and responded a week after Neta's provocation, is not balanced, specially when you did not block the person who is causing the whole issue. Again i have waited for some time to respond so as to not be angry in the response, but it still does not take away from the fact that your attempt to look into details have been extremely one sided. Neta is rude , obnoxious and has on n occaisions made personal remarks about n individuals. If I have done anything it has been in "response" to and the language/ remarks have been as a result of his continued hostility. For you to overlook all his transgressions ( I had posted windups before also, to which you did not even bother to reply) and to block someone who is responding shows a bias as well as a not so balanced side. Your personal issues with me over the religion category may have coloured your opinion but it has shown me that you are not a fair and objective admin <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 13:29, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Netaji was blocked for three days as opposed to your 2 days in that incident and I remind you again that even if the "other party" starts the battle, this does not give you the right to return fire in ways that could inflame the situation (Your counter-declaration of hostility at <a href="../../../h/i/n/Talk%7EHindutva_9f13.html" title="Talk:Hindutva">Talk:Hindutva</a> as well as on his page). Blocks are meant to restrain users from confrontation, and seeing as you were not able to restrain yourself from replying to his comments, I had to stop you from posting also because it would only inflame the situation. As I said before, if someone makes a ridiculous comment, just report it and let the words discredit themselves rather than stooping to their level. Action has and will be taken against editors who engage in inappropriate speech. Netaji has been blocked for a total of 14 days? 12 of them by me for his personal conduct towards other users, so I cannot see where I have blocked you for reporting him but not blocking him (the offender). As for the thing about the Sikh cricketers, I let the Sikh cats stay and didn't bother disagreeing with you, and let me say that in the last week I have cleaned up and expanded biographies on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Panesar_a7ac.html" title="Monty Panesar">Monty Panesar</a> and <a href="../../../y/u/v/Yuvraj_Singh_49c7.html" title="Yuvraj Singh">Yuvraj Singh</a> (who many people believe to be Sikh) and have nominated the Yuvraj page for <a href="../../../d/y/k/WP%7EDYK_3118.html" title="WP:DYK">Didi you know</a> on the main page and am now on my way to improving the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbhajan_Singh_dba0.html" title="Harbhajan Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> page.

<dd>I agree with this person's comments.How blatantly these two editors Subhash and Baka - say they are not liberals and secular and carry on edits to support organisations that India's first prime minister called "Indian Version of Fascism".Their edits are either to promote an alternate version of history based on the superiority of Hinduism and ancient Hindu India's dominance or wesel words to hide the activities of the organisations they support banned on many occasions in India.They have even written racial Anti Whites comments.They call other users with slurs and call other users as terrorist supporters.It is high time their activities on Wikipedia are stopped.They are using the facilities of WP to promote and advertise their organisations.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a></dd>

<dd>Well, with regards to personal behaviour, Baka has been blocked for about three days, Netaji about 12, you none and Haphar 2. If you feel that Netaji and Baka's edits are riddled with incurably disruptive and tendentious POV-pushing, then you will have to go to <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDCAB_20f1.html" title="WP:MEDCAB">WP:MEDCAB</a> for request article mediation, then go to formal mediation if required...If you think there is no hope you can go and seek <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFARB_0da3.html" title="WP:RFARB">WP:RFARB</a> to seek a sanction as the ArbCom is the only group who can. If you feel that "exhausting the community's patience" applies then go the <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and propose a ban (you need a strong consensus 75+ whereas arbcom only needs 50+). Aside from blocking people for poor personal behaviour I have not interfered in the article disputes except for locking the page, so I am not responsible and have not made myself responsible for article disputes. If you believe my blocks for personal behaviour have been unfair, you can pursue the same avenues that I suggested to Haphar above. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 04:24, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neta has been going around abusing people, calling them names and even wishing them to get killed. That is not the same as reverting. And for almost all of these above mentioned issues he was NOT blocked, those issues were 3RR as well as sockpuppetry. Most of his trasgressions have been unpunished. Even now after he expressed a wish to get me killed by islamic terrorists, you had just put a comment saying do not call Haphar a paki and not done anything, so I reverted to him AND brought the more damaging than the paki lines to your attention. And then I get blocked for reverting to HIS reverts&#160;? I did not break the 3RR rule, I am reverting to someone who is calling me names and is reverting to most things that I am putting in. How come Neta has not been blocked for similiar things&#160;? I "respond" to someone who calls me names, and I am in the same category as the name caller&#160;? And the name calling has been going on for months, AND was brought to your notice earlier ( with no reaction) wheras without anyone bringing things to your notice you saw it fit to warn me.</dd>
<dd>I have NEVER said in my above post that you are anti Sikh. So all your "rantings" ( since you call it a rant line yourself) about the "service" you have done to Sikh cricketers is not required. You had an issue with a stance I took on religious categories and that seems to have an impact on your neutrality.</dd>
<dd>I have referred cases like Neta's not only to you but the "suggested" pages and found no response, so your own case being referred would meet the same fate, It is not worth the effort. Live on with your biases it will cause you greater problems than getting it resolved.</dd>

<dd>I would like to see how the admin would react if someone wrote in print that the person would look forward to getting him killed, and how the admin would react when the same person has earlier made comments about the admins family being killed/maimed and raped by terrorists. And how the admin would feel that despite all this hostility the user has not been blocked for such incivility but for minor issues like 3RR. And all this from a sockpuppeteer who has lied to protect himself before. There is where the "tolerance level" being higher for an abusive uncivil editor of the admin baffles one.

<dd>As is 'Ho. 'Ho here has consistently exhibited anti-Hindu tendencies and Hindu holocaust denial. Now, he, together with Haphar, are trying to attack Blnguyen with allegations of bias in favor of lil' ol' me? Blnguyen blocked me for 10 days once. If anything, <i>I</i> should be yelling and screaming at <i>him</i> for bias <i>against</i> me. However, while (IMHO) he has been rather harsh with his punishments, he has listened to reason and argued his points logically, instead of going off into childish temper tantrums unlike certain other users involved in this debacle.

<dd>Yeah Blnguyen is the fairest admin I know, for sure. He blocked me for three days also. Since you refer to Hindu leader as fascists, why are you helping out a documented Israel-hater on the Babri, Guju violence, and Ram Janmabhoomi articles? Israel haters are real fascists. Most admins like the one that blocked me for no reason, are mad with power and are extremely trigger happy with blocks. Infact, TerryJho, Holywarrior etc. are lucky admins like Gizza aren't trigger happy.

I noticed an accusation of sock puppetry by Anwar, and found a "statement" used by Neta also used by his puppet in a talk page discussion with me, and commented on the similiarity of the comment. Which caused Neta to get on the offensive with me ( and we all remember who got what treatment so let's not comment on spankings here)- And Mr Neutral Secular Admin who has reverted in the above discussion&#160;? And who is trying wind ups about "spankings"&#160;? And who is not getting a warning on wind ups &#160;? And who is making false accusations of vandalism and cabals&#160;? ( you can check talk pages of all to see who has a cabal and who does not). Also making sure people know of an issue that is being ignored despite it being reported is not trying to form a cabal, and from the people getting onto the "discussion" with Neta it's pretty clear whose behind is getting some attention. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 13:03, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there...I agree that there are many offending parties in that debate. Actually, as you probably saw, I had to warn Haphar for incivility in the middle of my report on Subhash. I just felt like, overall, Subhash was the worst offender in all of this. Haphar and the others have had problems with being civil but they've shown some inkling to at least follow our policies some of the time. I see none of that from Subhash, as shown by all of his blocks. So that is why I blocked him. Plus, he essentially declared that he was going to no longer AGF. Basically ever. And I just don't see a way around that. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 04:06, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably easier to stick to using blocks where necessary. I don't think that if we asked these guys to go to arbitration they would do anything for pure misbehaviour not particularly related to a stuck content dispute and would rather we calm them down first. It's also normal that each time Subhash gets blocked all the others come and trash-talk on his page...pretty normal, which is one of the reasons why we never get anywhere.<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 08:58, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I had reported comments to you from Neta earlier too<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=65094003&amp;oldid=65084532" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blnguyen&amp;diff=65094003&amp;oldid=65084532" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. And got no reponse. Then I had posted these comments 2 days later on islamic fundamentalism page. Including the details of the user who posted them. Today the user deleted them, so I put the comment back. And you have removed them again so I would like to ask you a question. Here is some of what Neta had said on my talk page "There is only one kind of Islam. The kind that blows things up" and " I'm not upset about fundamentalism in Islam because there is no fundamentalism in Islam. Islam ITSELF is 'fundamentalist', in the sense of Intolerance, Slaughter, Looting, Arson, Molestation of women, ie I-S-L-A-M."</p>

<dd>If you look at my history, and my userpage, I don't edit on weekends.

<dd>I stated it verbatim as it is not my report. Furthermore, my comments to Hari Singh were not to condone personal attacks and civility, but it is an unfortunate fact that administrators are generally not held to account because in the past when this has happened it has often resulted in admins engaging in retaliatory block wars. Apart from 3RR which is cut and dry. Please do not twist my words as you have done on Woohookitty's page to indicate that I condone personal attacks and civility.

<dd>I do not think anyone would question you as an admin for raising a checkuser report on your own. If it is not your report Neta can raise it when active again. If you think his request has merit you can raise it yourself without going in for "verbatim". You could have also asked him to reword it as it carries accusations not related to the complaint. In my opinion on an issue where all parties are asked to excercise restrain, to forward a complaint by Neta that makes unrelated accusations against me, (a party to the restrained from responding group) is not expected from an admin. Specially in light of you not taking action on issues reported to you about Neta's behaviour by me in the past. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 13:31, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. Are you the same BLnguyen with whom I chatted on irc a few hours ago? If you're not, then plz ignore this message. I'm still very new to wikipedia and am only getting the hang of this editing stuff.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was reading the article on "Hinduism" (titled Hinduism) and noticed an anonymous user (like I was until now) putting edits that are very biased, pejorative and point-of-view-y. So I "reverted" them (I mean I went to the history page and clicked on the earlier version and saved it instead). Is this ok? I don't want to get into trouble or get anybody else into trouble so am asking you, since you seem like a nice guy (from what I read abt you in this talk page thing). I clicked on his contribs page and noticed a lot of other anti-Hindu edits that he has been making on Nazism articles, saying that Hindus are racist and like Nazis and such. I fixed those too and am watching this contribs page. I will paste it below:</p>

<p>I read help pages on wikipedia and saw that I have to warn him with a template so I put subst:test3 in his talk page and warned him. Is this also ok? Thanks. <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 10:23, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I am, and he is now blocked for 1 month as everybody thinks it is the banned Anirudh77. In the case of extreme POV-commentary and OR, a user can be blocked, especially here he made the absurd claim that because the Nazis used the swastika etc, the Hinduism is responsible for it (presumably that applies to Buddhism also).<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 01:42, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. I remember you from our chat session and was hoping for some advice reagrding a problem that many of us are having with this user. I have made some well-sourced verifiable edits to the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kancha_Ilaiah_e7d5.html" title="Kancha Ilaiah">Kancha Ilaiah</a> article and discussed with several users in the talk page ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kancha_Ilaiah" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kancha_Ilaiah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kancha_Ilaiah</a> ), who agree with me. Holywarrior, on the other hand, keeps deleting them, and has even violated 3RR to that effect in the past. He keeps giving bogus defwarns and threatens to report me and get me blocked. Please see his edit summaries:</dd>

<p>He has also threatened to report me for 3RR violation (in another user's talk page) even though I have not made more than 3 reverts in 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABen_W_Bell&amp;diff=72835608&amp;oldid=72595138" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABen_W_Bell&amp;diff=72835608&amp;oldid=72595138" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABen_W_Bell&amp;diff=72835608&amp;oldid=72595138</a></p>
<p>I have defended my case in the above post.</p>
<p>I have noticed this unfortunate trend of users getting other users blocked just by putting complaints without proper investigation even though complaints made against them may be unjustified. I'd like your advice on how I should deal with this matter.

<dd>I'm afraid that the dispute is far from over, and HW has refuted nothing. If you look at the talk page <a href="../../../k/a/n/Talk%7EKancha_Ilaiah_710b.html#Moving_forward" title="Talk:Kancha Ilaiah">Talk:Kancha Ilaiah#Moving forward</a>, the mediator and I agree on the issue, but HW continues to intransigently dispute the consensus.I request you to keep the page protected until disputes are resolved.
