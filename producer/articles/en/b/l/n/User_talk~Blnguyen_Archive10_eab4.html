<p>Hello Blnguyen. I just wanted to come here and thank you for everything before I retire from wikipedia. I have decided not to stay for various reasons, mostly from the past. I have seen what this place has done to people, and I have decided to not let it happen to me. I don't know if I will come back, but regardless I wanted to thank you. You were always nice to me, and for that I am forever greatful. Thank you my friend for everything. <b><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetruthbelow_03f2.html" title="User:Thetruthbelow"><font style="color:#cc1100">Matt B.</font></a></i></b><b><i><font style="color:black">"aka"</font></i></b> <b><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThetruthbelow_886a.html" title="User talk:Thetruthbelow"><font style="background:#cc1100" color="white">Thetruthbelow</font></a></i></b> 04:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to draw your attention, as an administrator and prominent member of WikiProject Eurovision, to the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carola_H%C3%A4ggkvist_f830.html" title="Carola HÃ¤ggkvist">Carola HÃ¤ggkvist</a> article. As you might know, Carola is to some extent controversial due to her past involvement in religious movements, as well as certain declarations and actions in the media. Especially the gay activists in Sweden and to some extent rest of Europe reacted very strongly to reports by Swedish gay magazine QX, as well as other, mostly tabloid media, of her alleged anti-gay remarks (or at least remarks not viewed as favorable by the gay activist community). Carola's winning Melodifestivalen in 2006 spurned another massive campaign against her during which some activists tried to argue she is strongly homophobic.</p>
<p>Recently, an anonymous editor using IPs beginning with 80.135. repetedly edited the "<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carola_H%C3%A4ggkvist_f830.html#Views_on_homosexuality" title="Carola HÃ¤ggkvist">Views on homosexuality</a>" section of the article, including a paragraph which I would describe as rather POV and trying to argue a point rather than inform the readers. This editor also deleted some other content contributed by other editors, including the link to the source of one of media reports in question. I believe this is not proper behavior and find the past versions more NPOV - I would, of course, appreciate your opinion on that, as I cannot be objective anymore as I had contributed to the article. I would be most obliged if you could devote some time to looking into the issue and give your opinion on that, as well as state what could be done about that.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance - Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 10:46, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your support for my recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_theProject_761f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/theProject">RfA</a>, which I'm quite happy to announce has passed with a consensus of 67 supporting, 0 opposed and 0 neutral. I'm glad I meet your criteria. Most of all, I'm glad you took the time to evaluate my candidacy, as I believe that's what keeps RfA running smoothly, and I'll be working hard to justify the vote of confidence you've placed in me. Please let me know at my <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheProject_8a2c.html" title="User talk:TheProject">talk page</a> if you have any comments on my performance as an admin.

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>I dropped notes round a while back to those who have listed themselves at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Formula_One_4955.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Formula One">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Formula_One</a> to ask for suggestions for selected articles on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Portal%7EFormula_One_d870.html" title="Portal:Formula One">portal:Formula One</a>. There was a pretty good response, both in terms of how it might work and of articles suggested. <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Hill_de37.html" title="Damon Hill">Damon Hill</a> came out with the most support and was brought up to <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a> standard after a lot of work by <a href="../../../s/k/u/User%7ESkully_Collins_923e.html" title="User:Skully Collins">Skully Collins</a> before going on as the F1 portal selected article a couple of weeks ago. It is now at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">Featured Article Candidates</a> as a Featured Article candidate (why not drop by and see if you can help polish it further?).</p>
<p>Several people who responded to the original request suggested that a monthly or bi-weekly 'Selected Article' could act as a catalyst for an improvement drive to get more articles up to a higher standard. Although it wasn't quite what I had in mind when I started, this seemed to work pretty well for the Damon Hill article, so I've drafted up a process for doing this more regularly. See <a href="../../../f/o/r/Portal_talk%7EFormula_One_Management_of_selected_articles_36a5.html" title="Portal talk:Formula One/Management of selected articles">Portal_talk:Formula_One/Management_of_selected_articles</a> for details. Essentially the suggestion is that we vote for an article to improve every couple of weeks and at the end of the improvement process the article goes on the portal as the new 'Selected Article'. I'd be grateful for any comments on how this might work - I'm sure some of you are more familiar with things 'Wiki' than me - as well as your votes for the next candidate (by 16 July).</p>
<p>You may also want to help with the article <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilles_Villeneuve_0aff.html" title="Gilles Villeneuve">Gilles Villeneuve</a>, which was the next most popular after Damon Hill. The idea is to try and get it up to GA standard by 16 July and then put it on the portal as the 'Selected Article'. I hope you can help! <a href="../../../4/u/1/User%7E4u1e.html" title="User:4u1e">4u1e</a> 15:05, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding. I think it's noteworthy, but not noteworthy enough to bring up in the first paragraph. Granted, I don't know how he's perceived in France, but if it's documented that he faces discrimination because of his religion or he's outspoken about it, then I might feel differently, but I certainly wouldn't put it in the first sentence. Most people think of him as being of Algerian descent, not Kabyle Muslim, and either way, I think it belongs in the "Personal" section. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 04:47, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been having issues with <a href="../../../n/o/k/User%7ENokilli_6e70.html" title="User:Nokilli">User:Nokilli</a>'s deletion of warnings from his talk page.

<p>Hi. I am John Davies's son. His wiki entry is very thorough, but I'd like to correct a few nits. The image was supplied to me by him. I will check its authorship but as it is over 50 years old and (I believe) was taken by an amateur photographer, it may not be able to be attributable. This is my first attempt at a Wiki entry and the mark-up language has me a little confused. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ji62300 (<a href="../../../j/i/6/User_talk%7EJi62300_dd4d.html" title="User talk:Ji62300">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ji62300_a1af.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ji62300">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Ah, that's good. If it was over 50 years old and taken in Australia, I think that would mean that any copyright would have expired.

<p>You deleted the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Everything_Linux" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Everything_Linux" rel="nofollow">Everything_Linux</a> with the deletion reason: "unsourced image csd i4". The article has no images, and in any case, you don't delete articles because they have unsourced images in them. I assume you meant PROD, as it was tagged for PROD deletion. Unfortunetly, the PROD was also invalid, as the article had already been kept in AfD. Someone's already fixed the problem, I just wanted to remind you to be more careful in deletion. I totally understand the desire to go fast, due to the massive workload, but it's not necessary or wise.

<p>Hi, it is practically obvious that this is the same as User:Moderator3000 who was blocked for having a bad username, intending to mislead people into thinking that they are a Moderator, and if that wasn't enough they frequently engaged in personal attack and vandalism on the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khatri.html" title="Khatri">Khatri</a> page. Which is full of it actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKhatri&amp;diff=62162137&amp;oldid=62162072" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKhatri&amp;diff=62162137&amp;oldid=62162072" rel="nofollow">see this</a>...even though I've never suggested I'm a Khatri or an Admin...stuff like that still pops up. Anyway, basically I'm requesting Moderator1000 to be blocked...and they can come back with a better user name (apart from User:Systemadmin who was also blocked I think because they seemed to be the same person as the Moderators). <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 07:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Not sure why we can not correct/edit the misinformation being pumped out by Wikipedia. It seems very one sided that we can not list the sources where we are officially listed as a legitimate institution?</p>
<p>Also, Warnborough University is now Warnborough College (Ireland), a name change to meet requirements by the Irish Department of Education and to meet accreditation requirements.</p>
<p>The message coming accross on Wikipedia is negative aimed to present Warnborough as a Diploma Mill, which is not the case.</p>
<p>Please can you advise on this matter.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>You said I have to claim importance. In order to help me properly re-create the Shadowclan page, could you be more specific and direct me to the General Criteria # for speedy deletion that I violated? Specifically I was trying to create a page similar to ones that already exist here on Wikipedia, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_End" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_End" rel="nofollow">Winters End</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Assassins%27_Guild" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Assassins%27_Guild" rel="nofollow">MIT Assassins</a>.

<p>Blnguyen,</p>
<p>Is it possible for me to retrieve the original page, add some information in order to help it meet the criteria necessary to keep it from being deleted? Also, if that is not possible, is there any objection at my attempting to recreate the article in a way that meets Wikipedia standards?</p>

<p>Please be advised that Ferick has advised me of the 3RR, and since I am relatively new to Wikipedia, I didn't know such a thing existed. Please don't block me, because I honestly didn't know about the rules, and from what I've now read, I need to be told that I'm about to break the rules before I do it for the first time (which is what Ferick didn't do, but rather waited for me to break them, because I didn't know they existed). I have stopped editing the Kosovo article, but you might want to take action against Ferick who is constantly addid a version of the article that has clearly been rejected on the talk page.

<dd>Yes I have. When you informed me of the 3RR, I read the rules and indeed I have broken them.

There is an ongoing vote in the talk page about this issue, but he doesn't seem to care about.

<dd>You have removed the Serbian Topics template, and as you have stated in the Kosovo talk page, you do not deny that Kosovo is not independent, and the article surely proves that Kosovo is a part of Serbia, and the template deserves to be there. I do follow the rules, it is you who is pushing his <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">POV</a>, and not respecting the discussion pages (or accept something on one page, but push the same POV on another page, like this one).

<p>Hello bunyip, I have 'stumbled' across another Adelaide University related sports article. I also stumbled across a whole page of rowing clubs. Most of these are amateur and if you applied your 'standards' of noteworthy they should be deleted. I make this reference as it is my understanding you were involved with the deletion of Melbourne University related sports articles (possibly even one about the MU Boat Club?). If all of these sporting clubs are not notable what about the listed rowing clubs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rowing_clubs" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rowing_clubs" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rowing_clubs</a> . I am trying to make a point here as I still believe the manner in which you played a part in the deletion of a page I was involved in was wrong. You put your own personal bias into this and drew in others to validate your views. <a href="../../../o/z/d/User%7EOzdaren_c4de.html" title="User:Ozdaren">Ozdaren</a> 11:23, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
