<p>Hello good friend! There's really no point in vandalizing Wikipedia.… Countless users have tools and programs that spot vandalism, and we have almost a constant lineup of users who volunteer to monitor harmful edits, as well as automated bots that can locate vandalism and change it back almost instantly. Vandalism just like yours has been done countless times in the past, and we know how to deal with it. Yes, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia anyone can edit, and sure, it might be tempting to totally fuck an article up, but that's not what we're here to do. If you'd like to edit Wikipedia in a constructive manner that doesn't make you look like a complete idiot, feel free to do so, otherwise, it's best to just leave it alone. That saves you the time of making pointless changes, and saves me the time of reverting those changes just as fast, if not faster, than you make them. Thank you for listening and I hope you enjoy using, and maybe editing, Wikipedia. ⇒ JarlaxleArtemis 00:36, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Moderator, please undelete this page. This page has been in existence for two years. In April this year, one Moderator engaged in some racist attacks against other Asian wikipedians and abused his privilege by deleting this page. This is really unfair because there one-quarter of the world are Asians and although not every Asian speaks English, this page deserved not to be vandalized. Besides Kai Wong is rumored to appear on Rush Hour 3 starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.

<p>Sorry about that. See, I find it a hassle to edit whole articles, and seeing as the RfA page is made up of smaller, less large sections, I usually type in (by hand, manually, without any references to aid me) "Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/(name here)" so when I saw his RfA that's what I did, except I didn't notice and forgot to place the two there.

Recapitulating my message to Crz, lest you should have to wade through the mess that once more illustrates that I can't express any thought, irrespective of size or import, in fewer than 200 words, I didn't mean to suggest that I was leaving the project (my diametrically opposed words to the contrary notwithstanding) and wrote cursorily and incompletely only in order that you (or others) shouldn't take time to craft a conomination; I'd intended straightaway to write Crz and you to explain but was stuck at <a href="../../../t/e/n/Portal%7ETennis_e05f.html" title="Portal:Tennis">Portal:Tennis</a>. In any case, I'm going to be returning to my full seven-hour exercise program (take that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Holland_8057.html" title="Stephen Holland">Stephen Holland</a>; I used the wayback machine for that one...)soon, having recovered fully from an abdominal injury, and so I'll not have as much time to edit here for the next few weeks, and the bulk of my edits will surely be to mainspace and portalspace, such that I'd be unlikely to do much with the tools, which is, for most RfA participants, a great turnoff. I meant, then, not to express a disinterest in adminship generally but, rather, a disinterest at the moment, and will edit my RfA comments accordingly. When I can be sure that I'll have more time to contribute here consistently and to aid the project with the admin tools, I'll likely seek adminship, and I hope that, having understood that my denial wasn't some melodramatic <i>I'm leaving the project</i> declaration but, instead, a <i>nip this in the bud and then explain later and individually</i> placeholder, you'll be once more inclined to support me.

<p>Hi, and thanks for your Barnstar (I must find somewhere to hang them proud one day). I'm still fiddling with the template and hopefully advancing it to be able to cope with the Australian hierarchy as a whole, or part of it at least in the short term, with support for WikiProjects. I'm just grabbing a sample of most article types for now to see what type of coverage is required by the project, and where coverage is lacking. By breaking Australia down in this sense, we can see which areas of Australian coverage are badly lacking in quality and detail. Feel free to list any articles you'd like to see assessed quickly at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australia_Assessment_f786.html#Requesting_an_assessment" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia/Assessment">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Australia/Assessment#Requesting_an_assessment</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 06:52, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm sorry you had to listen to the foolish thoughts of a silly girl while you were stressed and having a tough time, my beloved B. Your words have relieved me, but your absence is saddening; and not only because of our friendship, but because it's Wikipedia's loss as a whole to have you away, even for a short while. I'll be waiting for you to return whenever you feel the time is right; please, relax, you've worked so incredibly hard in the last times, that you desperately need a soothing rest.

<p>A definition of notable:</p>
<p>notable:Worthy of note or notice; remarkable: notable beauty; Characterized by excellence or distinction; eminent: formed a commission of notable citizens. See Synonyms at noted.</p>
<p>A person of distinction or great reputation. often Notable One of a council of prominent persons in pre-Revolutionary France called into assembly to deliberate at times of emergency.</p>
<p>Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Skaf - convicted gang-rapists, are not defined in the above.</p>
<p>I am not arguing if you are biased or not, I am merely stating fact.</p>
<p>The real issue is that all criminals, living in Australia, who have committed their crimes in Australia, are AUSTRALIANS. Categorising by race is an easy way of blaming ethnicity.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that they are notable, there are plenty of criminals in Wikipedia, like <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Milat_cca2.html" title="Ivan Milat">Ivan Milat</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Bryant_da7e.html" title="Martin Bryant">Martin Bryant</a>. Your point about blaming ethnicity for crime is not valid I think, because if so then one might also have to to remove <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Bracks_999c.html" title="Steve Bracks">Steve Bracks</a> on the reverse point that an ethnic group would thereby "take credit" for a positive member of the community. Basically, either they all stay or all go, and perhaps a better way to discuss would be <a href="../../../a/w/n/WP%7EAWNB_94e7.html" title="WP:AWNB">Australian noticeboard</a> with the whole community.

<p>I've replied on my own page, but I'll post here as well:<br />
I'd prefer it slightly if you left the page-creation up to me (I've got the "templates" I use saved as Notepad files on my computer, so it'll probably be a mite faster - also, if you're Wikibreaking and I'm not then I should probably be able to get them done faster), but you're welcome to add extra info to any of the songs - particularly where Ireland's concerned, I really only know the winners well. If you want, I could go directly to Ireland from Estonia when that part gets done. That said, if you want to create the pages, be my guest.

<p>I came here to wonder why you put a backlog tag on the NS category, when it was actually up-to-date - July 6th is 7 days ago, so we can't delete those items till tomorrow. But then I read your message at the top, and it prompted me to re-think what I was going to write. Pardon the vehemence, but - <b>GO BACK TO WRITING ARITCLES!</b> - we need that <i>far</i> more than we need an admin tasks done, and it's far harder to do. I speak as a WikiGnome; someone who has been doing maintence tasks since before I became a janitor, and simply continued - we need article writers <b>far</b> more than we need more maintence people - yes, the backlogs grow gigantic, and continue on as far as the eye can see, but - what we are here to do is write articles - that's what we have all come together for, and what our intention and purpose is. Please don't trade time you could spend writing articles for anything - it's our most precious and rare resource. I hope this is of some help - if I can do anything else, please let me know. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 00:52, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, exactly. I have a semi-automatic tool I use to handle the no_source categories, and it checks the the pages have been uploaded more than 7 days ago, no exceptions (and that they haven't been edited in the last day, just as a further check), so I don't usually get to the NS categories until at least one day past the 7 days. A backlog, to me, is 2 or 3 days beyond the 7 day limit. As for PRODs - I'm not that familiar with the non-toolserver process, but I assume people cut it close due to non-automatic checking (which was available on the toolserver, may it soon return). Glad there are other people concerned about the backlogs. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 01:15, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hi, just wanted to reiterate what JesseW says above. WP is too big for anyone to carry the whole thing on their shoulders, and if anything the backlog of excellent article writing is the one we should all be working on :) Happy wishes, <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 01:18, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Blnguyen, I see you are online now. Wanted to ask a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a newbie, I had copy pasted text to a few articles. The articles are substantially changed now. But the text obviously remains in the history.</li>
<li>Is it possible to remove just the history and let the present article remain?</li>
<li>Is it possible to delete just sections of an article?</li>
<li>Should I just put the speedy tag on such articles?</li>
</ul>

<p>They are purposefully editing my comments and the reporting me to admin for forcing a civil discussion on the page. I request you to consider my case, as I have always been civil, cited my sources, and talked about the issue at hand. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.141.69.21 (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.141.69.21.html" title="User talk:202.141.69.21">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.141.69.21_fb4f.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.141.69.21">contribs</a>) 04:11, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

I removed Panairjdde only after he did so to my decent proposal of adding a controversy sectionand asking for sources to a paragraph, quite pointedly. I am an advocate for civil discussion and there is no vandalism, at least on my part. 05:17, 14 July 2006 (UTC)~</p>
<p>Which is what is being done. Should we proclaim that the provocation that led to the headbutt was a qualified "non racist", noting that there is a FIFA hearing on the 20th to decide that matter, and none of the media have come to that interpretation, or should we say that these comments are ubder FIFA scanner and desist from qualifying them with our judgement. Please see what I am trying to do and not what is being told to you by 'old hands'. I have followed this topic with some interest, and I have no intent to either reduce it to gossip or idle chatter. I have used sources and all my debating skills to bring a <i><b>pertinent</b></i> point to the fore.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMarco_Materazzi_6bb9.html" title="Talk:Marco Materazzi">Talk:Marco Materazzi</a> you responded to a rather tangential comment unrelated to Wikipedia article discussion. Because the user who added the comment to which you responded has been vandalizing this page by blanking comments by others and his non-vandalistic comments are still not about improving the article, I have been reverting his edits entirely. I am careful with comments added by others in the interval, though it is a pain, but in removing his comment, your comment would be dangling so I would like to remove it as well. I have not yet reverted, because I am not going to keep reverting this vandalism every minute, so I will wait until he has been blocked or until it has been a little while. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> • 04:13, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
