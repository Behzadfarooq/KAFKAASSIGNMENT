<p>Thanks for locking the page. I would now like to bring to your attention a citation from non-English source that has been used by user:Mrtag.

<p>1^ महाराष्ट्राचे प्राचीन राज्यकर्ते --&gt;His translation I believe (Maharashtra's ancient rulers)-A brief summary of dynasties that ruled ancient Maharashtra by V.Rajwde . No ISBN/OCLC or any identification.</p>
<p>This book/magzine/paper (god knows what) which is not in the reference section is supposed to prove the Maharashtri Prakrit was an official language (he initially put Marathi and was later compelled to change it) in the Rashtrakuta empire. None of the English language authors I have referenced (from the reference list in the article) have mentioned anything about Maharashtri Prakrit being used as administrative language. I own the English books I have referenced. When I asked him to give a citation, he gave something (he himself typed out I guess) with its English translation.</p>

<p>"The Rashtrakutas were feudatories to the Chalukyas and came into prominence under Dantidurga around 753 CE.The oldest Rashtrakutas are believed to be from ancient Kuntala in the valley of river Krishna.

<dd>I'd say that unless there is a problem with the credibility of the Marathi Encyclopedia, then it would be fine. If there are other books which say different conflicting things, then attributing to the original historian and their differing viewpoints is the way to go. <a href="../../../s/o/u/WP%7ESOURCE_b1c9.html#Language" title="WP:SOURCE">WP:SOURCE#Language</a>, doesn't seem to rule out using non-English texts at all, although an original English translation, rather than a self-translation is probably better. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 03:22, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The snippets are enough to depict that <i>marathas/Maharashtri prakrit and Marathi</i> are not irrelevant to Rashtrakutas as the current article completely ignored it. If you see my additions, they are brief enough and based on the 'visible' part. No doubt that kannada was a strong language during Rashtrakutas but few branches of this dynasty did have Marathi origins and patronized Marathi/Maharashtri Prakrit. In fact Mr.Kannambadi has one of that book but it seems he has subdued this fact under 'notes'. I will surely dig all the libraries and book-shops of my town and add more about it. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtag_d414.html" title="User:Mrtag">Mrtag</a> 03:53, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Blnguyen, I would like to know bring to your notice about snippets being from google books being added as valid citations. There is every chance that the text would be cited out of context in these views. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtag_d414.html" title="User:Mrtag">User:Mrtag</a> is raking up trivial issues over transliteration and adding citation-needed tags even for texts which have been cited. I don't see such edits adding any value to the articles and is disruptive in nature. -- <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENaveenbm_8d5d.html" title="User:Naveenbm"><font color="blue"><b>Naveen</b></font></a> <sup><i>(<a href="../../../n/a/v/User_talk%7ENaveenbm_b53b.html" title="User talk:Naveenbm">talk</a>)</i></sup> 04:09, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suppose the part which says that there were some Marathi Rashtrakutas who were later ancestors of Marathas, seems like it stands by itself, that there were some Marathi speaking people. Of course it would be preferable if Mrtag has the whole book to read, although it doesn't seem that would help anybody else. However, the justification for putting Marathi first seems to be based on the use of a piece of text which merely stated that there were Marathis, not that they were predominant. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 04:42, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly.But these mentions have to be done. The same holds true for Yadavas of Deogiri. They are predominantly Marathi rulers and kannada inscriptions are incidental plus kannada origin is 'doubted'. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtag_d414.html" title="User:Mrtag">Mrtag</a> 13:16, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, if one notices the date on one of the snippets, its dated 1100 CE where as the imperial dynasty that ruled from Manyakheta went out of existance in 973 CE. Later, several minor Rashtrakuta branches ruled from various parts of India which has already been accounted for in Rashtrakuta descendents section. This main article has to do with the "Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta", not minor Rashtrakuta famlies who came later.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 10:22, 21 December 2006 (UTc)</dd>

<p>One of the reasons this article has been constantly plagued by controversy is partly because of the naming of the page. This page pertains to "Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta" specifically, though a brief mention has be made about their descendents etc. I propose we rename the article to match the name of the Imperial dynasty - <b>Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta</b>. This would solve lots of problems about dealing with Rashtrakutas of Vidharbha, Jodhpur etc. People interested in creating other subarticles are free to then create subarticles for their own tiny kingdoms elsewhere while the main article remains for most well known <b>Empire</b> - the rulers from Manyakheta. thanks.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 11:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding spoken languages in the 8-10 centuries, Telugu was popularly spoken in the esatern Deccan, and Tamil ofcourse in deep South. All these areas were also controlled by Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta from time to time (I can provide all citations and this has been briefly explained on the main page). I would not be surprised if those languages were used for local administration in those areas. But that does not make Telugu or Tamil the languages of Central Administration. This is my point. What was used in Vidharbha by a minor Rashtrakuta family should not prevail on the main family in Manyakheta. Kannada was used in many inscriptions during the rule of <b>Marathas</b> in the Karnataka region in the 18th century ( I can provide citations not just from by book but also from Archaeological Survey of India). If Maharashtri Prakrit is considered official because it was used in some corner of central India (assuming Mrtag is accurate in his translation), then Kannada should be also considered an official language of the Maratha Empire simply because people did not stop speaking in Kannada in the 18th century. we continued to speak Kannada and still do.Thanks.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 11:40, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Marathi citation that I provided clearly stated that some branches of Rashtrakutas did have Maharashtri Prakrit/Marathi as their court-language. The snippets I provided clearly show that rashtrakutas of Malkhed are Marathi speakers (the same branch Mr.Kannambadi is talking Its ok to remove Maharashtri Prakrit/Marathi script from main article and keep the mentions as Kannada <i>collectively</i> was main language of Rashtrakutas.(but do not remove Sanskrit) In same ways Yadavas of Deogiri are undoubtedly Marathi and the same language was strong in their reign. Kannada might be the language of Yadavas in Karnataka or so its script is not necessary and 'tall claims' should be supported by other sources. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtag_d414.html" title="User:Mrtag">Mrtag</a> 13:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Missing the point</b> You are missing the point. My suggestion has nothing to do with present day Maharashtra or Karnataka. The Yadava kings encouraged Kannada scholars in their court, minted Kannada coins. They wrote over 500 Kannada inscriptions. Nothing makes it more clear that Kannada was a court language. Whether the Yadavas of Devagiri are related to Marathi's or not itself is debated as expained by all the citations. To me it's clear from the Seuna article that during the 11-13 century was a time of multiple languages in Maharashtra. Even historians are not sure if it is clearly the first Maratha empire. The snippets you provided provide no information in any level of clarity.</p>
<p>Moreover, History is not about a barter between me and you. It is about providing facts based on available data which can be verified.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 13:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC) BTW, remember that it was I who put Sanskrit in there, not you.

<dd>Thanks for adding the Sanskrit stuff (but u forgot adding Sanskrit script),u also subdued the 'maratha' origin theory down in the notes. Anyways my snippets show exactly what I want to prove. Few rashtrakutas are of Marathi origin and they spoke/patrozied Marathi. Let us suppose this is not adequate for Marathi script as only Govinda III and Vidarbha Rashtrakutas did that. The same holds true for Yadavas of Deogiri, Yadavas kannada origin is doubted (they are from north), and the kannada inscriptions are found only in Karnataka and not in Maharashtra. It is a fact that yadavas patronized Marathi languge and Marathi culture. Only a fraction of Yadavas might had Kannada as court-language. I think I have made this clear.</dd>
<dd>I request to remove protection as I have more information to add. I have enough citations to prove that Yadavas are Marathi. It will be nice if he provide more sources for his extraordinary claims of Yadavas of Deogiri had kannada as their court-language.Or Let Mr.Kannambadi make another article for Yadavas of Karnataka. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtag_d414.html" title="User:Mrtag">Mrtag</a> 14:35, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yadavas had many branches just as rashtrakutas. Yadavas of Deogiri itself means the <b>major branch of yadavas which had Deogiri as capital</b>. Btw i have been to Deogiri and dont think I am novice at these. What sources do u have? The entire section is based on a book and that too clearly states that kannada inscriptions are in karnataka. I have no time to have petty fights and lose my dignity here. As I said,this time u have messed with wrong person!

<p>Hi. In the Seuna page, before you locked the page up, Mrtag an indef-blocked user and sock puppet (indef-blocked by Aksi_great) introduced a "snippet" (currently citation #14). This citation is not acceptable not only because it is a snippet but also from a banned sock. Please remove this so called "citation" when you have time.thanks.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 18:52, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to take this page for arbitration since it is plagued by reverts. I am hoping that this will resolve the issue. The need for the arbitration arises from the "validy or invalidity" of certian citations put in by an user who has been repeatedly banned for sock puppetry. How do I go about this procedure. what is the paper work to be done to apply for arbitration. Please help.thanks.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 20:02, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you should be patient as the dispute is not really of a magnitude ready for arbitration. The previous levels of dispute in September/October in the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> article is about the level for arbitration, but something perhaps 30% smaller may be accepted.

<dd>The Anon user is throwing in snippets, marathi blog sites claiming citations. The first thing to do is to bring in a native Marathi speaker who can interprit the clutter that has been created by the anon. He is also trying to confuse the reader by contradictory statements which we can go thru line by line. Eventually, arbitration in inevitable. By the way he is back to vandalism on Seuna. Someone is getting very agressive. If he continues tagging without discussion, can his IPaddress be blocked?thanks.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 13:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Snippets are elaborative enough to prove what I have added. Such Google books works were included in yadavas article as well. Where did I use Marathi blog sites?If Marathi sites are not to be used than why should kannada? I am a native Marathi speaker and my translations are full proof. Mr Kannambadi has deliberately suppressed Marathi stuff at Rashtrakutas and inserted Kannada stuff at yadavas. There are no contradictory statements. There is no vandalism on yadavas. All my additions are based on citations. I have discussed everything on talk page. Mr.kannambadi's is being 'bad boy' here. I am forced to edit by ip addresses as all my accounts get blocked because of Mr.Kannambadi's name-calling. 59.95.6.80 17:09, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Bl,</dd>
<dd>neither I am a vandal nor I have done anything wrong. The usage of tag Template:More Sources is not vandalism. There is a reason behind it. Plz note that I have included citations for my every additions. Each and every citation signifies the importance of Yadavas of Deogiri in Maharashtra history and Marathi language.</dd>
<dd>The Kannada thing is based only on 1 citation. I have another exciting thing to bring to ur notice,but before that Mr.Kannambadi needs to stop removing cited info and speaking nonsense about me.</dd>
