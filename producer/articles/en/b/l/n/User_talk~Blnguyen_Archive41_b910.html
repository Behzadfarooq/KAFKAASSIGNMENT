<p>Sir, an anon user with ipaddress 151.193.220.29 has been removing large chunks of cited info on the above page. This is not the first time nor is this the only article he has been warned not to remove info from (from the ip address talk page). The funny part is he is warning us not to revert his blatant removal of cited info and says he will bring in adminstrators. They come in various forms, dont they?.

<dd>Ah, it was just some on-wiki article stalking. I note that Gerash seems only to edit Iranian and Islam type articles, and that Iran does not play cricket whatsoever. However, he went over to two cricket articles, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_McCabe_2f39.html" title="Stan McCabe">Stan McCabe</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/f/Irfan_Pathan_b760.html" title="Irfan Pathan">Irfan Pathan</a> after I edited something he didn't like on <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_6e5e.html" title="Mahmoud Ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>. In the case of McCabe, he undid my GA polishing on the page, including removing some sources, undoing grammar corrections and unsplitting some overly complicated sentences. As for the Pathan article, he drove past and tagged two pieces of information that were already sourced. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 00:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

To this, I'll just add that the heart of the MSK-008 Dijeh deletion review goes directly to the closing statements that you made, where one editor at the deletion review now argues that the "closing admin apparently devalued the comments of some of the editors based on a perceived association with a WikiProject in order to reach his conclusion that there was a consensus to delete." -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 20:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi Blnguyen, I have something weird going on and thought an admin should at least know about it. I warned User:71.250.15.4 for User Page vandalism against <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerruckteDan_c06d.html" title="User:VerruckteDan">User:VerruckteDan</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">User:Alai</a>. Then I started getting messages on my talk page <a href="../../../r/u/h/User_talk%7ERuhrfisch_b20a.html#I_Don.27t_Like_You" title="User talk:Ruhrfisch">here</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/h/User_talk%7ERuhrfisch_b20a.html#Still_Don.27t_Like_You" title="User talk:Ruhrfisch">here</a> from User:71.250.15.4 and from <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapkid13_7c27.html" title="User:Mapkid13">User:Mapkid13</a>, who claims to be his brother. The weird thing is that the two users will both leave messages for me and each other and sign each other's names (or change signatures so it reads that it is the other one, when they did not write it according to the edit history).</p>
<p>I had never had any interaction with Mapkid13 before all this, but did leave a message on his talk page saying perhaps there was mixup. There has been no vandalism since the warnings except for one-time removal of warning templates from <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.250.15.4.html" title="User talk:71.250.15.4">User talk:71.250.15.4</a> after a test4 warning (plus some stuff written that probably violates <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>). I am not sure if this a sock or really brothers or what, but I thought I would let a wiser and more experienced editor than I know about it. Sorry to bother you and congrats again.

<p>Hi Blnguyen,</p>
<p>I am writing to ask that you reconsider your 'delete &amp; protect' on the entry for Sarah Hanson-Young (Senate candidate for Greens SA) on 23 Oct 2006. She seems no less worthy (in fact, she is probably more worthy) of entry in Wikipedia than the many other candidates in Australian elections (see e.g. those listed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_South_Australian_legislative_election,_2006" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_South_Australian_legislative_election,_2006" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_South_Australian_legislative_election,_2006</a>).</p>
<p>Unlike many of these people, Sarah has been a prominent community activist for many years. I knew of her when she was involved in pro-refugee causes and, when I heard she had been preselected for the Greens, I went to Wikipedia to find out more. I was dismayed to discover that, as a consequence of your actions, she did not have a page. I understand that Wikipedia has a policy against 'speculative' entries but I put it to you that her prior activities, and the fact of her candidature, are more than enough to warrant an entry.</p>
<p>I also note that the 'deleted and protected' entry for Sarah is now the top-ranking entry for her name on Google. This suggests to me that there is interest in reading a Wikipedia entry about her, that is currently being prevented by your actions.</p>
<p><br />
Could I ask that you lift your 'delete and protect' on her page? I am currently living overseas and have no personal interest in this matter, except that I rely on Wikipedia as an information source.</p>

<dd>It was deleted because of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sarah_Hanson-Young_2010.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarah Hanson-Young">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarah Hanson-Young</a>. The only reason I deleted it again, was because it was reposted. If you want to reverse the decision, please see <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. The reason that the people on the page you cite have articles, is because they are elected. SH-Y is a failed candidate, and has been agreed by other users that she is not at the moment entitled to an article. I am fully aware of her activities, especially outside Baxter Detention Centre, and the asylum seekers running away as well, as I attended the same university and was also canvassed by her for a vote a few years ago. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 02:05, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Blnguyen, thanks for your reply and the links. I really didn't want to get dragged into this, but your arguments are factually incorrect on several points so I feel obligated to. In particular,</p>
<p>(1) Numerous failed candidates from the SA 2006 state election have bios - that is why I referred you to the link. See Amanda Rishworth, Rosemary Clancy, or Peter Gandolfi, to name just 3. So being a failed candidate does indeed seem to entitle you to an article. Moreover, these people have done far less than Sarah has outside of being party candidates.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Those ones got through the net. I am willing to nominate them for deletion, as it is clear that those that are nominated, are routinely deleted in a decisive verdict. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>(2) Being a prominent community activist is, separately, a legitimate reason for being listed in wikipedia. Check out the bios for Ian Rintoul, Juanita Wheeler, or Felix Eldridge, to name just 3. Of course, you could spend your days going through wikipedia and deleting these people as well. Alternatively you could recognise that different communities use wikipedia to document their stories and histories, and that this is one of the things that makes wikipedia so valuable.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>That is true, as <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Eldridge_56d7.html" title="Felix Eldridge">Felix Eldridge</a> has survived one AfD. However, these are grey cases, and SHY did not pass her AfD. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>For both these reasons the "NN" rule does not apply. Consequently the whole argument about "crystal ball gazing" does not apply in this case, because Sarah is entitled to an article on the basis of her community activism and status as a candidate, not only as a prospective electee.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your electoral analysis on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sarah_Hanson-Young_2010.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarah Hanson-Young">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarah Hanson-Young</a> is factually incorrect. Political parties do not need a 14% primary vote to be elected to the Senate - they need 14% after preferences. The 2004 Family First candidate in Victoria was elected with about 2% primary vote. So the electoral situation of the Greens in no way justifies the deletion of the article. Similarly, your argument for including Andrea Mason and excluding Sarah is purely arbitrary and stands open to allegations of bias.</p>
<p>Moreover, and I say this respectfully, it really concerns me that (a) you have backed up your actions with spurious electoral analysis despite having an understanding of the Australian political and electoral systems that is incorrect on fundamental points, (b) you have done so little research to ensure that your deletion is consistent with the treatment of bios of people in analogous positions, and (c) you yourself admit to having a personal knowledge of Sarah, which surely should disqualify you from involvement in this case on the basis that you are not an impartial arbitrator. Your comments above, linking Sarah to the escape of refugees from detention, clearly suggests a bias against her.</p>
<p>I don't want to have to take this to a formal undeletion review because (a) I am busy and don't have enough of a personal involvement to engage in endless argument, and (b) it would unavoidably involve public criticism of you, which I have no particular desire to do. Please correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that it is within your power to reverse the deletion yourself. I am asking you to do this. If you are not, I would appreciate it if you could tell me exactly how to initiate an undeletion review.</p>
<p>Sincerely, JS</p>

<dd>I'm aware that you don't need 14% primary votes to get into the senate at all, but the preference system is quite complicated and I didn't go to the length of putting a convoluted argument there for people not acquainted with Australia's electoral system. The comparison to <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Fielding_570e.html" title="Steve Fielding">Steve Fielding</a>'s 2% is irrelevant, since he was elected, and continues to generate considerable media coverage as a sitting senator, while, SHY does not get a comparable amount of publicity. While it's true that Fielding had a lot of luck and on electoral merit is less notable, as a sitting senator, he is far more notable. I'm confident that the community was not fleeced, since the majority of the commenters are Australian and some are involved in politics themselves. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">User:Cyberjunkie</a> "cj" is an activist at Flinders, <a href="../../../r/o/i/User%7ERoisterer_ae8b.html" title="User:Roisterer">User:Roisterer</a> used to be a NUS office bearer, Lankiveil, Andjam, are all Australians. The only people who wanted to keep, Rebecca (is a student activist) and Zzymurgy is involved with the Greens, so the people who have kept have involvement, moreso than myself, I am simply a random student not involved or having a stake in politics at all, aside from being canvassed for a vote. I do not have a conflict of interest. All those things aside, it was not my decision to delete the article&#160;: CSCWEM closed the debate as a delete, as the nominator, I cannot adjudicate the verdict. I only deleted the second time because an article had been reposted after a group consensus to delete (see <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> G4&#160;??) about deleting reposted content. My delete was not dependent on any judgment except that it was to enforce the removal of something which was sanctioned by somebody else, in this case, CSCWEM. So I cannot undelete it myself, since it was the community verdict to delete the article. You would have to go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> and start an entry for SHY.

<p>Hi Blnguyen. I've noticed you protected the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> wikipedia entry and thus are probably the most suitable to approve / enforce / disapprove this matter, not to talk about your position on the ArbCom. There is a three-strike proposal regarding editors' behavior which they must conform to, and has been agreed by persons from all three camps (the pro-FG, the anti-FG and the third-parties). I'll reproduce the rules here that have been adopted:</p>
<p><b>The rules are:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>1. If you propose an edit to Wikipedia's Falun Gong entry, it MUST be posted in the discussion board of the Falun Gong Wiki entry or one of the special and related talk pages (e.g. the FG introduction discussion page). Exceptions only apply to administrators or sysops when playing their admin / sysop function.</b></li>
<li><b>2(a) An edit by any editor here is defined as the alteration - addition or deletion - of content of the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> Wikipedia entry.</b></li>
<li><b>2(b) Alterations of format, settings, including font size, etc., will be subject to direct approval by an administrator-level editor or above.</b></li>
<li><b>2(c) The inclusion of pictures is subject to Wikipedia copyright rules, the approval of editors AND the direct approval of an administrator.</b></li>
<li><b>3(a)(i). This proposal has to be on there for a minimum of FIVE FULL DAYS (120 hours) without disagreement from any other editor, except those editors blocked by Wikipedia during that time for violation of this rule IN RELATION to this proposal.</b>
<ul>
<li><b>3(a)(ii). To prevent abuse of the term "five full days", aka 120 hours, the time that Wikipedia is down or not accessible (if more than 1 hour at any one time during those 120 hours), then the time that Wikipedia was down will NOT count to those 120 hours.</b></li>
<li><b>3(b) If, during those five full days any other editor disagrees with the proposal, the five full day time clock is reset. A reset time clock applies to any edit of the main Falun Gong Wiki entry of the proposal's section(s).</b></li>
<li><b>3(c) If, after five full days, there is no disagreement from any user, then the main Falun Gong Wiki page will be edited accordingly. Reversion of such an edit is not permitted unless another proposal is made, which must then adhere to the above rules.</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>4. Any deletion or addition of content of more than 25% by any editor who is not a non-involved (in content) administrator or sysop of any one section will constitute as vandalism, except -</b>
<ul>
<li><b>a) The addition of more than 25% is to revert a deletion of more than 25% of the same content</b></li>
<li><b>b) Violation of the above rule shall be deemed in violation of WP:Vandalism and thus incur the same action(s) / penalty(ies).</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>5. If a user edits in violation of this, then they will be given a warning ('first strike'). Similar action will be taken if they do it a second time.</b></li>

<p>No, there is a Wikipedia rule that says that people who evade blocks will be blocked longer. WP:BLOCK. That's why the block is being lengthened.
