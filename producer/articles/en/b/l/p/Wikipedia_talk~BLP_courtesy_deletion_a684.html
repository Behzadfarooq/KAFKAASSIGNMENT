<p>I've put up the first draft of a proposal to delete marginally notable BLPs upon request of the subject of the article. It's rough and it needs hammering out, so all input is welcome. In particular, we need to find a working definition of "marginal notability," so that subjects who are clearly significant public figures are excluded from the provision.</p>
<p>As I see it, we're badly in need of a policy along these lines to avoid future rows over BLPs that cause distress to the subject and a lot of frustration for the editors involved. I'm thinking of BLPs such as Brian Peppers (now deleted), <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_c5c1.html" title="Brian Chase">Brian Chase</a> (now deleted), <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Lauder-Frost_38d2.html" title="Gregory Lauder-Frost">Gregory Lauder-Frost</a> (now deleted), Sam Vaknin (now deleted), <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Marsden_81fc.html" title="Rachel Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth_Finkelstein_6930.html" title="Seth Finkelstein">Seth Finkelstein</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Beesley_5b39.html" title="Angela Beesley">Angela Beesley</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:50, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tough one, SM.... We need to come up with some criteria to establish marginal notability. Maybe a Google test, a search on Lexis-Nexis, Newspaperarchive.com and the like? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 04:13, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't made up my mind about this sort of thing. But from my reading of the current draft, Gregory Lauder-Frost, Daniel Brandt, Rachel Marsden would not be subject to this given the number of sources on each. As it is written it seems redundant to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> since it essentially says that if someone is not-notable and they object they can their article deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I object for reasons discussed elsewhere and pasted below, and respectfully request that you get your facts straight. One of the people in your list has been the primary subject of approximately one hundred reliable newspaper articles (plus nationwide TV news), mostly having to do with his/her arrest, bail conditions, and criminal trial in which he/she was found guilty. None of those articles mentioned Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 17:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The most obvious way of measuring marginal notability is if there is less than some number (say X) sources that would fit the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criterion. Now, as I read it, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is essentially two independent reliable sources. So maybe X =3 or x=4? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:57, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think a more obvious way to determine marginal notability is how much of a bio one can create using only secondary sources. In the case of Brandt it is not possible to say much of anything outside of his activism in a fairly narrow subject area. I don't know what a "minimum bio" would be but perhaps it ought to be possible to determine age, employment over time, birthplace and where raised, general place of residence currently, education, and then the notable events the person has been involved in (all from secondary sources only). This ensures that people like George W Bush can't make a case for removal but less notable people can.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeURL_4d82.html" title="User:MikeURL">MikeURL</a> 18:56, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Precedent is against this. If a person wants it deleted they can take it to AfD.

<dd>Indeed. An encyclopedia is encyclopedic: it covers everything. While paper encyclopedias have to decide who rates being included, Wikipedia does not have such a constraint. I do agree that Wikipedia should not allow one person to use it as an instrument to inflict harm on another, but this can be - and is, as in the recent dispute over <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Internet_phenomena_9aec.html" title="List of Internet phenomena">List of Internet phenomena</a> - taken way too far, and that alienates the most valuable resource Wikipedia has, the average editor.

<dd>Ok, skirting BLP with this, but I'll try to handle the cases I'm aware of(if I say anything grossly wrong feel free to correct me). I can't guaranteee NPOV in my descriptions of what occured, but I will try (excepting one obvious case where I really can't, but it isn't the subject of the article) <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> I think everyone is aware of the ongoing issues. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Lauder-Frost_38d2.html" title="Gregory Lauder-Frost">Gregory Lauder-Frost</a> was a minor British politician whose biography contained accusations of criminal acts that were reasonably well sourced. Frost and his friends attempted to repeatedly delete the article in a highly disruptive fashion and some users sympathized with his demand of privacy. The final straw was an email claiming that Frost was sick and dying and that the Wikipedia article was adding to his suffering and possibly helping kill him. This pushed enough editors over to the side for deletion that it was deleted by a slim majority. (Editorial remark, the Frost's illness was never confirmed as of now Frost is still alive). Brian Peppers was an individual whose article was about an internet phenomenon- Peppers had a strange looking face and his picture along with claims that he was a sex offender became widely circulated among the sorts of stupid annoying people who like to vandalize Wikipedia and engage in things like <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> nonsense and feel a need to make up for their lack of lives by making fun of someone who they think looks strange. After many AfDs, and requests for deletion by people who claimed to represent Peppers' family, Jimbo deleted the article and declared that it would not be undeleted in less than a year. Recently, the 1 year came up, a DRV was held, and the DRV was closed with a snow for staying deleted. Note that in the Peppers case, it was not clear that he in fact met <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> anyways. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That seems like an unworkable standard or at minimum something that would need a lot of clarifcation (for example, a large part of the Brandt article is about his accomplishements, the Frost article also had positive elements, the only one that is indisputably nasty of all the one's SV gave as examples was Peppers). Furthermore, would a Thumper clause affect <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_Hovind_0b34.html" title="Kent Hovind">Kent Hovind</a> or <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Dahmer_e378.html" title="Jeffrey Dahmer">Jeffrey Dahmer</a>, or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Singer_a561.html" title="Fred Singer">Fred Singer</a> (nota bene, I'm not comparing these three people to each other or saying they are similar but in fact attempting to give three very different examples all of which could plausibly be included under some form of Thumper clause). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, in your example of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Lauder-Frost_38d2.html" title="Gregory Lauder-Frost">Gregory Lauder-Frost</a>, I didn't get the impression he was either indicted or tried, merely that there were these criminal "accusations" floating around (unlike Dahmer, who isn't a Living Person anyway). <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Kent_Hovind_941a.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Kent Hovind">Special:Whatlinkshere/Kent_Hovind</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Fred_Singer_1843.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Fred Singer">Special:Whatlinkshere/Fred_Singer</a> makes clear both are connected to "larger events". -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 07:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, well pretend Dahmer is alive and you get the same question.

<li>It does not provide any operational definition of "marginal notability." Whether it is even possible to provide such a definition is debatable.</li>
<li>It suggests the creation of a new Wikipedia game, called "Whack a bio", where administrators can essentially undermine deletion procedures if they manage to do so within a 72 hour period. The proposal even suggests the protection against recreation if the admin successfully "whacks" the bio.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we wish to take the subject's opinion into account in AfDs, we are free to do so: there is no need for a new policy. It might help to make the fact that some editors feel this is a legitimate reason for deletion in some cases explicit in the existing deletion guidelines, in case it isn't already. I think this is the only way to deal with this issue: allow each editor to weigh the arguments on a case-by-case basis, including the subject's opinion if they desire to do so.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 06:33, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that we currently end up with intractable situations such as Daniel Brandt and Rachael Marsden, and Gregory Lauder-Frost until a few sensible admins managed to sort it out. We need to recognize that with certain bios, Wikipedia becomes a participant in determining their notability, not just a reporter of it, by dragging up material from a long time ago that would otherwise have been forgotten; by having endless debates about the notability of the subject, much of which ends up on Google; and in the case of Brandt, by being part of the process of increasing that notability because of the subject's attempts to have the bio taken down. I have no fixed ideas about how a policy should approach this, but I think we do need some minimal process to give us a handle on how to deal with these situations. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rachel Marsden is clearly notable and her notability has nothing to do with Wikipedia.

<dd>That's a good question, Kendrick. The judgment is a primary source, and we probably shouldn't refer to it unless we can find secondary sources that do, then we should use those in preference. Primary sources may be relied upon in certain cases, and when they are, the claims based on them may only be purely descriptive, but the danger is that we pick and choose which bits to quote, so there's definitely an element of OR there. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:59, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second this proposal. There is no need for a new guideline, but there is definitely a need to allow people whose bios are inaccurate, a means for correcting them and vigiliantly patrolling BLPs to ensure there is no unrealiably sourced and defamatory material. If I recall, this was part of the issue that sparked Daniel Brandt into wanting to delete this own entry. The presence of inaccurate and offensive comments about him and his work - without a way for him to change it (you cannot edit your own article, anon admins enjoy protection, and no oversight) is what sparked his campaign. Perhaps he wouldn't have even wante dthe article deleted had the guidelines surrounding WP:BLP been better regarding the right of bio subjects to participate in fact-checking their own bios, rather than treating them as though they are always on the cusp of a POV violation (WP:AGF remeber?). To call the guideline "Courtesy deletion" is also absolutely Orwellian considering the history of the players involved and how deletion was refused before. Just expand the section on WP:BLP that grants people more rights to oversee/edit articles on themselves. I believe some of those changes have already made. There is really no need for a new guideline. I think too, it's only going to make the situation worse. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 12:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would be prepared to delete the material on the judgment against Rachel Marsden. I think it is borderline OR at best and I see no need to include such material in any event. It's not as if this was an event that attracted great public interest, like Mel Gibson's recent run-in with the police. When I saw it earlier, I was not prepared to delete it, though I felt like it, but in the light of comments that I've now read above, I will do so. I ask those involved here to support me if there are problems. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 13:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, now I've deleted that, I think the sexual harassment case dating back to 1990 is also of dubious relevance even though there is a secondary source for it. I'll leave it there for now. However, it seems to me that the big problem that has been identified by Slim Virgin is that some relatively non-public, but still notable, figure can have just about any incident from her life revealed, as long as we can find a reliable (secondary?) source. I don't think that's what Wikipedia should be about. However, we don't have to delete entire articles to address this; we need strong support for the idea that Wikipedia, as per the spirit of BLP, is not here to dig up non-notable dirt on marginally notable people. Indeed, I'm often surprised at the dirt on major public figures, e.g. last time I looked at the article on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Straw_671a.html" title="Jack Straw">Jack Straw</a> it contained statements about misdemeanours committed not by Straw himself but by certain of his relatives. Why is <i>that</i> the sort of material that we want? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 13:38, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This provision seems unacceptable in its entirety:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A BLP that has been the subject of a courtesy delete under this policy may be re-created if the courtesy delete is overturned by a two-thirds majority at deletion review, if and only if the subject's situation has changed, since the deletion, in a way that makes him more notable than before. If the deletion review is unsuccessful and the BLP stays deleted, the closing admin should blank the discussion.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>First off, if a deletion is made <i>in error</i>, this says that it cannot be reverted unless the subject has become more notable. This is bad. If an administrator deletes an article in the erroneous belief that the subject is not notable, this provision requires that the article stay deleted. This is incompatible with the goal of making an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Second, there is no excuse for blanking discussions. Our process is, and must remain, open. Blanking discussions makes it difficult or impossible (depending on whether the revision history is censored, too) for people in the future to refer to those discussions -- for instance to cite them as precedent or as examples of a rule or a behavior.</p>
<p>All in all, this provision leans so strongly in the direction of deleting articles that it may as well read as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anything someone complains about will get deleted, if it's not on anyone's watchlist who's active, and the complainant chooses to contact the most deletionist administrator available. <b>And no take-backs.</b></i></dd>

<dd>I appreciate your attempt to draw up a compromise position here, but I think the proposal is flawed from the outset. <i>If</i> Wikipedia were to provide some kind of "courtesy deletion" function, or other options (like stubbing as you propose) I think it should be as a last resort, to support the existing policy of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. For example, it could be listed to be used only as an absolutely last resort when repeated attempts to make sure an article is in line with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> fail, <i>and</i> the subject of the article is seriously disturbed by this failure. Such a clause could be added to the existing policy, under the section "Dealing with articles about yourself". In general, I feel that there should be a more open process for people who wish to correct articles with factual inaccuracies in them. They should be treated just like any other editor with a known POV; in other words, we should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and allow any editor to add to their own article and only prevent them when they repeatedly ignore core policies like <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> (or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, etc. Following this line of thinking might prevent frustration on the part of people who feel that their bios are inaccurate and unrepresentative and that they are being unjustly shut out from participating in editing an article whose subject they would ovbiously know a great deal about.

<p>I proposed something similar here a week ago: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html#Proposed_courtesy_deletion_for_persons_of_borderline_notability" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(people)#Proposed_courtesy_deletion_for_persons_of_borderline_notability</a>. The discussion is too long to paste here. Here is my attempt to summarize the discussion:</p>
<p>Thanks everyone. Let me try to summarize the discussion so far and interweave my own opionions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no support expressed here yet for the concept of <i>automatically</i> granting deletions, upon request, to people who are minimally-notable.</li>
<li>There is some support for the idea of taking the wishes of the subject into account in a deletion debate.</li>
<li>There is little support for expansion of policy or guidelines. I beg to differ on this one because I keep seeing experienced, dedicated Wikipedians, in good faith, each follow their own "common sense" and end up bitterly at odds over biography deletions. If guidelines are not explicit, people make up their own rules and this can easily result in <i>more</i> deletions of worthwhile articles than would have taken place under explicit guidelines. I've seen people argue that a person was "borderline notable" when the number of published works on the person numbered in the hundreds. This is the kind of thing I want to prevent.</li>
<li>I think we might have in mind at least two kinds of scenarios which could require different approaches.
<ul>
<li>The first is cases where the article is obviously embarassing to a person who is only notable for having done something stupid once, with no lasting historical significance. We can probably address most of these with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a>, which I've already cited in the AfD for Amir Massoud Tofangsazan.</li>
<li>The second scenario is where the article is about someone who is notable for something of real significance. In many cases, the subject would appreciate a purely positive-POV article, but asks for deletion after failing to get that. And then there are a few cases such as Brandt's, in which the subject Just Wants it Gone for reasons that may be hard for others to understand. The community, if not the people on this Talk page, is in a stalemate about the Brandt case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My general feeling is that we should do our best to accomodate the person's wishes, without removing the information pertinent to what made the person notable. In practical terms, I think this can usually be accomodated by either a) <b>retitling</b> the article to focus on the event that made the person notable, or b) <b><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mergism" class="extiw" title="meta:Mergism">merging</a></b> into the relevant article(s) about what the person has been involved in, with a brief description of the person instead of a hyperlinked name. If we can make the result of the rename or merge <i>no more flattering than the original article</i>, censorship should be a non-issue. We'd usually lose some biographical details, such as photos and hobbies. If that kind of information is of real encyclopedic value, then it's perhaps a sign that the bio should be kept. If it's not of encyclopedic value and we remove it, then the subject's right to privacy will have rightly prevailed. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayoquot_bbe3.html" title="User:Clayoquot">Kla'quot</a> 09:04, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Admins can already delete unsourced or poorly-sourced negative articles about living people under G11, editors can remove such information under <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. If the negative information about the person <i>is</i> sourced, and there's enough secondary material to write a comprehensive article on them, they're notable, even if relatively non-public. This would <i>flood</i> us with requests from people who don't like their biography, even if everything in it is perfectly well-sourced, and effectively put the subject in charge of the bio ("Don't you put that information in, or I'll just have the damn thing deleted"). If the person appears to be marginally notable, the fact that the person wishes the bio to be deleted should be stated at the AfD, but should not be an automatic speedy criterion. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 19:58, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely right in your premise, which is why we have <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. But that's as far as we need to go. If information is sourced reliably (which means that whatever the information is would <i>already</i> be publicly available), it is not we who cause any "distress". If it's not, we should remove it immediately under BLP.

<dd>I agree about not wanting white-washed bios, but this is a proposal to delete bios on request, not to remove certain awkward parts of them. This was a problem with one bio that I won't name here, but the subject or his friends created it as a vanity page, then when someone added a well-sourced negative thing about something that happened a long time ago, the same people kicked up a huge row trying to get rid of it. The important thing is that the bio should never have been created in the first place, because the subject was of very marginal notability, so deleting the page in that kind of case is the best thing, rather than arguing back and forth for months about how much of the negative material to include. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:36, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, if they're non-notable, AfD 'em, and they should go. But we shouldn't try to get into "marginal notability" here-either a subject is notable and appropriate, and we should include well-sourced information of any stripe, or it's non-notable and inappropriate, and it should go regardless of other considerations. (Generally, the stuff people see as "marginally notable" is stuff I see as non-notable, so you'd likely get my delete vote anyway.) But what about people who are mainly notable <i>because</i> they get in trouble? Have a look at <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_Hovind_0b34.html" title="Kent Hovind">Kent Hovind</a>. He may have some notability outside being a tax fraud, but that's certainly what kicked up the most coverage. Presume, for a moment, that Hovind (or a representative of his, since he's in jail), has contacted you, and this had become policy. You've contacted the representative at his office, and are well-satisfied that he's authorized to represent Hovind, and that Hovind wants the bio gone.

<dd>Hrm. You do have good motives here, and it's something to think about. I might be willing to support this, but the other concern here is that the decision, once made, is <i>very</i> hard to overturn (and tough to take to AfD, since non-admins then can't see the article, unless it's restored somewhere during the debate, which would kind of defeat the purpose anyway), with this as it's written currently. If there were a clearer (even if imperfect and subject to some interpretation) definition of "marginally notable", and it were easier to overturn a decision there's no clear agreement on, I think this might be workable. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 21:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SV, I think you overestimate how much people will agree on a know when they see it test. For example, I see Brandt as not marginally notable but fully(is that the right word?) notable and saw Frost as plausibly marginally notable if we had such a rule. However, at least one editor had the reverse attitude, seeing Frost as notable and Brandt as much less so. The only plausible general standard I can think of is (as I suggested earlier) to make it have a numeric basis in terms of how many sources we actually have, but that doesn't sit very well with me. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:26, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you're saying. But did you see Brandt as non-marginally notable at the time of the stub creation? I agree that he's more notable now, but only because of Wikipedia, so that's a hard case to build a policy on. Maybe we need to put the complexities of Brandt out of our minds when looking at this, because any policy would find that situation awkward to deal with — unless we had an opt-out policy for all living persons, which wouldn't fly. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't around when the stub was originally created, so I don't know quite what my judgement would have been then (the very initial version obvious not, since it gives no citations or evidence that he had been the subject of any indepedent non-trivial reliable sources) . However, given that Brandt is precisely one of the motivating cases for this, it is hard for me to see how we can plausibly not consider it as relevant (and also, my point was to the subjectivity of marginally notable, not a specific comment about whether Brandt was or wasn't). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:56, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure that Brandt is "only notable because of Wikipedia", certainly Google Watch has gained him a significant amount of press, as did uncovering the government tracking cookies. I agree I might have seen him as non-notable when the article was first created, but it is clear now that he is. On the other hand, I agree on Peppers' non-notability (I don't think he's even marginally notable), he doesn't have anywhere near the depth and scope of coverage that Brandt does. But I'm not sure how that's relevant-<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> has gained his notability largely due to Wikipedia, as well, but he's unquestionably notable regardless. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 21:59, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to reiterate some discussion above, I believe this would be an easier concept to define that "marginal notability". If a BLP's bio can be reasonably linked to two or more notable articles, they would be meta-notable, and using "What links here" would be easily checkable. The devil still lies in the details, and I don't like the proposal as a whole, but this seems like a concept which could move the whole debate forward a step.

<dd>This idea is interesting but flawed. Two concerns: first, this could conceivably lead to disruption other articles by editors either trying to get it linked or to take links off and also makes things too much of a function of how well expanded other articles already are. (I know you say "can be reasonably linked" rather than "is linked" but I think these concerns still apply). Second, if we use this test, then almost every case we've had of this sort would fail. Frost is mentioned on multiple articles, as are Marsden and Brandt. The only one which wouldnot meet such a test of the examples given above is Brian Peppers and it was questionable whether he met <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> anyways. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I see this as abusable. This will just encourage people to link to an article they create from other articles in which it's only of tangential relevance (if that), and what would stop a person from going through and anonymously <i>unlinking</i> links from several other articles prior to the request? Further, other Wikipedia articles are not valid sources, so it follows that they are also not valid notability indicators. The number, depth, and reliability of <i>outside</i> secondary sources determines a subject's notability. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 21:31, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we just need to be clearer that we are not here to do harm - and harm includes publishing non-notable dirt on people who are notable but are not public figures - or even on more notable people, perhaps, if we are the ones really breaking the news. Your example about someone's affair with the vicar in her youth is a nice one to illustrate the point. And it should not be sufficient that there is some kind of reliable source available. If we have to go to a court record or a local newspaper, or a low-circulations magazine, or whatever, then it is not the case that the damage has already been done. The source may be reliable, but we are <i>doing</i> the damage. If this is all understood, and something is said somewhere in a policy that will be interpreted this way by people with common sense, then that will do the job. Users need to understand that this is not a place for muckraking. Admins need to embrace that idea fully and to be prepared to act on it. I think that this idea would get a lot of support, but also a lot of opposition. But the support might come from respected people, because it really is just common sense. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 14:18, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This issue can already be solved today. If a BLP subject comes to you and asks for their article to be deleted and their notability is questionable, speedy it A7, IAR delete it, prod it, or AFD it - there's no need for an extra policy.</p>
<p>This line kinda scares me - "Objections may only be made on the grounds that the subject is a non-marginal notable public figure, according to reliable published sources". Public figure? Good grief, I could discover a cure for cancer, but I might still keep to myself. That doesn't mean that my article shouldn't be here.</p>
<p>Like some above, I'm afraid that this would just be creating more work for ourselves. We already have mechanisms in place for article deletion. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:41, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a good idea. Because Wikipedia "is not paper", it has become filled with too many articles about people who, frankly, are not particularly notable aside from salacious details about some minor peccadillo or ancient wrong-doing that has no impact whatsoever on the world at large, but a huge impact on them if it suddenly becomes the subject of a Wikipedia article (Wikipedia being a top 10 website). There are 6 billion people in the world, and while they may all be important to their immediate friends, family, and acquaintances, the vast majority are not encyclopedic in any real sense of the world. Writing an article about someone because they local paper happened to publish their DUI conviction is not only a bad idea, but actively harmful. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:20, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't imagine such an article would survive AfD anyway, that's trivial coverage and certainly insufficient for a comprehensive article. I've heard that this happens a lot, but can anyone point to a specific example that hasn't been deleted and has survived an AfD? That's why I'm worried about creep here-it seems our existing deletion policy would <i>already</i> deal with that scenario, we put it up for AfD, we overwhelmingly agree to delete, no problem, no need for a new policy. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 18:32, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no problem with the general principle that a subject's views on whether to have an article on them should be taken into consideration, and that they may on occasion be the deciding factor in a decision to delete. I do have a problem with making that a formal policy, and that is because "marginal notability" is a very difficult and imprecise term. The current policy as drafted makes it no clearer. In effect this puts the subjects of such articles in an impossible position: to claim deletion of their article and their own privacy (as they must see it), they must simultaneously dismiss their own achievements. I think the decision should go to an AfD, and be left to the good sense of the closing administrator. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 19:23, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll second that. Now lets see this form a real world perspective: If a paper, magazine or directory receives a request from a possible hardly notable person to not include them would that be automatically honored? Naturally no. It is up to the editorial conference or author to decide whether to include and or exclude someone from reporting/referencing. The equivalent of an editorial conference is the AfD in Wikipedia (only it works inversely.. it does not decide what goes into the paper, it decides what gets deleted from). On the other hand I cannot but suspect that this is the obvious attempt to change the rules to fit the outcome of a controversial AfD to the liking of some editors. Any attempt to automatically delete because of the request of a subject of an article is equivalent to censorship from the outside. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 20:11, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are a number of problems with this guideline. That this is a speedy/PROD criteria is the first one. AfD should look at these, it guarantees someone else will at least look at the article between the proposal and the deletion.</dd>
<dd>Requiring 100 edits for sufferage is entirely un-necessary and anti-wiki.</dd>
<dd>Restricting what an "objector" might use as a rationale is un-necessary. We cannot and should not predict what kind of objections might come up.</dd>
<dd>Salting to prevent recreation is also un-necessary and prevents a barrier should situations change. A new editor might write an article showing someone is truly notable.</dd>
<dd>The deletion review section boldly declares "if and only if" something has changed about the subject. Wrong! The deleting admin could have made a poor judgment in the first place.</dd>
<dd>What I could get behind would be an addition to some deletion criteria that "courtesy to the subject" is a valid AfD vote. That criteria has been rejected before and making it <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angela_Beesley_9ad5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angela Beesley">guarantees a lot of keep votes</a>.

<p><a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEP</a> wisely advises us to see if a problem can be solved by <i>trimming</i> guidelines or policy rather than expanding them. I believe in this case such a solution is possible, as in:</p>
<p>Generally, a routine DUI wouldn't receive much coverage, unless the person who was caught is already notable anyway. It might receive a short blurb in the local paper. I think a better question to ask would be "If we have articles on people (or any subjects) who are very marginally notable, why is this being allowed at all?" The solution, to me, seems to be to have less policy and guidelines rather then more. Eliminate the secondary notability guidelines (<a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, etc.), and make the sole criterion for inclusion that sufficient source material exists for a <i>comprehensive</i> article on the subject. Obviously, "Jack Crack got arrested for a DUI in Sometown, Somewhere" is not a comprehensive article, so if that's all we've got secondary sources for, it's gone regardless. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 21:48, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would have to apply only to living people; you'd be surprised how little information is available on, say, your average 13th century monk. But ok, maybe their uncomprehensive bio should just be in a footnote to another article, but of course, if they are mentioned in more than one article, you don't want to have to maintain multiple footnotes. That should apply to living people as well (which is why I still like the meta-notability idea). Do we have a definition for <i>comprehensive</i>? Especially given that there is no <a href="../../../d/e/a/WP%7EDEADLINE_f5b5.html" title="WP:DEADLINE">WP:DEADLINE</a>? I can see how you can have a comprehensive article about <i>carbon</i>; I'm not sure this concept has been defined for a <i>person</i>. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 22:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC) <small>hmmm... shouldn't <a href="../../../d/e/a/WP%7EDEADLINE_f5b5.html" title="WP:DEADLINE">WP:DEADLINE</a> link to something?</small>

<dd>Well, in the case of a person, comprehensiveness should include, at minimum, information about that person, what contributions (positive or negative) that person has made to h(is|er) field and society as a whole, what others have had to say, what lasting effects that has had, and so on and so on. (And no, I'm up for it applying to everything, applying different guidelines to different areas leads to systemic bias. If there's not enough source material for a comprehensive article on a 13th century monk, we shouldn't have that article.) It is true that <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETIND_80d6.html" title="WP:TIND">there is no deadline</a>, and we certainly should never delete an article based on the fact that it is <i>not now</i> comprehensive.

<p>Ok, first: For our purposes we will define a subject to be marginally notable if it has fewer than 5 indepedent, non-trivial reliable sources focusing on the topic (5 was choosen as an arbitrary number, not too large not too small, seems about right. Could be adjusted if necessary). Any person who is in that category can request the deletion of their article in which case it will be listed with a special type of prod template, maybe {{prod-subject}}. Anyone may remove the special prod if they find sufficient sources to make the article not marginally notable. Two important exceptions: 1) anyone who has run for public office may not do this (since you've essentially stated that you want to be a public figure) 2) Anyone who has given an extensive interview with a reliable newsource about a topic for which they are notable for may not do this(if you were willing to be interviewed by Salon or the NYT, again that is a strong sign that one is willingly being a public figure).

<dd>Don't like it. For some subjects there may only be one or two big "reliable sources" but plenty of non-reliable ones. In which case, we don't use the information from the non-reliable sources but they obviously show the notability of the person. That's a problem I'm faced with a lot. I first look online for information on something, and find a ton of unreliable junk - but it all says similar stuff. Later I'll do the deep research using Factiva or whatever and find usable original source material.

<p>This is no good, Joshua, for one simple reason. A person might have appeared in the press for some minor thing a few years back, and that story might have been reflected across many newspapers. However, it's only one thing, one element in their life, and then they are back to relative obscurity. They easily pass your criterion though. It's a lot easier to write criteria for what we consider "notable" and work from there. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Instead of a new policy we could make a new guideline allowing any person referenced in Wikipedia the right to demand an AfD in which he/she can explain the reasons for non-inclusion. These reasons are the only object of discussion during this special AfD. The outcome of this AfD can be <b>Keep</b>, <b>Delete</b> or <b>Remove personal information</b>. Articles with the latter consensus are to be tagged prohibiting an addition of personal information and locked to edits of non-registered and non-established editors. Editors not abiding by the rule face administrative measures. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 23:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not think any proposal with numerical rules such as this would be likely to gain general consensus. I have the following particular objections:</p>
<ol>
<li>72 hours is a shorter time than other WP deletions except speedy. Many editors edit weekly.</li>
<li>100 edits is apparently a way to keep out single purpose accounts. It will just lead to their sophistication. W can detect such accounts easily enough from the edit history.</li>
<li>specific majorities or supermajorities at Afd or DelRev are wrong in principle. They are not votes. They great any rate not supposed to be votes. The WP community spent a very long time in getting the vote nature of VfD changed. True, such discussion do show some traces of voting, in that closure against an overwhelming majority of the valid statements is usually not attempted. But closure is always justified on the basis that the arguments of one side or the other has the stronger arguments, not the most people there that day. Especially considering the nature of some of the questions here, attempts at canvassing <i>voters</i> will always be made.</li>
<li>We already have rules about not including dates of birth for living people in most cases, especially if against their objections. Similarly for race &amp; religion &amp; marital status, unless truly relevant, which they sometimes are--especially marital status.</li>
<li>We already do not include info from non-reliable sources with particular care in BLP, but debates often turn into a qy. of how reliable a source may be, &amp; this would continue.</li>
</ol>
<p>More generally, the reasonable use of BLP challenges is against individual articles on particular people who were victims of newsworthy crimes, or to whom unfortunate things happened. But there tend to be two problems: often the event is known by their name, and often the name is so notably connected with the event by widespread media coverage that it is futile. The first problem cannot be overcome--we must call things by the names in general use. For the second, a clear understanding that media coverage in this case is not a reason to give unwanted additional publicity. In practice, articles are already often deleted on that ground.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A less reasonable use is the attempt by evildoers of various stripes to suppress accounts of their deeds. Here the present status is all that is needed---a respect for the laws of libel, and a relatively strict understanding of what is sufficiently notable--we already do both. Anything more is censorship.</dd>
<dd>Another unreasonable use is the attempt by various public personalities to remove mention of things they are now ashamed of. The acceptability of this obviously depends upon the relative degree of notability , and the importance of the event. Very little in the life of a candidate for major political office is or should be private, and this is generally recognized. How far this goes to lesser figures must necessarily be a matter for discussion each time. Many people try this, but its a matter of editing, and they should not be allowed to remove an entire article on the grounds the edit disputes are so severe that the practical thing to do is suppress the article entirely.</dd>
<dd><i>but the least acceptable use is suppress controversy</i>. We have seen enough of this in the attempted arguments that various critics of WP are not N, or that the errors of well known WP figures are not N--arguments totally against common sense. Yet even now they sometimes carry the day. The last thing we need is anything to further encourage such self-censorship. This policy is a move in the wrong direction. I urge not merely lack of consensus, but rejection. I still take not censored seriously--it is the basic principle by which honesty ins demonstrated. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Quite often, material on marginally notable people could equally well be merged into the articles on the topics for which they are notable. That could be accomplished without losing any information, while still respecting requests for privacy to an extent. Right now, for example, there's absolutely no need for an article on Essjay, since the information is already present elsewhere. Yet, it looks like we'll have one, because people think it's a matter of principle. However, I have the sense that some of these would not object to a guideline favoring mergism. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 05:27, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But then you have to potentially maintain the information in multiple places. That's ignoring the whole point of being able to embed <a href="../../../u/r/l/Url.html" title="Url">hot links</a>, so multiple articles can link out to a central article about a subtopic. -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKendrick7_a50a.html" title="User talk:Kendrick7">talk</a></sup> 06:38, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not necessarily. Just maintain in each article the aspects that are relevant to each article. Google Watch doesn't need to know that Brandt had issues with the draft, or what Brandt's birthdate is. There are at best very weak economies of scale in having a central article for marginal people, my guess is it actually complicates matters by inviting essentially irrelevant detail. I've never noticed Wikipedia to have the slightest concern whatsoever about efficiency anyway. If hot links are considered important (and remember we're talking about marginally notable people), I suppose one could always keep a stub article with an index of references to the person. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 01:23, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many stubs of the marginally notable have no potential for growth, which just means that the detail in question is probably irrelevant and shouldn't be on WP anyways. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 02:49, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I think we need is one or more good <i><b>essays</b></i> to explain when and why some editors believe that the wishes of the subject is relevant. I think the strongest consensus that we have at present is that in some cases, the wishes of the subject is <b>a</b> factor to use in deciding whether or not to delete (not the sole factor). But I don't think there is any consensus currently, or likely to form soon, about when it is relevant, when it would tip the balance, et. cetera. Having one or more such essays, seeing where they are used, and whether or not those usages are supported by the general AFD community, will allow us to guage better what is likely to represent consensus. I personally believe that this page is doomed to not gain consensus in the next several months. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:59, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, I want to applaud SlimVirgin for taking a bold and appropriate stand on this issue. I'm 100% on board.</p>
<p>I think the Deletion Review criteria (2/3 majority to overturn) should not be so specific. DRV can figure out for themselves whether the deletion was done out of process. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 17:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Though well-intentioned, this looks like it would substantially change the balance of how things are done. This is the kind of proposal I'd expect to see if Wikipedia were in a dire emergency, with the current policies in desperate need of a major overhall. But on the whole, it seems like thinks are going pretty well-- I haven't bumped into any problems that would merit such a drastic change.</p>
<p>72 hours is a short time frame-- I expect most pages would get deleted without people even noticing. Most disturbing, however, is the presumption in favor of deletion--- where any significant dispute would keep the article deleted. On top of this, we have additional limit that would prevent even a review unless the situation has changed.</p>
<p>I think that in practice, this policy would devolve into "Any admin can delete any biography at any time, and unless the admin is <i>way</i> out of line, the page is going to stay deleted, end of story." --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlecmconroy_3761.html" title="User:Alecmconroy">Alecmconroy</a> 23:22, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see that it's a problem at all. If we agree that articles on nobodies are dispensable in principle, their being deleted is not something to cry over anyway.

<p>Maybe we could put the arrogance to one side and consider how Wikipedia looks to the nobody who finds an article on them in here that focuses on the small bad thing that got them into the papers a few years back. The subject of some article finds that they are immortalised in the "encyclopaedia" that comes up first in most searches on Google for some small thing that they did a few years back. "That's not me," they think. But they can't make the article into a fair representation of themselves because the newspapers didn't write about their charity work, or about how much they love their kids, or about their neat party trick. Nor does the article discuss their important life's work, because their work hasn't been considered broadly important enough to feature in the mainstream press. It's just that tax thing from a few years back, or whatever.</p>
<p>Maybe there is no small thing. Maybe the nobody in question simply does not want to be in here. Their view of their own "notability" might not square with ours.</p>
<p>The thing is, we're not enriching the encyclopaedia by having that article. It's astonishing to me that we argue at the same time that having articles about garage punk bands who haven't been signed is harmful but having them about very minor figures whose article upsets them is a good thing.</p>
<p>I can't see this ever having sufficient support though because, frankly, too many contributors simply will not do what I suggested up front and put the arrogance to one side. We have no conception of how Wikipedia affects outsiders. When they come here and complain, we treat them like dogshit. We throw rules and policies at them, and make out that if they do not grasp the rules and policies, <i>they</i> are at fault, not us. In the most notorious case, that of Daniel Brandt, our treatment of him has been shocking. I'm not a fan of Brandt's, and his behaviour has been bad too (although he's not making a pretence of basing his approach in kindness), and I at first thought we should keep the article, but there simply has not been an acknowledgement that <i>he has been hurt</i>. We should not be in the business of hurting feelings. It's not "our way or fuck off". That should never be our approach to the outside world.</p>
<p>As for deciding whether someone is marginally notable, this is a red herring. We can use judgement. We can ask, would anyone <i>really</i> miss this? Correctly identifying the standing of the complainant is more important (in the Peppers case, people <i>posing</i> as his family got the article deleted) because having nobodies' enemies delete their articles against their wishes would get tiresome pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So I commend SlimVirgin on the notion -- an excellent one -- but I fear it won't come to pass short of some determined action from Jimbo or the arbcom. I won't be holding my breath as I wait for that. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 04:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>sorry to tell you, but most of us are not really against removing someones article, we are against that articles get removed per <i>ordre de mufti</i>.

<dd>Exactly. Now yeah, if all a person did was commit a crime that ended up in a local paper, I'll be the first delete&#160;!vote at AfD. Why? Because <i>that's not enough source material for a comprehensive article</i>. But instead of all this, let's worry about tightening notability/inclusion <i>across the board</i>. If only a small amount of independent source material exists about something, we cannot possibly present a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">balanced</a> picture of it. However, this guideline, rather than properly addressing the problem across the board and across all subjects, takes only one facet and goes too far. Especially given that supposedly Brandt would be deleted under this-how is that possible? There is <i>tons</i> of published, reliable material about Daniel Brandt. Much of that is his own doing. He started websites, made every effort to publicize them, made no secret of the fact that he was their creator and owner, and publicized his findings on the government websites in addition to Google and Wikipedia. After the news media took notice, he happily granted them interviews, <i>choosing</i> to place himself in the public eye. But once you choose to place yourself in the public eye, you can't then choose just to claim you're "not a public figure" when you don't like a particular aspect of the scrutiny. It just doesn't work like that. By the time there's <i>that</i> much source material on someone, either that person has voluntarily tried or chosen to make a public figure of h(im|er)self, or it has happened to such an extensive degree already that we are not contributing much to the situation.</dd>
<dd>So, to sum up-let's work the problem across the board, lack of enough sourcing for a comprehensive article could be a problem in <i>any</i> area. This proposal only addresses one area, and takes it way too far. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 15:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
