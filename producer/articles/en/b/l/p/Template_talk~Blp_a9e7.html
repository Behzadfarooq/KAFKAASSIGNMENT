<p>I really don't see the benefit of adding the image.

<p>Is it really necessary to have a sketch of two naked bodies? Because they are nude, the picture implies that the article might somehow be about human physiology; unless the article is about a porn star, a person's life takes place mostly in the mind, and usually fully clothed. If a picture is necessary at all (is it?), a better picture would be a picture of faces, which connotes more of the person rather than the human body. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:48, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's the NASA image of human beings that was sent into space. It's known universally and therefore I felt it was appropriate.

<dd>Yes. But it was about what humans look like, directed toward another type of life form, not about biographies and living people. The image just doesn't seem related to the tag, and looks bizarre. The whole plaque really wasn't designed for normal human use, with the hyperfine structure based units and so on. The faces idea might be more appropriate if one wants to emphasize that one is dealing with an article about a real person with feelings. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 00:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was actually in the process of attempting to find an image when SlimVirgin beat me to it. I thought it was great. Since so many are objecting, how about another image that somehow fits the message, something related to kindness and the Golden Rule? An image is an important eye-catcher. Without it the text box just gets drowned among all the other text on a page. Is there somewhere here at Wikipedia where one can check out all the images that are already approved for use here? -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 17:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I liked it too, but for some reason others didn't, so Fyslee thought of the handshake instead. I think it shouldn't be so long and thin, because that causes it to merge in with the other tags, and it needs to stand out, so I adjusted it so that the first line ends with "biographies of living persons." Fyslee and Dreadlocke, do you still see the image overlap thing with it at this size? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:15, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>The size of the image was tolerable, as long as it doesn't inflate the template vertically to a size beyond what the text alone would produce. However, the image chosen turns out to have been not public domain, but a copyrighted stock photo, so it's not allowed. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 00:59, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And other people objected to it, pointing out a variety of implications that detract from the point this template tries to make. I realize people want to slap a picture on every little template for some reason, but the choices are often poorly suited to illustrate the message. The image is a symbol of human form, perhaps, but that's not really what the template is getting at. The salient issue is that these people are <i>living</i>, which is relegated to the background or not apparent at all from the pictures chosen so far (a drawing, alive?). A quick way to illustrate the concept isn't necessarily easy, but something like a newborn baby would come a lot closer to getting the point across, I think. Those who see many of our complaints from affected parties might also sympathize with the implication that there's a lot of unwarranted wailing involved. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'd guess some people would be disturbed by the religious aspect of the image, just as others didn't like the frank nudity of the Pioneer plaque. Rather than offend people unnecessarily, I'd go with the two girls. Youthfulness is a decent way to communicate being alive, so that's probably the best choice of those I've seen so far. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 16:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FoN, what is the problem with the formatting? Every time you change it, people complain about image overlap problems. This is the size and format that seemed to fix it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:06, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I put the image in a separate table cell. I don't see how it's possible for it to be overlapping the text. Floating the image within the same cell could cause the last line of the text to appear underneath the image, which should be avoided.</p>
<p>Hmm... I knew internet explorer was bad, but not that bad...

<dd>I think the handshake image is excellent, myself. A handshake is a symbol of trustworthiness, which is why it gets used by banks and insurance companies. It emphasizes that we are fair dealers and should behave politely, especially with a living subject. A static person icon could be acceptable, but I don't think it would create the same impression. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 19:43, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It also emphasises that we are white males who like to shake hands. Is that what's intended? I think it's a nonsense graphic added for lack of anything better. A biography has nothing to do with a shaking hands. A <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handshake.html" title="Handshake">handshake</a> isn't a <i>symbol</i> of trustworthiness (albeit, it may be a demonstrator to promote trust by not carrying weapons) -- it's generally a symbol of greeting or agreement.--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 06:23, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, that's precisely the problem, that handshake looks like two white male bankers or insurance executives who have just completed a rapacious deal to repossess every car in South America, or something like that. It creeps me out. There's tons of "people" and "people icon" pictures on commons, why not just use one? Here's a few that I like but there's plenty more.

<p>I don't understand what a b/w picture of two girls has to do with biographies of living persons. I noticed that this picture was taken in 1943. It's unclear who these girls are or if they are still living people. A picture of a long dead pioneer would be equally inappropriate as would the picture of Adam as this is not a theology template. What was wrong with the original icon? (P.S. I found the Lorenzo Lamas picture particularly amusing!) -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 13:18, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reason I prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Blp&amp;oldid=67093934" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Blp&amp;oldid=67093934" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Blp&amp;oldid=67110827" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Blp&amp;oldid=67110827" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> is that the former seems more inviting and accessible to non-Wikipedians. Saying that <i>you</i> should edit is different from saying that an <i>editor</i> should edit. Consider the use case of people unfamiliar with wikis who come upon a libellous article about themselves. They may take "editor" to mean a traditional <a href="../../../m/a/n/Managing_editor.html" title="Managing editor">managing editor</a>. Going into technicalities about things such as the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> seems distracting for the same reason.

<dd>We have this situation now where biographies of controversial people (e.g. major politicians) are turning into hagiographies. The necessity of getting rid of unsourced negative stuff is obvious; but it's extremely difficult to also get rid of unsourced positive stuff and have anything left. The result is the NPOV of these articles is getting clobbered. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> is (or was; I haven't looked at it lately) an extremely closely sourced bio that I like to cite as an example, but the amount of work it took to do it must have been insane. I don't have any answer to this tension between BLP and NPOV. And now we've got this arbcom decision coming (Hunger Project) that currently proposes to extend the BLP principles to businesses as well as people.

<p>The current text of the template says unsourced materials must be removed immediately. Several times I included some materials which I knew from personal contact or some now unavailable source.

<p>The correct spelling is "Libelous", with one "L". The rule is that the final consonant should be doubled, only if when pronounced, the accent is on the final syllable.

</ul>
<p>My suggestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Unsourced or poorly sourced, and especially potentially <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander_and_libel.html" title="Slander and libel">libellous</a>, material ...."</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that all libelous material, whether potential or not, should be kept out of Wikipedia, unless extremely well-sourced with the highest quality sources available. If such sources can be found, then it has already been proven to be true and it isn't libelous anymore, but is proven fact, which just makes it very negative material that can be included. Until a court or reliable third party source makes that decision, it's original research and an editor pushing a libelous opinion designed to damage the subject involved, which is very unwikipedian, but is a common occurrence here.</p>
<p>I believe this position is in keeping with the spirit embodied in this Jimbo Wales' quote:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Real people are involved, and they can be hurt by your words. We are not tabloid journalism, we are an encyclopedia." <sup id="_ref-Jimbo2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jimbo2" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>We simply need to place more emphasis on keeping potentially libelous material out of Wikipedia, and we can do that by strategically placing the comma. -- Fyslee 12:15, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think this is quite right. We of course want everything in every article to be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a>, but we surely do not remove every unsourced fact from every article. With the comma at present, the phrase means to suggest that <i>unsourced or poorly sourced</i> material must be removed, and I don't think that's what we mean. Only that information that is both poorly sourced and potentially libellous (to be sure, as Fyslee notes, one can generally say that that which is sourced is necessarily not libellous, but that's certainly not something about which we can be categorically sure) is, consistent with BLP, to be removed; the present version does not convey the necessary duality. Although I'm not certain why the commaless formulation was insufficiently clear (I gather that the objection is as to its not prominently emphasizing the concern as to libellous material), I would imagine that a formulation superior to that at present might be <i>Potentially libellous material that is not properly sourced</i>. The modifier in the present version, in any case, is not properly placed. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 15:57, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was my feeling too - that we increase the scope of what must be removed regardless of 3RR beyond just the libellous to anything which is unsourced. "Potentially libellous material that is not properly sourced" is better, but perhaps not tough enough.

<p>Right now clicking on the word "libellous" takes you to the rather thorough article on libel. Someone who is just adding stuff isn't going to take the time to look up the definition there. I propose that a brief one-line definition of libel be added to the BLP. Something like "Libel: an untrue or unproven statement that may cause defamation of an individual" or something like that (the wording would have to be worked on, or perhaps lifted from the libel article). I just think asking editors to go off-page might be a bit less efficient than simply stating out right that this is what we mean by libel. Just a thought. Otherwise I think it's a good idea, although still open to interpretation in terms of what constitutes a "poor source". <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image should have some context relating to biographies of living people. A handshake, two girls, or a long dead pioneer do not. Someone earlier on this talk page mentioned that the image of two girls might not look appropriate on talk pages of murderers of children.

<dd>It's a 'generic icon' for one. But I guess people would object (and already have) over the fact that it's nude. I would prefer an image at least where you can't identify the people in it.

<p>I too don't like the "two girls" image. Both for technical and aesthetic reasons. The technical reasons is that it looks awful at thumbnail size. Anything that is intentionally going to be used at thumbnail size should be altered to reflect that. At the moment, the picture works well when you se it full size, but at thumbnail size it just looks creepy. The girl on the left looks like she is upset about something, while the girl on the right looks like she has just spotted something. And the hand on the shoulder looks strange as well. This is just a classic case of a picture being used outside of its original context. It quite clearly was never intended to do anything other than illustrate two girls at an inter-racial summer camp (or something).</p>
<p>But I've also been told that I should suggest something to replace it. So I thought an image of a heart would be a good idea (all living people have hearts, right?). The best thing I could find at the moment is <a href="../../../h/e/a/Image%7EHeart1.PNG_93d8.html" title="Image:Heart1.PNG">Image:Heart1.PNG</a>.</p>
<p>The number and the Xs could be removed, or even replaced with the letters <b>B</b> - <b>L</b> - <b>P</b>? But maybe someone can come up with something better. In any case, I suggest a <i>heart icon</i> is used as the image on this template. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:53, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>None of the images call forth the notion of the sort of people likely to have biographies in Wikipedia. Maybe some sort of group scene would do it. Also desirable is for the image to call forth some sort of notion that you should be careful in dealing with biographies of living people. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 03:28, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Do you seriously think <i>any</i> image is likely to be able to "call forth the notion of the sort of [living] people likely to have biographies in Wikipedia"? Wikipedia is too broad for that. Which is why I think a generic heart image is the best of the lot, and waiting around for something better would not help. And wanting the image to shout "be careful - don't libel people"? Well, that is even more unlikely to happen. In fact, just dropping the idea of an image altogether might be best. A symbolic logo, word, or group of letters would be better than a random picture of two girls that is now plastered over 10s of 1000s of pages for no real good reason. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 09:22, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Would you believe I'd completely missed that!&#160;:-) Anyway, even if heart is not completely humanly generic, what can be used to symbolise humans and living? I'd still favour some abstract design being used, rather than a picture of two girls who may still be alive and not be happy about their picture being used in this way (I know, they can't do anything about it, but that goes against the spirit of the whole BLP project). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:01, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Please, change this "Two Girls" abomination to anything: Pioneer plaque, fine, though I think for a Biography Project it would be better to use an image of an old, leather-bound book with some press guilding and some silhouette that would offend no one: Beethoven's, Newton's, Aristotle's, you name it. I find "Two Girls" image so offensive that I am ready to blow the top and start a vandal war over it, and that's not really in my character. The problem is, this image is a racially motivated imposition of certain ideology that I despise. Human beings should be regarded strictly on their individual merits, without classifying them by race. Race-based political correctness is a racism, painful to anybody who has been persecuted on the basis of their ethnicity -- inverted racism, granted, but still a racism. Like those questions about your race in government's questionnaires. If they are skin-color blind, why do they care what my race is? The same with this "Two Girls" photograph.

<p>I suggest using a generic icon (such as a heart icon) that does not depict potentially living people (ie. not the "two girls" picture). This will avoid potential problems that would be embarassing for a project trying to avoid that sort of problem! Also, a generic image avoids accusations of the image representing only certain types of people (children, white, males, western, etc). A heart icon is neutral and suitable for representing living people (all living people have hearts). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 22:14, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the Bush idea. That he IS "polarizing" to some editors makes his image a particularly good one for the BLP logo: a central principle of BLP is that editors need to restrain themselves when commenting on negative aspects of living persons.

<dd>There are legitimate complaints against the use of the "two girls" image. Please read '<i>all</i> of the above discussions, rather than focus on one aaspect of the discussion. Though for what it is worth, I don't see the point of trying to represent all ethnicities in one picture. Or even one or two. That is just silly. And there is the valid point that the image was taken at an "inter-racial" camp - which in itself, IMO, makes the image too sensitive to use on such a widespread template. My opinion, stated below, is that even having a living person on the template is not ideal: (a) they will eventually die and the logo will need updating - why store up that hassle for future editors; (b) the widespread use of this template makes even use of free images somewhat suspect. The use of this image is more like using someone's picture in an advertising campaign, as a symbol of something. IMO, Bush and others would have legitimate reason to object to their image being used in this way. Just because an image is free, doesn't mean that it can be used indiscriminately for any use at all. IMO, a generic artwork logo is the only safe way to go. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:36, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That will look awful at thumbnail size (see example at right - in the Blp template, the picture was displayed at 100px size). Remember that an image seen at full-screen size may look wonderful, but can then look awful if viewed as a small thumnail. It will be very difficult for people to recognise that it is a crowd of people. Also, the idea of "finding the first free image I could find on WP" is great as a short-term solution, but is not acceptable as a long term solution. It should not be difficult to find someone willing to do a generic, conceptual artwork and release the image for use on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 11:29, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, too am puzzled by the unreasoned outcry against the girls. I don't like 'em because they don't seem to have anything to do with BLP. If we find a good image, it can do a lot to drive home the message of the policy. I like the idea, expressed above, of an image with two "controversial" and widely-known people in it. Maybe Bush and the Iranian president. Whoever the two would be, an editor with art skills could make an appropriate combined image. It needs to be small, yet convey the ideas of BLP. This is NOT a big job for one with the right skills. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 17:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>So, obviously biased people like Gamaliel decide now, which objection is legitimate, and which is not? Where Wikipedia has come to? Personal recollections of a Gulag prisoner would be considered "POV," while sunny reports about successes of Stalinism from <i>Pravda</i> are OK, "published source," as long as some self-appointed "editor" in Florida is politically infrared? I agree 100% with what Peter1968 wrote to Gamaliel on Talk: Jack Vance page: "You guys (administrators, super-active Wikipedia addicts, template inventors, bored individuals, etc) seem hell-bent on converting Wikipedia from being an encyclopedia editable and readable by anyone, into some sort of esoteric cross-referenced morass of hypercomplexity. Every day I come to contribute to this admittedly well-intentioned website, there's some new template, some new project, some new policy (usually arcane and for the benefit of the person who quotes it), some new shortcut, some funkified userbar or some such. It's gone beyond a joke. The KISS principle pass you guys by, did it? You do know what you're succeeding at with all these shortcuts, templates and cross-references, don't you? You're turning people off from contributing by purposeful obfuscation." Arvin Sloane 17:44, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever image is used, it should suggest the topic. It probably needs to be small, but maybe not. Somebody with art skills needs to work on it. A crowd picture isn't too bad, but fails to suggest individual articles. A multiple-person image might be good; it should include images of people whose articles have had, or might have, BLP problems. It might also include an image that would signify "anybody else"--see "Unknown Living Person" above. IMHO those who are focusing on race and gender are very much off the track, unless they've seen or created BLP violations having to do with those subjects.</dd>

<p>I earlier proposed a change to an earlier version of the template, which has since been improved. There is still a matter I'd like to see included in the template because it is confusing to some editors. They claim that it only applies to the article, and I can see their point. Here's the relevant part of the current version:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This article must adhere .....Negative material, especially if potentially libelous, must be removed immediately if it is unsourced or poorly sourced."</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not make it clear that anything other than the article itself is included in the policy. Here is a suggested improvement (<b>old</b> parts in bold):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>This article must adhere to the biographies of living persons policy as it directly concerns one or more living people. Negative material, especially if potentially libelous, must be removed immediately if it is unsourced or poorly sourced.</b> This applies to <b>all</b> articles and talk pages. <b>The three-revert rule does not apply to such removals. Concerns relative to this policy can be addressed on the living persons biographies noticeboard.</b></li>

<dl>
<dd>"These principles also apply to biographical material about living persons in other articles."</dd>

<p>I have rearranged the clauses in the sentence "Negative material, especially if potentially libelous, <b>must be removed immediately</b> if it is unsourced or poorly sourced". The new sentence reads "Negative material that is unsourced or poorly sourced <b>must be removed immediately</b>, especially if potentially libelous". The meaning is the same, but clarifies that it is not negative material per se that is a problem, but unsourced negative material. Also, by moving the reference to libel to the end, we remove the implication that unsourced though non-libelous negativity is somehow tolerable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBucketsofg_e5d0.html" title="User talk:Bucketsofg">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bucketsofg_1a3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bucketsofg">contribs</a>) 21:06, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>This template needs an edit to mention 3RR, I think. As far as 3RR enforcement is concerned, we have <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html#Reverting_potentially_libellous_material" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR#Reverting_potentially_libellous_material</a>, which sez <i>All users are encouraged to remove unsourced or poorly sourced blatantly defamatory, potentially libellous information about living persons, whether within a biography of a living person or elsewhere, including associated talk pages. As with vandalism, the repeated addition of such material is best dealt with by blocking and page protection, and repeated reversion should be used only as a last resort. Reverts made to enforce this provision are generally not considered contentious, because they are necessary. However, it can be easy to confuse removing potentially libellous material with an edit war over neutrality issues, which are contentious edits. Err on the side of caution: do not repeatedly remove material you consider defamatory unless it is blatant, and seek intervention from others early at Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard.</i> I think it very desirable that the template includes some mention of not breaking 3RR; or a ref to taht section <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>This just encourages repeated reverting. There is no reason to do this; if someone is repeatedly adding libellous information, an administrator needs to be contacted to either block the user or protect the page (which might warrant additional mention, though this should be part of the purpose of the BLP noticeboard). As a matter of policy, users who repeatedly revert to remove libellous information should not be blocked, but that does not mean that reverting should be favored over more successful, lasting, less disruptive solutions to libel problems. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 23:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must have missed a change in the policy. When the who BLP thing started, I thought it had been determined that 3RR does not apply in the case of removing libel, etc.? If there has been a change, adding some link to a page explaining the actual rule might be helpful. (It's possible the noticeboard contains this information, but most users won't go hunting for it; better to make a direct link to the current rule). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no change in the policy, but there is no need to encourage revert warring in the template the appears on every one of the talk pages. In any case, the proper course of action if libellous statements are repeatedly inserted is to report it to the appropriate noticeboard; it would be bad to penalize someone for zealously removing libellous statements, but nevertheless repeatedly reverting does not ultimately solve the libel problem. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 00:48, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies "to biographical material about living persons in other articles." If use of Template BLP were limited to biographies, then Template BLP would read something like "This biography must adhere to the policy on biographies of living persons" or "This article related to living persons must adhere to the policy on biographies of living persons" However, template BLP states "This article must adhere to the policy on biographies of living persons" and thus placement of the BLP template is not restricted by topic. {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}} has a parameter to {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}} where someone can add living=yes and the text of the BLP template appears. In reviewing this (see <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBanjee_b3b3.html#WP:BLP" title="Talk:Banjee">Talk:Banjee#WP:BLP</a>, I discovered that use of Template BLP on other than biography topics is not expressly part of the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Templates" title="WP:BLP">BLP guideline templates section</a>, but the overall BLP guideline seems to permit it. However, since every article potentially could include biographical material about living persons, template BLP potentially could be placed on the talk page of every article. On the other end of the issue, restricting template BLP to only article having biography topics makes template BLP useless since {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}} already serves that function. The answer may be somewhere in the middle. I think if we have a discussion on the impact of using template BLP, we may be able to derive guidance on using template BLP on other than biography articles.
