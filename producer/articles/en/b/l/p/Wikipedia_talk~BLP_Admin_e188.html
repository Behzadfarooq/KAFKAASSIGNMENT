<dd>Yes, it could be litigious, via <i>overall effect</i>. The sum total of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is not satisfied by simple adherence to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, although it is is a very common misconception among Wikipedians that it does. Often, problematic issues can be more nuanced but problematic just the same. For example, say a biography (or more properly, something under the guise of a biography) contains numerous sentences explaining the person generally, but the rest of the article is little other than a slugfest of controversies and criticisms, placed in by primarily that person's critics. In this case, <i>and even if each item is properly cited</i>, <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue weight</a> is the concern - and an undue weight problem <i>is</i> a BLP problem. Another example is often found in the sections on the subject's viewpoints and beliefs. When a subject's views are expressed <i>primarily from the perspective of his or her critics</i>, even if properly cited, this violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and as such it too is a BLP problem. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 00:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, we cannot prove it. It is by simple affirmation. However, if push comes to shove and something ends up in court, could it be that the BLP Admin involved will be called to take the stand?

<dd>Why the relatively redundant requirement of "twenty-five and a bachelor's degree"?

<p>Interesting proposal. A few comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you show any correlation between education and age, and maturity on wikipedia?</li>
<li>Rather than have BLP Admin as parallel to Admin, why not have BLP Admin after standard adminship so BLP Admins are a subset of standard Admins?</li>
<li>What exactly do you mean by "rapidly enforce his or her removal of potentially litigious content" that can't be done by admins now?</li>

<p>This seems extremely infeasible to me. How would "BLP admins" be distinguished from regular admins in terms of user rights? In order to create a new user class, a developer would have to add it, and even if that did happen, they wouldn't have many more abilities than a regular user. Very few of the things in this proposal are anything a regular user can't do, actually, except for the enforcement of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, "even against consensus". <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and OFFICE/OTRS are enough, this is excessive. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#3399FF">desat</font></a></b> 03:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Absolutely and completely unnecessary. There's no reason to privilege specific editors with powers and create additional stratification; anyone should be able to edit articles to comply with BLP on sight, and call on an admin or dispute resolution if someone's being disruptive or repeatedly violating policy. We already have <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a> and OTRS to handle people's issues with their biographies, and sensitive things like that should remain official. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 03:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I second this view. Between <a href="../../../o/f/f/WP%7EOFFICE_66ac.html" title="WP:OFFICE">WP:OFFICE</a>, OTRS, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_9928.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography">Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography</a> and the work of countless admins and other editors, this proposal is unnecessary. Judging from the recent controversy over BLP deletions, I think attention should be focused more on clarifying the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policies. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agne27_bd48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agne27"><sup>Cheese</sup></a>/<a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27"><sup>Wine</sup></a> 04:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As indicated in the proposal, "BLP Admins who find their focus changing should promptly resign from the position and/or seek installment as a general administrator." Should one fail to do this, "BLP Admins may be recalled from their position at anytime through a 75% supermajority of votes by general administrators and BLP administrators, collected over seven days." We have thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands 9amyone know exactly how many?) BLPs. The status-quo is largely passive about them, leaving potentially litigious content remain. This proposal creates an active role. Part of the idea is to prevent OFFICE from having to get calls each day! <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 04:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Fragmentation of admins by "specialty" does not strike me as necessarily a good thing. All admins have responsibility to enforce all policies. This proposal would slice out WP:BLP-related decisions from a "regular" admin's responsibilities. It does so while giving the new "super-admins" no new powers or capabilities. This creates a false hierarchy that will not be healthy for Wikipedia.<br />
On the specifics of the proposal, I disagree with the underlying premise. I believe that <i>all</i> admins should have an "exceptional knowledge of the Wikipedia policy" and should demonstrate maturity. Neither of those are guaranteed by being the author of a biography, being older than 25 or holding a bachelors degree.<br />
This proposal also ignores the natural evolution of our volunteer editors to shift the focus of their activities as their interests and experiences shift. For our volunteers, this is a natural and usually gradual shift. It is unreasonable to expect that someone will volunteer with this kind of sole focus and then remember to tell you when they change their mind. We are volunteers. We are not paid and are under no obligations to continue editing in any role. This proposal assumes that the new BLP-admins will want to stay in that role for a significant period of time. I do not believe that assumption will prove true. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wow! So if there is a content dispute, then we should just banish anybody who doesn't conform to your idea. Seriously, are you kidding? If there is a content dispute, then requesting a page lock with the material that is not offending is good enough. Admins are not perfect and there are some admins out there who are probably no more intelligent than some editors.

<p>There is no admin DNA that makes an admin smarter than any other user. Being an admin on Wikipedia is nothing more than a realization that someone can be trusted with a few extra buttons. There's no reason to create a position unless there are technical reasons to do so.</p>
<p>Any user can remove libel from an article. Anyone has the authority, right now, today, to enforce the removal of poorly sourced, negative information from an article. If you aren't an admin, you may not have the power to enforce it via a block or protect, but you do have the authority. Anyone has the authority, right now, to patrol articles about living people or <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLPN_8a63.html" title="WP:BLPN">WP:BLPN</a>. Unfortunately, I've gotten away from going through it regularly, but for a while, I was one of a very few who were going through <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLPN_8a63.html" title="WP:BLPN">WP:BLPN</a> and responding to issues. Anyone, right now, can discuss with a living person issues he or she is having with their article.</p>
<p>The whole thing about Wikipedia is that you can edit this page right now. With rare exception, anyone can help out in any way. All adminship is is reserving certain high-risk buttons for those who are trusted. But any user can and should be free to contribute in any way they can.</p>
<p>Because there are no special buttons for BLP Admins, there is no reason to create a special class for them. If you want to help out with BLP issues, just do it! --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>One</i> removal of BLP offending material by an editor must typically be defended for many, many, many, many hours - yes, days. And then two weeks later it all start again. Do that with just three or four articles and you are ready to forever end your career doing it. On the other hand, one removal by an admin and the matter is usually over. How is leaving this to editors a good idea? Plus we have a ga-zillion BLPs probably never even once evaluated for violations of WP:BLP, and an admin-to-BLP article ratio of, what, some minuscule decimal to ten thousand? <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 04:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(Edit conflict * 3) Yes, but if the item is being re-added repeatedly, then either the person adding it needs to be blocked or, if multiple IPs, then the article s-protected. A non-admin doesn't have the tools to make that happen, but users who violate the BLP policy after being warned with {{<a href="../../../b/l/p/Template%7EBlp2_4735.html" title="Template:Blp2">blp2</a>}} can be reported at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> and protection can be requested at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>. Yes, I know that sometimes it's frustrating when something happens at an odd hour and you can't find an admin to administer the much-needed block. There was one night when the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Falcons_01c3.html" title="Atlanta Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> message board was repeatedly vandalizing articles about their players and nobody was monitoring <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> ... but a BLP admin who is not also a regular admin would have the same problem. If articles are never getting examined, that's something for a WikiProject, not a special user class. We could have a bot generate a list of all articles in the living persons' category and then divide it up among those who are interested, checking off the articles as they are done. Believe me ... I've spent time with BLP issues. I've talked with individuals who are the subject of their articles. I know the frustrations that can be involved. But I just don't see any reason for a special user class ... really, I think the issue is just that more volunteers are needed for responding to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLPN_8a63.html" title="WP:BLPN">WP:BLPN</a> issues. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:42, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is transparent, except when it comes to the anonymous editor. BLP Admin may or may not be right for Wikipedia, however I think its a start.

<p>Firstly, adminship is no big deal, it just gives you a few extra buttons to press.

<p>I'm not sure it's this, but something. The BLP noticeboard is bloated and largely ineffective.

<dd>I am telling you, this project is just not going to ever get the number of people it needs to do this task unless they are also empowered to enforce things. I challenge you: as an editor only, select 10 BLPs and remove content from them that violates WP:BLP. Then, be prepared to spend the rest of the next several weeks and most of the hours of your day pulling out your hair and being subjected to the worst of human nature to see the changes actually stick. Then, visit those pages again after three weeks. Rinse, repeat. You accomplished almost nothing. No one, no one will do it for long. On the other hand, actually empower responsible people to specialize in this policy and enforce things regarding it and you will find 100s and 100s of people lining up to do the task. Why only then? Because they can have real hope of actually being successful at accomplishing something.

<dd>Again, you don't need extra buttons to do stuff at BLP. If you need a page protected, contact an admin to do so. It's often faster than RFPP. If you need a block, report it to ANI. Right now, I only see a BLP admin as someone who will block for minor infractions because

<p>I see a number of problems with this proposal <small>(apart from the obvious glaring one of age - what makes a person who is 25 and has a bachelor's degree any more mature? Maybe 27 or 28, maybe 40, but not 25. And a degree? Education either makes you feel you know everything, in which case it was a waste, or it teaches you that you know nothing, in which case there's nothing special about having a degree. In either case, having a degree does not make one more suitable for tasks like this - and I say that as a person with a PhD).</small></p>
<p>To begin with, anyone is free to intervene on BLP issues. If people aren't interested in BLP issues, there is only one way to change that - education. The only way to change the amount of attention the community gives to an issue is to convince people that they <i>should</i> care. Policing articles and getting into fights simply pisses people off. There is no way that any group of editors can police all the articles about living people. Either most people do it, or it's just a show.</p>
<p>Anyone is free to police articles about living people. Anyone is free to organise a WikiProject or some other grouping to focus on this issue. But there is no way that any group can really make a decent stab at tens of thousands of articles in any reasonable manner.</p>
<p>This provision is troubling: <i><b>The BLP admin shall have power to remove and rapidly enforce his or her removal of potentially litigious content from BLPs, even when this may be contrary to page editors' consensus.</b></i> For a project like this to work, we would need <i>hundreds</i> of "BLP admins" who not only understand the BLP policy, but also the NPOV policy. While this is about ideas and not personalities, my experience with CyberAnth has shown that s/he is willing to remove material "per BLP" which appear to be based on a mis-reading of the statements, and proposes changes which are not in keeping with NPOV. If a BLP admin were to have the power to <i>enforce</i> changes to the article, we would need to have a system in place in which ensured that people like that were weeded out. This is a lot more serious than adminship - admins don't have the power to enforce anything. It would, in fact, be closer to the power of arbitrators. Arbcomm candidates have their entire past sifted through for weeks. How could we do that with the <i>hundreds</i> of BLP admins needed? How would we find a big enough pool? Obviously, anyone qualified to be a "BLP admin" would have to be someone who the community already trusted enough to be an admin, but most existing admins have stepped on too many toes to get something like that through. It's worth looking at recent RFBs or things like DF's RFA for a bot. The community is uncomfortable with the idea of giving people special powers - I would be truly shocked if we could agree on a sufficiently large pool of trusted users to make this work.</p>
<p>Upon what is the assertion that BLP issue are primary to the survival of Wikipedia based? Looking around the internet, I would think that the issue of image copyrights is a far more dangerous. People make their living off images. Image copyright enforcement is growing. Wikipedia is a far bigger target on that regard, especially since we are based on a philosophy of open content, which puts us directly at odds with people who make their living selling content. Public figures cannot sue for libel. On the other hand, big companies which control huge banks of images could sue - and would win.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the problem of BLP is something that can be solved through improved article quality and the development of approved versions. It is not something that can be fixed by giving a few extra people a few more powers. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 06:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. Sure, BLP issues are a problem. Convincing people of the problem is important. Deleting material from articles just pisses people off, makes them hostile to the idea. In addition, simply deleting uncited potentially negative material can create major NPOV issues, especially Undue Weight problems. Unless a person is familiar with the subject matter, it can be difficult to tell whether a change improves the article or makes it worse. Creating super admins dedicated to BLP issues is likely to make the problem worse. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 13:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had little bad to say about the proposal until I hit this section. 1) Maturity and age are not synonymous. We don't have age-restrictions on regular admin duties. 2) Showing good work on relevant articles and displaying knowledge of policy should be enough. Education is not important when choosing any kind of admin. People without a degree can still be excellent admins. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:13, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For example, not only is it allowed, but these people are <i>explicitly</i> given the ability to block, protect, or use any other admin power to win a dispute they're in. Furthermore, they don't even require any sort of consensus to do this; they are allowed to apply their powers <i>against</i> a consensus. And to ever recall this type of admin, you have to get a 75% majority that they should <i>not</i> have the powers, which is nearly impossible. In RfAs, if someone isn't patently terrible, I have never seen them to get less than 26% support. So, in the end, we have admins who are explicitly empowered to use their tools in content disputes, may ignore consensus, and are nearly impossible to remove.

<p>Admins address disputes among editors. At times, Admins get into disputes among themselves. Without directly saying it, the <b>BLP Admins</b> proposal seems to identify biography disputes between "regular" Admins as a problem that needs to be addressed. To better resolve these disputes, the proposal seeks to create a class of Admins (BLP Admins) who have authority over regular Admins when it comes to biographies. A problem with this is that there is little to keep the BLP Admins from engaging in similar biography disputes among themselves. The BLP Admins membership criteria - knowledge, maturity, education - may work to assure better actions by an individual BLP Admin but does not increase the ability for BLP Admins to get along among themselves. Even if the proposal were reworked, I do not see it accomplishing the objective of reducing biography disputes between Admins. Also, creating additional layers of Admins to address an issue would take away from improving the existing policy, guideline, and process to address that same issue. Since I do not see how the proposal could be reworked to accomplish the objective of reducing biography disputes between Admins, I believe the proposal should be rejected. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 16:50, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This proposal is simply not the way this place works.

<dd>I agree. I have never seen Godwin's Law used so effectively and ineffectively before.

<dd>No one stops him or anyone from discussing it here. A "rejected" tag is not necessary definitive, it's basically a means to show the current consensus.

<dd>I am an admin, I am active in the BLP noticeboard, and I have never seen this proposal.
