<p><b>Blended Learning</b> is the combination of multiple approaches to learning. Blended learning can be accomplished through the use of 'blended' virtual and physical resources. A typical example of this would be a combination of technology-based materials and face-to-face sessions used together to deliver instruction.</p>
<p>In the strictest sense, blended learning is anytime any instructor combines two methods of delivery of instruction. However, the deeper meaning lies in engaging the students of the current generation. Thus a better example would be using active learning techniques in the physical classroom and a social web presence online. Blended learning is a term that represents a shift in instructional strategy.</p>
<p>The concept of blended learning has particular relevance to language learning (see point 8 below).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/e/Blended_learning.html" title="Edit section: Current usage of the term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current usage of the term</span></h2>
<p>With today's prevalence of <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_technology.html" title="High technology">high technology</a> in many countries, blended learning often refers specifically to the provision or use of resources which combine <a href="../../../e/-/l/E-learning.html" title="E-learning">e-learning</a> (electronic) or <a href="../../../m/-/l/M-learning.html" title="M-learning">m-learning</a> (mobile) with other educational resources.</p>
<p>Some would claim that key blended-learning arrangements can also involve <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mentoring.html" title="E-mentoring">e-mentoring</a> or e-tutoring.</p>
<p>These arrangements tend to combine an electronic learning component with some form of human intervention, although the involvement of an e-mentor or an e-tutor does not necessarily need to be in the context of e-learning. E-mentoring or e-tutoring can also be provided as part of a "stand alone" ("un-blended") e-tutoring or e-mentoring arrangement.</p>
<p>Researchers Heinze and Procter have developed the following definition for Blended Learning in <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_education.html" title="Higher education">higher education</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><cite>Blended Learning is learning that is facilitated by the effective combination of different modes of delivery, models of teaching and styles of learning, and founded on transparent communication amongst all parties involved with a course.</cite></dd>
</dl>
<p>A major criticism of such a definition revolves around their rigid insistence upon features such as "communication", "transparency", "parties" and "courses". These features do not necessarily have clear or unambiguous meaning in environments outside that of higher (or other institutionalised) education systems. In other words, the definition fails to acknowledge environments where blended learning does not raise issues of "transparency of communication" in the way it is envisaged in the institutional definition. This might refer to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> systems, or animal training systems, which can be involved in blended learning since they employ combined resources.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that some authors talk about "hybrid learning" (this seems to be more common in Northern American sources) or "mixed learning". However, all of these concepts broadly refer to the integration (the "blending") of e-learning tools and techniques with traditional methods. Two important factors to consider are the time spent on online activities and the amount of technology used.</p>
<p><a name="Alternative_usage_of_the_term" id="Alternative_usage_of_the_term"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/e/Blended_learning.html" title="Edit section: Alternative usage of the term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alternative usage of the term</span></h2>
<p>The term "blended learning" can also be used to describe arrangements in which "conventional", offline, non-electronic based instruction happens to include online tutoring or mentoring services.</p>
<p>This combination of e-tutoring plus conventional learning, although it is a perfectly valid example of blended learning, is the "opposite way round" to most current blended learning arrangements, in that the solution is driven by conventional learning techniques, not by the electronic techniques.</p>
<p><a name=".22Pre_e-learning.22_and_.22non_e-learning.22_usages"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/e/Blended_learning.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Pre e-learning&quot; and &quot;non e-learning&quot; usages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Pre e-learning" and "non e-learning" usages</span></h2>
<p>As with many things prefixed with 'e-' (originally standing for "electronic", but eventually more specifically applied to the involvement of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a>-based or more recently <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>-based technology) the e-learning aspect of blended learning can often mislead the unwary into believing that it is the defining constituent of 'multi-resource' educational approaches.</p>
<p>Those involved in school education (as opposed to many of those responsible for developing occupational training resources) are often more familiar with 'combined resource' educational tools that do not necessarily involve computer technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classroom based audio-tape resources (language laboratories);</li>
<li>Auditorium multimedia visual resources (movie projectors, slideshows, VCRs);</li>
<li>Textual resources: textbooks, exercise books (although these are obviously the mainstay of traditional school educational resources, they are actually a neglected and under-valued potential component of e-learning-based blended learning);</li>
<li>Home-learning resources (video recordings, audio recordings);</li>
<li>Blackboard and whiteboard resources, including high-tech "printing whiteboards" and "online whiteboards";</li>
<li>Demonstration resources, including "museum exhibits", "laboratory experiments", live theatre, historic re-enactment, hands-on workshops, role-playing, etc;</li>
<li>Non-instructional education resources, such as examination, quizzes, invigilation, test-grading, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above, whilst they do not include e-learning, are nonetheless potential constituents of a blended learning approach.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the same way that "non-human resources" which are not e-learning are not included in many blended learning solutions, the human component of an e-learning-based blended learning arrangement does not need to be "high-tech".</p>
<p>Interaction with a human being in blended learning solutions is typically delivered through real-time <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chat.html" title="Chat">chat</a> systems or online <a href="../../../m/e/s/Message_boards.html" title="Message boards">message boards</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_mail.html" title="Electronic mail">email</a>. However, telephone contact with a tutor or trainer may be just as effective and potentially far more reassuring to the learner.</p>
<p><a name="Current_non-e-learning-based_blended_learning" id="Current_non-e-learning-based_blended_learning"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/e/Blended_learning.html" title="Edit section: Current non-e-learning-based blended learning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current non-e-learning-based blended learning</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes, especially in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_technology.html" title="Information technology">IT</a> training, learners may use computers as a training resource in a conventional classroom setting. The presence of a classroom tutor often tends to prevent training delivered in this way from being labelled as e-learning or blended learning.</p>
<p>This kind of instructor-led training can itself be conducted completely online, using email, chat or message boards. While there is a sense in which this not really "blended" (it ultimately constitutes just a single "delivery method"), the combination of human teacher and online interaction can certainly be thought of under the blended learning umbrella, especially if the online interaction is conducted using some of the more sophisticated online interactive whiteboard tools like <a href="../../../n/e/t/NetMeeting_776a.html" title="NetMeeting">NetMeeting</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/e/Blended_learning.html" title="Edit section: A Model used by Language Schools">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A Model used by Language Schools</span></h2>
<p>Language learning (especially ELT, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language_learning_and_teaching.html" title="English language learning and teaching">English Language Teaching</a>) has been at the forefront of the development of blended educational solutions. ELT in particular requires a combination of face-to-face teaching and interactive (and therefore frequently electronic) practice activity. This can be achieved through the adoption of a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_Learning_Environment_3f9f.html" title="Virtual Learning Environment">Virtual Learning Environment</a> (VLE).</p>
<p>VLEs have been a major growth point in the ELT industry over the last 5 years. They are developed either as an externally-hosted platforms onto which content can be exported by a school or institution (examples being <a href="http://moodle.org" class="external text" title="http://moodle.org" rel="nofollow">Moodle</a>, 'Worldwide Web Course Tools, WebCT' or the 'Blackboard' VLE) or as content-supplied, course-managed learning platforms (an example being 'Macmillan English Campus'). The key difference is that the latter is able to support course-building by the language school. This means that existing learning pathways are supported by games, activities, listening exercises and grammar reference units online.</p>
