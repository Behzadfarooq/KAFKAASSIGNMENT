<h2><span class="mw-headline">Infobox show/hide function, data and opinion collection</span></h2>
<p>There is an optional field of the anime infobox (<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_animanga_Manga_ba23.html" title="Template:Infobox animanga/Manga">Template:Infobox animanga/Manga</a>) that allows you to list the foreign publishers in a hidden field with a show/hide tag to reduce its length. However, in it's default form (viewable <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rurouni_Kenshin_8316.html" title="Rurouni Kenshin">here</a>) the text is too small for most people to see. I have attempted to fix this, and am currently transcluding one of my user subpages so that I don't have to mess with the main infobox.</p>
<p>For me, the infobox views perfectly. However, <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">User:Dekimasu</a> says that he still can't read the text in the box, and raised a couple other concerns as well. So I am asking for wider input here. I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the infobox text show up at a legible size for you? (also, what browser and Wikipedia skin do you use?)</li>
<li>Is the show/hide field in the infobox a good idea?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance. For the record, I'm using Monobook (default skin) with Opera and Internet Explorer, and the infobox works. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 10:47, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Has anyone ever explained about the Japanese obsession with pseudo-english Words, which are all but impossible to write in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kana.html" title="Kana">Kana</a>? I think that might deserve an article to itself, if there isn't one already. Certainly the <i>Bleach</i>-article should link there. (The article "<a href="../../../e/n/g/Engrish.html" title="Engrish">Engrish</a>" touches this subject a bit, but it doesn't really hit what I'm getting at.) --<a href="../../../b/j/k/User%7EBjKa_efa1.html" title="User:BjKa">BjKa</a> 09:21, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm just a bit curious on what you're trying to accomplish with your proposal... I mean this is merely a result of a language system in Japan where they attempt to assimilate foreign vocabularies into their own. It also serves as a way for them to directly take a word (phonetically) and write them in katakana for publication purposes.</dd>
<dd>I mean even Americans does this all the time with words from European and Asian countries... it's merely a way for us to cope with this multi-langual world we have today. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 18:36, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>English is seen as a very trendy language in Japan, and most are able to at least somewhat read English words phonetically. It's not uncommon to see English words on clothing (such as the word "BOY" on Ranma's bathing suit). In other cases, the words are borrowed from English because an author likes the sound of the word. <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akira_Toriyama_c562.html" title="Akira Toriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> is particurly well known for deriving terms from English. Many other langauges are also borrowed from in this manner. I've seen German and Spanish quite a bit, especially in Bleach.</dd>
<dd>As for the the poor <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliterations</a>, this has more to do with the language itself. Specifically, Japanese speak in <i><a href="../../../m/o/r/Mora.html" title="Mora">mora</a></i> instead of syllables. That said, Burīchi might not be as bad as you'd think. The u is silent and the i at the end can be destressed or omitted. The ī is sounds almost identically to the "ea" of "Bleach". The only real problem is the r/l sound. They have a similar sound that falls somewhere in the middle. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 19:55, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>Well, you might expect that it would be, but in practice the u isn't silent here. They don't usually go silent unless they're at the end of the word. As for <i>burīchi</i>, it's not just on loan for the name of the comic. It's a real loan word. We could just as well start complaining about <i>pseudo</i> being used in English. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well we're off on this topic, how can you tell when the Us are not supposed to be pronounced? It sounds like <i>suki</i>, for example, is pronouced as the English word Ski. Such as in <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatsuki_Arisawa_d139.html" title="Tatsuki Arisawa">Tatski</a>, and also perhaps in <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanpakut%C5%8D.html" title="Zanpakutō">zanpaktō</a> and the like. If the Us are being pronouced, they are certainly very quiet. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 05:28, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</i>
<dl>
<dd>It's true that the U is almost wholly elided in "suki," but it's really not in "Tatsuki." It's also not elided in "zanpakutō." That might seem very confusing, but I think it's partially a result of how casual you are willing to be with your language. There's a saying, "tade kuu mushi mo sukizuki," (~equal to "there's no accounting for taste") in which the U is fully elocuted twice (possibly to sound more literate); it's also pronounced in "sukiyaki" (and you have to be polite to food, as in "osake"). Anyone who is being formal in their speech will also pronounce the U in "suki." Likewise, people who are being formal in their speech will sometimes pronounce the word-final U sound in "gozaimasu," "desu," "arimasu," etc.</dd>
<dd>I think one of the biggest issues is the length of the mora, which must be complete in correct speech (an N mora without a vowel gets the same "mouth time" as a KA or HO). In verb-final SU elision, like the normal pronunciation of any -masu form, removing the U allows the sentences to be more clearly separated, as the S is given more "mouth time" and effectively marks the end of the thought. This seems to carry over into elision of the SU in other positions in words, even to the point of shortening the mora that it was so important to draw out before (making, effectively, "suki" into a single mora), but the same type of elision isn't usually used when dealing with the TSU mora, the KU mora, etc.</dd>
<dd>I can't tell you that my impression is correct based on any references, but upon reflection I believe that this is what I do when I speak. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 06:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. It's also worth noting that the U in the final SU is not normally elided in plain-form verbs ("kasu," "tasu," "dasu," "sasu," etc.). Couldn't tell you why. I don't think I could if I kept thinking about it, either. (&gt;_&lt;) <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 06:16, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd agree, but you're giving out the wrong examples. More often than not, I'd say that a 'u' following an 's' is usually glanced over (the only exception I can think of being "sumimasen" although in that case the first 'm' is often omitted instead; "sukiyaki" is often pronounced as "skiyaki"), noticeable in verbs like "dasu" or ... "korosu", whereas in verbs like "kaku" or "horu" or "kamu", the 'u' is much more apparent to the listener.</dd>
<dd>As for the "BOY" on Ranma's shirt and the issue that pertains to, the only thing I would say is that I'd equate that to any non-East Asian person getting a kanji tattoo based on how it looks or what (they think) it means. -Patchi- 8 January 2007</dd>
<dd>Pronouncing 'u' in Japanese works the same way as 't' in English. Most people omit t's at the end of words, "can't" for example, and end the sound before the t abruptly instead. If you were trying to be more formal, you'ld anunciate the t.Ziiv (<a href="../../../z/i/i/User_talk%7EZiiv_3235.html" title="User talk:Ziiv">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ziiv_59f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ziiv">contribs</a>) 06:02, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Defining a Spoiler</span></h2>
<p>I think we need to define exactly what counts as a spoiler. I propose that something only qualifies as a spoiler if it was meant to be a secret at the time that it was eventually revealed. Facts that take time to be revealed simply because Kubo hadn't gotten around to it before then should not be considered spoilers. For the moment, I'm going to avoid discussing plot spoilers and stick just to fact spoilers. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 00:04, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>I agree with your approach philosophically. In practice, I stay away from certain pages on the recent chapters of the manga (I generally haven't read past the end of the last published Japanese tankobon, although I've read some individual chapters after that in my Shonen Jumps). People should have the common sense to do that if they don't want to know what happens. On the other hand, if there is something that's a significant unexpected plot element (not necessarily a spoiler by your definition) unrelated to the article topic, I think it should be noted. For example, if I want to go read about Zaraki Kenpachi and I find out ahead of time that he has killed Ichinose, I might be a little upset. In that sense, I think we should be more careful of actual plot spoilers while being as careless as possible about background "spoilers" (for instance, everything on this page [outside of a prospective plot summary] with the exception of Aizen's name). <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 15:35, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, now. Plot spoilers are quite different than spoilers about facts. An example of something that sits outside of the plot is Rukia's sword. A new reader might be interested to read that when released, her <i>zanpakutō</i> turns pure white and whatnot. This was not revealed until later in the manga, but was not really part of the plot. Nor was it a secret. On the other hand, as mentioned above, describing the final release of Ikkaku's <i>zanpakutō</i> could potentially spoil his battle with Edward. It was certainly plot critical and was kept secret from almost all of the other <i>shinigami</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think all plot information should be kept inside its own section, with a sub-section, or otherwise obvious break for plot that occurs after the end of the anime. Facts that imply future plot events, such as a character being currently dead, should probably be kept inside spoiler tags as well. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 20:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>I don't think there's anything on the page now that really requires a spoiler tag. Revealing the existence of the vizard or the arrancar or Urahara's mod souls doesn't really say what they have to do with the story, and I would suggest they are not spoilers. I would go so far as to say that there are only two plot spoilers in the whole article, and they are the number of Quincy and the fact that the Bount were created by the shinigami. I think the spoiler tag could be removed entirely until a plot summary goes into the article. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 08:41, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's what I'm objecting to. If they wished to maintain the original flavor they wouldn't have subverted the "older brother" denotation (and I don't feel like <i>san</i> has as such an "honorable" connotation here, since it's more something said by convention). "Big brother" is in standard English usage and having Orihime say it would have reinforced her somewhat childlike image.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Renji -- Add to main characters?</span></h2>
<p>I believe that Renji should probably be considered a main character alongside Ichigo, Rukia, Orihime, Chad, and Ishida at this point. He's gotten nearly the same amount of screentime as Ichigo (certainly more than poor neglected Chad has) ever since his introduction, had character development, and now is a part of the new rescue party. I realize this may kick up a bit of opposition from slippery slope arguers, but it's really a fact now in the series, why not acknowledge it? (And no, I don't believe we need to expand the list to include Hitsugaya, at least not yet) --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 06:28, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I could support Renji, but not by himself. It is indeed slippery and subjective. Personally I think Kon should be added as a central member of the group of protagonists. He was around when we barely knew anything about Soul Society, just like the other "main characters." Urahara has also been highly involved over time. That's my limit.</dd>
<dd>The Spanish page has Renji and Kon in addition to the characters we list now; Italian is the same as ours; French lists ours plus Kon; Finnish has ours plus Urahara; Portuguese adds Renji, Kon, Aizen, Hitsugaya, Yoruichi, and Urahara.

<dd>Kon hasn't done much since his introduction though. He's comic relief, but doesn't really even participate in the main storyline anymore. He would have been a major character at the beginning, but after they left for SS, he's pretty much been deprecated.

<dd>The purpose of the "main characters" section, as I understand it, is to serve newer readers. As such, I believe it's best to just list the human Ryoka, plus Rukia. A more ideal solution, in my opinion, would be to merge the "Main characters" and "Races" section into one "Characters" section. The divide by "races" always seemed strange to me, as everyone (except possibly modsouls) are ultimately human, more or less. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 18:29, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>Actually, Renji <i>is</i> a Ryoka in the Heuco Mundo arc, since iirc Ryoka refers to intruders. The purpose of the races section is to define all of the different soul classes.

<dd>About the "main characters" and "races," I had thought about merging them into one "characters" section, with an intro and subheaded into "main characters" and "character types." I think it would be difficult to merge them entirely, however. As for who the article is for, I agree that the people reading it would lean towards newer readers, and it should serve them as much as possible (this would seem to argue for including Kon), but one of the goals is still to be encyclopedic. <i>If</i> Renji is a main character, I think he has to go into the section. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 20:30, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The VIZ site lists Kon as a main character. If you go to the larger list you can see that Urahara, Yoruichi, and Renji are farther down the main character list as shadows.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Humans Section</span></h2>
<p>I temporarily took out the new "humans" section. I feel like this is covered in the introduction to the section and the rest of the material is too detailed for the series overview. Also, I don't think it's really true that most people accept the existence of ghosts in <i>Bleach</i>. The Kurosakis never talk to anyone outside of their family about seeing ghosts. I think Don Kanonji's television show is supposed to be popular in the same way <i><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_autopsy.html" title="Alien autopsy">Alien Autopsy</a></i> is popular... as entertainment, not as truth. Here's what I removed... let's talk about it. "The humans of <i>Bleach</i> are much like those in a modern, non-fictional setting. They primarily differ in their wider acceptance of spiritual beings such as ghosts. One in 150,000 humans have at least some perception of nearby ghosts, though only a relative few, known as mediums, are able to perceive well enough to hold conversations. The best known medium is <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Kanonji_d6ce.html" title="Don Kanonji">Don Kanonji</a>, who hosts a television show where he interacts with ghosts. At the height of its popularity, it was regularly watched by 25% of the Japanese population. Despite all of this, human understanding of the spiritual world is somewhat limited. Only small groups such as the Quincy ever knew of the eternal conflict between shinigami and the hollows, but they have all but disappeared in the modern age." <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 04:32, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, is there a distinction between a plus and a spirit? Your ghosts section calls pluses souls that haven't been buried, where the old one called them the spirits of humans who have died. Aren't residents of Soul Society also pluses? And did you choose the word "ghosts" so that it wouldn't be a choice between "plus" and "whole," or was there another reason? Generally I think the new section reads better, but I'm confused why the title is changed. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 05:55, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reflecting this, I've tried "Ghosts in <i>Bleach</i> are known as <b>pluses</b> (<b>Wholes</b> in the official English editions). A plus is the disembodied spirit of a person who has died. A plus has a spiritual body composed of <i>reishi</i> that resembles its material body at the time of death. A chain, known as the Chain of Fate <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">因果の鎖</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">inga no kusari</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>, protrudes from the chest and binds the soul to a location, object or person that they felt close to in life. The soul can move about freely if the chain is broken, but this also causes the chain to corrode. Normally, pluses are sent to <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Society_c73d.html" title="Soul Society">Soul Society</a> by shinigami in a ritual called soul burial <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">魂葬</span><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">konsō</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>. However, if the Chain of Fate is corroded entirely before a soul burial can be performed, a hole will form in the chest of the spirit where the chain was once anchored. Such souls are driven mad and become spiritual monsters known as hollows. If the Chain of Fate is torn out deliberatly, this also leads to spiritual degradation." I also incorporated some of the edits into the introduction (about <i>reishi</i>), because in retrospect, I think some of the explanation was repetitive and could be explained fully in the introduction. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 06:10, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an aside, I think the lead and the introduction are a little strange at the moment. It would be good to incorporate more of the intro into the lead and replace the intro with at least a cursive plot summary that doesn't reveal the endings to each (unofficial) arc. The plot summary is preferred to an introduction by <a href="../../../m/a/n/WP%7EMANGA_5d75.html" title="WP:MANGA">WP:MANGA</a>, although here I think it should probably go after the characters and setting sections so that it would make more sense.

<dd>Hrm, this is a lot to go over. I'll explain my overarching motives. I'd like to see the "Character types" section turned into a "Characters" section, with the subdivisions logically denoting different types of characters. Characters worth a short overview, the "main characters" would be at the top. This leads into why I added the Human subsection. The humans subsection was meant to replace the content in the current introduction.</dd>
<dd>Next... Hmm, I think I'll make a new subject regarding the plus/whole/spirit/soul/ghost situation, and explain how I see it.</dd>
<dd>Onto the humans and their acceptance of ghosts. It seems you're right. I can find no incontestable evidence. This was just the general impression I had from viewing the series, but moreso, it worked well with the paragraph and lead into all the things I wanted to mention about humans. It probably needs to be reworded. I think something needs to be said about human and their relationship to the spiritual world. It's too bad not much is said on the subject. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 06:44, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</i>

I think the lead to the ==Characters== section should deal with the series in as much an out-of-universe perspective as possible... for example, discussing how characters are used (redemption of "evil" characters as a theme, high level of character development in the series because the same characters are used throughout, etc.). <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 06:49, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Plus/Whole/Spirit/Soul/Ghost</span></h2>
<p>I think we need to clear up a few things. This is how I understand it:</p>
<ul>
<li>All beings are souls.</li>
<li>Human bodies contain a soul. They are chained together during life.</li>
<li>A soul outside its original body in the real world is called a spirit.</li>
<li>Hollows are evil souls of dead humans. In the real world, this makes them "evil spirits"</li>
<li>As for pluses, Rukia explains it best, I believe:
<dl>
<dd><i>"One is called a plus and is the most common spirit. You can say that the 'ghosts' you usually see are these."</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Specifically, the term seems to refer to dead souls who still have their chains anchored to their chests.</li>
<li>Shinigami perform a soul burial on pluses/wholes/ghosts, sending them to Soul Society.</li>
<li>In soul society, they are no longer referred to as ghosts/pluses/spirits, they are simply "souls".</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the Plus/Whole term. We have never heard this used outside of Rukia's explanations. This is what led me to believe that it is either a technical term, or a shinigami term. Humans obviously call them "ghosts". I believe this is the term we should use as well. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 06:59, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The character book says １死した人間の魂魄；２’ユウレイ’の総称 for pluses (1, the souls of dead humans; 2, a general term for ghosts), which seems to leave it up in the air. But no one ever says that soul burial turns a "plus" into a "spirit" either. The Japanese page for <i>Bleach</i> says that all souls that aren't hollows (ホロウに堕ちていない、通常の霊魂) are pluses, and that 死者の魂 (the souls of dead humans) live in Soul Society. The problem here is <i>konpaku</i> (霊魂, spirit) vs <i>tamashii</i> (魂, soul). The Japanese page makes clear that these terms can be used interchangeably (魂魄、いわゆる魂, spirits, in other words souls). I think you're right that all beings are souls. I think all good souls (including living humans, shinigami, etc.) are pluses, and all evil souls (hollows) are "minuses." I still think that residents of Soul Society are pluses.</dd>
<dd>If that's the case, then it does make more sense to use the term "ghosts" to distinguish the kind of souls we're talking about in that section from all the other kinds of pluses, and the pluses/hollows distinction should be made in the lead to the character types section. How does that sound? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:22, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It also makes the case that the distinction between character types that we should talk about in the introduction isn't human vs. spirit, but good soul vs. bad soul. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>soul - everyone is a soul (that's why the character book is named like it is, too). This is represented by both <i>tamashii</i> and <i>konpaku</i>.</li>

<dd>"Ghost" is only used by Ichigo's family in reference to what they see, because they don't have any idea what it is that they're seeing. I am guessing that when Rukia says "spirit" in English in episode 2, it's at the place outside the park when she says <i>rei</i> in the second manga chapter. This is when she's talking to Ichigo in the terms he uses and I don't think she ever says it again. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 00:34, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been thinking about this more and reading the Japanese page and looking through my <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4887188595/ref=sr_11_1/250-7263802-8377016?ie=UTF8" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4887188595/ref=sr_11_1/250-7263802-8377016?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">Secrets of Bleach</a></i> book and I think I have a better handle on this now. Soul and spirit are exactly equal, so the dichotomy in the introduction is false (humans have souls too). On the other hand, the term plus is used for "a soul that hasn't become a hollow" and I can't find it used in any instances outside of what we're now calling "ghost." It seems to me like we should use that term for the section header to distinguish "pluses" ("good ghosts") from the "hollows" ("bad ghosts"). The part in the shinigami section where it says shinigami are recruited from the ranks of pluses should be changed to souls. Any place we have "spirit" could just as well be changed to "soul." <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:46, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tried a little cleanup, but you're right that a humans section needs to go in now.

<p>I think it's fair that spirit should refer to every incorporeal being (plus, shinigami, hollow, etc.) as we have no other general word to describe this. As the previous version (a week+ ago) said, there are two main beings in Bleach - humans and spirits. They are further divided into humans/Quincy/Bounts/modsouls vs. pluses/shinigami/hollows. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 01:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It read better, but I think it was a dichotomy constructed only for the purposes of the article. I suppose we could have a subheader of "humans" (followed by an intro and the bullet descriptions of the Quincy and the Bount), and a subheader of "spirits" (followed by an intro and the bullet descriptions of pluses, shinigami, hollows, and modsouls), but I don't think it should be articulated in the text. And I think the comment that all characters are souls should stay. Modsouls should go on the same side as shinigami because they both use gigai to go over to the human side - shouldn't they? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 03:02, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Looks like we're on the right track. A quick question, though. Do we have any specific reference to souls being called "spirits" other than while they are in the real world? The traditional meaning of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit.html" title="Spirit">spirit</a> refers specifically to incorporeal beings. Within the perspective of soul society, <i>reishi</i> is very much corporeal, i.e. material; tangible. It's only in the real world that souls could honestly be referred to as incorporeal beings (spirits). This leads me to believe that it is synonymous with the human's word "<a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">ghost</a>", and thus not synonymous with "soul". If so, it's an inappropriate label for resident souls in soul society. This is why I'd like to see a reference to be sure. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 04:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, pluses/shinigami/hollows are not really "incorporeal" in the real world in <i>Bleach</i>, either. They can use their <i>reishi</i> to run into walls and knock things over... or both at the same time, in the case of the hollow from the first episode. The only difference is that they can't be seen and heard. I think tjstrf's changes were very good, although he didn't separate the humans from the spirits. As long as we stay away from cementing a spirit-soul distinction where it <i>may</i> not exist (obviously I don't think it does), I have no objection to using the word "spirit" in a descriptive way. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 08:41, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For example, "Together they search for hollows and perform soul burials on wayward souls, cleansing the spirits and sending them to Soul Society." I know it's the lead and that much of that is explained in the rest of the article, but really, the lead should be the <i>easiest</i> part of the article to understand, and we haven't written it that way. I don't generally work on the pages for the individual characters, but I imagine it's much the case there as well.

<dd>From what I've observed, Bleach is indeed much more focused on its various terms than most anime. I've actually never seen one that has such a frequent use of created terms as is seen in Bleach. Most of these created terms (in my opinion) aren't just some basic concept. Several have a variety of defining factors as to what it is and what it is not, but little is clarified about them. One particular term that remains in my mind is reiatsu. It is used on multiple pages, but only two pages give any slight mentioning as to what it is. <a href="../../../n/e/n/Nen.html" title="Nen">Nen</a> is a page that defines reiatsu in all of its aspects. Also I'm not too sure what the comment about searching is. If I look for something as common as getsuga tenshō, I will of course get links to Ichigo and the zanpakuto pages, explaining what that frequent ability is. But what will searching for the neglected frequent terms be for? I think that there enough significant terms for them to earn their own page, but there at least needs to be some improvement for knowledge on Bleach's terminology. Plus the many of the terms (most notably techniques) seem to have some very high symbolic details behind it, which someone (if they got to know what it meant and how it acted) could spend much time analyzing, understanding Tite Kubo's potentially subtle messages. I'm just thinking someone new to the series (or not into it at all) who would come here to better understand things, could instead wind up with gaps of understanding, giving up here and going to a knowledgable friend... --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerraGamerX_0be5.html" title="User:TerraGamerX">TerraGamerX</a> 06:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Does the official English translation really use the word <i>Spritrons</i>? Because that would be crazy. However, a lot of the issue here is a simple lack of translation of the Japanese. Most of the made-up words are a combination of two or three Japanese kanji that make the general meaning of the term obvious to the reader. Thus rei+atsu=spiritual pressure in the same way that ki+atsu=barometric pressure. The Quincy kanji, likewise, indicate that they are "destroyers." This general method also allows Kubo to keep actual applications and meanings of many of the terms fairly vague (see our terminology dispute above). It probably helps him avoid violating the canon and creating paradoxes. I think that this main page should be able to explain the manga without reference to any in-depth concepts that are even confusing to people who really know about <i>Bleach</i>. Many of the <i>Bleach</i> subpages are still very crufty, making them more opaque and less useful (for example, many articles on individual characters include major plot summaries). Either way, creation of a list page has three main problems: problems of bias as to what should be included, the lack of a real way to clarify many of the vague terms, and the fact that it will draw AfD nominations left and right. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:03, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We could make it standard to use a the nihongo template on every prefered Japanese term the first time its used in an article.

<dd>You are undeniably right that many of the <i>Bleach</i> articles require a lot of work....

<dd>Yep, that's the biggest problem right there... since manga series have fanbases which are pretty much sufficient unto themselves and spread by word of mouth, it's hard to find real opinion references that pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</dd>
<dd>As for the invented term in Bleach, I don't think they would be opaque to a native speaker of Japanese. Think of it as constructing words from Latin or Greek roots.

<dd>Without looking at anything, I know that he gets credited on everything, even stuff he doesn't write. The difference is that he will be listed as one of the authors instead of the author (a way of saying that he's signing off on whatever people are ghostwriting for him). This is true of the factbooks and various other <i>Bleach</i> materials. Unfortunately he is forced to sign off on things with plot holes. But speaking of the Bount arc and who's doing it, did anyone notice that the animators have changed as well? Ishida and Ichigo have a completely different facial geometry now. It's annoying and it doesn't look like the manga.</dd>
<dd>The movie is being marketed as though it's supposed to be canonical, so maybe he really did write it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Main" characters</span></h2>
<p>Do we really need a main characters section? If so, what's the criteria of becoming a "main" character? Should we just delete it? Bleach has a large cast of characters, each important. If the criteria for becoming a "main" character is being important to the storyline, I could put up a dang good argument for just about any character. <a href="../../../m/w/s/User%7EMwsilvabreen_11b8.html" title="User:Mwsilvabreen">Mwsilvabreen</a> 02:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But why do we need a section with a list of just six or seven people?

<p>I had an idea. What if we had a primary protagonists/antagonists section? Defined by whoever is currently featured prominently in the storyline. <a href="../../../m/w/s/User%7EMwsilvabreen_11b8.html" title="User:Mwsilvabreen">Mwsilvabreen</a> 02:54, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Currently featured prominently in which storyline, anime or manga? And there are far too many characters featured in many of the arcs of both media to list them all as main characters. Personally, I think Main Characters are characters that have featured prominently in all the arcs since their respective introductions. I'm not sure about the manga, as I've only read up to about chapter 24, but in the anime the roles are fairly clearly designated as major or minor characters, at least up until the filler arc. Just my two cents. <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique1287</a> 03:00, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Both storylines. From what I've seen, it's pretty easy to just tack on (anime only) to the end of a word. As for the far too many characters, its pretty easy right now. For protagonists, you could list the spirt powered imbued humans and the soul society characters currently residing in the human world. Antagonists is also fairly easy. You could list the three defecting captain, the arrancar, and the hollows. <a href="../../../m/w/s/User%7EMwsilvabreen_11b8.html" title="User:Mwsilvabreen">Mwsilvabreen</a> 03:04, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which would be common knowledge to some, and ruin the series for others. I really don't feel we should intentionally give away the biggest spoiler in the (still unfinished) series. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 13:19, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But even having Renji and Kisuke in there is also a spoiler. Even Chad, Uryu, and Orihime in there is a spoiler. If someone wants to learn about the series, the current featured characters is a big feature to learn about, which gets me back to my original question, why do we even need a main character section? <a href="../../../m/w/s/User%7EMwsilvabreen_11b8.html" title="User:Mwsilvabreen">Mwsilvabreen</a> 19:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree that any of those inclusions are spoilers. While it implies that they will become important characters in the series, it doesn't say anything about their role. Ishida could be important because he destroys Soul Society. Chad could be important because he's actually a hollow in disguise. Once you split the characters into a protagonists and antagonists section, you are giving away the fact that Renji isn't such a bad guy, or that you-know-who is a bad guy who isn't dead. As for why the section is there, I believe it is because the article is structured according to the guidelines at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_manga_89fb.html#Sections" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga">Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga#Sections</a>. In fact, the formatting that we have for the section now is flawed, and there <i>should</i> be blurbs on each of the main characters. However, as it stands, I believe that the page remains informative while containing no "spoilers" that could be said to detract from anyone's reading/viewing experience. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 01:09, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>While interesting, the information on Spanish naming/Hispanic origins is <i>not</i> one of the most important things that we can say about <i>Bleach</i> as a whole.

<p><a name="Naming_issue" id="Naming_issue"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Naming issue</span></h2>
<p>We have been using merchandising to standardize some of the names of characters in the series (the Bount, the mod souls, etc.). However, the merchandising is not always consistent. For example, some merchandise romanizes 市丸ギン to <a href="../../../i/t/i/Itimaru_Gin_6c50.html" title="Itimaru Gin">Itimaru Gin</a> rather than Ichimaru, and <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_DS_52d3.html" title="Bleach DS">Bleach DS</a> romanizes Kyōraku's first name to Syunsui rather than Shunsui. This is not an inaccurate romanization system, as it reflects <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunrei-shiki.html" title="Kunrei-shiki">Kunrei-shiki</a>. However, it's not the one that we usually use on Wikipedia (modified <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepburn_romanization.html" title="Hepburn romanization">Hepburn romanization</a>). It doesn't seem to make sense that we believe "Noba" but toss out "Itimaru". What are your thoughts on this? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 03:09, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said in Talk:Shunsui Kyōraku, there are 2 cases of romanization: for Japanese words and for non-Japanese words. The romanization for Japanese words and names should follow Hepburn and there really isn't much room for deviation. The official character book also spells Hitsugaya's name Toushiro in English, that doesn't mean we should. However, for non-Japanese terms (Bounts, Ulquiorra, cero), we should be more careful and probably make an educated guess until there is an official spelling. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 11:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In the case of Noba/Nova, I think it was decided by the other character, Kuroud/Claude. Any existing romanization system would've placed an <i>o</i> at the end (i.e. Kuroudo or whatever), so it's likely that it's supposed to be an English spelling. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 11:47, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry to draw it out after you gave a good answer. I don't mean to suggest that we should toss out the current names, which are certainly better (although we do override the Hepburn and macronization standards for company and personal names that are trademarked or designated as preferred by the companies/individuals themselves). However, following "Immanent God Blues" and the like, I have lost confidence in the idea that anything I see romanized in <i>Jump</i> or <i>Bleach</i> merchandising is reliable. I was happy to have a "solution" when I found "Noba" and "Kuroud" in English, but I'm beginning to believe I was just looking at the flair of an underling at an advertising agency in Japan rather than any true creative intent. It's somewhat frustrating. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 07:06, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Organizational changes</span></h2>
<p>I support most of the organizational changes made today, but the lead needs to have some of the publication information reintroduced (both per <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANIME_d1de.html" title="WP:ANIME">WP:ANIME</a> and to give the reader context). Also, I think that some of the numerical content (number of volumes, number of chapters) needs to be reintroduced. Information in the infobox should be restated in the article, just as information in the introduction would be. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 08:08, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

For another, people who watch the anime already know when the characters debut, and people who don't watch the anime probably don't need to know, if they even care, what episode each character debuts in. <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique</a> <small><a href="../../../n/i/q/User_talk%7ENique1287_b03c.html" title="User talk:Nique1287">talk</a></small> 23:05, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Since all our standardization topics have been archived, here is a summary of what the past discussions have resulted in:</p>
<p>We use shinigami (as opposed to Death God, Soul Reaper, Angel of Death, Reaper, etc.) We do not capitalize shinigami, hollow, plus, zanpakutō, etc. We do capitalize Soul Society though. Quincy seems to be a grey area, since the Quincy article uses caps almost exclusively and it was never decided one way or the other. It's lieutenant, not vice-captain. We are using the english naming conventions for characters, given name first. It's also Bleach, not BLEACH.</p>

<p>As the talk page is getting on towards 120KB, I'm about to make a new archive. Assorted new decisions:<br />
1) It's Bleach (manga), not Bleach (anime).<br />
2) Correct character spellings include Bount (pl. Bounts), Yammy, and Luppi.<br />
3) The onmitsukidō is to be referred to as "special forces."<br />
4) The main characters on the page are listed in the order of their appearance.<br />
5) Soul Reaper vs. shinigami is unresolved, but we use shinigami since it remains the more common usage.<br />
6) There will be rigorous fact-checking of new additions to the page.<br />
7) Finestela has proposed a citation format as follows ("The 1-999 is the page number(s) for citation").</p>

<dd>I think it should be SOULs and VIBEs, which is what appears on the actual covers. This is not the same case as BLEACH because it's in all-caps to be inline with Japanese text, while 'Character Book SOULs' is not all-caps therefore there may be meaning to the capitalization. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 11:47, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>New consensus opinions through February 2007:<br />
1) Demon Arts has been superceded by kidō, since all versions of the series use the Japanese term. (<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">User:Tjstrf</a>)<br />
2) Spoilers should not be included in the main article unless they significantly contribute to an overall understanding of the series.<br />
3) The "artificial soul" subsection has been introduced to the character types section, replacing "modified soul" — this is to incorporate other manufactured souls that may not be considered "modified" in the same sense as Kon. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 10:59, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
