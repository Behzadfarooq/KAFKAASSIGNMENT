<p>Hello, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a> says that users shoudln't give undue wieght to minority views. Let's say we have an article that is 10 paragraphs long. While 5 paragraphs are devoted to a majority perspective, and 5 are devoted to a minority perpective. This is clearly a violation of WP:NPOV#Undue_weight. But should it be solved?</p>
<p>One solution is clearly that we can add majority views, so that the majority receives due prominence in the article. But let's say that users are unable to find more material on what the majorioty believes. Should we then begin to remove the minority perspective, although it is sourced to Reliable Sources? <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 17:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's rare that removing sourced information is a good thing. If you can't find more sources on the majority view, you could tag the section as {{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnbalanced_cf71.html" title="Template:Unbalanced">unbalanced</a>}}, explain the problem on the talk page, and that will attract the attention of editors and readers who might be able to help. Hope that helps! --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 18:23, 23 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)
<dl>
<dd>This is something of a tricky situation. In my opinion, if you can't fix the situation yourself tagging the page is better than removing information in an attempt to balance it, as long as that information is well sourced. As for moving the information, you need to be careful. Moving it into another article that expressed a non-<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> would be a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV fork</a>, and therefore strongly discouraged. However, in some circumstances it would make sense to create an article <i>about</i> the minority point of view. For instance, there are articles like <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> that discuss a certain point of view without violating neutrality rules. Hope that helps! --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 09:27, 26 February 2007 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</dd>

<dd>What false statements does Ali sina make? Give me one example. I think its pretty clear that the article is about the website and its claims and stuff.

<dd>I would say with personal experience that the statement is generally true - and its obvious he was talking in a general sense. Not all Muslims lack pride and self-esteem and also there are many degrees of Muslims. There would be some with a lot of good healthy self-esteem, for example. Saying that all Muslims have 0 pride is not true, however thats not what Ali said. I think we're going into debate now which I wont do. Since the article is about Ali Sina, its relevant to quote him and the website. You can work on a Criticism section in that article, but be sure to follow standard wiki policies, which you know already. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 18:11, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Trying to get your attention towards the Faith Freedom page. My eidts are being deleted for no reason. I have made some comments regarding the article and its presentation. which violates many of the Wiki rules.</p>
<p>would you like to discuss. I am not against deleting the article or anything. Rather i am for putting the article in its right perspective. for example.1) the article alleges that it has 20,000,000 visitors. I agree however i state that it has only 1200 members who write ever wrote on its fourmns. I state that all the stuff on the website is read around only 10,000 times out of the 20,000,000 visitors it had. all this has been referenced by me (site meter is the ref:)Aditionally each visitor spends 5 minutes or less on the entire site and less than 5 seonds on each page.</p>
<p>Then there are violations of references. No outside references are given. If given they are reports of Ali sina himself. How can that be credible when speaking about his own self. Z2qc1</p>

<p>Is the poroposed compatible the physical description of Muhammad which has higher notability and credibility than the image srouce?</p>

<b>Meaning:</b></p>
<p>Is the image more notable than the cartoon images of Jylland Posten and Bahomet?</p>
<p>This means, if some biased editors want to dictate the pictures on the basis of notability then better put those cartoon or Jylland posten images, so that a reader can run away after coming to know what stupidity wikipeida has. The cartoon or Bahomen image will tell all the story how reliable is wikipedia, instead of deceiving the readers by not putting the cartoon/bahomet image and giving the wrong information to the reader at the same time. It is better to make the reader aware from the start how biased wikipedia article is about Muhammad.

<dd>Thanks for your message. I have revised my comments at the deletion vote, but I still feel that an article on that topic would be an appropriate one for Wikipedia. The related articles do not quite have the same topic. On such a topic thre are certain to be strong differences of opinion, and I agree with your concerns about POV issues and a lack of references. The {{fact}} tag is useful to highlight questionable statements, and a discussion page can be used to try and arrive at compromise language. Failing that, there is always the option of adding your text (fully referenced) which contradicts what someone else's reference claims. I wonder also if you mightn't object to some of the "see also:" references at the end of the article as not meeting standards of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>? I believe I have seen coverage of the topic in Time, Newsweek, the New York Times, and similar European publications which are generally accepted as reliable sources. Many religions have extremists, or terrorists, or militants, or fundamentalists, and these four categories are not always the same.

<p>To answer your question on 06:28, 25 March 2007: No, WP:NOR is neither ridiculous nor offensive, and infact works extremely well 99.99% of the time.

<p>Hi, I see JayJG has been leaving messages on your page, with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness. In reality, JayJG is a rabid Zionist and is trying to purge Wikipedia of any negative information about Zionism, and is trying to paint Muslims in a bad light. Along with many of his cohorts.</p>
<p>The problem is that JayJG is part of the Wikipedia cabal. When there were elections, despite massive efforts to the contrary, a number of people got a higher vote percentage than JayJG - but Jimbo Wales put him on ArbCom anyhow. Jimbo has shown his true colors as well.</p>
<p>These people control Wikipedia. They are all together, and attacking you. No one is coming to your aid. This is because they control Wikipedia, with Jimbo at the center, and have more or less driven off everyone else. You are banging your head against a wall here - any massacre by Zionists against Palestinians will be covered up, distorted, justified etc., anyone who attacks an Israeli soldier will be castigated here.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative, like a wiki encyclopedia that is not pro-Zionist and anti-Muslim like this one. Or if you do continue here for a little bit, to spend less time. It is better to waste 5 hours of time accomplishing nothing than 10. Eventually you will give up here, everyone does.

<p>Seems that most comments (including those by WAS, Alf, Slim, etc.) agree that the sources do not need to be bowdlerized, even if they "give you the shivers" as Alf says. I think the best thing that you could do for the article would be to bring some suitable sources about the good that Sudais does. FOr example, I've asked on the talk page that the part about his renditions of the Qur'an be sourced; they have been tagged since February. That is obviously a good thing that Sudais does. I'm sure there is much more that can be expanded about his work in the university and the mosques. He preaches about many things besides Jews, I hope, and his calls for charity and the like should be represented. Also, there still is little to no mention of his family. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 04:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Alf and slim specifically reference the overwhelming for example " but one cannot exclude some aspects of it because it is "too much"" (Alf). It seems that those who cared to pass comment believe that the article as it stands is not overwhelmed in wiki standards. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 05:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wiki policy is discussed, and consensus reached, by people, so there will never be 100% consistency. If there is an issue that you have with Gilbert, why don't you post a link to the BLP talk section on the Gilbert talk page and ask for comment? -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 05:11, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
