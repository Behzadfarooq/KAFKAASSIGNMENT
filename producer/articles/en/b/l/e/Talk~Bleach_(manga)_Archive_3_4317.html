<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bount/Bound</span></h2>
<p>I reverted an anon who changed all of the word "Bount" to "Bound", but then realized that we aren't consistent throughout the Bleach articles, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_series_2c58.html" title="Characters in Bleach series">Characters in Bleach series</a>, etc. I don't have any clue as to which is the more correct translation, and we obviously don't know what they'll be using in the english dubbed anime yet. Anyway, someone with better knowledge of both the Japanese language and Wikipedia policy for such things please suggest which spelling would be best. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 08:54, 6 April 2006 (UTC) Ehh, for now, I'm unreverting it, since the Characters article has Bound consistently already. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 08:56, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>well, as i have watched the series, the word the characters use is 'bounto', so i think that we should revert the articles to 'bounto'. anyone agree? OmniAngel 13:23, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, that's how it's pronounced, but not necessarily spelled. The only recent editor who has any Japanese userbox at all is <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a>, who might give us some insight. I just like to make sure an edit is correct before I do it, especially if its a bunch of them. You can probably change it whatever you want (keeping it consistent, of course), since that's what a few anons have been doing anyway, until we figure out what its supposed be (but i'd rather wait). --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 15:15, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Anaraug pointed out, pronunciation isn't the same as spelling. Look at Etna from Disgaia, named after Mount Etna but pronounced Etona in Japanese. Or Bulma from Dragon Ball, pronounced Buruma but clearly spelled as Bulma. Japanese pronunciation is limited by their phonetic alphabet, you simply can't use it as a basis for spellings. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu</a> 23:58, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since <i>baunto</i> is not a Japanese word, we cannot know (unless there's a source outside of the Bleach anime) how it's supposed to be spelt in English. However, Bound is definitely wrong. It was only consistent throughout Characters in Bleach series, because someone changed it recently (probably the same person who changed it in BLEACH, I haven't looked yet). I think so far Bount, Bounto or Baunto are logical, anything else is wrong, although Dattebayo seems to think it's Bauntō, so that may also be an option (although Dattebayo is inconsistent, I doubt they should be taken seriously). Lunar used Bount until it stopped subbing Bleach. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 14:01, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm going to hazard an educated (German+Japanese+English) guess here. First of all, I think you're certainly correct to eliminate Bound and any variation of it. The long mark also has to go (it's definitely 'baunto' and not 'bauntou'). That leaves, Baunt, Bount, Bounto, and Baunto. If we assume that this name is of German derivation, like most things associated with the Bount seem to be, we can eliminate the final 'o' as a kana alteration. The German spelling that would cause a romanization of 'baunto' is 'baunt,' rather than 'bount'. Therefore, IF you accept the premise that the name's derivation is German, as well as the premacy of the author's preferred spelling over the English spelling, 'baunt' would seem to be the best romanization. I think 'bount' is the simplest for the average person trying to find out about Bleach... but 'baunt' is the most correct. --Anon in Japan who wishes he had an account now, 28 July 2006
<dl>
<dd>And if you want an account, well, make one I guess. It takes all of 3 seconds. I'll just comment that whatever decision you make, we need to actually write an article about the Bau/ou/ow/nt/o/ou soon. (and some character articles as well) Though we seem to be getting close enough to the end of the filler that we could almost wait until then. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 04:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Heaven</span></h2>
<p>In anime episode 62, Aizen escapes saying that he's going to take the throne of heaven, as he goes to a different place--which implies to me that heaven is not the same thing as Soul Society, contrary to what these articles say. (And it is 'ten' in Japanese.) <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 06:49, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I interpreted it as a metaphor, as he's planning on gaining so much power as to become godlike, and heaven of course would be where a god would live. But yeah, maybe its an actual place, we need more info in order to say it for sure, but maybe it deserves mention, I'm not sure. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 07:00, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Define heavan? Bleach Mythology has four planes of existance. The living world and Soul society where souls sling shot back and fourth for all eternity die in one world and are reborn in the other souls may be created in either (based on shinigami and others in SS ageing but many others claming never to age in SS). The hollow world which seems to be the space between the worlds and Hell where no soul may leave. Therefore its fair to say the closest thing to a western idea of heavan (Where the good souls go) Is Soul society Rukia and Ichigo both refer to soul society as heavan but Rukia says its like heavan. Hinting that the human idea doesnt exist but SS is close (SS is 60-80% better than earth or somthing like that i think without checking of course). I think its metaphorical, he is saying he will attain ultimate power. (Of course even hollow/shinigami hybrids like Vizard and Ichigo have limits as well)--<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Turner_a056.html" title="User:Seth Turner">Seth Turner</a> 20:05, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I think the problem that we all are running into is that soul society does not represent the view of heaven which many people in Western society envision. I agree with Anaraug, I think that when Aizen says he will take the throne of heaven, he means that he wants to become godlike. There are many who believe that there is a god who rules over us all... perhaps this is Aizen's goal: to become powerful enough to rule over not only soul society, but all worlds where souls exists. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleachBaby_9f95.html" title="User:BleachBaby">Bleach Babe</a> 01:16, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He was speaking in metaphor. There is no Bleach heaven that we know of, and we should not mention it in the articles unless it is explicitly stated as being real in the manga. (Did anyone else notice that Aizen's speech was quite like <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucifer.html" title="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>'s Biblical monologue, in which he says he will surpass the most high God?) --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 00:48, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm pretty sure that's either from Dante or Milton (can't remember which), not the Bible. I didn't notice it at the time -- haven't read anything like that in ages. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 02:09, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nope, it's in the Bible, from Isaiah 14. Milton's famous devil monologue had more to do with the devil as a victim of circumstances (he made him an anti-hero), and Dante's most referenced quote is probably "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."</dd>

<p>You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God... ...I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High." Isaiah 14:13-14, NIV. The question now is, should we mention the parallel or not?--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 05:21, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In one of the fansub anime episodes I saw the old guy, Yamma? commander general of the 13 squads, said that they didn't have to worry about Aizen for at least a year because to ascend to "true heaven" required a lot of preperations. I'll grant that it could be mistranslated or the anime guys taking some creative license but there was no mention of this in the Manga? Jargon 06:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Failure" id="Failure"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Failure</span></h2>
<p>I just realized, after some IP user's edit of the Renji Abarai page (to say that he was moved to the 6th division and not 11th), that maybe so many users are changing the info in the Bleach-related pages because most of our information is unreliable, and therefore the idea of the Bleach-related pages is so far a failure. Therefore, I implore the regular editors to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediately grill any edits that are not entirely correct, are misleading, etc. <b>This means revert or delete them!!!</b></li>
<li>Check the current articles for such information and grill it too. If it is sourced, obviously check the source first before changing.</li>
<li>If you make an edit of a non-copyedit nature (i.e. actually add new content), make sure to source it, unless it covers a major part of the story which everybody knows about.</li>
<li>If you see anything that could be disputed in the current articles, and know where to find the information, find it and source it.</li>
<li>A special request from me, try to find the place where Aramaki states his seat (I'm sure he does somewhere), because I can't seem to find it.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to source, write:<br />
&lt;ref name="ANYNAME"&gt;<i>BLEACH</i> manga; chapter XX(X), page X(X).&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
or<br />
&lt;ref name="ANYNAME"&gt;<i>BLEACH</i> databook; page X(XX).&lt;/ref&gt;<br />
Same with anime, external publications, etc.</p>
<p>If the article doesn't have a ==References== section, add near the bottom:<br />
==References==<br />
&lt;references /&gt;</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, <b>do not</b> use any fansite or other non-official Bleach website as a source.</p>
<p>I'll now be checking articles trying to source stuff, and removing some info I'm not sure about. If I remove anything important, feel free to re-add it with a source.</p>

<dd>Poor Ynhockey, always talking to himself... You're very committed, and we do appreciate you. Good advice. And of course, rereading the Bleach manga up to this point would also be a good piece of advice. I think many of the errors are merely the result of people trying to work from material they are remembering that they haven't read in weeks or months.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 04:46, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yeah, you're right. Also, by "not entirely correct", you basically mean any speculation of any kind. This sometimes poses a problem for me, since I'm a few episodes/chapters behind, and will probably be that way until summer starts, so sometimes I don't know if something new has been revealed or not. I'm sure this applies to a few other users too, so basically I might see an edit, and I have no idea whether its valid or not -- that might explain why some bad edits are getting through. Sorry. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 12:30, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the warm comments. It isn't that bad though that you're behind on the series - you can still remove a lot of speculative edits. Basically a simple outline:
<ul>
<li>Anything with the word 'fan', 'speculate', 'it is thought', 'it is believed', etc. There are a few speculations which are legitimate as they have substantial basis, but they are very few and by reading them you can probably understand that they are important. For instance, the Zaraki vs. Gin/Tousen paragraph which keeps being deleted.</li>
<li>Any edit by an unregistered user should be suspect by default. I'm not saying it will be bad, because some IP users have made great helpful edits, but most of them either vandalize or insert fancruft which has no place here. Spelling, grammar and style are also very important to watch out for where IP users are concerned.</li>
<li>If you doubt an edit, you can always bring it up in talk, and if no one replies in a few days, grill it.</li>

<p><i>Moved to left</i> Also, standards are very important.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bleach (manga) vs. BLEACH</span></h2>
<p>While I am neutral on this issue, I am an advocate of standards, and therefore am curious to know why the title was reverted without discussion to the old one. This kind of action is rather harmful because it means we'll have to change a hundred or so BLEACHes to Bleach (manga) again, even though the move has not reached consensus and therefore we might need to move Bleach (manga) to BLEACH again later. Let's first vote and then see what comes out. Meanwhile, please don't move the article or change instances of BLEACH to Bleach (manga). -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 12:34, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to request that all users give a brief reason as to why they support the title that they do. Since we seem to be tied or nearly tied, a clear sign that there is presently no consensus, we may have to settle this by discussion rather than vote, and having reasons given would be a good starting point for such a discussion. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 00:50, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Suggestion: can we discount votes, in a manner similar to AfD? I am seeing some votes by very new users and users who have never edited a bleach article in their histories. Do we really want to "ballot stuff"?

<dd>In this case, I think you're right, because there is an apparent tie. Although in general, voting counts whether or not the user has edited the articles in question. My List of Bleach characters in the Hebrew Wiki was deleted (on the basis of notability after an AfD vote) even though none of the users who voted actually edited the page (other than myself). -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 03:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Neutral votes don't help, but I'd just like to comment on the options: BLEACH is contrary to some Wiki standards, although it is justified by the common spelling policy. It is also easier for the editors to work with BLEACH. Bleach (manga) is more 'English', and adheres to all Wiki standards and guidelines (not as important as policies but sometimes may be more important). It is however harder to work with Bleach (manga). Please take these things into account before voting.</li>

Bleach is a prefectly acceptable capitalisation and from my experiences from fansites and online bookstores the most common way to write in English text. Wikipedia seems to generally frown on the usage of all caps where it isn't necessary. Other manga articles doesn't use all caps in their titles. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeltz_23d5.html" title="User:Jeltz">Jeltz</a> <a href="../../../j/e/l/User_talk%7EJeltz_3bb8.html" title="User talk:Jeltz"><small>talk</small></a> 16:24, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I can tell, the perception that BLEACH is the proper capitalization comes from two sources. Primarily, from the title graphic. However it is not uncommon for normal names to be displayed in all-caps when in logo form. <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> being a good example of this. The second source is that Bleach is always written in all-caps when it is mixed within <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html" title="Kanji">kanji</a>. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.jp.playstation.com/scej/title/bleach/hanatareshi/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jp.playstation.com/scej/title/bleach/hanatareshi/index.html" rel="nofollow">PS2 game's site</a> for an example of this. However, this is not unusual. Roman characters are almost always in all-caps when mixed with kanji. So... unless there is another source outside of the title logo and kanji, we'll have to assume that ブリーチ is written as "Bleach" in English. Oh, and since the article is about both the manga and the anime, it shouldn't just be called "Bleach (manga)". I suggest <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28series%29.html" title="Bleach (series)">Bleach (series)</a>, as this can refer to both <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_series.html" title="Book series">book series</a>. -- <i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 23:50, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>I have no problem with the (series) specification, though it should be noted that in most game and book articles, it is used to specify between articles on a series and articles on the original title that is the series's namesake. So by what seems to be the common usage, (series) would be used to disambig. between Title (series) and Title (book), not Title (series) and Title (real-world location of same name). -<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a>

<dd>How many people are for "BLEACH" just because it will be easier on editors? I see no one claiming that BLEACH is the <i>correct</i> way of doing things. If Wikipedia has to choose between doing things the easy way and doing things the right way, it should choose the latter. Articles are supposedly written for a much larger audience than just the editors, and we have a responsibility to give this audience correct information. By writing "BLEACH" we are indirectly telling them that this is the correct, which it is not. Is typing <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28series%29.html" title="Bleach (series)">Bleach</a> once per article really that hard? -- <i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 14:50, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>I like Bleach (manga) because it is the right way of doing this. NO ONE uses BLEACH to describe this manga; it is written as such on covers but that is a stylistic/artistic matter. In actual practice, Bleach is the spelling of choice, and I would go as far as to say the "correct" way of spelling it. If nothing else, BLEACH is obnoxiously loud and disuniform. Additionally, most of the pages on wiki are Series name (manga), even for those that have anime series; this is because anime series are usually derived from manga. If it is the opposite, I'm sure that simply the series name or Series name (anime) would be used. It's a matter of uniformity, along with what's right. If we get concensus, changing all of the articles from even the 10 or so editors here would not be hard, since it would only be a one-time deal <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a> 03:31, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I pick Bleach (series) as it's more encompassing and doesn't leave out anime (a certain user asked the valid question, why we have anime-only info in an article about manga). -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 08:37, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I promote Bleach (manga) on the basis that the manga is the original form for the media. Furthermore, the (series) designation seems to usually be used when referring to series of books that have the series's title as the name of the first book as well. I don't mind either way though. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 09:03, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To begin with, it seems that (manga) is the convention, but it is not necessarily "standard" nor "correct". Here is a list of manga that have been animated that use the (manga) disambiguation to refer to both the manga and anime:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28manga%29.html" title="Berserk (manga)">Berserk (manga)</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slam_Dunk_%28manga%29_52b2.html" title="Slam Dunk (manga)">Slam Dunk (manga)</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/u/Touch_%28manga%29.html" title="Touch (manga)">Touch (manga)</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The (series) disambiguation has traditionally been used for book series, but that is not necessarily a problem, as the Bleach manga is technically a series of Japanese <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic <b>books</b></a>. Regardless, (series) it is not exclusive to books. My best example of this is <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mega_Man_%28series%29_3a71.html" title="Mega Man (series)">Mega Man (series)</a> which covers all the different video game series, the television series, the American comic series, the manga and the anime.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Though, if there is a Japanese word for the superclass of manga and anime, that might be preferable. To further complicate the issue, series might still not be a perfect choice since this page will likely cover <i>Bleach: The Movie</i> as well, when it comes out. The designation (<a href="../../../s/h/%C5%8D/Sh%C5%8Dnen.html" title="Shōnen">shōnen</a>) might be more accurate (with a redirect from "shonen" of course) as it refers specifically to what Bleach is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think series would work the best of all the known alternatives, but if we can't find a clear answer, we should probably stick with manga just because that's what everyone else is doing. We can jump off a bridge while we're at it.&#160;:D –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 14:24, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>I think using shōnen is problematic because it's a genre, if that was the standard then we'd have stuff like <i>The Da Vinci Code (thriller)</i> instead of <i>The Da Vinci Code (film)</i>. I think using genres in general to describe anything should be kept to a minimum, partly due to the uncertainty of the genre for certain works, and the fact that many works can be put into various genres. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 14:29, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like manga, because it follows precedent and it is The Original. We make the distinction of canon based on the manga, and any page we make will be heavily manga-centric.

<dd>What I mean is, use Bleach (manga) and for the pages of Bleach (series) and BLEACH, redirect it to Bleach (manga). Of course, that is already being done so that's a moot point. As for how we write/link it in articles, it doesn't much matter. All we need is a <b>{{BLEACH / Bleach (manga) / Bleach (series)|Bleach}}</b> and ta-da! Of course, it would be better to have all the links direct to Bleach (manga), but if we want to be lazy, that would work too. <b><a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a></b> | <a href="../../../h/o/b/User_talk%7EHobbeslover_fb13.html" title="User talk:Hobbeslover">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hobbeslover_dec5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hobbeslover">(contribs)</a> 03:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't understand Japanese, so it's a little hard to do research into the meaning of a term, but it seems that the term "manga" can refer to animation. In English, the term "manga" is exclusively used to refer to Japanese, hand drawn graphical novels drawn in the recognizable style popularized by the like of <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osamu_Tezuka_fd57.html" title="Osamu Tezuka">Tezuka</a> and others. This is far too specific to be the reality of the term in Japan. The <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manga" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:manga">literal meaning</a> of the term is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%BC%AB" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:漫">漫</a> (<i>man-</i>) "random, uncontrolled" + <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:画">画</a> (<i>-ga</i>) "picture, sketch". From this, the original intention seems to be "unrealistic art".</p>
<p>Microsoft seems to support my theory in their dictionary entry for <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/manga.html" class="external text" title="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/manga.html" rel="nofollow">manga</a>. Here, they say that manga is "Japanese comic books or cartoons: a <b>Japanese style</b> of comic books or <b>animated cartoons</b>, often very violent or erotic". In their definition, they suggest that "manga" is primarily a "<a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting_style.html" title="Painting style">style</a>". Secondly, the point out that it can refer to both still art and animation. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 22:14, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>Yes and no: Yes, Wikipedia's search engine is case-sensitive, apart from the first letter, which is automatically made a majuscule (some software issue when Wikipedia was first designed makes all articles begin with a capital; this was fixed for Wiktionary). No, the argument is more about common use vs. naming conventions (two of Wikipedia's key topics regarding page names).</dd>

<p>Strictly speaking, the word manga is never used to describe or include anime the same way you'd never call a movie a novel. They are two different types of media. That being said, I personally support in renaming the section into Bleach (series) to better reflect the state of the Bleach franchise. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 12:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Character articles</span></h2>
<p>Really, this has got to stop. Users are trying to create articles on minor characters which don't need to have articles. A great example is <a href="../../../d/-/r/D-Roy_3a21.html" title="D-Roy">D-Roy</a>, and now <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupi_%28Bleach%29_2bd2.html" title="Rupi (Bleach)">Rupi (Bleach)</a>. Especially in D-Roy's case, there is absolutely no more potential information that can be added. I have already AfD'd it, but the result was no consensus (none of the Bleach regulars seemed to vote there too). We should discuss it here and reach a clear consensus. My proposal is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge all current arrancar articles (and delete them) except Grimmjow and Ulquiorra into Arrancar assaults on the human world.</li>
<li>This article will have two sections: first assault (Ulquiorra/Yammy), second assault, and third assault.</li>
<li>It will have a short description of each arrancar with all the info we know, but not spread as thinly as now.</li>
<li>This can turn into a fairly long and conprehensive article on a Bleach fictional event which includes several character bios, rather than have a million articles which will, even if the information is spread very thinly like it is now, have almost no useful information.</li>
<li>If support to this idea is given, make a mass-nom and cite this discussion.</li>

<dd>I kinda agree with Gunslinger. I'm not really sure if making a new article on the arrancar assaults is a good idea.

The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_series_2c58.html" title="Characters in Bleach series">Characters in Bleach series</a> page (Big Page) is meant for minor characters, and we should delete all of the character pages for minor characters and fold everything back into the Big Page. Not sure if Rupi deserves a page. I think we should hold off for a few more chapters until we can see a significance. For all we know, she could be killed in the next chapter.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I've been learning a bit of Japanese recently and decided to take a closer look at this word. I think you may be transliterating it wrong. The reading of the last character (動) appears to be dou (どう) not just dō (ど). This means that the proper transliteration may be "Onmitsukidou". This term gets more matches in Google, if that counts for anything. This might help us understand the word better. Both "onmitsu" and "kidou" are Japanese terms.

<dd>* <b>Response</b>. 動 is indeed read as どう. Dō is also read as どう. Dou and dō are exactly the same. For what it's worth, the term "onmitsu" was used in the Edo period to refer to samurai who acted as spies (lit., according to my Japanese-Japanese dictionary, "deeply studied the comings and goings") under the control of the shogun. "Kidou" refers to people and weapons invested in quickly responding to a situation. These both give an implication of "the secret service," which would be a good representation of their role in Bleach. --Anon in Japan, [who now has an account. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 05:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)]</dd>

<dd>And for a more cynical review: The first three arcs are the most significant of the anime. The first, titled <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bleach_episodes_4f9c.html#Arc_1:_Agent_of_the_Shinigami" title="List of Bleach episodes">Agent of the Shinigami</a>, is nothing too special (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/IMHO" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:IMHO">IMHO</a>, of course), however the series becomes very engaging after <a href="../../../r/u/k/Rukia_Kuchiki_df0d.html" title="Rukia Kuchiki">Rukia Kuchiki</a> leaves to Soul Society. This period is covered by the following two arcs; <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bleach_episodes_4f9c.html#Arc_2:_Soul_Society:_The_Sneak_Entry" title="List of Bleach episodes">Arc 2: Soul Society: The Sneak Entry</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bleach_episodes_4f9c.html#Arc_3:_Soul_Society:_The_Rescue" title="List of Bleach episodes">Arc 3: Soul Society: The Rescue</a>. This period is <a href="../../../s/h/%C5%8D/Sh%C5%8Dnen.html" title="Shōnen">shōnen</a> at its best, and I highly recommend it.</dd>
<dd>At this point, the anime had caught up to the manga it was based off of and it entered into a fourth arc regarding the vampire-like <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bount.html" title="Bount">Bount</a>. These episodes are <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filler_%28media%29.html" title="Filler (media)">filler</a> and I don't personally recommend it.

<dd>It's in the Japanese version too. Foreign names in Bleach are usually listed in kanji, but these kanji given furigana, and this is where you see the Spanish words. The most interesting thing is that the arrancar sometimes speak katakana-over-katakana; while the basic text might say "lucky" in transliterated English, it's given Spanish furigana.

<dd>I guessed that rain was their intention from the common theme of clouds and stars. "Ririn" is, admittedly, quite far from rain. However, on the other hand, <a href="../../../k/a/k/Kakarotto.html" title="Kakarotto">Kakarotto</a> is no where near carrot, yet it is still derived from the word. It seems to make sense, but as I suggested, I'm not sure if it should be mentioned, even if it is true. Also, we'd still need an external reference.<br />
My only other guess regarding Ririn's name is it has similar origins as <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yachiru_Kusajishi_f297.html" title="Yachiru Kusajishi">Yachiru</a>'s nickname for Chad, "moririn". –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 05:26, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>Well, Kakarotto is actually pretty close to carrot - because Japanese doesn't double Rs, doesn't have a C, etc., and an ending T can usually be written as 'to' or 'tto', English Kacarrot would also be Kakarotto in Japanese. I don't know what the beginning 'ka' is for, but the rest of the word is a 100% accurate transliteration. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 10:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that Akira didn't try to make a perfect translation, but rather derived Goku's saiyan name from the English word. I propose that Ririn is derived from "rain" (or "rein" as they say it). A couple friends and I were discussing this, suspecting a pattern with the three modsoul's names.</dd>
<dd>Claude's name (Kurōdo) is very similar to the Japanese pronunciation of cloud (kuraudo). Nova (Nōba) seems to inarguably be referencing the word "nova". Both of these are English (or at least, non-Japanese) words describing heavenly entities. Assuming Ririn's name follows the same pattern, there is one obvious choice.

<p>I removed the template tag "in progress TV show" for the following reasons, which should be considered before re-adding:</p>
<p>1. This page is titled Bleach (manga), not Bleach (anime). A more apt template would be something like "in progress serialized story".</p>
<p>2. It looks ugly.</p>
<p>3. We do our best to keep speculation off the main page, and driven into the corners of the character articles, if present at all. It just makes us look bad to slap a big speculation warning on the main article when, compared to other series at least, we have almost none. Similarly, the main Bleach article is remarkably stable. For an example, compare the article history with <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto.html" title="Naruto">Naruto</a>: We have less edits in the last week than they did in the last 2 days.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ordering of main characters</span></h2>
<p>Currently, the "main characters" are ordered alphabetically by first name. This is not necessarily a perfect solution but was selected because the alternative is a completely arbitrary order. We might as well make it official and discuss it. I suggest we leave it as it is for now simply because order is really not important enough to warrant more elaborate solutions. However. not having an official, fixed ordering will just result in people constantly mucking with the order in an arbitrary fashion. Anyway, other viable options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>order by appearance in the manga</li>
<li>order used on official websites</li>
<li>popularity determined by number of Google results</li>
<li>amount of "screen time"</li>

<dl>
<dd>I think they should be ordered first by race and then by importance/prominence (determined by amount of screen time, back story given, independence from the main character, introduction time, etc). I admit that using this scheme will be fairly difficult when dealing with only five characters, and in such a case I think the race should be scrapped and the order should be: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki (the two primary characters who started the story), followed by Ishida (although arguably not as important as Orihime and certain other characters, he is a rival to the main character and moves independetly, which raises his importance significantly), then Orihime and Chad (introduced at almost the same time, both serve as auxiliaries to the main character and train together, etc.) -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 08:33, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would support order of introduction myself. Which would be... Ichigo, Rukia, Orihime, Chad, Ishida, correct? Order of importance raises some POV concerns. Popularity would mean Hitsugaya was a main character, and screen time would put Renji in the main characters, above Chad, Rukia, and Ishida. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 09:04, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that's another matter entirely. Just who will we include in the <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html#Characters" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach (manga)#Characters</a> subsection? Renji does indeed appear to be more of a "main character" than Rukia, Chad and Ishida by some measures. But anyway, we should discuss that after we reach a consensus on ordering.

<p>As for the issue of filler characters in general, I think we will probably need to make articles on Kariya and Yoshino, maybe Utagawa and Ichinose as well. By writing these articles, if we focus most of the filler summary into them, we can significantly improve the article quality of several other characters, who will no longer be forced to explain every detail about their opponents within their articles. Those 2-4 are major characters within the arc itself, and have significant backstories, major impacts on the plot, or relationships with other characters that should be described somewhere, and that somewhere should <i>not</i> have to be the other character's article. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 07:34, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spotty placement of kanji</span></h2>
<p>The main page uses a few Japanese terms (Kubo's name, Karakura town, etc.), but other terms for which kanji could easily be provided (Shinigami, character names, etc.) are not included.

<dd>I haven't really thought about that. Now that I do, I think we should remove all the kanji from the main article. The only Japanese letters that should remain are the spelling of Bleach (ブリーチ) and 魂葬 (<i>konsō</i>) because there's no main Plus article (and by the way, shouldn't be, one existed before and was deleted). -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 20:27, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In that case, let's remove Karakura, which serves no purpose. <i>Inga no kusari</i> is also written out in the Plus section. Is "Chain of Fate" the official translation in the English version? It's not a very good explanation of the term. <i>Inga</i> usually means "cause and effect," and can also mean "karma" when used in a religious context. Thus the Japanese term implies "reaping what you sow," which is quite different from "fate." If that's the official translation, I suppose it can stay and <i>inga no kusari</i> can go. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 01:25, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re: reference removal. It was once again a standardization choice. I'm confused as to why the name of the town, which is mentioned many times, needs a citation. Soul Society doesn't have a reference to page 96 of the databook, and so on throughout the article. I guessed that the person who added the reference was sourcing the kanji, rather than the name of the town. It's a choice which would probably make sense to people reading the English version of the manga. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 10:03, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Genre discussion</span></h2>
<p>Some people have been editing the genre box in the template to include things like comedy and fantasy. While I agree that Bleach isn't comedy, I think there needs to be another tag besides the shōnen and action tags. In his last revert Ynhockey implied that the shōnen tag encompasses the fantasy aspect of Bleach, but I don't believe that's really the case. Many popular shōnen comics have no supernatural elements at all (things like Initial D, GTO, Bebop High School, etc.). Those that do have fantasy elements (say, Kenshin) often have a fantasy tag in their genre boxes. Those manga that are most similar to Bleach (the "Shinigami genre") at least have something to note that they aren't realistic. For example, Death Note is listed as "supernatural," and YūYū Hakusho is listed as "paranormal." If "fantasy" carries too much of a Princess Bride-style connotation, couldn't one of these be included? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 04:30, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mind 'supernatural' or 'paranormal'. Although I think there should be some kind of standard for tagging anime series like this.

<dd>Paranormal ("outside normal sensory channels;" "beyond the range of normal experience or scientific explanation") seems to be a better fit than supernatural, which can imply divinity, but this is only the case when "death god" is used as in Bleach, with no real implication of divinity.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terminology (again) - gigai</span></h2>

<ul>
<li>Artificial body is a direct translation of <i>gigai</i>, no string attached</li>
<li>It sounds better in English</li>

<dd>I'm in support of using <i>gigai</i>, personally. There's no direct English equivalent for it, and it is not hard to pronounce. Basically for the same reasons I support using "shinigami" over "death god" or whatever. "Artificial body" doesn't seem like a term that real people would ever commonly use (from the perspective of the fictional universe). The dubber's selection of "faux body" seems to be trying to solve that problem. A smarter decision for them would have just been to use the word <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mannequin" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:mannequin">mannequin</a>.

<dd>I agree with Gunslinger... when Rukia first says <i>gigai</i> to Ichigo, he doesn't have any idea what she's talking about, because it's pretty much a made-up word in Japanese too.

We have a decent amount of information on <i>gigai</i>. Who invented them, how long have they been in use by Soul Society, the people in charge of their creation and maintinance, the various types of <i>gigai</i> (normal and Urahara's hilarious deflatable ones), their significance to the plot of <i>Bleach</i> (namely the one Urahara tried to trap Rukia with) and their relationship to mod. souls. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 14:37, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Then again, why go through all of that work? Artificial body is simple, self-explanatory, and perfect for the english readers who will look at <i>gigai</i> and go "WTF?" -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakaioultimodragon2050_9ebc.html" title="User:Makaioultimodragon2050">Makaio</a> 00:54, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are many English words as well that English readers would look at and go "WTF", but that doesn't mean that we should replace them with simpler words that only approximate the meaning.

<dd>Actually since you mention it, Newspeak would be an awesome language to write an encyclopedia in. I mean, most human languages are complicated and this is good for literature and such, but for articles which are meant to present only facts, the elaboration is unnecessary.</dd>
<dd>On the actual subject - actually it's not just an approximation of the meaning, it's a direct translation. 義 (<i>gi</i>) means artificial when used as a prefix (<i>gishi</i> - artificial tooth, for instance), and 骸 (<i>kai</i>) means body. The fact that it carries certain connotations within Bleach is irrelevant because many such Bleach 'terms' do, which are usually translated - <i>hadō</i> (as blast or destruction/ive spell) for instance.</dd>

<dd>Well, that's one possible translation of 義, but it doesn't always mean artificial when used as a prefix (we have, e.g., the common words <i>gimu</i> and <i>giri</i>, obligation/duty). In fact, I'm looking at my kanjigen now, and the sixth definition of 義, the one you're referring to, reads "名目上の。<b>かりの。</b>人口の。" (emphasis added). In other words, even in the entry you want to look at, the meaning <i>temporary</i> (<i>kari no</i>) is listed before the meaning <i>artificial</i> (<i>jinkou no</i>). And <i>temporary</i> applies to <i>gigai</i> as much as <i>artificial</i> does.</dd>

<dd>I think it would get very crufty very fast. I am a big Bleach fan, but I don't think it makes Wikipedia more useful to have in-depth descriptions of each episode.

<p>Anyway, it would be a bad idea to make a bunch of individual pages for Bleach episodes. I say this because I could write a long page and throw random stuff in to make it huge and wonderful. But it descends from encyclopedic to fan work if it goes too far, such summaries for programs like <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a> and such are so incredibly expanded that sometimes they say the same thing in a different way 5 or 7 times. The episode list is perfect the way it is and could actually use some trimming. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakaioultimodragon2050_9ebc.html" title="User:Makaioultimodragon2050">Makaio</a> 07:26, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which is exactly why we should take a look at the guides that "worked" and learn from them. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate.html" title="Stargate">Stargate</a> is a good place to start. As for the episode list itself, I agree it requires a great deal of trimming down.

<dd>The problem with TV guides is that they have a strict anti-spoiler policy and therefore usually only summarize the first 1/3 or 1/4 of an episode. This is of course unacceptable for us. I agree however that some episode summaries need to be trimmed down. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 15:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yn, this is why I'm proposing the trim-down for episode list along with the episode summary/note pages for individual episodes. Also, I'm not talking about "THE" TV Guide in the US, but program guides/sneak-previews in general such as those you see in manga magazines.</dd>
<dd>Take 95 for instance. We wouldn't want to pile everything from Byakuya and Jin Kariya wounding one another, Ichigo joining in, the two bankai, Byakuya feels annoyed by Ichigo's joining in, etc. Those are not needed in the episode list. Instead, a short, brief description about Ichigo joining in, fight continues, along with few minor side details would be sufficient. For in depth information, it should be within individual episode info pages linked to the list page.</dd>
<dd>In essence, I'm supportive toward a system similar to that used by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes_00dc.html" title="List of Stargate SG-1 episodes">Stargate episode list</a>. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 16:13, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Basic problem: We would have just jacked up the number of Bleach articles to about 150, and no end is in sight for the anime either. You know how hard it would be to even maintain that many articles, let alone write, standardize, and de-cruft them? Articles about individual episodes of shows are probably the highest level of cruft you could possibly achieve. Constructing a large mass of low-quality articles when we can't even get the listed summaries right is just foolish.</p>
<p>Additionally, since we can inspect a noob flood from the 8th circle of Hell starting this Saturday, I really think our highest priority should be coming up with some way to explain how to write an article well to all the new people. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 16:24, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyway, I feel that the link provided agrees with what I was trying to say. For an episode article to work, it has to be based on something notable other than just the plot summary itself; if we are prepared to speak to Bleach's impact on culture, how Bleach is received by critics, or how it is produced, that is one thing; at this point, though, anything like that would be original research and/or unverifiable.</dd>
<dd>I'm glad I've established myself here a little bit before the newbies show up. Luckily, they won't know about anything past the first few episodes and thus probably won't try to rewrite too much.

<dd>My personal fears are a bunch of OMFG SPOILERS!!! complaints, and people writing excessively detailed character summaries based on the first episodes to the extent that we have on the latest.

<dd>This is exactly the kind of attitude we need to avoid. So what if we need to increase the number of articles? If you want to complain about the number of articles we need to maintain, we can simply follow that of the Japanese version of Bleach article and be done with it.</dd>
<dd>All I'm saying is, we can't have it both ways. There's no middle ground for the episode list. Either discard excessive information altogether, or preserve them by addition of summary guides for each episodes.</dd>
<dd>I personally favor the latter simply because from the point of view of a reader, it's helpful this way. As I've pointed out over and over again, there are successful examples out there, and we just need to follow them.</dd>
<dd>No matter what the outcome from this discussion is, bottom line, the episode list needs a huge makeover.</dd>
<dd>Also, hostility toward these so-called "newbs" isn't going to help anything. The "failure" section of this article pretty much sums up this problem, though I have yet to see anyone (including Yn himself) living up to that standard. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 16:51, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

It's a discussion on whether we should have this or not, and I'm merely pointing it out that it is something that has already been done in other wiki-sections, and that it should be done here as well. Did I say it has to be now? Not that I'm aware of.</dd>
<dd>Again, I'm all for cleaning up the episode list, but as I've said over and over again, it's best to accompany this along with individual episode summaries following the other successful examples in English Wiki. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 21:14, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All I'm trying to point out is that this is a fairly common practice with degree of success in many cases, and it shouldn't be discouraged. If we do this right, it would be a great achievement. If not, then oh well. Just don't come up with excuses like "excess pages" and "too much work to maintain", because if you're going to complain about workload, we can simply go it like the way they do it in the Japanese article and expect everyone to get the "actual" info from reading the manga/watching the anime itself. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 23:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The media information section has been getting bloated - names of the English voice actors when we never listed the names of the Japanese voice actors, when commercials were released for Adult Swim, etc. I think it really needs to be trimmed more than anything else.

<p>I've done a lot of cleanup in the media information section and removed the cleanup tag that was there. I think the most important thing that needs to be added is more information related to the manga's publication by Shonen Jump (which should probably be right at the top as the earliest and most important media info). Also, another media-related thing. Why is the number of chapters at 242? The issue with 242 in it hasn't been released yet in Japan. It has been ahead of the Japan publication by 1 for quite a while. If there's any reason this shouldn't be changed back to 241, let it be known.... <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 10:35, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

VIZ Media is jointly owned by Shueisha and Shogakukan, making it a pretty big conflict of interest for Shogakukan to give <i>Bleach</i> an award.

<dd>Dekimasu, don't be alarmed by the award... It's not really a self-promotion as the reward had been there for more than 50 years, and it is simply a award for the "best manga" of the year (by Shogakukan's standard). Granted, westerners might consider it to be some sort of conflict of interest, but to be honest with you, it's like the Pulitzer Prize for mangaka in Japan. After all, Shogakukan IS the oldest publisher in Japan.</dd>
<dd>Besides, Shueisha and Shogakukan split a long time ago, and had been funtioning as two separate companies ever since.

<dd>Yes, I noticed that almost nothing on Tuesday makes the top 10. Like I said, I know that the anime is popular because the kids I see every day still like it; the comment in the article referred to the anime and not the manga. It's fine if it's because it's filler (frankly, I hate the filler too), but the fact remains that saying "the ratings are going strong" is, in this case, as much POV as the "the English dub is good" comments we're talking about below.

<p>Don't blame the dubbers for this one. This occured back when Japanese distributors wanted to use English words on the merchandise. Almost all used the word soul reaper rather than death god. When Tite Kubo was approached about an English dub, he requested that the dub use soul reaper rather than death god since all the merchandise with English on it already said soul reaper. So not the dubs fault and this was decided years ago. Unfortunately, the term death god no longer has a place in this article and I believe it should remain that way.<a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 22:08, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gdo01, you really need to re-read the whole section... No one is advocating the usage of the term "death god" anywhere in the articles. While Shinigami literally means "death god" when you break the word apart, it's not "death god", but "god of death" or "grim reaper" in translation.</dd>
<dd>Just like what it states in the <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUse_English_179c.html" title="WP:Use English">WP:Use English</a>, the majority of editors/readers of the article are much more familar and comfortable with the japanese romaji term "shinigami" currently. Untill later when we have a sizable editors/readers prefer the usage of the term "soul reaper", it's better to keep it as it is.</dd>
<dd>As I've said over and over again, we can always hold a vote to see what people prefer. Currently, by the look of this article itself, the force behind keeping "shinigami" remain strong, though most of us do see it being eventually replaced. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 23:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Finestela-- Gdo01 may have been referring (very enthusiastically) to anons occasionally editing "death god" back in. It's pretty clear that all of the regular editors know the real deal... I think that "soul reaper" is quite a good translation because the term would both associate with "grim reaper", the English/American/European cultural equivalent, yet illustrates that they aren't <i>exactly</i> like the grim reaper either. I remember reading some policy about how we're supposed to use the official English translation in most cases, however there are exceptions and IIRC this is one. Really I think it would be equally "good" to have either term, but for now leaving it as "shinigami" clearly makes the most sense. In any case, Googling "shinigami bleach" gives about 20 times as many results as ""soul reaper" bleach". I don't think we should even consider changing it in all the articles until that figure changes. --<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnaraug_6363.html" title="User:Anaraug">Anaraug</a> 23:32, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What merchandise had soul reaper on it? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 14:20, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And Kubo himself originally translated shinigami as "death" in the title of the first chapter/tankobon (or, really, translated his English title "the death and the strawberry" as "shinigami to ichigo". He also translated shinigami as "dead" in chapter 99 (haha) according to <i>SOULs</i>. I'm not really clear on what distinction Finestela is trying to make between "death god" and "god of death" here. The reason "death god" or "grim reaper" would have been a better translation is that it explains and reinforces the surprise at finding out that the shinigami residents of Soul Society aren't all-powerful, immortal, etc. etc. "Soul Reaper" doesn't really carry any connotations and thus the nuance is lost. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 14:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My argument with (or rather to) Gdo01 is this: No one uses the "exact" word <b>Death God</b> anywhere in the article, except for that little line explaining what each individual words in the "Shinigami" kanji stands for. The issue here is between <b>Shinigami</b>, the original Japanese word in romaji, and <b>Soul Reaper</b>, the word used by official English version.</dd>
<dd>Not to mention <b>Death God</b> isn't really a proper English word to begin with (and a bad direct translation of the word also), and the constant reference to the phrase is not only misleading, but also not helping with the discussion. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinestela_a233.html" title="User:Finestela">Finestela</a> 20:42, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am still missing what makes it a bad translation and improper English.

<dd>The problem with saying "Rukia is a death god" as opposed to saying "Ares is a war god" is the fact that Ares is a god, and Rukia, clearly, is not. In Japan, <i>shinigami</i> is the idiomatic term used for the personification of death, i.e. the Grim Reaper. The literal decomposition is not highly important. Consider the word <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw.html" title="Straw">straw</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawberry.html" title="Strawberry">strawberry</a>. Translating that to Japanese as <i>warakinomi</i> (<i>lit.</i> berry of straw or straw-berry) would be incorrect.

They rendered the term as <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_of_Death_a663.html" title="Angel of Death">Angel of Death</a>, portraying the intention quite nicely.

<ul>
<li><s>as evidenced by Chad and Orihime</s> --&gt; overdetailed for an overview of the manga</li>
<li><s>In the case of a human soul removed from a body that isn't dead, this chain is tied to the person's body.</s> --&gt; not bad information in and of itself, but the first sentence says that a plus is the spirit of someone <i>who has died</i>.</li>
<li>moved information on balance between worlds to the settings section. this also shortened the plus section into one paragraph for the refactoring.</li>
<li><s>When captain- or lieutenant-rank shinigami travel to the human world, their power level is limited to 20% of their usual strength to avoid causing unnecessary influence or chaos. They must ask Soul Society for permission to "lift the limit" if they need to release their full power while in the human world.</s> i really don't think that's one of the five or six most important things we can say about the shinigami. this, again, shortened the shinigami section into a manageable paragraph for the refactoring.</li>
<li>removed references to character names in the Quincy section to make it more of an overview (links to the main article anyway).</li>
<li>moved the hollow section above the one for modified souls. this puts the sections in order of appearance like the characters, and the hollows have a very high importance anyway.</li>
<li><s>former Gotei 13, 5th Division Captain</s> --&gt; while there is a spoiler tag, i don't think we need to give up the biggest spoiler in the series. this way it's a little more vague while still being informative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes were small. I added a sentence about who the Shinigami are (please check for veracity) and changed wording in some other situations. Again, comments welcome. The page flow is nice, though. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 10:06, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The infobox is annoyingly long, and destroys the section formatting now. I've messed around with it for about 12 minutes, but can't get that Ichigo image to fit in without wrecking the page formatting. Is there some way to show/hide the publisher info so that it doesn't do that? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 08:58, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have an idea. It's been bothering me for a while anyway that there are no summaries of the main character pages, only links. There should be a blurb for each of the main characters just as there is a blurb for each of the character types and each of the locations. If there were ~5 sentences on Ichigo and each of the other main characters, the picture would fit perfectly next to his character summary. The characters are already summarized on many of the pages in other languages (the Spanish ones look really appropriate... if only I spoke Spanish). I could run one of them through babelfish and clean them up, I suppose. The page as it stands is under 20KB so making the page too long isn't an issue. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 09:11, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought of that myself, but I think it would be easier to simply remove the image of Ichigo. It's sort of out of place anyway. Placing one or two sentence character summaries for them would be a good idea, if you could come up with something that succinct. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 09:15, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I hate babelfish after all. Here's a sample of the translation. "Rukia Kuchiki: Rukia is one of the co-protagonists of the series. Sometimes it can be fries and other times it can get to risk his own life to save to somebody. It was sent to the Earth to face hollow and is from here that is developed the history of Bleach. They enchant the rabbits to him and it draws them whenever it has the opportunity. His brother is Byakuya Kuchiki and he unites a great bow to him to him." Still, would something this length be too long? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 09:18, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Never use babel fish. I speak a decent amount of spanish so I'll work on translating it now. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalevious_dbc7.html" title="User:Malevious">Malevious</a> 13:44, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Ichigo is the protagonist of the series. he has a very (somthing) and cold personality and somthing somthing social. in contrast to this, he is very protective of his family and friends who he would put his life on the line for without thinking. since he was little, he posessed the capacity to see spirits which makes him have a life out of the ordinary." Thats the best i could get some words i think are slang so i dunno what the mean, i think pasota means passonate or something but im not sure. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalevious_dbc7.html" title="User:Malevious">Malevious</a> 14:35, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Category name change?</span></h2>
<p>I think the main Bleach category should be renamed to <a href="../../../b/l/e/Category%7EBleach_%28manga%29_7565.html" title="Category:Bleach (manga)">Category:Bleach (manga)</a> to match this article. Also because typing (manga/anime) is annoying.
