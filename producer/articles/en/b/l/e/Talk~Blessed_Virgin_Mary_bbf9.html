<p>Yes. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_the_Mother_of_Jesus_2878.html" title="Mary, the Mother of Jesus">Mary, the Mother of Jesus</a> is a universally recognised <i>person</i> throughout christendom. The <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessed_Virgin_Mary_7f1f.html" title="Blessed Virgin Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> is a catholic concept accepted by many anglicans but rejected by more fundamentalist protestants. They are two <i>fundamentally different</i> visions of the same person, both in terms of their history and in terms of how they are perceived in terms of their roles within different strands of religion. In some ways, while the person may be the same, the <i>concept</i> relating to issues like the <i>virgin birth</i> or the <i>Immaculate Conception</i> are fundamentally different. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 01:19 Feb 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above argument is terribly flawed - if the reasoning were valid, for example, we would have a different Wikipedia article for the prophet Muhammad from the viewpoint of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Buddhists, etc. - or even particular Muslims, particular Jews, etc. I accept that a reference to a single person could have multiple senses; "Alexander the Great" could refer to the youth, the man, the prince, his position as King of Macedon, the victorious military figure, etc. But what would be the point of having our knowledge of the person in all his forms scattered in fragments around the encyclopedia under different and possibly inconsistent headings? Incidentally, I've been following the Manual of Style discussion around an appropriate epithet for the prophet Muhammad. I would recommend, not only that this article be consolidated with the article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_the_mother_of_Jesus_3bac.html" title="Mary, the mother of Jesus">Mary, the mother of Jesus</a>, but also that the epithets in use, especially for religious figures, be addressed. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELooksharp_9463.html" title="User:Looksharp">Looksharp</a> 20:50, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeandrod_cc8e.html" title="User:Leandrod">User:Leandrod</a> has replaced some, but not all, occurrences of "(Roman) Catholic" to "Roman" or "Romanist". I assume this is an attempt to get a more NPOV (which is a very delicate problem in matters concerning religion).</p>
<p>However, the term "Romanist" is obscure to me. It is not linked, and in fact there is no wikipedia page "Romanist" at the moment; I assume that if there were one, it would point to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>. Is "Romanist" or even "Roman" a generally accepted term? As far as I know, members of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> refer to themselves as "Roman Catholics"; is this term offensive?</p>

        ::Um, no. We don't call them Papists. If they do in the U.S. or some other countries I don't know but in Asia they don't.

<p>Yes, Romanist, or simply Roman, is a shortend to Roman Catholic. I substituted it for Catholic, since Catholic also encompasses Protestants and specially Eastern Orthodox Catholics.<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeandrod_cc8e.html" title="User:Leandrod">User:Leandrod</a></p>
<p>Actually <i>Romanist</i> is a POV term, in so far as it is used as a perjorative term implying an agenda behind the use of the term. In Ireland, for example, the term is used by 0% of main stream crhirtsian and non-christian religions. It is only used by the fiercely anti-catholic (and anti-jewish, homophobic politically far right) Free Presbyterian CHurch. It is used in the same context in the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and in South America by fundamentalist protestant groups. As a result, however genuine the original user may have been in including it, it is linguistically alkward and laiden with POV implication in much of the planet, making it unusuable in an NPOV encyclopaedia article. For tha reason I have removed the term. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><i>Fear<b>ÉIREANN</b></i></a> 17:14, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find it odd, to say the least, that anyone could consider petitioning the Pope to proclaim something infallibly. How could something become inerrantly so just because millions of people would like it to be so? I always, as an admitted outsider, just assumed that such "ex cathedra" proclaimations were made by a Pope based upon his belief that he had been led to an inevitable conclusion by the guidance of the Holy Spirit, not by the petitioning of the masses, regardless of the sincerity of their devotion. If such a thing were to happen, would not this give even more creedence to Old Catholics and others who reject the First Vatican Council and the whole concept of Papal Infallibilty?</p>
<p>P.S. This article is for the most part well-written, well-researched, and scholarly, but it is very much from a devout Catholic POV in my opinion.</p>

<p>The description of the official third secred of Fátima is missing.</p>
<p>I added the text about the 3rd secret. (That section tended to be very "ultra-conservative" Catholic, i.e. more Catholic than the Pope, and I tried to balance it some.</p>

<dd>Absolutely not. It would be absurd to try to blurr different religious concepts of Mary in the one article, as so many of those concepts are mutually contradictory. It would also produce endless edit wars as each side thought the other side's view was getting priority. The separate concepts of Mary are best dealt with on separate linked pages. For a start, any mention of the <i>Blessed Virgin</i> Mary would infuriate many protestants, and any playing down of that title would infuriate many Catholics. So a single page is a non-starter. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">00:31, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></dd>

Old Catholics, Anglo-Catholics, etc., use it mostly in sense #3 when talking about modern things, or sense #1 when talking about ancient things (and use "Roman Catholic" for sense #2). Protestants usually use "Catholic" in sense #2 (or in sense #3 if they think about the distinction at all), and very occasionally in sense #4.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">There isn't a single <i>right</i> way to use "Catholic", just ways that are more or less useful in various contexts.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">Now, when we're talking about devotion to Mary, sense #3 is the obvious one to use to distinguish Catholics (and Orthodox) from other Christians (in general, Protestants). If you write "Roman Catholics honour Mary, but other Christians don't", you're wrong, because you're claiming that Anglican Catholics, for instance, don't honour Mary, which they do. If you write "Catholics honour Mary but Protestants in general don't", you're being (fairly) clear, and using "Catholic" (fairly) obviously in contradistinction to "Protestant".</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">Sure, I know that some people use "catholic" (generally with a lower-case c) to mean "Christian". But if you ask them "Are you a Catholic?", they'll understand what you're asking; and if they're, for instance, Lutheran or Baptist or Seventh-Day Adventist, they'll say "No, I'm not a Catholic."</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">All of which means that to use "Catholic" to mean "Christian" (sense #4) 1) can be pretty confusing, 2) is often inaccurate, 3) is not standard English usage, 4) leaves us with no word or phrase for sense #3, and 5) seems kind of POV.</font></font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">I would suggest that the Co-Redemptrix section needs to contain an explanation of what is meant by 'Co-Redemptrix', since this doctrine is so frequently misunderstood.</font></font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">The explanation of the literal Latin meaning of "coredemptrix" was just plain wrong, so I backed it out. Whoever wrote it at <a href="http://home.nyc.rr.com/mysticalrose/marian14.html" class="external free" title="http://home.nyc.rr.com/mysticalrose/marian14.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.nyc.rr.com/mysticalrose/marian14.html</a> was badly in error. The Latin prefix <i>co-</i> (or <i>con-</i>) derives from <i>cum</i> (with), but it means "with" in the sense of acting-together-with — just as it does in English. There are dozens of common examples in ecclesiastical Latin &amp;mdash <i>coepiscopus</i>, an associate bishop, <b>not</b> someone accompanying the bishop; <i>cohaeres</i>, a fellow-heir, <b>not</b> someone with the heir; <i>concivis</i>, fellow-citizen, <b>not</b> someone acting alongside the citizen. And the ending <i>-trix</i> is just the feminine form of <i>-tor</i>, and turns <i>redemptor</i>, a male redeemer, into <i>redemptrix</i>, a female redeemer. To argue that <i>coredemptrix</i> means "woman with the redeemer" is wrong in almost exactly the same way as it would be wrong in English to say that a "co-authoress" didn't help write the book, but is merely the "woman with the author". <a href="../../../f/r/j/User%7EFrjwoolley_64f8.html" title="User:Frjwoolley">Frjwoolley</a> 20:21, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">It seems silly to me to have to bring this here, but since my initial, extremely minor copyedit to bring the opening sentence of the article into conformity with basic rules of English grammar was summarily reverted without even the courtesy of an explanation, I'm going to mention it here before restoring the edit.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">At present the opening sentence begins with "The <b>Blessed Virgin Mary</b>" and then goes on to point out that she is also called "<b>The Blessed Virgin</b>".

Because <b>The</b> is not part of her name, it is not included in the article's title and is not boldfaced at the beginning of the opening sentence ("The <b>Blessed Virgin Mary</b>", where it's only even capitalised because it's the first word of the sentence). Nor is it capitalised at any other point in the article when she is referred to by a name or title preceded by a definite article ("the Virgin Mary" or "the Blessed Virgin").</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#006666"><font color="#FF6600"><font color="blue"><font color="black">I'd also point out that, if it was part of her name, it would be included in direct address.

WP is screwing around right now and requiring multiple saves, as it keeping treating saves as previews. The only save that finally worked was the one where the previous edit summary had been lost.) In formal title usage, the <i>The</i> is used, in general usage it is not. As per standard, as the opening paragraph was mentioning formal title, the formal title include <i>The</i> was used. That is standard on WP. Monarchs usually are described in their opening paragraph as <i>The King</i> in the opening paragraph, then <i>the King</i> (ie grammatical, not formal) in the body text. WP only uses the definite article as part of a title on those rare occasions where it is part of a title (eg. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>). In most cases it follows the simple rule of strictly formal title in the opening paragraph, standard grammatical usage in the rest of the body of the text. <i>Blessed Virgin Mary</i> uses the in the grammatical, not title, form (hence BVM, not TBVM.) but <i>The Blessed Virgin</i> is used in a formal sense with the definite article. It relates to the existence of other honoured virgins who came to be called <i>blessed virgins</i> (lower casing and no definite article) in the early mediæval period. Though such titling for the other women died out as early as the reformation period, the use of <i>the</i> is still used with regard to Mary as a hangover from the time when it was thought necessary to distinguish between <i>a blessed virgin</i> and <i>The Blessed Virgin</i>, of which in religious terms there was just one, Mary. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:43, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

Your problem is not Jesuits, Masons, and the Trilateral Commission, it's your lack of good citations. Here's a tip for you: you are making some pretty extravagant claims. That's fine, provided you can verify them, but the more extravagant they are, the better your verification has to be. In particular, someone doubting your claims has to be able to actually look them up for himself and find a specific passage in a specific source that verifies them. Vaguely citing "some ante-Nicene Fathers" just won't cut it -- Which author? In which passage? You mention Augustine, yes, but even there, you don't get specific enough that anyone who has his complete library can actually find the sentence that says what you claim. Also, Hislop is simply not a good resource. He is writing 1900 years after the fact, and himself doesn't cite sources in a strong enough way either. So citing him won't convince anyone. If your facts are as pervasive as you suggest, you should have no trouble finding them all over the place in ancient sources. <a href="../../../m/l/o/User%7EMlouns_fbae.html" title="User:Mlouns">Mlouns</a> 14:10, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></dd>
