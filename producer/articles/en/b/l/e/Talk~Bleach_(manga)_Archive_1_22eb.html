<h2><span class="mw-headline">External Links</span></h2>
<p>I wouldn't qualify BleachFan as having "content." It appears to be merely a download link / packlisting site. Speaking more broadly, Wikipedia is not a web directory, so discretion is advised when placing external links. Most articles I've looked at do not link to any fan sites, but only to "official" ones. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMako098765_2591.html" title="User:Mako098765">mako</a> 06:44, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is what I meant with no content, and the reason for that I removed it. It used to be more than that. There is no reason for wikipedia to link to a pure packlist/downlaod site that I can think of.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for if we only should link to official sites I'm split. Often time official sites have no interesting content and are just adveritising, and in some cases also not in English. Fansites on the other hand is often more useful for people who which to learn something about the series/game/comcis/etc . The reason for not linking is because, as you said, this isn't a webdirectory. I think that it's best to link fansites but do it with care. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeltz_23d5.html" title="User:Jeltz">Jeltz</a> <a href="../../../j/e/l/User_talk%7EJeltz_3bb8.html" title="User talk:Jeltz"><small>talk</small></a> 09:12, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guess we will have to wait and see what becomes of BleachFan. Frankly, I would like to see the domain/website mature into something more than just a guide to downloading the Bleach series. Since we are speaking of qualms, one of mine is the fact that Bleach lacks quality fansites. The quality Bleach fansites vanished after the Bleach fansite spurt, which brought in a lot of "NarutoFan" clones, and that's not a good thing for reasons I shall not adventure unto. - Dotuser 05:12, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>. Fan sites are "maybe ok." However, I've found that on the <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto_%28manga%29.html" title="Naruto (manga)">Naruto</a> page that they've become a huge hassle to maintain. It is hard to judge notability, as they all copy content from eachother, and people keep adding their own sites even though they don't deserve to be there. I've edited the Naruto article to remove the fansite link section, but added a sentence in the article discussing fansites. Now there are some links on the bottom that link to Fansite directories, which I believe is much more appropriate. ~<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMdd4696_2098.html" title="User:Mdd4696"><span style="color:#333333;font:normal normal bold small sans-serif;">MDD4696</span></a> <span style="font-size:small;">(<a href="../../../m/d/d/User_talk%7EMdd4696_9dbb.html" title="User talk:Mdd4696">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mdd4696_369b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mdd4696">contribs</a>)</span> 05:22, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm, anime-specific information is starting to pop up. This page should probably be moved from its current title of "Bleach (manga)", but I can't think of what it should be though.

<dd>Well, the Bleach (anime) page redirects back here, and most pages on wiki of animanga series usually just keeps the manga page. Maybe we could redirect both bleach (manga) and bleach (anime) to bleach (animanga) and then keep the manga as a basis, but interject with anime-specific sections? Or we could do that with this page: keep the title, keep focus on manga, but come in with anime-specific sections like (Anime Only) blah blah blah. <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a> 16:20, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think sticking with the current disambiguation (manga) is all right; the manga came first, and as you mention, it's how the majority of pages are already. The main thing is the storyline: the storyline is the same one (AFAIK) for the anime and manga, so they can share an article. As long as people read the article they'll know that an anime was made, based on the manga.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Really Needed?</span></h2>
<p>While I'm sure everyone appreciates the new additions to the page, I consider the extremely detailed information on the first chapter/episode to be unneeded, excessively detailed, and setting a bad precedent for the rest of the page. Wikipedia is not for the creation of episode spoiler guides, that's what fan sites are for. Shouldn't we instead focus on the explanation of the Bleach universe as a whole, rather than just the opening scenes?</p>

<p>Under Shinigami, the Captains and Vice-Captains at the beginning of the series are listed, but wasn't Rukia Vice-Captain for Squad 6 under her brother at that point, and only lost that position when she apparantly went 'rogue' due to losing her powers when she transferred them to Ichigo? <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 21:52, Jun 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Nope, she was a member of the 13th squad under Ukitate. My guess is that she was a seated member but I don't believe that she was the vice-captain of the squad.

<dd>No, Rukia was never a vice-captain. I don't believe she was even a seated officer. At one point of the manga, there was a flashback and it showed Rukia entering the 13th division and she was coming home. Byakuya asks her "What seat did you make?" and she said she wasn't strong enough to become a seated officer. Of course, this is probably a bit before she met Ichigo, and she MAY have been able to become a seated officer during that time, but it is best to assume that she doesn't hold a officer position. -- <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a> 19:25, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Under the captains listing, if we are going to include Shiba as dead, we should also include Aizen and Tousen as no longer being captains either. They betrayed Soul Society and left with a bunch of hollows to become hollows themselves. They definitely are no longer captains. If on the other hand, we are simply listing them as they are at the beginning of the series (and as it states under the titles) Shiba should not be called dead.</p>

<p>On another issue, do we need a listing of every single captain and vice captain and seated Shinigami's Shikai and Bankai abilites and their release cries?

<dd>Well, that's the point of this article. Look at Naruto: it's hella long with five or so articles dedicated to it. What we COULD do is condense the listing, then make a seperate page "Bleach Characters" or "Bleach Captains list" and throw all of the current stuff there -- <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a> 23:15, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess I just tend towards minimalism on this. Whatever we choose, we should decide quickly, before the page gets to be like the Full Metal Alchemist page, where they have to go and put "in the manga..." after every thing because of poor planning in the initial setup. A seperate page for Characters or captains would be good.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 02:32, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, I read about how his dad destroyed Grand Fisher "With just one punch". I figured somehow his love for his wife or something powered him to super strong attack or something. Or that ichigo's energy rubed off on him. Then, when I read the manga when he fought Grand Fisher and he was actually a Shinigam I was like "WTF?!!??" That was a pretty big suprsie to me.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too many Spoilers</span></h2>
<p>We need to be careful of HOW big a spoilers are placed on the page. The last few days various spoilers for far into the series have been entered into the article, and this goes against what it was intended to be...a general synopsis of the series and some minor information and LIMITED spoilers. People, please stop posting things that basically ruin the mystery of the plot for others? It's one thing to mention who made Rukia's gigai body, it's quite another to go off and mention everything relating to it. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 16:13, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again, please be mindful that most spoilers in the article are quite minor, and putting massive spoilers from far into the series goes against the tone already set. Keep it general, alright? I recommend keeping things limited to what someone can see in a casual viewing of a few episodes, or from reading the first and second manga for the most part. Anyone agree or disagree? I think we need to set a guideline NOW, some of what's having to be deleted is really, REALLY plot breaking at times. Heck, I'm kinda iffy on Aizen's zanpakuto ability spoiler since it involves information that can ruin a major plot point if anyone happens to put two and two together. I'm tempted to chop off the part about the betrayel, and if people make the connection that's there on their own, fine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Standardization of terms</span></h2>
<p>We need to decide whether to use Shinigami or a translation of it, and then standardize it throughout all of the Bleach articles. Most notably people have been using either Soul Reaper or God of Death. I understand that different translation teams use different terms, (Lunar uses Death God, while Bleach Society uses Shinigami) but it is rather annoying and could become more of a problem in the future, especially once Bleach gets licensed. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 08:20, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I vote for an English version (anything other than Shinigami), since we're writing in English. Soul reaper sounds very nice IMO but it's been a while since a major sub group has used this term, so it might cause confusion. Therefore, my vote goes to Death God. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 09:22, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

"Soul reaper" or just "reaper" sounds like a better description of what they actually are.

<dd>I suspect that "Shinigami" will be the actual term used in the dub, due to the whole (possible) mess that could be caused by something as potentially religiously dividing as "Soul Reaper". They bowdlerized much of the same content in the TV version of <i>Shaman King</i> for the same reason, I considering how popular the show is, I don't doubt it won't end up on TV (at least on <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_swim.html" title="Adult swim">adult swim</a>). Additionally, I'm not too keen on Soul reaper or death god, since what the primary function of a shinigami (at least as demonstrated by Rukia and a few others) is that of a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychopomp.html" title="Psychopomp">psychopomp</a>. However, since I doubt we'll be getting that deep (and as Jeltz says, what I feel is less important than what is official) I think that we're best going with shinigami. Worst comes to, if the final English edition is something else (say, if 4Kids gets the license and suddenly it's "Ghost Samurai" or something equally stupid), we can always go back and change it.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 12:33, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Frankly, unless Kubo or someone in an authorative position comes out and says something about the meaning of the title, I really don't think we should worry about it. The meaning behind the title could take on a million different things to an equal number of people and could still be wrong; for all we know, it could be because the name stuck after Kubo's editor was walking through the laundry supplies section of the supermarket. So I really think the speculation can be tabled until someone has hard evidence.

<p>What's your (speaking to everyone) position on spoilers? I see people adding and removing them all the time, but we need a clear position on what manga chapter is the limit, what we can/cannot add, etc.</p>
<p>IMO, in the general bleach article (and Characters in Bleach), we shouldn't have any major spoilers (that is, things that are major and not yet covered in the anime), but the individual character articles (or more specific ones like Zanpakuto, etc), should have 100% spoilers, because if someone goes to such a length to read about Bleach, they are probably fans who at least know the outline of the story. Tough luck for those who insist on not reading the manga, but I mean, this is an encyclopedia, not a promotional summary, so the aim is to have encapsulating info.</p>
<p>Also, someone should make an Isshin article for that part of the story&#160;:)</p>

<dd>I believe the general consensus is that the main article should not have blatent spoilers past what's been fansubbed anime-wise. Spoilers from the manga are pretty much limited to what's been released in the US except for general, non-plot destroying spoilers. This is mainly because people tended to put in the MASSIVE plot twist spoilers from far into the manga, and since the rest of the article is much more safe...well, those spoilers get removed and/or shifted to the character pages. Which, by the way, I agree should be 100% spoilery for those who want to give them. The main article is a general synopsis and info page, the sub-pages are for specifics. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 16:12, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone else think we should split the manga and anime pages? That would allow for manga-related info which is considered a spoiler now because it's not in the anime to be added, and also help organization. The negative part is that both pages will have to be updated as more manga/anime comes out in different ways, since the manga is still way ahead in the story.</p>
<p>Also, does anyone have info on the chronology of captaincy? So far here's what I gathered:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know for sure that Yamamoto became captain before Kyouraku and Ukitake</li>
<li>We know for sure that Aizen became captain before Ichimaru, Kuchiki and Tousen, and most likely Komamura.</li>
<li>We know for sure that Ichimaru and Kuchiki became captains at the same time.</li>
<li>We know almost for sure that Ichimaru became captain before Hitsugaya.</li>
<li>We know almost for sure that Kurotsuchi and Soi Fong became captains at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there any more info on the chronology? I think Aizen called Ukitake senpai (could be wrong), which would mean that most likely Ukitake became captain first (it would also make sense because both Ukitake and Kyouraku seem to be ancient).</p>

<dd>I'm against splitting it up into anime and manga since, except for filler stuff in the anime and a bit of expanded info in the manga that didn't make it into the anime...they're the same. It would be a waste of space and a duplication of effort to try and seperate one from the other and have pages for both. If something MUST be made clear to be seperate in some way, marking it with Anime Only or Manga Only is probably the best way to handle things. Remember, the main Bleach page is for a general synopsis of the series, if someone wants to know more they can go to the subpages such as Characters of Bleach which DOES contain manga only spoilers.

<p>Where do we write about vizards, arankaru, etc.? I don't mean the actual characters, but also a descriptions of what they are, what they do, etc. It would be a huge spoiler in this article, but no other seems suitable, at least while there aren't separate articles for each. Any suggestions? -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 17:46, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd suggest putting them under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Bleach_series" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Bleach_series" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Bleach_series</a>, that's the main subpage for that sort of thing and we seem to be going with the consensus that the subpages are where major spoilers go in regards to things. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 06:44, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we should remove a lot of info on this page, such as the gotei listings (already on the characters page), as well as specific info like clothes 'modification', which could also go in the description of each character. Does anyone disagree? -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 09:51, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too many pages?</span></h2>
<p>Instead of having seperate pages for Hollows, Plusses, Anraku, and Vaizards, perhaps all the info could be consolidated on a single page?--Chris F.</p>
<p>I disagree. IMO, the more pages the better. No one likes to read a huge page if they only want to find out what Bleach is, and don't care about details. Also, no one wants to search a huge page for a less important detail like how the hollows fight. Modularization also makes it easier for editors like ourselves. In the case of vizards, hollows and arankaru, we don't know much about them yet, but some of the recent manga chapters expand on them. I'm sure the more small details we get, the less full descriptions are appropriate for the main Bleach page. Also, why don't you register an account? -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 00:52, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>They don't need to go on the main page; there could be a seperate page for all the types of spirits.-- Chris F.</p>
<p>That's exactly what they are doing, except that they are making a seperate page for each different type of spirit.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 17:29, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
