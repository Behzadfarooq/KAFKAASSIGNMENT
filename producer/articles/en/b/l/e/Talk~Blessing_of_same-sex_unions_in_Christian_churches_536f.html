<p>This article fails to mention other denominations that have provided some form of blessings to same sex couples. I think the PCUSA has rites for commitment ceremonies. What about them? What about the United Methodists? <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 15:00, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not to mention Unitarianism and denominations completely outside of Christianity, such as Judaism and Wicca. Urgh, there's probably a box that can be added to the article to indicate the types of additions that are needed...I'll see if I can figure it out. --DavidK93 12:19, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I ended up renaming the page to end with "in Anglicanism." Now the title accurately reflects the contents, and people can write articles about same-sex union blessings in other faiths if they want, and the articles can be merged in the future if deemed appropriate. --DavidK93 12:48, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that was a poor decision. I propose changing it back and adding other faiths. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 13:39, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. The Anglican Church is having the highest-profile struggle over "The Issue". The United Methodists do not have such a rite at all, the PCUSA has a very limited allowance <a href="http://www.pcusa.org/oga/ad-op/note07.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pcusa.org/oga/ad-op/note07.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and prefer to assume that the couples are not actually having sex. Wicca, the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, Unitarians, and Reform/Reconstructionist Judaism, wisely, actually have same-sex <i>marriage</i>. Anyone left? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 22:10, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your statement:<b>The Anglican Church is having the highest-profile struggle over "The Issue"</b> ...is incorrect. I have been following this issue for some time as well. A presbyterian (PCUSA) pastor recently made lots of news when he pronounced a same sex couple "married" when the presbytery specifically disallows "marriage" of a same sex couple while it allows an official "blessing" of their committment. Many people unfamiliar with the difference between a same sex <b>blessing</b> and a same sex <b>marriage</b> will benefit from discussion of this issue in a wikipedia article. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Church_of_Christ_7fcb.html" title="United Church of Christ">United Church of Christ</a>, that I am most familiar with, follows the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church_governance.html" title="Congregational church governance">congregational church governance</a> model, so many of the UCC congregations have different marriage policies... for instance a recent minnesota minister recently refused to perform <b>state marriages</b> but he said he would <b>bless</b> same sex and different sex couples. Other churches just signed the "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lexington+confession&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lexington+confession&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">lexington confession</a>" stating that a marriage is between a man and a woman. The "official" UCC policy on marriage is that the UCC does not have any binding policy that applies to the denomination. I would encourage you to consider the fact that your might have a certain POV on this issue about Episcopalians when in fact many different churches are dealing with or considering this same issue. <a href="../../../e/l/c/ELCA_c434.html" title="ELCA">ELCAs</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disciples_of_Christ_7729.html" title="Disciples of Christ">Disciples of Christ</a> come to mind. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 13:42, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I admit that I have a POV, but I submit that it is not because I am an Anglican, but rather because I am Canadian. Our denominational situation is different up here. The <a href="../../../e/l/c/ELCIC_2aab.html" title="ELCIC">ELCIC</a> recently voted against blessings, which leaves the matter settled for the moment at least. The <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian_Church_in_Canada_8d98.html" title="Presbyterian Church in Canada">Presbyterian Church in Canada</a> is not having a debate at all, so forgive me for my ignorance about their American counterparts' situation. However, the citation I provided to PCUSA policy clearly offers a very limited blessing scheme. Our closest equivalent to the UCC is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Church_of_Canada_9aa4.html" title="United Church of Canada">United Church of Canada</a>, which does indeed provide marriage to queer couples. As regards the Disciples of Christ, we have them up here too (though not many) and I have never heard a peep from them on the issue (which is one that I follow closely).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My main POV on this issue, however, is that "blessing" same sex unions is a cowardly compromise designed to accomodate queer couples to a limited extent while not shocking the establishment by upsetting the status quo. The role of a saints, it has been said, is to "disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 12:23, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>These are great facts to know. Unless you had put it in wikipedia, I would have had very little knowledge of the status of "blessing" same-sex unions in any Canadian denomination. I don't want to sound heavy handed here but I ask you to consider whether there is a place in Wikipedia where these highly useful facts about <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing_of_same-sex_unions.html" title="Blessing of same-sex unions">Blessing of same-sex unions</a> could be presented.&#160;;) <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 14:00, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blessings for same-sex unions are not only discussed and allowed in Anglicanism..also other churches bless same-ssex unions...lutheran churches in Germany, reformed churches in Switzerland, Netherlands, ...--<a href="../../../g/l/g/User%7EGLGerman_47ee.html" title="User:GLGerman">GLGerman</a> 18:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)GLGerman...so i think that should also part of the homepage...i will transfer it, where all churches, which bless same-sex couples, can be noticed.--<a href="../../../g/l/g/User%7EGLGerman_47ee.html" title="User:GLGerman">GLGerman</a> 18:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)GLGErman</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, now we have a title which does not really reflect the contents of the page. If you're going to broaden the title, it would be nice of you to do some work on correspondingly broadening the article. Currently, the "Blessings in Christian churches unrelated to Anglicanism" is about two sentences long and lists only three churches, without any details. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 22:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If this is an article on the status of blessing of same-sex unions in presumably ALL Christian churches, why does it read like an Anglican article? Why does it exclude all mention of the majority of Christians?</p>
<p>Several improvements wich I would suggest for this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introduction should state that Christian Churches are divided on the issue.</li>
<li>A terminology section is needed to decypher same-sex marriage, blessing, civil union etc. Even it is brief and mostly points the reader with such questions to other articles.</li>
<li>A section is needed outlining the theological and other reasons some churches favor and some churches oppose same-sex unions.</li>
<li>An outline of which churches whose practices are most favorable and least favorable to same-sex unions and those which are in between.</li>
<li>Another section with the best available statistics on same-sex unions is also needed.</li>
<li>At least a mention of some ecclesiastical divisions with pointers to relevant articles should also be included.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the casual reader, this article raises more questions than it answers--okay for a homily, but not okay for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_66a7.html" title="User:Vaquero100">Vaquero100</a> 00:33, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I think that dividing the world into "favorable" and "unfavorable" is a false division. Churches may have nuances that prohibit such easy categorization. Perhaps we should just list all the churches like the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christian_denominational_positions_on_homosexuality_caff.html" title="List of Christian denominational positions on homosexuality">denominational positions on homosexuality</a> article but have it be called "List of Christian denominational positions on same sex marriage and same sex unions."<a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 15:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thge user <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> has changed the following text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>At present <b>the majority</b> of Christian Churches have either not approved any recognition of same-sex unions or have publicly opposed them.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>to:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>At present <b>a very large number</b> of Christian Churches have either not approved any recognition of same-sex unions or have publicly opposed them.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The rationale he offered is, "<i>majority implies 51%+. "large number" is more supportable without a source.)</i>" To that I say that this article is the source. The article lists almost every -- if not every -- church that doesn't disapprove of or hasn't publicly opposed same-sex unions. Many of these churches are themselves divided on the issue. Even without consulting an official source on the number of churches or denominations out there, it is plain that the majority of Christian churches have either not approved any recognition of same-sex unions or have publicly opposed them.</p>

<dd>Let me be clear... I am not against having "a majority" be in the article, but that is a mathematically precise term that we don;t have any sources (besudes, uh, wikipedia) that document this. If it is so clear to all involved then it shoudn't be that hard to find a reliable source OUTSIDE OF WIKIPEDIA that says this. Please review <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:cite sources</a> for more info on why original research doesn't pass muster at wikipedia.
<dl>
<dd>I agree that this article has provided <b>many</b> examples of churches that oppose SSM etc, but this only shows that a <b>large number</b> of churches have this policy, not that a <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority.html" title="Majority">majority</a> have this policy.

<p>That's some confusing speech there. You aren't against it being in the article, yet you changed it and you think it qualifies as original work? I don't see anything in either of those articles that suggest that saying it's a "majority" is original work any more than I see anything that says saying it's a "large number" is original work.</p>
<p>I don't know any direct sources that outright say that the majority of Christian churches or Christians reject same-sex marriage, and I haven't been able to find any after 5 or so minutes of google searching, but I don't think that says anything. This is a commonly accepted fact, is it not? You say you aren't against it, so unless you can give a valid reason why you think it's original work I don't see why it should be changed. ~ <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHairouna_81c4.html" title="User:Hairouna">Hairouna</a> 22:36, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me clarify my speech. I personally believe/intuit that the "majority" statistic is probably true, but without any evidence, I hesitate as a wikipedian to make such a strong claim. You would think <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Barna_ce12.html" title="George Barna">Barna Group</a> or <a href="http://hirr.hartsem.edu" class="external text" title="http://hirr.hartsem.edu" rel="nofollow">Hartford Institute for Religion Research</a> or some other religious research organization would have these stats. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 15:17, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rather, I wouldn't expect that they would, since there's nothing to report there. It's far more likely that they'll have polls on the attitudes towards and positions on homosexuality (and they do) than a statistic about how many churches support same-sex unions. The fact is that there are so few, that these few are so confined to certain geographical areas, and that the issue is still not as huge as some make it to be that such research is unlikely. And the claim that there's a majority is just about as strong as the claim of many, especially since so few have favourable views on same-sex unions. ~ <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHairouna_81c4.html" title="User:Hairouna">Hairouna</a> 03:42, 14 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My whole point is that wikipedia doesn't have opinions on things... if wikipedia is the only organization in the whole world claiming something, then that violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> even if the claim is correct. Lucky for us, there was a real research project ("World Religions and Same-Sex Marriage" Marriage Law Project July 2002) that agrees with your and my intuitions. I am going to update the claim with sourcing and blockquote. 97.6 % of US Christians and 99.97% of Christians worldwide believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.</dd>

<p>Yet within this diversity, the over- whelming consensus among Christians is that marriage, by definition, requires a man and a woman. There are only minor exceptions (see part II.E below). These amount to 2.4 percent of Christians in the United States and 0.03 per- cent worldwide. We treat “Christianity” in terms of Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Protestantism, and Latter-day Saints. Then we address “The Exceptions" (those religious bodies that endorse same- sex “marriage”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So? Many Christians who support same-sex blessings adhere to a heterosexual definition of marriage <i>per se</i>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Hutchison_1d72.html" title="Andrew Hutchison">Andrew Hutchison</a>, for example. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 23:41, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a>, one person doesn't really count as many, especially when compared to a total of maybe 2 billion. I suspect that people like that would live almost exclusively in developed countries, and they don't even contain the majority of Christians.

<p>I'm not making a claim at all, but rather finding a hole in another. My point is simply that the survey quoted doesn't tell us whether a majority of Christians agree or disagree with blessing of same-sex unions, only whether they think that such unions are <i>marriages</i>. Obviously, I am not presenting the Primate as "many" people. But then, I think you knew that already. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 00:01, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Plus the language of the pdf suggests that they're considering same-sex unions in general. They repeatedly refer to the "marriages" are same-sex "marriages". ~ <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHairouna_81c4.html" title="User:Hairouna">Hairouna</a> 01:04, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, so here's the state of the union (sorry for the pun&#160;;) )...
<ul>
<li>we do have source-cited statistics on Christians being a majority <b>unfavorable</b> to same sex <b>marriage</b>.</li>
<li>We do not have source-cited statistics on how many churches or Christians officially disparage "blessing" of same sex unions or how many Christian churches officially/regularly provide such blessings.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Because of this lack of statistics on the insidence of SSU, the "unfavorable" section merely explains why it's hard to document such blessings. Unless we get a source I am not comfortable asserting that "most" churches think blessing SSU is AOK. In wikipedia, it is not safe to assume anything... we have to cite sources on disputable issues. <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 18:29, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There appears to be no article that discusses the blessing of same-sex unions in non-Christian religions. Should this one be expanded to do so, or should a new, broader article be created? (Or am I just missing this article, which in fact already exists?)</p>

<dd>Good question, but isn't the answer that this should be discussed in the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same_sex_union.html" title="Same sex union">same sex union</a> article, and perhaps <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_marriage.html" title="Gay marriage">gay marriage</a> articles??? <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 22:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not as far as I can see. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_union.html" title="Same-sex union">Same-sex union</a> is a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage.html" title="Same-sex marriage">Same-sex marriage</a> is overwhelmingly political in its focus (which I am trying to correct). <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing_of_same-sex_unions.html" title="Blessing of same-sex unions">Blessing of same-sex unions</a> redirects to <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing_of_same-sex_unions_in_Christian_churches_eb69.html" title="Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches">Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanB_DanD_1af1.html" title="User:DanB DanD"><font color="darkpurple">Dan</font><font color="black"><b>B</b></font>†<font color="blue">Dan</font><font color="darkblue"><b>D</b></font></a> 22:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>hmmm... you raise a good point. Maybe we should change the name of the article from <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing_of_same-sex_unions_in_Christian_churches_eb69.html" title="Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches">Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches</a> to <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing_of_same-sex_unions.html" title="Blessing of same-sex unions">Blessing of same-sex unions</a> and have just a section on Christians. That might ruffle a few feathers but I would back you on it if you proposed a move vote. The other option is maybe create and article on <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessing_of_same-sex_unions.html" title="Blessing of same-sex unions">Blessing of same-sex unions</a> and list (with sources) other communities (religious communities?) that "bless" unions. I think this is a significant enough issue that I think you have wiggle room to be bold and create something that may be the 60% solution. Go for it!!! <a href="../../../m/p/s/User%7EMPS_0645.html" title="User:MPS">MPS</a> 22:10, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
