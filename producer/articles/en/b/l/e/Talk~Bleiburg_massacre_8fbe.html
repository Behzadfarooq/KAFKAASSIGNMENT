<p>It should be mentioned that the refugees were Ustashes and their collaborators. there were domobrans but among the civilians I think it is safe to say that they were mostly collaborators due to many obvious reasons. A vast majority of people cheerfully welcomed the partisans after all.</p>

<p><i>1. one operates with big numbers, and their contention is that somewhere between 250,000 and 600,000 Croats had been executed in Bleiburg, Slovenia and northern Croatia. While the upper limit is almost certainly false, the lower one has gained credibility in recent years, when Slovene authorities have estimated, in 1999 and 2000 that mass excavations in wider Maribor area have found ca. 180,000 human corpses, mostly Croats (judging from the remnants of military insignia). As reported elsewhere:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>In 1999 the resources from the Republic of Slovenia reported of as many as 110 mass graves of Croats discovered in this state, victims of the "Way of the Cross" in 1945 immediately after the end of WW2. Among them there were not only soldiers, but also a large number of civilians. The Slovenian public was shocked by the size and number of these graves.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>In 2001 Slovenian sources reported of as many as 296 mass graves on their territory, and an estimate of about 190,000 Croats killed immediately after the end of WW2 (May 1945 and later), mostly Croats. Only in the region of Tezno woods Slovenian sources estimate about 60-80,000 killed. Many children bones have been found among the remains victims.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to know the sources for this. Zerjavic's investigations are well-documented and argumented but if this were true, it would throw them out of the window -- and open the question of why 100 000 more missing do not show up in demographic data.</p>

<p>There are two flagrant ommisions in the description of this regretable fact. The first one is that Josip Broz Tito was a Croat and that most Serbs ware royalists, and not communists. The second, is that during World War Two the Ante Pavelic Croat government organized and conducted bestial atrocities against large civilians populations, most of them Serbs.</p>
<p>For fear of payback, those criminals of war ware escaping from Croatia. However, the severity and complete bestial nature of the war in those regions, unfortunately put the situation out of what is right.</p>

<p>1. <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/Pars_pro_toto.html" title="Pars pro toto">Pars pro toto</a> confusion</b>: Bleiburg massacre may refer to events near the village of Bleiburg on a particular day (deaths in triple digits at most), or events in the region (primarily Slovenia) over the course of the following weeks or perhaps months (mass murder, deaths in tens of thousands). Unfortunately, the term "Bleiburg massacre" has come to cover both meanings, and this needs to be spelled out clearly. One cannot just say (and I quote) "The number of those who met their death in Bleiburg is", and then shell out five- or six-digit numbers - because it simply isn't true.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a side-effect of translating from Croatian, where when one says "Bleiburg" then the whole massacre is implied, not just the village. Fixing. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 01:03, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. <b>Bleiburg as an exclusively "Croatian thing"</b>: the victims were also Slovenians (Bela garda) and Serbs (<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chetniks.html" title="Chetniks">Chetniks</a>), in no small numbers. Not a single word in the article.</p>

"The Slovenian public was shocked by the size and number of these graves." Yes, the Slovenian public was shocked, because we were told these were mainly corpses of Slovenes in those mass graves.213.172.254.126 15:16, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>...And yes, I clearly prefer Serbs over Croats because Serbs never stained themselves by persecuting Jews - unlike the Croats, who traditionally express most savage forms of anti-Semitism, including their beloved "president" Tudjman. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleverde_a328.html" title="User:Aleverde">Aleverde</a> 00:26, August 20, 2005 (UTC+2) (<i>note: the date is wrong, should be March 13, 2006</i>)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>BTW, Belgrade in 1941. proudly declared itself "first Judenfrei city in Europe".</p>
<p>It was the German Nazis who declared Belgrad judenfrei not Serbs who in their entire history have never been antisemitic. Croats were massacred in Bleiburg yes and that is just, they got what they deserved.</p>
<p>Are you fogeting that Hitler and your Germans forced (some more or less willing) the entire Axis (includeing Mussolini) to kill jews? You say the GERMANS killed jews in Serbia and not Nedić? Who the f... do you think controlled our 'good friend' Pavelić anyway?! I can't believe you're so naive... Serbs murdered Croats and Partisans and collaborated with the Axis while the Croats were the first to oppose the antisemites. The chetniks were just as bad (if not worse) as the Ustashe, they just didn't have as much support. But as for the collaborators at Bleiburg, I more or less agree with you.. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDIREKTOR_9f33.html" title="User:DIREKTOR">DIREKTOR</a> P.S.: The traitorous Pavelić regime was anti-Serb, not antisemitic, originally</p>

<p>The article talks about "British involvement in the affair" but does not explain what this is supposed to be (it's explained, for instance, in the German Wikipedia article about this topic). I think somebody should translate it or come up with reputable sources and include it in his or her own words. --84.137.43.81 19:57, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Though I cannot at present site sources (though they are easily found), relatives of victims, as well as locals from Bleiburg reported: Bleiburg is where the fleeing Croatians had to change trains as they were bound for Germany; British troops promised to guide them to safety, and allocated the refugees onto trains which they state that they "never knew" were heading back to Yugoslavia, even though there were dozens of trains over a long period of time, all heading in the same direction, which could only have sent them back to Yugoslavia as Bleiburg is so close to the Slovene border. I personally believe it as the whole thing looked excellently calculated. <a href="../../../e/v/l/User%7EEvlekis_1e94.html" title="User:Evlekis">Evlekis</a> 06:15, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And it goes without saying, that whatever involvement the British may or may not have had, nobody from Communist Yugoslavia was ever internationally condemned, indicted, summoned to appear before an international court etc. even though the events of the 1990s were extremely minor by comparison. <a href="../../../e/v/l/User%7EEvlekis_1e94.html" title="User:Evlekis">Evlekis</a> 08:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Removed following line added by anonymous contributor: "It should be remembered, however, that there is high probability the majority of the refugees were collaborators with the occupying Axis forces, since they ran from the Partisans leaving all or most of their property behind, irregular behaviour unless with serious reason."</p>
<p>Represents original research &amp; is a claim that cannot be proven or disproven. Those fleeing may have been anti-communist, or afraid of the red army. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 14:12, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
