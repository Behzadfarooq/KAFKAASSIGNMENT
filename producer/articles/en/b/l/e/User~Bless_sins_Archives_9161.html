<p>Hi - thanks for your note - I looked over it briefly and realized there is much I don't know about the exact history of ownership. The Palestinian Authority has recently obtained approval from Turkey to obtain records of land deeds of the Ottoman Empire era, but I don't know if they have been handed over yet. Since I have been swamped with work lately, I'll try to catch up on some reading and stop by that article again as soon as I can.

<dd>Hi, let me see if I can help out. Regarding your first question, it looks like that image is one of those distributed by subscription news agencies, so it would be copyrighted. Regarding your second question, I think good places to find images are on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/" rel="nofollow">Creative commons</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/" rel="nofollow">Flickr.com</a> (only the images released under a proper copyright). Sometimes you can find images with free copyrights on some government websites, and you can also contact the owner of an image and see if they will release its rights. Hope this helps&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 03:19, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Salam! There are other resources online where you can find royalty free pictures, one is <a href="http://sxc.hu" class="external free" title="http://sxc.hu" rel="nofollow">http://sxc.hu</a> (previous url was like <a href="http://stock-exchange.hu" class="external free" title="http://stock-exchange.hu" rel="nofollow">http://stock-exchange.hu</a> or something, for stock exchange of photos), many users on sxc have listed photos under "no usage restrictions", some "require attribution". Also, if you contact and request the photographers who have copyrighted photos, they'll generally allow, especially if you ask for a smaller size photo like 600 x 400, and give a link to their site. Also, you can use organizations' logos and other news related images under "Fair use" clause on en.wikimedia, but "Fair use" is not allowed on commons.wikimedia. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../w/a/q/User%7EWaqas.usman_9104.html" title="User:Waqas.usman">Waqas.usman</a> 10:15, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is not really a "dispute", since NOBODY has responded to anything on the talk page. What is happening is that someone is reverting my edits constanstly. I've tried to edit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed&#160;:"After Muhammad's efforts to convert the Jews of Yathrib failed [citation needed],", since nobody came up with a source for that.</li>

<ul>
<li>Put the Quranic verses (The Proof 6-7) in context. I have merely completed the quote.</li>

<li>Created a new section called "Historic and modern Muslim respect for Jews", because "Muslim denunciation of Anti-Semitism" doesn't fit into the "Historic events of Muslim persecution of Jews" section.</li>

<p>Bless sins, I looked at the page and it looks like all users are reverting your edits. Any unsourced infromation (from edit history) is to be reverted almost at once. If the user keeps doing this you post to his/her talk page. As far as I can see the article needs some cleanup. I'm going to read it again and if I think it needs cleanup, I am going to add it. If the users are posting to the talk page it means they are fooling around and not asking others what they think. It might be worthy if this page was protected. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForestH2_888b.html" title="User:ForestH2">ForestH2</a></p>
<p>Any unsourced infromation can be deleted right away. Tell me if you think the article needs to be cleaned up. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForestH2_888b.html" title="User:ForestH2">ForestH2</a></p>
<p>You need to be posting to the user's talk page. Now that you mention it it needs cleanup but I suggest you write to the user's who are reverting your edits talk page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForestH2_888b.html" title="User:ForestH2">ForestH2</a> (<a href="../../../f/o/r/User_talk%7EForestH2_6a03.html" title="User talk:ForestH2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ForestH2_2ee0.html" title="Special:Contributions/ForestH2">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Would you request a cleanup for this article? As you mentioned in my talk page I can see it sort of needs a cleanup. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForestH2_888b.html" title="User:ForestH2">ForestH2</a></p>

<p>{{[[Template:helpme|helpme}} Hey, I was wondering if you could help me out with this. Recently, a whole section was removed from the article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_anti-Semitism_a000.html" title="Islam and anti-Semitism">Islam and anti-Semitism</a>. This section was called "Historic Muslim respect for Jews", a parallel to the section "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_anti-Semitism_a000.html#Historic_events_of_Muslim_persecution_of_Jews" title="Islam and anti-Semitism">Historic events of Muslim persecution of Jews</a>". The argument underlying the removal was that this section "did not belong to the article".</p>
<p>Firstly, did the section indeed not belong to the article?</p>
<p>Secondly, if it didn't, is there another article in wikipedia where this section would belong.</p>
<p>Thirdly, would it be appropriate to create an article which accomodates this section along with other views.11:29, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I would say that the section certainly does belong in the article. It is well written and seems to represent a neutral point of view, so I see no reason to remove it. I would suggest discussing the issue with User:Pecher on his talk page. I think he probably removed it because the article is titled Islam and <b>Anti-</b>Semitism, but I think a separate article for Muslim respect toward Jews would be unnecessary. Thanks. I hope this helps. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#CD6600;">Tantalum</span><span style="color:#000080;">Telluride</span></a> 17:41, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

</dl>

<p>I feel the Qur'an is using a special language. I don't think "eating the flesh of his dead brother" seems better than being "apes". Lot's of Muslims really do "spy on each other behind their backs". My brother, I am not an interpreter of Qur'an. I just feel that they are transformed form of the sin itself but maybe in another dimention. I don't know. I will try to contribute to the article as soon as I get free from school work (i.e. after my finals that finish in two weeks from now I think) Take care. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:04, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed your edits on the Zionism page. There's a pretty well-organized group (groups?) of people here who seek to defame Islam every chance they get. This is being done by whitewashing Muslim contributions in history, presenting less-than-credible arguements from partisan sources aimed at generalizing Muslims, etc. I hope I can ask you to help if there's a conflict with some of these articles. If you're familiar with other Muslims here, tell them to keep an eye out for this kind of defamatory content. If you need my help with any article pertaining to Islam or Muslims, I'd be glad to help if it's in my power to do so.

<p>The article happens to have the title that it has; citing one part of the article to justify edits to a different part of the article is inappropriate.

<dd>I don't have a lot of experience in this subject, but I think a separate article for Muslim respect towards Jews might be OK. It will be imporatant to cite sources and maintain a neutral point of view, especially since you're dealing with a contentious subject. If you do create a new article, it can be linked from the "See also" section of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_Anti-Semitism_4037.html" title="Islam and Anti-Semitism">Islam and Anti-Semitism</a> article. Another possible solution would be to move <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_Anti-Semitism_4037.html" title="Islam and Anti-Semitism">Islam and Anti-Semitism</a> to Muslim Attitudes towards Jews or something similar which would be broad enough to include a section about Muslim respect towards Jews. Of course, you should seek consensus on the article's talk page before making such a major change to the title. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#CD6600;">Tantalum</span><span style="color:#000080;">Telluride</span></a> 19:11, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Assalam-o-Allaliakum, Just wanted to let you know that now the Dhimmi article is protected. It is good time to discuss things on the talk page. Please do not lose hope. They had removed the disputed-tag and to restore it I have to notify it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Disputed_tag_is_removed_from_Dhimmi_article" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Disputed_tag_is_removed_from_Dhimmi_article" rel="nofollow">administrator pages</a>.

<p>Hiya Bless Sins. From what I can tell from online sources, I know this is a "weak" hadith (saying) of the Prophet, but I'm have a had time dating it to its earliest written source. I think it goes as far back as 1000AD, though after a while all these Islamic authors names start to blur (do they have to <i>all</i> be named "Al"? <a href="../../../s/h/y/Image%7ESHysterical.gif_1508.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/d/d3/SHysterical.gif/18px-SHysterical.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" longdesc="../../../s/h/y/Image%7ESHysterical.gif_1508.html" /></a>), and I don't really know who's who to begin with.

<p>Hi! I saw your interests page, and I wish to explain a bit situation with mentioned history-related article.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't want to erase content of this, it will be merged into more global article like "Occupation of Ukraine".</p>
<p>Also, as you can notice, current version of article contains &gt;50% about Holocaust, it's not the primary goal of it. If it will be merged into Occupation of Ukraine it will be more title-specific. Because at that times, there were Soviet people, not Ukrainians. And article particularly speaks about Jews.</p>
<p>Also, you mentioned, that article is referenced, but I want to tell you that most references are not valid, since citations were misinterpreted by editors. You can see talk page for more info. Briefly, the strongest accusations were provided from some journalist, which has only one article on history, and has no historical background at all.</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding, please provide your arguments. --Galkovsky 06:11, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did not insist on picking Jayjg, as you know it was indirect. I kept trying to explain to you that because I wanted to make sure you understood there is no alliance between me or Alithien or Jayjg. Alithien was brought to a mediation from a post I believe, and as I have said before he did not favor my side. I did however, appreciate his mediating. Unlike my "opponent", his reasons made sense to me. I have never worked with Jayjg, nor have I talked to him about anything else but this recent mediation attempt. I did believe we should stick with him because he seemed neutral from the start. I was also afraid it would take even longer for another mediator. I was more insisting to just give mediation a chance, to hear what someone has to say. That was it.

<dd>I never said you should not file a request, in fact I encourage you to do it. Similar to Jayjg, I really do not know who Aminz is but I assume now that we would not get along and/or he would be on your side. I was not thinking of it as "OK, your turn to choose" or anything because there has not actually been a mediator yet, one referred us to another. I did believe we should stick with him because he waited for you per your request so we can actually start mediating, and when returned we could not. Otherwise, if you wish, post.

<p>Hallo,</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not wish to accuse you of hatred of Jews, though I see that my comment could be misunderstood as making a positive statement. Take out the "his" and this is solved. I was speculating on whether you are doing what you are doing deliberately or whether something was blinding you (and what that something could be). I know you much too little to accuse you of the above.</li>
<li>I see that the short form BS can be misunderstood and will, if brevity is required, merely say "Bless" or B, if not your user name.</li>
<li>"Mr M" was an expression used by me before Maududi came along. I don't think I have used it when it could be ambiguous. If so, I will not do it again. However, I see nothing disrespectful in this.</li>
<li>I don't know what you mean by "all respected non-Muslims". Can you please tell me whether I am respected.</li>
<li>If I will respond to your "request" I will to so on the article talk page.</li>

<p>Trust me, Bless sins, though we may not always agree, I honestly in good faith believe your edits not to be very neutral. But, I certainly see why you'd think this article needs some balance. Forcing everyone to choose between two biased versions guarantees edit wars, which is exactly what has been happening. As long as we're not talking about religious/partisan or extremist sources, we don't have that to worry about, which makes compromise much easier. I've recent made two edits to the other version which atribute controversial claims to individual scholars (Stillman and Vaglieri respectively) in an attempt to address the problems I see with that version. So why not calm down and give it a shot? The current path isn't working out for anyone, is it?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 06:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This book... I had already since you had posted the question on Aminz's talkpage, and was thinking about it. I don't know: I guess it depends what it is talking about. e.g. there are lots of medieval "life of Christs" which we do not count as reliable dispite being notable because of when they were written. Who published the translation? I guess I would try to start an article on WP about the book, including why you reckon it is notable and provide enough context for people to know when it is reliable and when not? It may not survive but it is does you'd be a lot of the way there. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 20:39, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look, I've given a brief, factual, non-sensationalistic and studiously disinterested version which is significantly more nuetral than either Beit Or's proposed version or what was there before. What's the point of aiming for neutrality if you just resume fighting to split the remaining difference? I brought Watt's view in fairly, I insisted on attribution of controversial language (e.g. "pogroms"), backed you in changing section titles, and for what?

<dd>Yes, Bless sins, I am beginning to wonder if compromise with you isn't futile. It doesn't bother me that you have a point of view, and it doesn't really bother me that you push it. What bothers me is that you push it, push it, and push it, every day returning to push it some more. Here I made it clear that Al-Rabi lied to Muhammad about the treasure, and that b. Maslamas brother had died in the battle, two details (one very crucial) which were missing before, and you're still pushing. When it turned out that you hadn't read the whole narrative, and wrongly believed that Al-Rabi had killed Mahmud (perhaps misled by a certain Islamic website?), you resumed pushing without skipping a beat, even insisting that the very same language which had misled you be included in the article where it might mislead others. That I find truly difficult to understand. Perhaps I'm looking upon this too dimly, but at this moment I struggle to recall anything that was ever solved, any discussion that was ever over until you had your way. See also <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBanu_Qurayza_3414.html" title="Talk:Banu Qurayza">Talk:Banu Qurayza</a>. I'm not by any means asking to quit representing your point of view, but I am sick of revisiting the exact same arguments every day. If you let up a little bit and look around, you might find other things which could use balancing or general improvement where others might actually agree with you. Weren't there other things you wanted to add to this article? We'll never get there at the rate we're going.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 22:46, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
