<p>I won't revert without a mutual agreement, but I still having Isshin listed as a shinigami is still a spoiler, considering many Bleach fans are anime watchers and do not read the manga. On the other hand, all character pages that have this template already contain spoilers from the manga, even in the lead section, but at least they have spoiler tags attached. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 20:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The entire existance of the arrancar and vizard is a spoiler to an even higher degree, and we have them on the list. Not to mention the battle details from far more recent fights that are included in articles such as Hitsugaya's. Isshin's secret identity was revealed a year ago. I relocated his because I view logical placement within the list as more important than hiding ancient spoilers.</dd>
<dd>You do bring up an issue that will definitely need addressing in light of the english anime release this fall though, as even Urahara's shinigami identity will have become a major spoiler, to say nothing of Aizen's being the villain. What will we do then? (of course, the issue may become academic if it turns out the series is popular enough that vandal patrol is the only thing we can do effectively...) --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 21:10, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think Aizen, Ichimaru and Tousen should be grouped with the rest who have continued their captain and division relationship. And why are Ichigo and Rukia in the main characters section. Either Ichigo should be the only one in that section or it should also include orihime, chad and ishida.--Noman953
<dl>
<dd>Ichigo and Rukia are the main characters. They are the two characters who have been followed and explored since chapter/episode one. Also the edits you have suggested would all be major spoilers. People who have not seen that much of the series (especially with the new english dub anime out) would see it and if they were to see Aizen not in the shinigami list and in some other section the entire Soul Society arc would be ruined. Plus in the dub version Ishida has yet to make his first appearance, even putting him with the main characters is a spoiler. In my view it is better left as it is, at least for the moment. -- <a href="../../../u/r/r/User%7EUrrgh5591_fa2b.html" title="User:Urrgh5591">Urrgh5591</a> 11:32, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think the 'main characters' line should be removed altogether. No change should be made about Ichimaru, Aizen and T≈çsen, because of spoilers (as mentioned by Urrgh). Keep in mind that this template appears on many pages, containing varying amounts of spoilers. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 13:44, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who moved Rukia from the main character list to the soul society list? If the template is going stay like that, we should move Ichigo to the karakura school list. Actually, I think i will do that.

<p>-There's Nell and his brothers as well as other Arrancar. Also we still don't have a page for hollow ichigo, zangetsu, zabimaru, the different bount dolls. maybe all of them can go one page as characters inside people's souls or something, we could also include Kon and those three others mod souls as well. I know they're minor characters but hollow ichigo and zangetsu have had more screen time than most shinigami there should be some sort of page on them. also you can't use the english dub as template for when to include stuff that spoilerish. Bare in mind that Bleach goes to other countries aside from North America, so you can't use the American dub for deciding when to release information as that's just racist. I've tried making a page for hollow ichigo a fair number of times but people just delete it and I don't know why.--Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>Congrats on doing the Nell Tu Article. We just need a pictire of him. Hollow Ichigo doesn't really need an article because he's part of Ichigo himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe an artice on Noitora soon if there's anymore backstory on him soon, and maybe Arturo Plateado when the Bleach Wii game comes out. There's gonna be an animated feature included with the game, so that may provide information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm thinking about Dordonii also, but we'll wait and see what happens in the manga. Still, the Nell Tu article was a good idea.</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Creation of new character pages should be discussed before actually making them. This will prevent unnecessary deletions. Of course, Nell may yet become very important, but so far, even with all his/her help, Nell is an NN character for all intents and purposes. There are a few more existing articles which are about NN characters, we'll wait and see how the characters develop. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 17:19, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually "RedEyesMetal" someone else did the the Nell article. The big question I have is why characters as non existent as yamamoto's leuitenant can have pages, yet important story people like Ichigo's hollow and zangetsu can't. Who gets to decide what goes on these pages and more importantly where does this god given right come from. I mean after making numerous suggestions to change the picture on Aizen's article somebody actually did change it. And now I find that its been reverted again. There were quite a bunch of users who were for the picture change, not just me as I didn't even revert it. I just checked Aizen's page's history apparently someone was reverting "vandalism" when all this user did was give Aizen's page a less uglier picture.--Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both Ichigo's hollow and Zangetsu are part of Ichigo and can be consolidated into his article, so why create separate ones? As for Aizen's picture, there was a new picture added after many requests, but it is clearly against Wikipedia policy to include a completely giveaway picture right at the top of the article. We don't want to spoil the series for everyone. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 23:25, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fair enough. So then why does Tousen have a new picture. You guys could have moved Aizen new picture to the bottom of the page the way you did with Tousen. wikipedia is an encyclopedia, so spoilers don't stop people from posting stuff, that's why we have spoiler warnings. --Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uh, there's already a spoilery Aizen picture at the bottom. It may not be the one you wanted, but there's nothing wrong with it and no good reason to insert any other picture. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 22:00, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read the upcoming episode titles, and it seems the Bounto arc is coming to a close. So, should Kariya's article be deleted? He's got a big history, and has played a vital part even though its a filler arc, but should his article be kept?</p>

<dd>I say keep it. He's his arcs major villain and, filler or not, he's had more activity than half of the Gotei 13 captains have. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 17:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article should be kept. He did play a big role and a lot of non-existent characters, like Yamamoto's lieuenant and Soi Fon's as well, who had about 2-3 episodes and played absolutely zero role in any plot at all, while Kariya was the driving force behind much of a complete arc, with plenty of notable fights to boot. <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMoChan_fb89.html" title="User:MoChan">MoChan</a> 03:02, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I personally liked the old list. It listed all the characters and wasn't much more bulky. If anything, the current version looks more bulky with the big text.

<dd>I agree. I didn't notice the change initially, but it's definitely less readable now and fails its purpose as a navigation template between the character articles. If I'm reading Hitsugaya's article, I don't want to have to go look at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_8f0f.html" title="Characters in Bleach">Characters in Bleach</a> again to click a link to <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soifon.html" title="Soifon">Soifon</a>, because I already read that page. A good attempt on Someguy's part but it really doesn't make sense here because we already split the templates to avoid cluttering articles with both character and primary bleach templates. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 15:35, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, because then you have that One Piece infobox, which is so grotesquely messy that it damages every page it is on. Or at least <a href="../../../n/a/r/Template%7ENaruto_info_0b13.html" title="Template:Naruto info">Template:Naruto info</a> which, while not quite so unreadable, is still HUGE.
