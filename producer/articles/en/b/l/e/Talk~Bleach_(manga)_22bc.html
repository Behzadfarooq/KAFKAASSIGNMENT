<li><small>In titling, we use Bleach (manga), not Bleach (anime) or BLEACH.</small></li>
<li><small><small>We are using the English naming conventions for characters, given name first.</small></small></li>
<li><small><small>Quincy and Soul Society are capitalized, but we do not capitalize most other terms (<i>shinigami</i>, hollow, plus, <i>zanpakutō</i>, etc.).</small></small></li>
<li><small><small>It's lieutenant, not vice-captain; the <i>onmitsukidō</i> is to be referred to as "special forces"; demon arts has been superceded by <i>kidō</i>, since all versions of the series use the Japanese term. Soul Reaper vs. <i>shinigami</i> is unresolved, but we use <i>shinigami</i> since it remains the more common usage.</small></small></li>
<li><small><small>The main characters on the page are listed in the order of their appearance.</small></small></li>
<li><small><small>Correct character spellings include Bount (pl. Bounts), Yammy, Luppi, and Kuroud.</small></small></li>
<li><small><small>Spoilers should not be included in the main article unless they significantly contribute to an overall understanding of the series.</small></small></li>
<li><small><small>We refer to "artificial souls" rather than "modified souls" in order to incorporate all manufactured souls.</small></small></li>

<dd>I've said it before, I still strongly disagree with this idea of 'notable' subjects only. It is highly subjective and conducive to needless arguments. Also, Grand Fisher is extremely notable in the Bleach universe, seeing as how he/it was responsible for the death of Ichigo's mother, a major factor in the life and motivation of the main character of the entire series. That alone makes Grand Fisher worthy of an article. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDestradoZero_4957.html" title="User:DestradoZero"><b><font color="purple">Destrado</font><font color="black">Zero</font></b></a> 05:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>yeah, if we can justify giving EVERY SINGLE captain and vice captain their own article, we can DEFINITELY justify giving grand fisher one. i mean, half these vice captains/captains are complete enigmas. 67.175.45.179 04:55, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Other than the normal vandalism reversions, the page has become much more stable lately. I still think that there are issues with the plot summary (introduction) and main character sections that need to be worked out, but the stability in the page does have its advantages.</p>
<p>I'd like to propose that we take the opportunity to do better referencing for the sections on character types and settings, using the primary source (the manga and merchandise itself). As long as the notability of the series has been established by third-party sources — and this is clearly demonstrated in the media section — I don't see a problem with referencing plot/situational information with citations from the manga and anime.</p>
<p>Although I want to help with this, too, my copies of the manga are not in the same country as me at the moment. Would anyone else be willing to help me find good manga references for what a hollow is, or how many people can see spirits, or how Soul Society is organized, et cetera? <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu"><font color="darkgreen">が...</font></a> 05:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tj's just added to our standardization section and it's made me realize that it's about time to archive this page again and work out what we've decided lately, which I'm going to do now. (Update: I have recompiled the standardization topics and added them to a template at the top of the page. The old talk section is now in <a href="../../../b/l/e/Talk%7EBleach_%28manga%29_Archive_4_a5df.html" title="Talk:Bleach (manga)/Archive 4">archive 4</a> Let me know what you think.) I think we have a fairly strong core of information to use to bring this article forward and it may be time to submit it to a peer review.

<p>I think that we should change the introduction section into something like "story thus far" and write what has been happening in the story instead of just the first chapter. <font color="red"><a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurosaki_Ricky_f6ca.html" title="User:Kurosaki Ricky">Ricky</a> 17:57, 3 March 2007 (UTC)Kurosaki Ricky</font></p>

<dd>The thing is, do we follow the anime, or the manga? And do we follow the English release, or the Japanese? It's better to just let it stay an introduction to the story, and let the reader decide if they want to read/experience the series on their own or not. <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique</a> <small><a href="../../../n/i/q/User_talk%7ENique1287_b03c.html" title="User talk:Nique1287">talk</a></small> 18:04, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Readers already know the story in general, and new readers ought to be shielded from plot spoilers. The characters and setting sections are much more valuable to new readers.

<dd>Actually, I disagree. At the moment the page is very friendly to new people who are just starting to watch <i>Bleach</i>, but it isn't fulfilling all of its role as an encyclopedia article. There needs to be a plot summary introduced at some point, even though it will reintroduce spoiler tags to the article. I started to work on one in... I think... October, by translating the plot summary from the Japanese article. We had additional style problems that point because the actual introduction to the article and the Introduction section of the article were substantially the same. I stopped working on it for some reason, but I definitely think it's the responsibility of the article to describe the complete plots of both the manga and anime. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu"><font color="darkgreen">よ!</font></a> 12:02, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But neither is complete, nor planned to be complete anywhere in the near future. Plot summaries are available with a quick Google search if someone really wants to look it up. (A search for "Bleach plot" turns up quite a comprehensive plot summary in the first result for me, albeit not very up to date.) We could go a short way into the 'future' beyond the first chapter or so, but as Gunslinger47 said, who would it be useful to? People already into the series know the story, anyone who doesn't care about the story doesn't need the details, and newbies interested in the story should read it before going through a detailed plot analysis. Spoiler warnings only compound the "Why?" factor of it, because again, either people already know the story, want to learn the story but really should experience it on their own, or don't care about the story. <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique</a> <small><a href="../../../n/i/q/User_talk%7ENique1287_b03c.html" title="User talk:Nique1287">talk</a></small> 12:57, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After reading through several character pages, I noticed that we seem to have a bad habit of swithcing back and forth between given names and family names. For example, while reading through <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin_Ichimaru_61b3.html" title="Gin Ichimaru">Gin Ichimaru</a>, I noticed that the page refers to him as Gin and then Ichimaru a couple of sentences later. This can get quite confusing for some readers and something should be done about this. Should we go by their first names? Or their last? Or does it not really matter? // <a href="../../../p/o/e/User_talk%7EPoetic_Decay_7f41.html" title="User talk:Poetic Decay"><font color="black"><i><b>Decaimiento</b></i></font><font color="purple"><i><b>Poético</b></i></font></a> 22:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well for the main characters, I think either is fine but I lean towards given names for them. Secondary characters like the captains and lieutenants should be named by their family name. Arrancar are a mixed bag. Espada are mostly known by their given name but what about the Numeros? <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 22:58, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with referring to the main characters by their first names, especially Ichigo and Uryu due to the re-emergence of Isshin and Ryuken (more so Uryu. I don't think we ever called Ichigo or Isshin "Kurosaki" to begin with). // <a href="../../../p/o/e/User_talk%7EPoetic_Decay_7f41.html" title="User talk:Poetic Decay"><font color="black"><i><b>Decaimiento</b></i></font><font color="purple"><i><b>Poético</b></i></font></a> 21:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For characters other than Uryu, it makes almost no difference (unless you are writing about the one chapter where Orihime and her brother were both around at the same time). I tend to purposefully alternate between them to make my writing less redundant (Gin one sentence, Ichimaru the next). Uryu should definitely be noted as Uryu in most cases though. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 21:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I do not necessarily argee with having them completely separated as they are a sub-class which is why I came up with the compromise of the subset group (but it seems that was reverted. although I do not know why since those who wanted the seperation got it with out the repeating, and those who wanted to keep them together still gets the feel of them being together).

<p>The reason for having italics on death gods, soul slayers, etc. is that they fall under <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Foreign_terms" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS#Foreign terms</a>. It says "Wikipedia prefers italics for phrases in other languages and for isolated foreign words that do not yet have common use in the English language" and goes on to imply that this means inclusion in an English dictionary.

I discuss things quite a bit on that page and will bring it up.</p>
<p>Since the words we are talking about for this article do have English names (they're just not the ones we are using for these articles), I don't see how we can justify removing the italics. The broader article on <i><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinigami.html" title="Shinigami">shinigami</a></i>, for example, uses italics throughout; it's not a term made up for the <i>Bleach</i> series either, so we don't have that to fall back on as we might for "arrancar" or "vizard".

<p>I feel that we should create a new article which specifically talks about the plot of Bleach so far, including what is happening and what is about to happen.

<p>So instead for other users to look at certain character profiles just to get an idea what <i>the character</i> itself 'contributed' to the overall plot of the story, there should be an article which highlights every single storyline and the events that happen/about to happen.

<p>yes i'm sure learning japanese is so much easier than us creating a "plot of bleach" page or pages lol. no, of course we need to create a "plot of bleach" page (or pages, presumably one article per arc or something to cut down on size). then we can get rid of all the extremely disorganized/overlapping nonsense we have in each and every character profile. the problem is people are TRYING to write down a "plot of bleach" but we are doing it CHARACTER BY CHARACTER, and this is pretty chaotic. we need a single set of articles for the plot of ALL characters, definitely. obviously it will be significantly abridged version from the manga.

<dd>From my own reading of the manga, Kubo goes out of his way to use certain verbs at key points in the manga (<i>someru</i>, to dye, and <i>sarasu</i>, to bleach) in reference to conflicts between good and evil.

He says in the 11th episode (according to Lunar Anime's fansub), "With this orange hair, all kinds of things are tougher for me," leading me to believe it's something he has to live with, that's out of his control. Besides, what sick person bleaches their child's hair (referring to when Masaki was still alive). Some theories I've heard state that "Bleach" has to do with the "bleached" color a ghost is, or how the shinigami "bleach" the hollows into normal spirits. Another one, which is rather interesting, is that Tite Kubo is a big Nirvana fan, and named the series after their debut album, "Bleach".

<p>well the vizard are actually NEVER referred to by any of the soul reapers in the entire gotei 13 at any point in the entire storyline thus far, but PRESUMABLY it is one of their overly strict rules - remember they were going to kill rukia for ACCIDENTALLY giving a human her powers *in order to save the human's life from a hollow*, a seemingly irrational sentence indeed. so it would appear that they would definitely look down on "becoming more hollow esque" as something inherently disgraceful, and impure, and so punishable/forbidden/illegal/etc. 67.175.45.179 05:08, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>i really don't see anything wrong or misleading whatsoever about doing "Bleach (manga/anime)" after all 'manga' still has precedence, and that clears up the whole bount issue too. 67.175.45.179 05:09, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, so as I see it, these are the two best options (in my opinion, at least): 1) Leave it the way it is, or 2) Change it to <i>Bleach (series)</i> so that we don't have to worry about forgeting about the musical, or the games, or the anime, or anything.

<p>I am also for keeping it the way it is. The plot changes between the manga and anime are very minor, and it seems fair to give precedence to the format that spawned the franchise.

<p>i agree we should have a plot summary, significantly abridged form of the manga. an episode list just does not cut it i'm afraid. and it is a lot more accessible for newbies to read about a plot on wikipedia than to hunt down scanlations of manga, for sure. it might inspire people to go out and BUY some manga volumes, if we had a decent plot article. 67.175.45.179 05:12, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As has been pointed out a number of times, and with good reason, we don't need a plot summary. To sum it up: anyone that interested in the plot can read or watch the series themselves (in another discussion you mention learning Japanese; there are scanslations out there for people who don't know it), and anyone who's read or watched the series or who just doesn't care about the plot will find the plot summary useless. Just because it's true doesn't mean it needs to be included on Wikipedia. We should stick to the intro and the sheer volume of plot covered on the episodes page and the character pages. <a href="../../../n/i/q/User%7ENique1287_dbc7.html" title="User:Nique1287">Nique</a> <small><a href="../../../n/i/q/User_talk%7ENique1287_b03c.html" title="User talk:Nique1287">talk</a></small> 15:15, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about overviewing the characters from an out-of-universe perspective? Explain their significance to the series and their importance to the narrative. In a general sense. For example, Rukia's situation at the end of the introductory arcs is rather complicated and doesn't really need an explanation here. What's important is it serves to pit Ichigo against Soul Society, setting up the first real antagonists of the series. Prior to that, you just had the (predominantly) unorganized hollows, who stood as mostly generic menaces.</dd>
<dd>That aside, explaining <i>who</i> she is rather than what she did might prove more valuable. She is a 300 year old woman (despite her adolescent frame) who grew up, orphaned in the slums of Soul Society. She has an almost sibling relationship with Renji. She suffered great trauma from the death of her idol/crush Kaien, but Ichigo slowly rescues her from her depression. Something like that. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 02:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mentioning that she pits Ichigo vs. SS doesn't make much sense unless/until we update the introduction section to say that he has to go rescue her.

<dd>An out-of-universe perspective would be great, but that requires sourcing too. We are probably safe if we say "protagonist" or "antagonist", but sentences like the one I added to the bottom of the character types section several months ago when I was new to the site ("Encounters between roaming and displaced characters are a driving plot force in <i>Bleach</i>.") aren't really acceptable without attribution. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 02:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But really, if this article is going to be ready to for good article status, we should thoroughly cite the plot points from the manga itself (that should be fairly easy) and track down as many third-party sources as possible.

<dl>
<dd>Lies and deceit! Have you considered how many Shinigami there are? Kenpachi's duel with the previous 11th captain was overseen by at least 200 men, and there are 13 divisions plus their support staff and the other groups of shinigami like the covert ops. <i>At minimum</i> that gives us a couple thousand shinigami, probably far more. Now, of all those shinigami, Renji is ranked within the top <b>26</b>.</dd>

<p>There appear to be two disputes in the character summaries that I can't see a simple way to deal with by rewording, so I'm bringing them here.</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we describe the process by which Ichigo becomes a real shinigami? I prefer <i>withstanding death to unlock his own shinigami abilities</i> because it gives a concise but accurate summary of what he actual did in order to gain them. 71.226.56.79 prefers to just say <i>by unlocking his own latent abilities</i> but I'm not going to put words in his mouth as to why.</li>
<li>Uryu: The last Quincy or <i>supposedly</i> the last Quincy? I wrote the former, because that is how he introduces himself and because the "supposedly" is sort of odd sounding. Additionally, he is one of the two contenders for the title and if you listen to Uryu's definition then he is the last because his father isn't active and doesn't uphold the traditions. Ryuken says he's the last Quincy because even though he doesn't like the title he is the only current Quincy to master every technique.</li>

<dd>Ishida is <i>a</i> Quincy, and Ichigo is <i>a</i> shinigami. We already have the introduction.

<dd>Honestly I kind of like it the way it is now as "Uryū Ishida is actually a Quincy, descendant of a line of priest-like hollow hunting archers." It avoids the problem entirely. You could probably also get around it by saying he <i>introduces</i> himself as the last Quincy. I consider both Ryuken and Uryū Quincy because they both have the powers. 71.226.56.79 17:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One other thing not related to the above but could cause a wording dispute later: I used "dimensional" when describing the "fabric" that separates the places in the settings section. While I don't know if it's official wording, it is more clarifying than the vague standalone word "fabric."

<p>1. I would have to go with <i>by unlocking his own latent abilities</i> just cause it doesn't give away to much plot. 2. There is no need to avoid the subject, Uryu is the last Quincy (whether his father practices or not) because he is the last of thier family line.--88wolfmaster 05:15, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>are you referring to when rukia makes ichigo a shinigami, or when urahara re-makes him a shinigami? in the first case, clearly ichigo is NOT "unlocking his latent powers", in the second case he definitely is. in the first case he is just TAKING OVER someone else's powers. 67.175.45.179 05:18, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been slightly confused about this for a while. Why is it that some characters appear to be able to "fly" some of the time, but not other times. Two particular instances that strike me are <a href="../../../i/k/k/Ikkaku_Madarame_2de1.html" title="Ikkaku Madarame">Ikkaku Madarame</a> in episode 118 and 119 (I guess this could be part of his bankai), and Ichigo while fighting the bad guy (name escapes me) in the Sealed Sword Frenzy OVA. I will assume that the vizard and the arrancar have some sort of natural ability to do that since D-roy said something like that when fighting Rukia, but what about the shinigami? The way it looks to me is that they kind of force the air to solidify under their feet when "flying" rather than actually floating or hovering. Is this present in the Manga? Has anyone else been kind of confused about this of is it just me? 71.226.56.79 18:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's definitely present in the manga. In fact, the first use was in Ichigo's fight vs. Acid Wire when he recovered from a blow by braking against the air. It's not actually flight though, but rather running/walking/standing on the air using their spirit energy. The "air-stepping" technique is presumably part of the same class of technique as shunpo, so they are concentrating reiatsu at their feet to form a surface to stand on just like shunpo concentrates reiatsu in the feet to accelerate them. (I'm assuming it's in the same group as shunpo because the Quincy skill hirenkyaku does both.) --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 21:14, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems spiritual matter can move through solid matter, so where you stand in relationship to the ground is somewhat irrelevant. It appears easier to push off of solid matter or other spiritual matter, however. Especially for travelling over a distance, as evidenced by the necessity for Yoruichi's wing-thing that she gave Ichigo in episode 41. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 07:02, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we need to change the standard reference format for the manga citations. Since we necessarily rely on manga scans at least for recent information which is not yet compiled into volumes, the current format is unacceptable both because it makes all the page numbers inaccurate when we convert from the previously used <i>volume, chapter, page</i> form and because it is inapplicable to all chapters which have not been republished in tankobon form yet. And yes, the page citations are necessary. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 01:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have changed them somewhat before readding them, because I noticed the problem with the chapter numbering, but since all of the citations are from the tankōbon, we should be able to use the exact tankōbon page numbering. The problem is that if we cite individual chapters, we should be citing <i>Shōnen Jump</i> instead. That's actually no problem at all for new stuff; I buy it almost every week. Just let me know if something is needed. Since my manga volumes are in a different country from me, though, it would be nice if someone could figure out the correct page numbers from the tankōbon for the citations we already have. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 01:46, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I mostly agree with you in principle, but think that the chapter reference does need maintained in some form or another even if we do convert to volume page numbering. Looking at what you've done, that does seem like a good temporary solution.</dd>
<dd>Another possibility I'd thought of, considering that the actual names of the volumes are not "Volume <i>X</i>" but rather things like "Quincy Archer Hates You" was making use of our <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bleach_manga_chapters_d7cf.html" title="List of Bleach manga chapters">List of Bleach manga chapters</a> and section anchors (either the arc ones or {{<a href="../../../a/n/c/Template%7EAnchor_6de9.html" title="Template:Anchor">anchor</a>}}) to create a format like this:

<dd>Then the ISBN numbers in both Japanese and English, actual volume title, etc. would all be available by following a simple link at the bottom of the page.

<dd>I think the references should be self-sufficient. Linking the article on the chapters as an addition is a good idea, but I think the citations on this page itself need to retain all of the information necessary to verify the information on the page, including the author and publisher.

<p>Ok here are some suggestion I have to raise this to a good article</p>

The introduction section expands on some information presented in the lead section but not to the extent of requiring its own section. Or: move all the media section into the lead section and move all introductory/plot summary type information into the introduction section.</dd>
<dd>2)Create a subset of shinigami and hollow (repectively) for vizard and arrancar. They are two major character types and with the current setup they are not properly addressed. What I mean to say is: bullets are employeed to make the article easier to read. But because vizard and arrancar are just a sentence at the end of shinigami and hollow (repectively) you can completely over look them. This is wrong do to the fact that they are major character types important to the plot. (this actually happened to me a while back, before I started editing wikipedia).--88wolfmaster 06:15, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We had decided previously not to use kanji on any series-specific words that have their own pages. However, we've added the kanji for Ichigo's name when we already link to Ichigo's article, where that information can be found. I think using the kanji for the main characters is a good exception to the rule, but I think care should be taken that it doesn't spread to every term throughout the article.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think it is mandated by <a href="../../../m/a/n/WP%7EMANGA_5d75.html" title="WP:MANGA">WP:MANGA</a> to show the names of the voice actors on <i>this</i> page, as long as they are shown on <i>a</i> page. When the contents of the article become so long that we have to break out new articles, it is up to us what remains in the summary on the main page. Personally, I think it is good to have the names of the voice actors on this page too, but I don't know if we need to use the template. If we can incorporate them back into the main text, we can more easily use a bulleted list without breaks like the one we used for the other sections, to keep the formatting consistent throughout the article. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 01:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We need to have a short summary above the listings for each character, just as we have a short summary above the listings for each character type and each location. Once that is added, it will look better to have a bulleted list that mirrors the formatting of the other sections, because otherwise the headings won't appear to be broken-out text. I'm not going to readd the bulleting now, but I'd like to see posts on the talk page first to discuss new edits rather than seeing reversions... especially since there are so many big changes going on here at the moment. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 02:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I seems that definition lists work best for the characters because there is quite of bit of text on the first line. For the other two sections, the bullet lists look better because their section names are only one or two word. The surrounding paragraphs also give a nice framing effect. I don't believe there is any reason to have all three lists use the same list type. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 02:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's part of what I'm saying. There should be surrounding paragraphs for the section on the characters as well. I also suggest that even if we retain the information, we shouldn't retain the animevoices template, which eliminates the extra text. Incorporating the voice actor information into the character descriptions also encourages the necessary out-of-universe perspective. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 02:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you remember when we talked about having the sections for main characters and character types merged into "characters", with the current sections as subsections? Maybe we should work on that now. In any case, I am also starting to wonder if the character types section should be above the section on the main characters. The character types section explains a lot of the information necessary to understand the descriptions of the characters. As it stands, we say that Ishida is a Quincy before we explain what a Quincy is. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 02:25, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>if you wish to talk about this lets talk about this. A non bulleted list just looks more professional. the titles/names clearly stand out. in reguards to a short summary for the character section i believe its not necessary because main characters is straight forward and should need no explaination. in reguards to the summary for the setting section it needs editing because it does not properly lead into / transition to the specific settings. voice actors need to be included (i'm impartial as to how as long as its not overbearing). character types would go better before main characters but not merged (as that would just be confusing).--88wolfmaster 02:31, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You might want to make it a little easier in your posts to see what you are stating as opinion and what you think is grounded in policy or guidelines. I've already stated above that voice actors do not <i>need</i> to be included based on the guidance of <a href="../../../m/a/n/WP%7EMANGA_5d75.html" title="WP:MANGA">WP:MANGA</a>. It wouldn't be a straight merge; rather, it would be reorganized into subsections. Since we are linking to a main article, we need to summarize the contents of that main article rather than starting a list at the beginning of the section. It is also an opportunity, if done correctly, to explain why the characters that are in the section are there. People adding, deleting, or reordering characters in the main characters section is one of the major problems that we have with this article.</dd>
<dd>I disagree that a non-bulleted list looks more professional; however, <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> states that there shouldn't be bulleting if every paragraph in the section is bulleted, so I am content with leaving it out until a summary (which I believe is needed) goes in. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 02:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's probably because I'm the person who was strongly in favor of putting the italics in place here, and I only regularly edit three or four other <i>Bleach</i>-related articles.

<dd>There is precedent on Bleach articles for using the Japanese terms instead of the English (shinigami, kidō, etc.). We want to be consistent in these things, so changing to/using the English would mean changing instances of "shinigami" to "death god", and "kidō" to "demon arts", among other changes, and innumerable edits to pretty much every article relating to the Bleach universe to change all of them. Hasn't the English manga reached the point where the item in question is talked about? And does the English manga consistently use the Japanese terms like shinigami and kidō?</dd>

<dd>The entire point of translating terms is to make them more understandable to English readers. If the translations don't do a good job of informing (as in death god), or even if they hamper understanding (as in demonic arts) then I definitely favor the original Japanese terms. How that applies to the current situation, I'm undecided. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 02:19, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The translated and untranslated terms are about equal there imo. The literal meaning of "crumbling jewel" is actually the most accurate representation of what it does in English. Not in the normal sense of crumbling, where it would mean "A jewel that is disintegrating", but in the alternate sense where it would mean "A jewel that disintegrates/causes disintegration". It disintegrates the barrier between hollow and shinigami. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 02:32, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you already know, I'm for Hōgyoku. Not because I prefer it, but for consistency and a precise reason.

<p>As many editors here know, I'm staunchly in favour of using purely English terms for everything. However, here are some points to consider (from/for both sides of the argument):</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone said there is a precedent of using Japanese terms on Wikipedia. In fact, there is no such precedent. Shinigami was used because of a straw poll conducted a long time ago. Demon arts, and not <i>kidō</i>, was used until very recently. Same with initial and final release.</li>
<li>There is a guideline on Wikipedia to use the most common term. Usuaully that is the Japanese term at the moment, but that is slowly going to change with the English dub progressing. Except for Japanese terms which the English dub uses. This is precisely why "demon arts" was changed to <i>kidō</i> - with the English dub using this term already, there is no reasonable chance that "demon arts" will ever become the most common form. However, this does not apply to the term soul reaper/<i>shinigami</i>.</li>
<li>When using Japanese terms, there is a guideline on Wikipedia to always use italics. This is fairly inconvenient.</li>
<li>English terms are understandable to an audience that does not consist only of existing Bleach fans.</li>
<li>Consistency here is a relative term. You can, for example, use Japanese-only terms for consistency within Wikipedia, but then you wouldn't be consistent with, say, the English dub, and therefore (at least eventually) likely violate the guideline of preferring the most common term. Also you'd be violating the guideline saying to prefer the English term when possible.</li>
<li>On the other hand, most common is not always correct/official. This is one reason why many supported using <i>shinigami</i> over "soul reaper" in the beginning. Soul reaper doesn't explain anything. However, correctness is important. That's why it's Soifon, not Soi Fong (the most common version). By the way we have yet to see what the English dub makes of her name.</li>
<li>If we are to go for correctness, in combination with following Wikipedia's guidelines of using the English term if possible, you'd want to look at the English version of the manga, which translates <i>all</i> terms. There you will not see things like zanpakutō, kidō and shinigami. This is incidentally the system I support. However, many oppose it on the grounds that it's very difficult to come up with an accurate translation of certain terms, such as <i>hōgyoku</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consider all these points (and more which I probably forgot) before forming a final opinion. Unfortunatly this will probably be solved with a straw poll in the end. One reason that's bad is that I have noticed a trend where many anime 'otakus' who know absolutely no Japanese (except words like <i>kawaii</i> and <i>yarō</i> - a level above the usual <i>arigatō</i> and <i>sayōnara</i>) support using all-Japanese terms. I'm not talking only about Bleach and only about Wikipedia, so please don't take offense in what I said (those who support using all-Japanese). This cannot be good. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 13:53, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't say on Wikipedia as a whole, I said within Bleach articles, since we do use shinigami and kidō, among others.

<p>Personally, I like having the Japanese terms, but I insist on having a glossary. And if I term does not have its own article then you link the term to the glossary. And if the term's page doesn't include in the lead both Japanese and English terms then I just include it. This way, in my opinion at least, helps keep Japanese roots, and make the series more understandable if you watch the subs without being terribly confusing to the English-speaking, dub-watching fans.--88wolfmaster 22:48, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would support a glossary on a Bleach information site, as it may be the easiest way to get people to understand terms, but this is non-encyclopedia. Maybe it's better fit for WikiBooks. But anyway, most terms are explained in depth on at least one page. We just need to link to that page. For example, as it stands now, Orb of Distortion should link to Kisuke Urahara#Inventions. How many such links do you see? I think that is one of our main problems. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> 00:14, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
