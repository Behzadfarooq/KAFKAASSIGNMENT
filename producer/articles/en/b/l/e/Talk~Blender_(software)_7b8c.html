<p><b>Blender Version 2.4</b></p>
<p>I haven't added this to the main page because I think its secondary information that users can get by clicking on the discussion tab. Ton Roosendal announced the features list for 2.4 on the developers forum and it looks like many things will be added to blender including support of stack based shape manipulators (ala 3DsMax). There will be other major changes.. I don't know if I have the abilities to make the necessary documentation changes to Wikipedia's main blender page documenting all the current features of blender.. It seems the page could go through a bit of a makeover. Also note all the external links below the page (including mine, to my video tutorials) probably should be removed because they detract from the page. But as long as they are there I thought I would link my page. The "Star Trek" link seems not to exist so I annotated it as "dead". Whoevers that is should remove it, or redirect it. --<a href="../../../r/o/f/User%7ERofthorax_83ce.html" title="User:Rofthorax">Rofthorax</a> 11:43, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Blender V.6.0</b> is the newest speculated version of a series of <b>Blender</b> Game and animation programs. It is designed under the overall supervision of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Ton_Roosendaal_84d4.html" title="Ton Roosendaal">Ton Roosendaal</a>.</p>

Goals for after 2.4 haven't really been set - 2.4 has additional targets for Project Orange particularly multipass rendering and general rendering engine improvements (likely motion blur, and improved anti aliasing), also you left off 16 bit per channel support for renders - also more improvements in the animation tools are planned (particularly the SOC project on constraints will be integrated). For after 2.4 there is a desire to add additional customizing in particular customizable keybindings and menus (not a priority for Ton but it is for many other developers).</p>

<p>Seriously, the development section has to be trimmed a lot. Wikipedia article is supposed to tell about the application <i>broadly</i>, as in "what the application is capable of". Yes, release history is important, but it needs to document the <i>broad</i> changes, too. As in "Blender 2.42 was a giant honkin' patch that added a lot of features that were used in ED movie, like (this) and (that) and (the another)." Nobody, <i>nobody</i> is interested to hear that it had "new python scripts" or that Blender finally has a loop/path select. The latter goes in the features section. No wait, no one <i>needs</i> to hear about that in features section - any more than you can learn that "Wow, Blender has the surprisingly amazingly uncommon tool to select and - knock me down with a feather - <i>remove</i> Mesh Vertexes."</p>
<p>I'm not saying it doesn't <i>matter</i>.

<p>Would the issue with ATI graphics cards be notable?

<p>I think this should be mentioned as well. This is a major problem with Blender (actually, it's more of a problem with ATI). I've been using a work around that leaves support for about 10000 polygons before getting unworkable lag (this is on a 128MB graphics card). I can run Blender faster on a 32 MB card that isn't an ATI. Hopefully the OpenGL problems in ATI will be fixed. -Alden</p>

<p>For the blender primitive, I think it definitely needs to be it's own article, just like the utah teapot and some other 3d object I see around here.</p>
<p>The suzanne awards also deserves an article of it's own especially that the award is awarded annually and there's bound to be entries on who's getting an award for what and it'll keep bloating by itself. Already there's four categories that can be expanded upon. It's totally separate of what a wikipedia entry on blender is supposed to be.

<li>IMO, Suzanne isn't notable enough to deserve her own article. She's unknown outside of the Blender community (unlike the Utah Teapot), which doesn't have a large enough marketshare (if that's even the right term) for specific minor mascots to have their own articles. Having a section within the main Blender article would be fine, if you think she's really notable enough. As far as the Suzanne Awards, I'd argue they're not really notable(since the audience is a fraction of the total Blender community - again, a brief mention in the main Blender article would be more than sufficient (and including an EL to an appropriate site with winners and losers). <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirogtheconq_2809.html" title="User:Virogtheconq">Virog</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Virogtheconq_1bbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Virogtheconq">It's not</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EVirogtheconq_c1d6.html" title="User talk:Virogtheconq">my fault!</a></sub> 02:13, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since the <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanne_%28Blender_primitive%29_bdce.html" title="Suzanne (Blender primitive)">Suzanne (Blender primitive)</a> is now a redirect to this page, I suggest adding a section to explain what it is.

<p>What if we created a new category for Blender, along with articles on several projects derived from Blender such as the <b>Blender Artists Forums</b> (website: <a href="http://blenderartists.org/forum" class="external free" title="http://blenderartists.org/forum" rel="nofollow">http://blenderartists.org/forum</a>, among the most popular forums for Blender), <b>Blenderart Magazine</b> (website: <a href="http://blenderart.org" class="external free" title="http://blenderart.org" rel="nofollow">http://blenderart.org</a>, a free, downloadable magazine with each issue handling a particular area in 3D development) and <b>Blendernation</b> (website: <a href="http://www.blendernation.com" class="external free" title="http://www.blendernation.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blendernation.com</a>, a site with articles and new on Blender and all surrounding it)?</p>
<p>That would hold articles such as the one on <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephants_Dream_855a.html" title="Elephants Dream">Elephants Dream</a>.</p>
<p>Blender is significant enough to deserve it's own category.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Suzanne is indeed not significant enough to have her own article so I agree that we should merge that article with the one on Blender (software).</p>

<p>Okay. The article has tons of web references... but looks like I was the first one to add a &lt;ref&gt; to the article. Anyway, all of the web citations should use the {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}} template rather than just an external link.

<dd>Agreed. I just made some small changes in the hope to improve wording in the first part of the article. If those changes are agreed upon, I would like to continue.

<p>Just added a short note about Plumiferos. I would like to note that the project seems to be very important to the Blender Foundations, and that developers try to satisfy their "this is what happens when Blender is used in production" requests and bug reports readily. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find references to this. Any ideas? - UncleZeiv 19:05, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed the "Artists using Blender" section and "Usage in the media industry" as none of the other articles on 3d software have such sections that I know of. I've also nominated that this article get checked for neutrality. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.83.126.45_b11d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.83.126.45">71.83.126.45</a> (talk) 08:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>Hmm I'm not sure why other articles not having those sections make it an 'advertisement' - most of the other articles on 3D tools are extremely poorly done and incomplete. However a brief search reveals that although they don't have specific sections for such content, the articles contain such information within them - ie the ZBrush article "it is used by companies ranging from ILM to Electronic Arts"; and in the Maya article "Alias worked with Sony Pictures Imageworks" (and a specific mention of Spiderman 2). Personally as a someone reading about 3D software - significant work related to the software is something of interest. LetterRip 19:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>I see no problem in an article about a movie or work that was created primarily with one 3d program to cite the tool used, but a section in an article about the tool citing creations made though use of the tool is pretty much the same thing as the gallery page at a 3d tool's homepage. It's there to sell the tool. The other articles about 3d programs that have comments about what studios use them and what works were created with them should get cleaned up too, but this Blender article is by far the biggest offender. 71.83.126.45 07:48, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Anything the reflects positively on a tool would act as an 'advertisement' for, and anything within an article that reflects negatively on a tool would act as an 'advertisement' against. The only questions are - is the information accurate; is the information provided something that would be of interest to a reader about the topic. If I read about Maya or ZBrush I most certainly want to know of some important or significant works that are associated with those tools. Also if you are refering to mentions of Elephants Dream - it was a project created and executed by the Blender Foundation as a specific tool to improve the features of Blender - not mentioning it would be a major omission. Also a large scale commercial feature animation that uses a single 3D tool almost exclusively for its content creation pipeline is unheard of in the 3D industry - thus the mention of Plumiferos is relevant. If there was a mention of other less significant stuff (ie Blenders usage for some animatic work in Spiderman 2; or Blenders usage in the XMen game for modeling) then I would agree that it shouldn't be present. If you mean the 'artists using Blender' I don't see how that can really be construed as 'advertising', but certainly wouldn't object to its removal. LetterRip 06:10, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
