<p>Should we merge these pages? With the new info in ch. 197 and 198, there doesn't seem to be any need for separate pages, considering hollow are becoming arankaru all over.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Capitalization</span></h2>
<p>Ok, we don't have a Bleach project, but still, we need to agree on capitalization of terms. The terms I mean are: shinigami, quincy, hollow, rukongai, seireitei, soul society, etc.</p>
<p>As it stands now, it's completely inconsistent. I vote for them to <b>not</b> be capitalized. Please express your opinion on this (and don't forget to reply to the previous topic in this discussion).</p>

<dl>
<dd>I vote for capitalizing Quincy and Soul Society only, since unlike the others they're proper names. All the others are generic descriptive terms. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 01:17, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes that makes sense. Although, quincy is actually kuinshi in Japanese, spelt using proper kanji and readings, so it's not the same as Soul Society. Anyway, I hope at least a couple more people will give their input on this before I go edit everything.</dd>
<dd>Also here's another question: should it be 'bankai' or 'ban kai'? I use bankai now, but noticed that I myself have used ban kai in the past. Neither seems particularly better, although I guess if it's shikai and not shi kai, then it should also be bankai. What are your thoughts?</dd>
<dd>And finally, why are these pages so dead all of a sudden? Too few contributors. I was thinking of starting a Bleach project, but if there are no regular contributors, it would be quite pointless.</dd>

<dd>I say we don't capitalize them, with the exception of Soul Society. Also, on a sidenote, is it "Quincy" or "Quincies" for the plural? The pages are probably dead because school is in full swing, I know that's why I've been absent.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 21:30, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Standardization of Terms 2</span></h2>
<p>OK I'm going to try and go over the Bleach pages and standardize terms according to the consensus (only involves a few people since most don't seem to want to participate in discussion). Right now everyone already uses shinigami, so all that's left is to lowercase all instances of such words.</p>
<p>However, I just read the Wikipedia standards for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28Japan-related_articles%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28Japan-related_articles%29" rel="nofollow">Japan-related articles</a> and it seems that they agree on using the English version of terms (i.e. soul reaper, not shinigami). I mean, we already used Quincy instead of Kuinshi. But I can't tell if it applies here. What are your opinions? Also, what about Vizard? The first person used 'vizard' so we stuck to that, but someone today edited to 'vaizaado', and this should probably at least be mentioned at least.</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 04:16, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're confusing pronunciation with spelling. Quincy is what it actually is in both languages, Kuinshi is the phonetic spelling. Same with Vizard and Vaizaado. Basically, go with the simplified spellings for situations like that, to do anything else is rather like an insult since you'd be parroting a pronunciation based on limitations in a foreign language(also referred to as being Wapanese, aka Wanna-be Japanese). If the intent is, say, Quincy, then that's what should be in the article. As for the soul reaper/shinigami situation, I like shinigami yet feel we should bow to what the Manual of Style says, which in this case is to use the english soul reaper. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 09:37, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually <i>kuinshi</i> is not a result of a Japanese limitation, it's a normal Japanese compound similar to <i>senbonzakura</i> or <i>seireitei</i>. However, Quincy seems to be widely accepted. But I agree with your reasoning on Vizard/Vaizaado. I agreed with Vizard but an anonymous user brought up Vaizaado which made me think. I mean, from what I know even Viz hasn't yet decided on an official spelling. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 18:17, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you're not going to use shinigami, then "Death god" would be the more commonly used term. Ziiv 15:02, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On reading that article, it doesn't seem to really cover when you translate and when you don't. It talks about romanization of spelling and proper names, but as far as translation goes, it only says they "should be used in its most commonly used English form in the body of an article." The discussion page, on the other hand, does yield some results that apply directly to manga/anime, but no clear consensus. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles/Macrons|Discussion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles/Macrons|Discussion" rel="nofollow">page reference 1</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles/misc1#Arbitrary_division_8|Discussion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles/misc1#Arbitrary_division_8|Discussion" rel="nofollow">page reference 2</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My conclusion: Status Quo, keep as is. We have no official consensus except a hazy one that you go with whatever ends up as the most popular term after the anime has been released in english. Personally, I hold with the "manga purist" viewpoint, but I understand I may be in a minority there.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 22:11, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I prefer the manga purist view as well, and so do several others who tend to these articles. So you're probably in the majority here. I vote for keep as is, however. Shinigami is fine, Vizard is fine, Quincy is fine.&#160;;) <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 22:27, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Plus (Bleach)</span></h2>
<p>Plus (Bleach) -&gt; do we need this article?</p>
<p>I've just noticed that it has been created, and IMO it's not necessary, since we really don't know that much about Pluses in Bleach. What we do know is summed up in the main article (the paragraph I added on <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html#Plus" title="Bleach (manga)">Plus</a>). If most agree, we should probably tag Plus (Bleach) with VfD and have it removed. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 14:25, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>While Wikipedia generally advocates the use of singular rather than plural in titles, plural might still be fitting in Bleach, such as "Pluses", "Hollows" (since shinigami and Quincy are both).</li>
<li>The section 'Ichigo's family' seems completely out of place and irrelevant to the main article. Any suggestions on changing/removing it?</li>
<li>Where do we place the article about shinigami executions? So far we know about covert ops executions, execution by placing the subject in that hole (old), and soukyoku. Basically I'm wondering if it should go into Shinigami (Bleach) or Soul Society, since those are Soul Society's, not necessarily shinigami executions (but they won't fit with the article about Soul Society, which is a locale).</li>
</ul>
<p>I see not many seem to be taking an active interest in the Bleach pages, but some of the regular contributors, please state your opinions&#160;:)</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 15:06, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Plus article is unnecessary. Put it up for deletion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plurals: In what context are we talking about? Section titles? Article titles? Either way, I'd say we go with singular. Also, this would be a good place to ask, why do people keep writing "Quincys" and "Quincies" rather than "Quincy" for the plural form? I mean, "Quincies" is at least understandable, but "Quincys" is just ridiculous.</li>
<li>Ichigo's family: Removal is probably best. It would make a good section under the character page though.</li>
<li>We have an article about Shinigami executions? Since when? If you are talking about a section, probably under the Soul Society article. This might involve a change in the entire purpose of the Soul Society article, however, from simply being about the location to being about the society itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another issue on standardization of terms:<br />
Do we call Yamamoto Captain-Commander or General?</p>
<p>I vote General, because not only is sōtaichō closer to general than a 'captain-commander' in meaning, but also we're using a normal English rank (lieutenant) for fukutaichō, and captain for taichō which actually means 'commander' (more or less). For now I'm putting down General, but if you feel otherwise, please say it here.</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 21:32, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Another vote to delete the Plus article. Seems unnecessary to me.</p>
<p>As for Yama-jii, either are fine I think. General seems less unwieldy than Captain-Commander, which is what I've seen in various fansite descriptions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/e/User%7EYueni_30c2.html" title="User:Yueni">yueni</a> 21:56, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah it seems captain-commander is almost a universally accepted term now, but so is vice-captain, which is not what we're using. Moreover, no offense to Bleach fansites, but they tend to be run by those who don't know/care about the more logical name, thinking that anything the fansub/scanlation groups decide is 'cool'. This is a bad attitude IMO, since scanlation groups have been all-out wrong on Bleach terms before, the reason being that they translated the manga before chapters were released clarifying what the term really means in practice. In any case, Lunar Anime is widely recognized to be the best Bleach fansubber though, so I'll get their version of episode 54 today to see how they subbed 'soutaichou'. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 22:02, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good points all. I believe Lunar subbed 'soutaichou' as Commander, but I'll have to rewatch #54 tonight to be doubly sure. Maybe Commander would be a good alternative to the hyphenated captain-commander or general (which I don't see anywhere). As for VC vs. lieutenant, both versions have been used throughout, so that at least, is easily recognisable. -- <a href="../../../y/u/e/User%7EYueni_30c2.html" title="User:Yueni">yueni</a> 22:07, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The main problem I see with 'commander' is that it doesn't give the user a clear idea of how this commander stands against the captain rank. So someone unfamiliar with Bleach or Yamamoto would be confused. However, we can always use two terms (e.g. <i>Yamamoto is the commander (general) of the Gotei 13</i>); but it's best to reach one 'more' accepted term for the places where short descriptions are used (e.g. Characters in Bleach series). -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 23:03, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Final touches</span></h2>
<p>I realized now that the Bleach coverage in Wikipedia is nearly whole. However, there are still some holes to fill, which I hope to put down here. If someone has more 'holes' to suggest, please post them. I hope to 'complete' the Bleach coverage in the coming week (starting Nov 06). Obviously even after completion, things like copyedits and updates will be needed, but they will be cosmetic. So, here are the current issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles that need to be created: <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatsuki_Arisawa_d139.html" title="Tatsuki Arisawa">Tatsuki Arisawa</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Kanonji_d6ce.html" title="Don Kanonji">Don Kanonji</a>.

I don't think we need any more articles, but possibly one about the Shiba clan. Also, a list of Bleach manga chapters would be helpful (in a separate article), but it's not imperative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Artiches that need to be re-organized: Basically all the 'race' articles, such as Shinigami (Bleach), Quincy (Bleach), Vizard and Hollow (Bleach). I've almost finished touching up the Shinigami article (you'll notice a whole new build, images, etc.), but the others are still somewhat unorganized and sloppy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Images - IMO we need at least one image on each character article, and a few more for the generic articles. I plan to upload a bunch, but it would be helpful if everyone uploaded some.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are basically all the issues that I can see right now.</p>
<p>By the way, I proposed a barnstar a few weeks ago at the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstar_and_award_proposals_787a.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstar and award proposals">Barnstar and Award Proposals</a> page, it's at the bottom, called Anime and Manga Barnstar. Please express your thoughts. I'm hesitating to put the barnstar on the main page, since someone expressed concern over the copyright status and stuff, but overall the response (for the only 2 users who replied) has been positive.</p>

<dd>It is legal (in the U.S.) to sample up to 30 seconds of a song for fair use. IANAL, and I have no idea how that would apply here. Are there any native Japanese speakers here that would like to record and upload (with a liberal license) the pronunciations of some of these names?

<dd>Bleach manga was originally created by Kubo Tite. As the manga became popular the anime was created which broadcasts at 6:30pm on Tuesdays on TV Tokyo in Japan. Viz Media currently translate the manga into English and is distributed globally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bleach is an animated japanese cartoon series about Kurosaki Ichigo who looks just like any average 15 year old teenager with only one big difference; he can see ghosts. Rukia Kuchiki, a Shinigami (Soul Reaper or death god) sets out on a mission to find an evil spirit called a Hollow whos target is none other than Ichigo. Rukia and Ichigo confront each other the first time that they meet, though they quickly put aside their differences once Ichigo’s family gets endangered by the Hollow and the only way to stop it was for Rukia, who was injured in combat with the Hollow, to transfer her Shinigami powers to Ichigo because he has a strong spiritual force. The concurrence of Rukia and Ichigo leads to many adventures, with a lot of humor along the way. Ichigo helps Rukia fight off Hollows and keep the town safe. The story takes many odd twists and turns along the way with plenty of comedy along the way.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Story Arc Names</span></h2>
<p>People keep changing them regularly, always anonymous IP or new contributors...and NOT ONE seems to have a source they've provided as to where they're getting the names. I recommend removing the Arc name section unless and until someone provides a verifiable source, because it's getting REALLY annoying at the rather constant changes made to the section every day or so. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 23:11, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you can verified the names from the DVDs, e.g. the first set is "Shinigami Daiko" and the second "Soul Society Sennyu", then "Soul Society Kyushutsu" (this is going purely on the CDJapan listings). What you can't verify are the translations until there is a US release. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShiroi_Hane_f5af.html" title="User:Shiroi Hane">Shiroi Hane</a> 23:28, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The changes I made earlier today involved translating them directly from the DVD volumes, but I'm not sure of the episodes that are within the arc. I purposely didn't include "Soul Society" in the Sennyu and Kyushutsu translations because they seemed to be an identifier on the DVD volumes that it took place in Soul Society rather than a part of the name. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoulsteelgray_33e0.html" title="User:Soulsteelgray">Soulsteelgray</a> 01:35, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The names of the different seasons are written in English on the back of some DVDs. I think it's DVDs 3, 4, &amp; 5 that say "AGENT OF THE SOUL REAPER" &amp; DVDs 8, 9, &amp; 10 that say "THE SNEAK ENTRY SERIES". So it should say the name for season 3 on the back of DVD # 13 when it comes out.

<p>I've removed the story arcs for now for 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It apparently wasn't clear to at least one editor (unregistered) so far that these arc names are just for familiarization and not for in-depth info, so he added a full episode guide. Therefore, even arc names may be too in-depth for the main Bleach (manga) article and should be moved to media information at least.</li>
<li>We only have Japanese names that are verifiable, except the English DVD captions, which weren't what we had in the first place. Basically, everyone will keep changing the translations to what they like, we're better off without them, since it's not very important info anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I still support moving them to the Media Information page and reaching a consensus regarding translation. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 12:14, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time Line</span></h2>
<p>I find this page very informative and i am in love with the series, but could someone explain deaths in Soul Society and how time works there. Are people reincarnated? Or are they dead forever, because, technically, that is your soul dying? Also, I would like to know how old Rukia is. In the beginning, doesn't she say that she is about 100 years old, but if we follow the timeline in the last arc, that isn't possible. HELP!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>From what's been shown in the anime and manga, time flows at about the same rate in Soul Society and the human world. When someone dies in Soul Society(unless the soul is destroyed), they're reborn as someone new in the human world. In fact, a common fan belief is that Ichigo is the reincarnation of Kaien Shiba. While the evidence for this belief is somewhat circumstantial(looks similiar, was born around the time Kaien died in SS), there's no evidence AGAINST it. As for Rukia's age, I suspect she was exaggerating. If you keep in mind that her sister died 50 years before the current time, and had been married to Byakuya for 6 years, that accounts for 55 years. But Hisana left Rukia while the latter was a baby, so unless Hisana wandered around on her own for 95 YEARS before marrying Byakuya(Rukia told Ichigo she was ten times his age of 15), then Rukia is much younger than she said. And I can easily see her stating she's older than she really is to make herself seem more experienced than she really is. <a href="../../../n/e/z/User%7ENezu_Chiza_7976.html" title="User:Nezu Chiza">Nezu Chiza</a> 23:46, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Character Name Standardization/Name Order</span></h2>
<p>I realize that most of the character names in wikipedia are in the English order as opposed to the Japanese order, a complete 180 shift from the last time that I was active in the bleach articles (~6 or 8 months I guess). I have looked through this talk page and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7ECharacters_in_Bleach_series_9655.html" title="Talk:Characters in Bleach series">Characters in Bleach series talk</a> and haven't found any discussion related to this topic except for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7ECharacters_in_Bleach_series_9655.html#Name_order" title="Talk:Characters in Bleach series">one rudimentary comment</a>. Was there ever discussion on this topic? The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Anime_and_manga_89fb.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Anime and manga">Anime and manga wikiproject</a> states that "Characters should be called what the series officially states their romaji names as. If that does not exist, use what they are named in the most recent or popular English translation, if it exists, isn't egregiously bad, and is the generally-used name (a google test is appropriate here). Otherwise, use a literal transliteration." Google test reveals "Kurosaki Ichigo" (116,000 hits) overwhelmingly in support as opposed to "Ichigo Kurosaki" (22,100 hits). Results are even more stark with Kuchiki Byakuya (74,300 hits) as opposed to Byakuya Kuchiki (804 hits). In short, no one uses the English convention EVER except for wikipedians. It is not the place of wikipedia to make their own interpretations of facts; fandom overwhelmingly supports Japanese name, something that is upheld in the neighboring <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto_%28manga%29.html" title="Naruto (manga)">Naruto</a> wikis despite also having "official" English translations. I am not saying that we should abandon the English, but could we pursue a policy of labelling Japanese first and using English as a sidenote?</p>
<p>I would like a concensus on this, or point me to where previous discussion has taken place.</p>

<dd><b>Leave as is.</b> The order of Japanese names has been long contentious around Wikipedia, but that's because most people aren't reading the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles_Naming_order_841c.html#Final_Results" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles/Naming order">argument at the style manual</a>: that <i>"It has been official Monbusho (Ministry of Education etc) policy to write Japanese names in English as given-name family-name order since Meiji times. All the English language media uses GN-FN order, all the newspapers, the offical broadcaster NHK and all radio stations."</i> The poster also stated that <i>"I believe it has changed recently to make this optional but the number of people doing this is low (eg Utada Hikaru). In my opinion this just makes it confusing. Korean and Chinese names are usually kept in their traditional order but if they become citizens of English speaking nations they have to change. My name gets swapped around in Japanese, surname, firstname middlename and I don't complain, when in Rome..."</i> With the grand majority of post-Meiji Japanese names as GN-FN, to suddenly decide to go the opposite route is going to be not only contrary to Wiki standards, but also will cause a lot of chaos and disorder. Therefore, my suggestion is to leave them in place as is, and perhaps place a note at top that due to Wiki style we go with GN-SN, though it is typically found as SN-GN.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 16:39, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, well I am also using a style set by the Anime and manga wikiproject. Your manual of style relates to REAL people. Anime and manga are a bit different, because we have to go by what is actually used. Wikipedia should strive for accuracy, and this should reflect facts as well as what is actually done. Wikipedia can't be this closed minded sphere that enforces unrealistic naming conventions, seeing as how NO ONE uses first name last name convention. IMO, it's actually more disorder to use English convention because it's simply not what we are used to. <a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHobbeslover_149a.html" title="User:Hobbeslover">Hobbeslover</a> 00:06, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. The style manual covers names, period, not real vs. fictional. I understand that you're using the Anime and manga project, but I'm wondering if they've compared this to the overall style manual (which is the final authority regarding these issues). I'm thinking the whole thing should be brought up there, because for Bleach characters to be changed, while other characters in other series are not looks seriously out of place.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 03:11, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>We are not changing the names of anything, as names themselves conform to whatever language a person is using; furthermore, personal names cannot be copyrighted (the characters, not the names, are the intellectual property). If you want to change the names how they are presented in the series - or in any Japanese series, for that matter - it will have to be done at the style manual level. For us to change the <i>Bleach</i> articles to be out of step with the rest of the articles in Wikipedia is doing a grave disservice to the project.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 16:50, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Which order gets the point across better to the readers, if any? The anime doesn't exist in english yet, so the fans are more used to the SN-GN order at present.

<p><b>Keep as is</b> - sorry I'm late for this discussion, but as you probably know I agree with Mitsukai. Not only is it Wikipedia police to write in GN-FN in English, but also if this is what Viz does, IMO this discussion should be over.

<dd>Whatever the decision, everything needs to be changed one way or the other. Right now, BOTH are used (GN-FN and FN-GN), sometimes even for the same character. It is currently impossible for somebody unfamiliar with BLEACH to determine characters' GN and FN, since the order is random. I'm in favour of the FN-GN order, but since the consensus is obviously GN-FN, I might start rearranging things to GN-FN for the sake of consistency. <a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGuspaz_ad69.html" title="User:Guspaz">Guspaz</a> 06:01, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based on the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a>, it really depends on several factors:
<ul>
<li>Articles should use the same dialect throughout.</li>
<li>If an article's subject has a strong tie to a specific region/dialect, it should use that dialect.</li>
<li>If there's no strong tie, try to find synonyms that can be used in any dialect.</li>
<li>If no such words can be agreed upon, the dialect of the first significant contributor (not a stub) should be used.</li>

<p>LOL! There's always been a difference in grammatical syntax for English all over the world. Bristish English is where all English derives from, but there are subtle differences like "favourite" (British &amp; Canadian spelling) versus "favorite". Personally I hope we go with Canadian English!--<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Ethereal_9efd.html" title="User:Miss Ethereal">Miss Ethereal</a> 15:40, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>If no such words can be agreed upon, the dialect of the first significant contributor (not a stub) should be used.</i><br />
I think only this clause applies to our case, but I don't think it's a very logical guideline. However, for the record, we started with British/Canadian spelling and gradually moved to American. The reason I didn't oppose this was because the English version of Bleach probably uses American spelling, and the anime will use American pronunciation when it's dubbed into English (most likely). However, in principle, I also think British/Canadian is better. Let's wait till this discussion ends to see the results, but so far British/Canadian has the lead in votes from what I understand. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 16:15, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The thing about that is that it's not just humans who reside in there. Quincy and Bount also live in there as well. I think it should be changed to "living world" as "material world" sounds like a rip from the Legacy of Kain series. -- 03:08, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arrancar pages</span></h2>
<p>Again, although nobody seems to care about this page, I'll bring up yet another issue: some arrancar pages - i.e. Shawlong Qu Fong, Il Forte Grantz and Edorad Leones - deal with minor characters who are already dead and aren't important to the storyline of Bleach. I think they should all be merged into one article, something like <i>Arrancar in Bleach</i>, where detailed descriptions for each should be given, without spreading the butter too thin (little info over 3 articles). -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 17:40, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's hard to explain my thoughts on that take. As I think it would be a good idea, but we already have an Arrancar section in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_series_2c58.html" title="Characters in Bleach series">Characters in Bleach series</a>.

<dd>I am open for suggestions, because I also don't think that having one article about a few odd arrancar is the best option (but can't think of anything better). However, we cannot possibly includes all the details given about these arrancar in Characters in Bleach series, and we don't want to lose any important information. Moreover, we already have an article called <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urahara_Sh%C5%8Dten_fa3f.html" title="Urahara Shōten">Urahara Shōten</a> which gives descriptions and somewhat more detailed info about Jinta, Tessai and Ururu. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 17:49, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>True, but you have to keep in mind that Jinta, Tessai and Ururu haven't really been explained at all. Those three arrancar had alot of information about them packed into those chapters. As well as considering the article on the Urahara Shoten is about as long as one of the arrancar profiles, I think it should be just let be. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakaioultimodragon2050_9ebc.html" title="User:Makaioultimodragon2050">Makaio</a> 05:05, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually the articles about the arrancar are artificially bloated. Without the synopsis (which can be added for any character, including Ururu etc. but isn't that important), I could probably condense the article about each of them into the same 5 lines as the description of Ururu. But it's good that you reminded me, if I will have time now, I'll expand the Urahara Shōten article to include more detailed descriptions. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 17:55, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't move Bleach (manga) to BLEACH, and I have double thoughts about the move. On one hand, it makes editing easier because of link formatting and stuff, and also BLEACH is never spelled Bleach except in Viz, but on the other hand it looks ugly and Bleach is the more logical spelling, and surely will be used in any English version of the manga. For now I went with the move to make editing easier (and changed all <i>Bleach</i> to <i>BLEACH</i> because someone started doing this), but it may need to be reverted. We should probably vote. My current vote is: <b>Keep title as is</b>, however, change back all instances of <i>BLEACH</i> to <i>Bleach</i>. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a>)</sup> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 15:18, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not sure about episodes, I never said I was. Also keep in mind that many of these sites offer only torrents and don't have direct downloads of the material you consider illegal. As of yet, the US doesn't have a law against torrents, even though the MPAA has successfully shut down a bunch of torrent sites, mostly in Europe. I'm not trying to get Wikipedia into trouble, but linking to a site which links to material which may or may not be illegal is questionable at best.

<dd>I believe that now that both the Bleach manga and the anime are licensed in the US, downloading either one is a form of copyright infringement and therefore you are right removing fansites such as bleachportal from the list of reference sites. As for the music downloads, I am not so sure because there are no real international copyright laws and I don't think any of these bands have copyrights in the US... so downloading J-Rock and J-Pop off of these sites may not be illegal.

<dd>It's not a matter of language; it's a matter of LAW. I'm not saying that it's right to download this music, I'm just saying that it isn't illegal. There are different copyright laws in Japan than in the US. Hence the existance of doujinshi; in Japan authors can write a different story using the same characters, unlike in the US. But that's beside the point. These downloads are how many of these bands get exposure in the US. So it's really not such a bad thing if you think about it. But that's just my humble opinion... <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleachBaby_9f95.html" title="User:BleachBaby">Bleach Babe</a> 02:25, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you talk about is ethics. I talked about law. TThe copyright law is different in Japan, yes, but I bet that you still can copyright comcis and cartoons. The copyright law is quite similar in almost all nations. I think that in every nations except for perhaps one or two have a copyright law which is fundamentally the same as what most nations have. It doesn't matter if it doesn't hurt the copyright holder it is still illegal (yes it is illegal even if it makes the copyright holder rich). The damages only matters for determinig how much money they can sue you for. You always have to get permission before redistributing other peoples works. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeltz_23d5.html" title="User:Jeltz">Jeltz</a> <a href="../../../j/e/l/User_talk%7EJeltz_3bb8.html" title="User talk:Jeltz"><small>talk</small></a> 10:34, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, should one of us hire a couple of lawyers for about $30 and hour to review this case so they can tell us we're debating too much, OR, should we just not have the links in question? -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakaioultimodragon2050_9ebc.html" title="User:Makaioultimodragon2050">Makaio</a> 20:17, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree; this is stupid... I think that as long as we make some type of disclaimer about Fansites somewhere on the page, then we should be fine to leave them up under the fansite heading that they're already under. Besides, they do provide a great reference for those wishing to learn more about the series. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleachBaby_9f95.html" title="User:BleachBaby">Bleach Babe</a> 21:13, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bleach on Adult Swim</span></h2>
<p>As of March 30, 2006, Bleach has been licensed by VIS Media and will likely be playing on Adult Swim in the Fall around 12:30am. (According to adultswim.com<a href="http://www.adultswim.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adultswim.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) I'm just kind of going for opinions here: What does everyone think of Bleach being on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim? <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleachBaby_9f95.html" title="User:BleachBaby">Bleach Babe</a> 15:40, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it's a good thing. This way much of the hsow will remain intact. COme to think of it, COULD it be shone anywhere else with out editing out most of the show? <a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptimusShr_c3cb.html" title="User:OptimusShr">OptimusShr</a> 15:48, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's true but what about the dubbing job? And I'm still worried some important parts will be cut out due to censorship...&#160;:-\ I'd hate for a good series like this to get bastardized like so many others have... <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleachBaby_9f95.html" title="User:BleachBaby">Bleach Babe</a> 17:09, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I think that it wont be edited too bad, since stuff on AS isnt usually edited. And VIZ isnt too bad on its current dubbing projects... Just look at Naruto.<a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostStalker_48d0.html" title="User:GhostStalker">GhostStalker</a> 01:22, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont think the dubbing for naruto is that bad... There might be a couple of voices that dont fit characters, but the general consensus is that the dub is actually pretty good.

<dd>It really always comes down to the voice actors... I guess I'm just partial to original voice acting. And this is where the sub/dub dispute comes into play... sigh. Ahh well. I got my answer.

<dd>What I really want to know is, how do all of you compare fansubbing to DVD subtitles? Now that Lunar, and DB are banned from producing English subtitles for all upcoming new Japanese episodes, I guess there will be gutted anime fans around world. I bought myself an InuYasha dvd, and I think the subtitles are too small and not bold enough, if the Japanese voices are swearing, who knows, they might subtitle with just simple words like "jerk" or "bastard", which isn't good for the hardcore anime fans, but fine with me because a despise swearing on all occassions. Anyways, what was the question again? (works every time...) <a href="../../../a/m/s/User%7EAMsisscorsister_5695.html" title="User:AMsisscorsister">Darkroom Danny</a> 07:35, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um... no we don't. A spoiler warning is given, if you continue on then its fair game... and it always helps to sign your name as well, so if you could please do that in the future.

That's what I mean. A couple of the pages about the characters had spoiler about Aizen right in the beginning. I fixed a couple myself. I also think it might be time to put pictures with less spoilers in them (if we havent already).</p>
