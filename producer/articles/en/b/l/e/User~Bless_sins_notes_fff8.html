<li>"According to Islamic legal theory, <i>dhimmi</i> status was applied equally to Jews, Christian, Zorastrians and members of a few other religions...Islamic legal sources, unlike Christian sources, which talk pejoratively about the status of Jews specifically, have relatively little to say <i>specifically</i> about Jews. Islamic legal sources refer to <i>dhimmis</i> in general. Jews generally were not, atleast in thoery, singled out."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"For most of the fourteen hundred some years of the Arab-Jewish encounter, Arabs were not in fact antisemitic in the sense in which the word is used in the book....In Islam, the Christian testament has no place; Muslim children are not raised on stories of Jewish deicide; there is no <i>theological</i> tradition of anti-semitism...It is noteworthy that Islam, unlike Christianity, did not retain in its sacred canon the Hebrew Bible - the Old Testament - and no clash of interpretations between Judaism and Islam could therefore arise."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"But generally speaking, during much of the history of the contact between Jew and Muslim, the two peoples habituated themselves to one another, and much of the harshness that we have come to expect from these kinds of vexing regulations either simply did not emerge."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The first period, that of so-called Classical Islam, consisted of the first seven or eight centuries of Muslim history...The position of Jews, as of toher minorities, varied enormously during these centuries, but an important point must be noted: even at thier worst, anti-Jewish persecutions did not have the distinctive characteristics of Christian antisemitism...Antisemitic activity of sever nature - violent persectuion, forced conversion, banishment - was rare during this first period."</li>

<li>"The Moslem rulers, on the whole, proved humane masters...A partnership of sorts developed between Moslem authorities and Jewish subjects, and Jews eventually gained admission into the highest circles of power and wealth in the empire...The Hebrew Exilarch was granted prestige and privelege in secular affairs, and the caliphate extended full relgiious authorities to the Gaonim (heads of Jewish academies). In Palestine it seems the Jewish population fared equally well. A thriviing school rose in Tiberius, where, it is beleived, the great liturgies of Judaism had their first flowering. There, too, developed the vocalization of the Scriptures (the Masorah). The Sanhedrin again deliberated the affairs of the community . the greates strifeendured by the Jews of the "homeland" was occasioned by repeated Byzantine incursions, which carried death and ruin in their wake."</li>

"In thier basic human nature and status, therefore, they [men and women] are united in the bond of humanity:- they are one and the same, and even in their functions they stand out as complimentaries and not negation of one another.

<ul>
<li>"Opposition to slavery did not begin as a result of Western influence, as is so often assumed, for the Druzes abolished slavery in the eleventh century. However, they were such a heterodox Isma'ili sect as to have little or no impact on the wider community. They were in any case confined to the mountains of Greater Syria.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>More striking, albeit less radical, were notable reforms in the 'gunpowder empires' that arose from the sixteenth century. At best, in the case of Akbar, Mughal emperor of India from 1556 to 1605, there was a possibility that slavery might have withered away, if his reforms had been continued. At worst, the questioning of forms of enslavement and slave use, from Timbuktu to Sulawesi, became part of a tradition that later reformers could draw upon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The emergence of fully-fledged Islamic abolitionism from the 1870s was no mere response to Western pressure. Reformers of various kinds returned to the original texts of the faith, especially the Qur'an, as part of a broader movement of revival and renewal. Rather to their surprise, they discovered that the foundations for slavery in holy writ were extremely shaky, not to say non-existent. The Qur'an nowhere explicitly allowed the making of any new slaves by anybody save the Prophet himself, and called repeatedly for the manumission of existing slaves. The Hadith literature was scarcely more supportive of slavery, and many reformers queried the authenticity of some of these traditions. The entire edifice of slavery, accounting for a third of the compendium of holy law most used in Inner and South Asia, was found to be built on a cumulative set of dubious exegetical</dd>
