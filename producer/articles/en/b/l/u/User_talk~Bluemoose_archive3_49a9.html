<p>Greetings! I had originally posted only the first 500 of each letter because of copyright concerns; some thought that posting only a portion at a time might make it more likely the list could be used. As it is, though, I think the consensus is that it would not be a copyright infringement either way.</p>
<p>As it is, though, one problem with the list is that it desperately needs pruning. For instance, entries like <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> exist, and I know without looking that the Einstein mentioned in Britannica and Columbia has an article in Wikipedia. So before I posted the first 500 of each letter, I performed a preliminary pruning - not to remove all blue links, and not to check each one, but to remove those blue links that I was 99% certain were not false-positives. For example, we have an entry for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Loudon_McAdam_eb37.html" title="John Loudon McAdam">John Loudon McAdam</a>. I know without looking that the chances are high that the EB's John Loudon McAdam is the same as ours. Otherwise, there would have to be 2 encyclopedic people with the same first, middle, and last names, and we would have to have the bad luck of picking the one that EB <i>doesn't</i> mention without also including the one EB <i>does</i>. Possible, but not likely. For the entry <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wycliffe_d8ce.html" title="John Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a>, it is much more likely, and I would probably not prune that one out (without checking).</p>
<p>So I've done a preliminary pruning for the ones listed, but not for the other ones. Before those are listed, I'd like to prelim-prune them, or have you or someone else do them. I've prelim-pruned the first 1000 unlisted A's, but that's all. Would you be willing to do some of those? – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>)</sup> 14:44, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, I got my point tested, and the message is clear; any user can add an article about a company (big or 'small'?)&#160;! into Wikipedia and it's not violating any rules! So if I add an article, about my own company or the company I work in, it's ok? <a href="../../../e/g/o/User%7EEgocentric_5421.html" title="User:Egocentric">Egocentric</a> 15:14, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I realize that there were strong feelings on both sides with respect to the outcome of the AfD for this article, now located at <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_theories_regarding_Hurricane_Katrina_5c34.html" title="Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina">Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina</a>. I would like to assure those who expressed concerns about the content, tone, and potential for degradation of this article that I intend for it to continue to exist only as long as is necessary to draw the contributions of fringe theorists away from the more substantial Hurricane Katrina articles. Once interest in this topic dies down, I'll quietly trim and merge this information into the appropriate general-topic articles. In the interim, I will carefully watch this page to prevent it from being abused, and I will continue to work towards making this article NPOV, properly sourced, and useful to those seeking an accurate record of the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_hysteria.html" title="Mass hysteria">hysterics</a> that so often follows catastrophe.

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. I first posted oon wikipedia a few days after you did, so perhaps it is fitting that you became an admin first. I eould like the recognition, and the extra tools, but it is not a big thing for me. i have been involved in a number of rather heated policy debates -- over the spoiler templates, the last set of CSD proposals, the current copyright CSD, the GNAA page deletion thing, and the current Undeletion policy proposals and the VfU/Deletion review proposal. If you don't think that makes me too contraversial to pass RfA and you think I would make a good admin, please do.</p>
<p>Note I would still use speedy tags -- I belive in the tag and bag rule. except for obvious vandalism and true patent nonsense, i would generally only speedy delete a page that anothr editor had tagged, and would tag pages I found for another admin's attention. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:30, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again thank you. I have always tried to be calm and rational on such matters. I have sometimes had stong views, and I have stated them as strongly and as persuasively as I knew how, but trying to give reasons, and to yield to consensus when it formed. I don't really know if the people "against" realy think ill of me, or just dislike some of my ideas. Sure, let's give it a try. If the nom fails, well, that won't really do any harm, and at least I'll know. It woudn't be the first time. I was elected the chairman of my professional assocation, and then defeated for re-election. This past spring I ran for township council in the town where I live. i put lots and lots of time and money into that, and got only 16% of the vote. so be it.

<p>Hallo Martin! I have translated the following article <a href="../../../../de/n/e/u/Neurofibromatose_Typ_2_95d7.html" class="extiw" title="de:Neurofibromatose_Typ_2">de:Neurofibromatose Typ 2</a> into an english version <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurofibromatosis_Type_2_8c56.html" title="Neurofibromatosis Type 2">Neurofibromatosis Type 2</a>. I posted a request for help to one of my english collegues (jfdwolff) but he does not react. So I dont no why, but nevertheles I need some information. Perhaps you can help me. In the german wikipedia I initiated a hole list of articles, (one became featered articel) circeling around the topic neurocutaneous diseases. These are lacking partly in the english wikipedia as I can see. So my idea is to contribute to the english community the work I have already done. But my english is not extremly good and I dont know the "hows" and "whys". The articles, if they will be translated, need some form of contribution of native speakers and people who know the formalities. If you think its worth, please have a look at it and let me know.

<p>Hallo Martin! Your help is welcome and your contribution to the neurofibromatoses will be encouraging for me. (oh my godness this english is a cruelty:). Nevertheless I will go on to do another translation. There are two articles which I think will be worth to translate because the lemmas are red in the english wikipedia: The article "Phakomatosen" is an definition of the term and of the historical development of the usage of the term "Phakomatosen". The article "Neurocutaneus Diseases" will indroduce an categorisation from a dermatologic viewpoint. My featered article Neurofibromatosis type 1 may be translated but there exist an english version and I will not produce a collision. The article Von Hippel Lindau Disease is not ready for translation, I have to do some work on it. An article about Tuberous sclerosis exists but I did no contributions to it. The Ataxia teleangiectasia is to be written. My ultimate plan is to write about the rare forms of Neurofibromatosis (the segmental form) which will perhaps finish the job.

<dd>Martin - No problem! It looks like most people want to keep the matrices more or less like they are now. So, I really don't have much to do. The two pages that really need to get changed are <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_theory.html" title="Game theory">Game theory</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payoff_matrix.html" title="Payoff matrix">payoff matrix</a>, which will get done when I revamp the game theory page. (This is what inspired me to change the game theory page!) I've added some stuff on game theory, but I've been distracted a lot by doing easier tasks like AfD and Disambig repair.

I readly grant that this user is a vandal; I could find no contributions by this user that were not some form of vandalism. However, at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking_policy#Vandalism</a> it states "For static IPs, such blocks should initially last 24 hours, but repeat violators may be blocked for a maximum of one month". Katefan0 blocked for 24 hours on 2 October 2005. The vandal came back right after that and began vandalizing again. The next step <i>should</i> have been to block this static IP for a month. Instead, you applied an indefinite block on 11 October 2005. I think this was out of the bounds of policy. I'd like to ask you to unblock this user, and re-apply a block lasting until 11 November 2005. Additionally, a note should be left on this IP's talk page that they have been blocked and why they've been blocked. Additionally, it might be nice to point out to them that they are wasting their time with the vandalism, as despite all his/her efforts to vandalize, it's all been undone and suggest they contribute positively to Wikipedia instead, which doesn't waste their time.

<p>Hi Martin! I decided to put the new <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_theory.html" title="Game theory">game theory</a> article up so since the article was on the main page.

I don't have a good sense for what people are looking for, and I would rather not nominate myself if it would be contentious. Do you think I'd be likely to pass muster?

<dd>Wow that was fast&#160;:) Thanks in advance for taking a look at the article. I'm always worried when I make huge revisions, I'm accustom to writing in a style that is not always readable by non-philosophers (well, maybe not even readable by philosophers either&#160;:). If you wouldn't mind nominating me, I would appreciate it. But, please, don't feel obligated; if you feel put out at all I can go ahead and do it myself.

<dd>Your welcome, having been controvercially blocked twice now I can empathise. The wikipedia needs more rewards, and less punishments. We are volunteers after all, not prisoners, and focusing on punishments (blocks, arbcom, criticism) as we do drives away good contributors, and encourages malevolent ones. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 19:14, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I tend to agree with the line of thought that if we ban anonymous IPs from editing, that editors with ill intent will just create account to do the same. So, I don't think banning anonymous editing will help. I hate the idea of adding heirarchy into the project. However, I think the following idea has merit (if difficult to implement under the current software): Identify the top 1,000 most vandalized main space articles using some periodically automatic method of doing so (this is complex). Restrict editing to those articles to editors who have been around for at least a month and made at least 100 edits (or some other arbitrary metric that serves to limit attacks on these articles). I am involved in a proposed wiki project for a hobby of mine, and the issue of vandalism has come up. My response to this has been to indicate that only members of the organization can have accounts, and only logged in users can edit. This makes people accountable. Here in Wikipedia, we can not realistically do that; there is no membership. But, we can take steps to defend the largest problems areas. All the vandal fighting that is being done, and which is so much of a focus of many an admin's work, is essentially wasted effort; it does not contribute to expanding and improving the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 23:05, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I like the idea about resticting anonymous editing from AOL IPs. There's no way to block them, there isn't even any way to talk to them. I tried accessing Wikipedia through AOL - <i>every</i> page had the orange "you have new messages" message. It's distracting - I would hate to try to look up something on Wikipedia via AOL. (And, by the way, if you use AOL through a broadband connection you still get the "new IP with every page" thing. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 23:08, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>With most command shells, you can just put the commands in a text file, and then run that file as a command. (You may need to set its permissions to make it executable.) -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 23:25, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Another bot question: does it only change capitals? I have checked like 10 changes made by the bot and they all are about capitals. Anything else it can do?&#160;;) And who decided it should be lowercase?

<p>Hi Bluemoose, I really appreciate the sterling work your bot is doing. I noticed that its edits are appearing in recent changes - I think that's not meant to happen, officially.

<p>Hi, Bluemoose. I'm also a fan of your bot. I always fix these particular inconsistencies when I see them; it's good to know I'll be seeing fewer of them in the future! By the way, one thing to watch out for, though I'm not sure what can be done, is situations like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Muslim_Dynasties&amp;diff=27036819&amp;oldid=25930132" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Muslim_Dynasties&amp;diff=27036819&amp;oldid=25930132" rel="nofollow">this</a>, where you end up with two <span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: nowrap;">==See also==</span> sections in the same article. —<span class="horsepunchkid"><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 03:45, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey BlueMoose,</p>
<dl>
<dd>First I'd like to ask you a question. I've noticed that your BlueBot is appearing very frequently on my watchlist as having made minor edits to my watched pages. I'm not particularly technical minded (I was proud of myself when i recently succeeded in plugging in a new mouse without hurting myself), but i was just wondering if this is design or coincidence. Is your bot the edit contributions either of me or someone with similar interests to me?</dd>
<dd>I'm not getting paranoid or anything, in fact i'm very much glad for what your bot is doing - but is it wikistalking me!!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly then, I was interested by what you said on you future of wikipedia section on your User Page. I think you should remember that wikipedia is, if not to the same extent as it is an encyclopedia, an experiment in humanity - and maybe you should reflect that in your comments. Unless of course you do not feel this is the case. I'm not trying to criticise, but I wonder where you stand on that issue.</p>

<p>Since <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubst_9cfb.html" title="Wikipedia:Subst">Wikipedia:Subst</a> has gotten a lot of feedback, how about going ahead with the bot? Start with a couple of non-contested templates, e.g. test1-6 and afd; you can always add more later. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 16:50, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps if changes are made to a user's talk page the bot could add a section "Subst-bot was here" with content "Templates on this page were substituted as per <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubst_9cfb.html" title="Wikipedia:Subst">Wikipedia:Subst</a>" This would avoid the "what msg" reaction.

<p>Please teach your bot to respect nowiki tags, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;curid=56074&amp;diff=27660682&amp;oldid=27575186" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;curid=56074&amp;diff=27660682&amp;oldid=27575186" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It is probably not a big deal in that context, but I can just see the subst bot adding "subst" tags to all sorts of discussions about templates, which are better left for humans to figure out. For example if I write "It is better to use {{subst:test}} rather than {{subst:test}}", then I have a strong expectation that no one should turn both of those references into "{{subst:test}}". <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 23:47, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Martin, I recently saw your 'bot at work and saw that you invited people to make your 'bot do some work.&#160;:-) Would it be possible for you to code a <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotificationBot_ebcc.html" title="User:NotificationBot">NotificationBot</a> quickly? Right now <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> has one, but he says it'll be a while before it's back up; in either case, the last run had some bugs. AllyUnion's bot is great, but it would be wonderful if we could have two notification bots (one acting as a backup) that would leave messages on user talk pages. Do you think you would be willing to do this?

<p>Hello Blue Moose:</p>
<p>As the author or contributer to a lot of articles that fall into the sculptor American/sculptor United States categories [or what ever they are] my watch-list took a big hit today after your bot had moved through. However I was quite surprised to discover that this uninvited and preemptive strike was done by an administrator, at the same time that such a change appeared to be getting voted down else where.</p>

<dd>Blue Moose - I owe you an apology and would do it if I could spell it.

<p>The bot apparently takes any reference to <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> 1911 and renders it "This article incorporates text from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, which is in the public domain."

<dd>I'm afraid that the References section is for primary resources. An encyclopaedia is a secondary resource, and would not normally be under References, but under External links (except in the case where different sources were being compared to point up different interpretations). Also, the text of the article itself is derived from the 1911 Britannica, so it is inappropriate to count as a reference the work upon which the text is based—you wouldn't go to that document to cross-check the facts that are quoted, because they started off being the same, by definition. Your bot seems to be doing the wrong thing.</dd>

<p>Hello Bluemoose. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avian_influenza&amp;curid=440479&amp;diff=28193754&amp;oldid=28163866" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avian_influenza&amp;curid=440479&amp;diff=28193754&amp;oldid=28163866" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, you rolled back an anonymous editor's substitution of the word "References" for "Bibliography". While you may believe that one word is better than the other in that article, I wonder if you might consider reverting such edits with an edit summary in future, and not with your admin rollback button. Reversions arising from content disagreements should not be made with rollback, which is intended for use mainly against vandals; the user in question deserves an edit summary telling him why you think his edit was not an improvement. This is especially so with new users—which he appears to be (it is his first contrib)—who may be confused when they see their edit disappear and only a rather mysterious edit summary on the history page. I'm not terribly miffed or anything—it's the sort of mistake we all make from time to time—but I thought I'd just drop by and ping your page about it.

<dd>I don't really have an opinion about the bot issue, as I haven't been following it. I think if you want to bot to be unblocked, the right thing to do is to ask on Talk:Bots or on AN/I for another admin to unblock it, not to unblock it yourself. A better path might be to spend the week gathering consensus about what the bot is supposed to do. It's clear (from a cursory reading of Talk:Bot) that there is a disagreement, and users will look to you as an admin to get an idea of how they should behave. Why not meet the objections, and then you'll be able to proceed without controversy? <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 17:10, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Martin - After the bit on ANI, I checked the conversation on Talk:bots. Am I right in understanding that you will stop your bot from making 1911 changes for the time being? If so, I will hapily unblock your bot, since Noisy seems not to object to anything else. This would satisfy Nandesuka, and it gives me the chance to unblock something :) --best, kevin <font color="#BBBBBB">·</font><font color="#666666">·</font>·<small><a href="../../../k/z/o/User%7EKzollman_a660.html" title="User:Kzollman">Kzollman</a> | <a href="../../../k/z/o/User_talk%7EKzollman_107b.html" title="User talk:Kzollman">Talk</a></small>·<font color="#666666">·</font><font color="#BBBBBB">·</font> 17:40, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Martin. I saw your question on jguk's talk page and thought I'd confirm on his behalf: there is definitely consensus among the cricketing community (especially Wikipedia's) that capital-t Test is the only correct form. I can't point you to a direct discussion on the matter, but I know it's been touched upon and almost every relevant article is in the capital-t form. The main reason the categories aren't is that someone made a mistake a long time ago and no-one has seen fit to correct it yet. I suspect <a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloth.html" title="Sloth">sloth</a> as the main reason...

<p>Thank you for your offer on my talkpage. Yes, there is consensus on WP:Cricket to use "Test" rather than "test". In a poll a while I go, I was the only one preferring "test", and I'm happy to accede to the majority. No-one who has joined since then has made any comment about the issue. If you're happy to sort the Test cricketers categories out, it would be appreciated (it started off as "test" as I started the categories, and we decided it was too much work to change things when the decision to use "Test" elsewhere was reached), <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:47, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm the primary author of the linked article. I fully believe you, and I bet you and are of the same type so I'd agree with you that it is worth noting in the article. But that brings up my point: I'm worried that "considered a rumour mill" is (because it <i>could</i> be considered a pejorative) will attract a NPOV dispute (see <a href="../../../r/2E/_/Talk%7ER._Albert_Mohler%2C_Jr._95f9.html" title="Talk:R. Albert Mohler, Jr.">Talk:R. Albert Mohler, Jr.</a> for an example of what I'd like to avoid.) So is there some way we can say the same thing but justify it a bit? I wikified "diploma mill", and changed it to "considered by some..." That includes me! <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Canon_985a.html" title="User:Alan Canon">Alan Canon</a> 23:27, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Would you please put a LEASH on that damned bot of yours?

<p>Hello, Martin. Somehow I missed your <a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html#reply" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid">note</a> on my talk page about possible adminship. I've read the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_requests_for_adminship_d0e1.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship">guide</a> you pointed me to. It sounds like something that might benefit me somewhat in combatting vandalism, at least. I do not have much confidence that the nomination would be successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have no idea what my edit count is (nor do I particularly <i>want</i> to know), though I suspect it meets most voters' <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Standards_ce02.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards">thresholds</a>.</li>
<li>I don't think I'm very well known; would there be enough votes to create a consensus?</li>
<li>I have made my share of contentious edits, though I don't think I have made any permanent enemies. <tt>:)</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I would accept a nomination, but I would appreciate your input before proceeding with it, if you still would consider nominating me.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your bot is doing great work. I note that it dealt very well with overcapitalisation of section headings. Can I offer some more examples?</p>
<p>There are quite a few in aerospace articles. I have tackled the following and automation would be a great help. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission Characteristics</li>
<li>Mission Highlights</li>
<li>Mission Insignia</li>
<li>Mission Parameters</li>
<li>Support Crew</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, the following two articles give examples of what I mean. <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupolev_Tu-110_a6a7.html" title="Tupolev Tu-110">Tupolev Tu-110</a> <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_17.html" title="Apollo 17">Apollo 17</a></p>
<p>I know that table headings might be more controversial than section headings. So perhaps you may wish to just do section headings and not table headings. I will understand if you want to do neither, it is just a suggestion. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">Bobblewik</a> 17:55, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
