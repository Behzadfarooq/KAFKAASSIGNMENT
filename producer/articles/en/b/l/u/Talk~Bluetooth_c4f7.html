<p>I have heard about all the research on cellular radiation that Motorola et al don't want us to know about. I have experienced the power of that radiation when my cell phone is close by my land phone during conversations on the latter. So how much radiation is my poor brain receiving from my Blue Tooth hearing device when it is on my ear?</p>

<dd>Because of the lower level of radiation a Bluetooth headset should probably be better for health versus the full power of a cellphone right beside the head, but in instances where a wired headset is possible and there are no radiation concerns (ie. an MP3 player) perhaps the added exposure so close to the head (particularly by the young) should encourage more research and discussion.

<dd>I've read somewhere on the Internet that the reason could be one of two:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The first chip (or whatever) looked like a tooth that was blue.</li>
<li>King Bluetooth was known for his communicating skills and in uniting warring tribes (or something like that). It was an apt name for a communications protocol.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the Bluetooth logo was also supposedly taken from the sign (name in their alphabet?) used by the king.</dd>

<dd><a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/about/" class="external free" title="http://www.bluetooth.com/about/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluetooth.com/about/</a> says that the SIG was named after the king because of his role in unifying Denmark and Norway. I'll see if I can find out more and add it to this and the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Bluetooth_b630.html" title="Harold Bluetooth">Harold Bluetooth</a> article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimiko_090c.html" title="User:Kimiko">Kimiko</a></dd>

<dd>Weird: I thought it was because he'd created a (historical first) standard version of the <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runes.html" title="Runes">Runes</a> to be used in his kingdom (Harolds Runes) - which makes a lot more sense, since Bluetooth is a communication protocol. His unifying the "tribes" of Norway and Denmark basically amounted to some squallid political intrigues with him claiming the part around modern Oslo and subduing the rest as his vassals... and then losing the whole thing to his son, Sven Forkbeard. O tempora o mores. Problem is I don't have any reference to give to confirm the runes story...</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, the correct runes would be G and B. H isn't present in any form I've heard of. It would also make more sense with G being Gift, and one definition of B as Liberty. Gift of Liberty would make sense to me for a wireless protocol. It may not be vital to the article, but there are some people who do want to know. 66.216.148.171 19:18, 18 March 2006 (UTC) Jace</dd>

<p>The runes are the combination of H and B in the younger futhark rune alphabeth, used in scandinavia.</p>
<p><br />
Origins of "BLUETOOTH"</p>
<p>The essential reason for the well marketed name Bluetooth have little direct connection with Denmark</p>
<p>Bluetooth is a wholly British creation and one of the many examples of British science that makes the UK the leader in science medicine and technology in the world-(official stats please check new pats/advances-(USApop300m- 34%UKpop60m-10.5% Japanpop145m-10% Germany pop 90-5% etcetc)</p>
<p>One of the peculiar characteristics of modern times is how Britain is continually and cleverly "put down"- in the public eye as the worlds leading scientific innovator-as indeed it is put down in almost every other area also -London is now the established centre of banking and business in the world for example outstripping New York while some 18 of the biggest blockbuster films of the last thirty years(all marketed as American ) have been made in London and are by normal measurements British/American</p>
<p>It was therefore important when marketing Bluetooth to find a name that would cleverly distract from any suggestion of its British origins.As Sony Ericcson obviouly has(apparently) Scandinavian origins , a Danish name could easily seem appropriate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is a lie involved in this also because the Sony Ericcson organisation operates from London-where its research is based-and is -again from a "real"point of view-as distict from legal technicalities etc a British company</p>
<p>The marketing of Bluetooth is a superb example of the way there is almost a fanatical obssession to prevent Britains scientific eminence from being widely known. The media seem only interested in Britain for its pop music or health scares....a sorry business indeed.....that the British government does nothing to correct.....JP</p>
<p>Incidentally the name Bluetooth was of course choosen carefully by a British marketing consultancy...</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The whole thing above from "Origins of Bluetooth" and down to the start of this sentence is wrong.And very much so. The radio technology for Bluetooth was developed by Ericsson in Lund, Sweden. Mossig 22:52, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Regarding the introduction, how can a radio frequency be secure? And is "low-cost" actually supposed to apply to the frequency? 213.23.136.189 13:10, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as 29a and sent to anti-virus groups. Because of this, it should not be regarded as a security failure of either Bluetooth or the Symbian OS. It has not propagated 'in the wild'.</i> Brilliant. "Nobody broke these locks in public this time they really are secure."</p>

<p>With two distinct meanings for bluetooth (the wireless comms technology, and the King of Norway and Denmark, Conqueror of Normandy), should we be considering a disambiguation page, as normally used where a word refers to subjects in different areas? It's somewhat strange to see Bluetooth mentioned only as "someone who this technology is named after"</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think there is a need for disambiguation. The introduction of this article links to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Bluetooth_b630.html" title="Harold Bluetooth">Harold Bluetooth</a> that redirects to the article regarding the King <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_I_of_Denmark_73c9.html" title="Harold I of Denmark">Harold I of Denmark</a> (aka Harold Bluetooth Gormson). -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabre23t_1266.html" title="User:Sabre23t">sabre23t</a> 01:30, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>We need to decide what section we are going to talk about Harold Bluetooth as there are two sections in this Bluetooth article and it is redundant. Additionally, there is a link in the See Also section that refers to the Origins of Bluetooth. Seems also redundant. 198.151.12.8 14:06, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read that some modules detect the signal strength, then adjust the power consumption to only the amount needed. In effect, this makes the power indirectly related to the distance.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a project based on bluetooth video streaming. I would like to enquire a few questions on Bluetooth:</p>
<p>1. Is it more feasible to work on the project based on Java platform or C++?</p>
<p>2. How is VDP (Video Distribution Profile) used in bluetooth video streaming?</p>
<p>3. Is there any online bluetooth resources available for this bluetooth video streaming project?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hello! I'm a new Wikipedia editor who's done a lot of research on <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluetooth.html" title="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> for audio streaming versus for phone headset use and found that it's difficult to find out the consumer reality vis-a-vis A2DP and mobile devices such as MP3 players and Pocket PC's. It took me <i>forever</i> to figure out what works, what doesn't, what I need, and what I need to do. I wanted a heaset that (a) worked as a phone headset with my Pocket PC Phone (Pocket PC 2003 SE), (b) worked as headphones with audio streaming <i>directly</i> from the Pocket PC, and (c) worked as headphones for non-Bluetooth devices. It's quite difficult to understand the differences between the three, and there is probably demand out there for some good information. (Incidentally, I settled with the Plantronics Pulsar 590 Cordless Headset and was able to use it for direct audio streaming after installing a software patch on my Pocket PC. I am quite happy with it.)</p>
<p>Does this type of information fit here (or anywhere)? I know it's helpful because there's just no good resource out there to explain in simple terms to consumers why, for instance, they can't listen to streaming audio on their Bluetooth headset, or why they need an adapter even when their mobile device is Bluetooth- (but not A2DP-) ready.</p>
<p>I wrote the following for a product review. It's written from a first-person point of view, so the format is inappropriate for Wikipedia, but would a more encyclopedia-type version be helpful somewhere in this or another article?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BLUETOOTH AUDIO STREAMING PRIMER</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, a little background on Bluetooth audio streaming for the tech-impaired. Bluetooth is a wireless technology that, unlike infrared, does not require line-of-sight access (meaning that you can keep your MP3 player or phone in your pocket or even in the other room) and, unlike WiFi, is merely a local connection for interaction between two of your personal devices. It has most commonly been used for mobile phone headsets, allowing someone to use such a headset without cords, something that greatly increases usability (as those who've used a corded headset can attest).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm on my second Pocket PC Phone (now called Windows Mobile Phone) and have long wanted to have not only cordless access to the phone, but cordless access to the music too. It would seem that if the former can be done, the latter should be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, in fact, almost NO Bluetooth headsets can be used for this purpose. There are "Bluetooth headphones" out there that not only have no phone functionality but also don't connect directly with your device but rather with a separate adapter you must connect to the audio port of your device, which partially defeats the entire purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It boils down to Bluetooth "profiles," and the profile used for phone communication is different than the one for audio streaming (known as "A2DP"). What I wanted was a single headset that (a) could communicate directly with my Pocket PC as a phone headset, (b) could communicate directly with my Pocket PC as headphones to listen to music or for watching videos, and (c) could communicate with my non-Bluetooth MP3-player via the audio port.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS headset DOES accomplish all three of these things...with one caveat. The device you're using to stream audio MUST be Bluetooth enabled WITH the A2DP profile in order to stream directly to the headphones without having to pass through a separate go-between device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As of March 2006, only a few Pocket PC's, MP3 players, and other mobile devices have this A2DP profile; most Bluetooth phones (mine included) only allow for phone-headset use. Thus, I had to find and download a patch for my Pocket PC's Bluetooth stack to add this functionality. Fortunately, this solution worked easily and flawlessly, which is important given that unofficial patches in general (for other needs/devices) have caused me headaches more often than not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are using a Pocket PC 2003 Second Edition and it uses the "Widcomm/Broadcom Bluetooth stack," search on "Broadcom Bluetooth Stack Patch for PDA2k Pocket PC Phones" in a web search-engine and the first link or two will allow you to download this patch. You CANNOT use this patch if you have the Microsoft Bluetooth Stack.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you know which stack you have? Turn off Bluetooth by clicking on it and selecting "Turn Bluetooth Off." If you see a red X in the lower right-hand corner, you have the Widcomm/Broadcomm stack. If you see a line through the Bluetooth icon, you have the Microsoft stack and cannot use this patch—in other words, no audio streaming for you!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows Mobile 5.0 will, beginning soon, have built-in A2DP functionality; otherwise, implementation is spotty across the market. And don't buy a Windows Mobile 5.0 device expecting that you can download an update to give you A2DP. It's up to each manufacturer whether to release such an update, as Windows Mobile is specific to the design of the device, and you may end up out of luck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>I agree, it's impossible that EVERY motorist dislikes. I'm not sure you can even say that it has had limited success without some verification of this.

<p>I've added a bit to the Bluetooth vs Wi-Fi section, as well as cleaning the heading (it's not just companies that use this stuff).</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the claims I find dubious (Wi-Fi isn't Ethernet??), and the blatant ease-of-use argument is plain missing. I've been working in IT for 10 years and I'd much rather use BT to transfer my business card to another person than set up a FTP, SMTP or perhaps SNMP server to handle the request?
<ul>
<li>Why no, Wi-Fi certainly isn't ethernet. Ethernet is defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard, with sub-standards per speed (10, 100, 1000, etc.) It has a very simple topology and utilizes electric signaling. Wi-Fi is the technologically unrelated 802.11 standard, with a more complex topology and, most importantly, electromagnetic signaling. The only reason you might think that Wi-Fi and ethernet are the same thing is if you use "ethernet" as a word meaning "networking equipment," which is no more accurate than saying you googled something on MSN. <a href="../../../n/e/n/User%7ENentuaby_338f.html" title="User:Nentuaby">Nentuaby</a> 22:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was under the impression that Wi-Fi transports IEEE 802.3 frames (perhaps with extensions to allow hand-overs and roaming?). Thus, even if the <a href="../../../o/s/i/OSI_model_2837.html#Layer_1:_Physical_layer" title="OSI model">'physical' layer</a> is technologically different between 802.1/2/3 and 802.11, the Link layer is identical or nearly identical. It depends on your definition of 'Ethernet', in that case. If you take '<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethernet.html" title="Ethernet">Ethernet</a>' to denote only Layer 1, then Ethernet and Wi-Fi are entirely different (but this isn't made clear in the article).

<p>All the PAN/LAN wireless standards gain by having a kind a similar "look and feel". Which is going from the user down to most technical building blocks. Then, follows elements which can be perceived as peripherals (social concerns). Then standard items (trivia, references, external link, etc...). So, I reorganised (slightly) Bluetooth: use, 2 technical sections, and created social concerns.

<p>I've read the page on "How Stuff Links" that appears on <i>External Links.</i> This link has been on-again, off-again, on this article. As per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, it offers something that the article doesn't: a layman's explanation of how Bluetooth ... works. WP's article as written is a technical overview, with specifics on developments and such, but not in such a way that I think John or Josephine Doe will read and "get." I suggest the link stays. The linked-to site satisfies the guideline, I don't see undue advertising on the external site, and no discernible conflict of interest. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidbspalding_e14a.html" title="User:Davidbspalding">David Spalding</a>&#160;(<big><font color="darkred"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidbspalding_3442.html" title="User talk:Davidbspalding">☎</a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Davidbspalding_8ef5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Davidbspalding">✉</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_davidbspalding_bb1b.html" title="Special:Contributions/davidbspalding">✍</a></font></big>) 02:11, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On 4th January, 2006, Google News pointed to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003506916_bluetooth030.html" class="external free" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003506916_bluetooth030.html" rel="nofollow">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003506916_bluetooth030.html</a>, which describes a dispute about Bluetooth patents.

<p>I have 3 questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article doesn't make clear it if inside of a piconet the transfers between masters are slaves are made in both ways or if only the master can broadcast and the slave receive. (it says "data can be transferred between the master and 1 slave" but I don't know if that <i>between</i> means <i>both ways</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Could a slave send data to its master? If so, does the slave exchange roles with its master when transmitting or doesn't need to?</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are only two devices, is there a master/slave configuration? or that scenario occurs only on piconets? If there are no master/slave how is each device identified?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Can a piconet have more than 1 device working as a master/slave connecting to another piconet? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.11.144.176_7ab6.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.11.144.176">88.11.144.176</a> (talk) 00:39, 16 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>I removed the line "The name "Blue Tooth" can be attributed to the infamous altercation between young Jarmsie Davis and J. Beard in Autumn, 2003."</p>
<p>It is not only irrelevant (it was in the section "Bluetooth Profiles"), but it also completely contradicts the section "Origin of the Name and Logo"</p>

<p>I have removed the reference to gaming consoles at the bottom (not the top), simply because I believe it's not important for this article, and the information is in the wrong section (Nintendo and Sony are simply using Bluetooth technology, they are ot part of the consortium.) Also, the information does not make any citations.</p>
<p>Information about these consoles and their respective controllers should be in their own articles, and not in the general Bluetooth article just because they utilize the technology.--Coolbho3000 18:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
