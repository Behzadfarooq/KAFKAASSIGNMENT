<p>I just got a email from some "PIMENTEL Winnie &lt;rhodes@crookedsmile.com&gt;" saying this:</p>
<p>"You are being emailed because you are a user of BlueSecurity's well-known software "BlueFrog." <a href="http://www.bluesecurity.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bluesecurity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluesecurity.com/</a></p>
<p>Today, the BlueSecurity database became known to the worst spammers worldwide. Within 48 hours, the database will be published on the Internet, and your email address will be open to them all. After this, you will see the spam sent to your mailbox increase 10 - 20 fold.</p>
<p>BlueSecurity was illegally attacking email marketers, and doing so with your help. Many websites have been targeted and hit, including non-spam sites. BlueSecurity's software has been fully analyzed, and contains an abundance of malicious code. This includes: ability to send mass mail to users; the ability to attack websites with Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS); the ability to open hidden doors on any machine on which it is running; and a hidden auto-update code function, which can install anything on your computer and open it up to anyone.</p>
<p>BlueSecurity lists a USA address as their place of business, whereas their main office is in Tel Aviv. BlueSecurity is run by a few Russian-born Jews, who have previously been spamming themselves. When all is said and done, they will be able to run, hide and change their identities, leaving you to take the fall. YOU CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES and expect to get away with it. This email ensures that you are well aware of the situation. Soon, you will be found guilty of computer crimes such as DDOS attacking of websites, conspiracy, and sending mass unsolicited bulk email messages for everything from viagra to porn, as long as you continue to run BlueFrog.</p>
<p>They do not take money for downloading their software, they do not take money for removing emails from their lists, and they have no visible revenue stream. What they DO have is 500,000 computers sitting there awaiting their next command. What are they doing now?</p>
<p>1. Using your computer to send spam&#160;? 2. Using your computer to attack competitor websites? 3. Phishing through your files for your identity and banking information?</p>
<p>If you think you can merely change your email address and be safe while still running BlueFrog, you are in for a big surprise. This is just the beginning..."</p>

<p>May 2006 - In an emerging battle between Blue Security and a subsection of the spamming community, there is a logical test of which party is legitimate -</p>
<p>On one side you have a group who have clearly revealed their executive group, source of funding, code of ethics, and even provide the full source code of their software. On the other side you have an anonymous group whose actions speak for themselves, as demonstrated by the above spam.</p>

<dd>I got the same crap email. I must say that it's a great encouragement. I was previously skeptical of whether Blue Frog could make much headway against a sea of spammers, but since they are now trying to discredit it it must <i>really</i> be working. Someone should update the article with these new developments immediately (in fact, I think I'll throw something together myself in the meantime). <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 01:20, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There, done. I've also added the email I got, which actually looks much more believable than the laughable one Zenzizi posted above. For me at least the arrival of this coincided with a crapload more spam (usually only one or two a day miss Gmail's filters, today about ten did). I'm wondering if they deliberately turned up the volume of spam to reinforce that Blue Frog is screwing you over... hmm... <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 01:54, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think all of the DoS stuff should be boild down to only a sentence or two. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a news outlet nor an ad medium. Compare the sizes of the entries for bluefrog with spamcop. Spamcop has had many more DoS attacks over the years, and many more lawsuits, and yet spamcop's entry is quite short and to the point. It also doesn't read like an ad. <a href="../../../w/r/s/User%7EWrs1864_30eb.html" title="User:Wrs1864">Wrs1864</a> 13:47, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That supposed "false" email sent out to users of Blue Frog contains a lot of true information.</p>
<p>Blue Security does perform DdoS attacks. Blue Security is a company in Isreal.</p>
<p>Add to that we recently uninstalled Blue Frog from our computer and since then our Bulk folder has been flooded with spam. It seems that Blue Security themselves are now spamming our email. We never even got this much spam back before we used Blue Frog. And now that we've uninstalled the program the spam has increased to a ridiculous amount.</p>
<p>Here are some links to articles about Blue Security, their DdoS attacks, and their location being Isreal:</p>

<dd>Blue Security is in Isreal, my grandparents live in isreal, there is nothing wrong with being from Isreal.</dd>
<dd>And they don't to DDoS attacks, arguably they send spam with huge safeguards to enusre that only spammers recieve it and only less messages then they sent out to Blue Frog. Its proportionate, its not perfect but it works.</dd>

<dd>Good lord. Who said that there was anything wrong with being from Isreal? That's not the point. It's the fact that while Blue Security speaks of being in California they never make any mention of being in Isreal. The company is not being completely honest. And yes they do DdoS attacks. The article that I linked to above talks about how they perform DdoS attacks. - <a href="../../../c/%26/r/User%7EC%26R_edb7.html" title="User:C&amp;R">C&amp;R</a> 09:15, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see anything in those articles about Blue Security doing <a href="../../../d/d/o/DDOS_201c.html" title="DDOS">DDOS</a> attacks. They do send masses of email to spammers (but at most one per outgoing spam email); they do not sent zillions of IP packets to spammer's hosts, nor do they use <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombie_computers.html" title="Zombie computers">zombie computers</a> for a <b>distributed</b> attack. (By the way, that pcworld URL does not open in Firefox, only in Internet Explorer.)</dd>

<p>I think I have found a place to put my IMHO. =) Sorry for being stupid enough to add it to the article itself for the first time and thanks Savidan for quickly pointing this out.</p>
<p>So, IMHO two points present: 1. BlueFrog is the Bad Thing. (cut-and-paste from talk with Savidan)</p>
<p>I'm a system administrator and of course I'm also bothered with the spam problem. But the Blue Frog solution to that problem really freaks me out. What they do is using same botnet technologies as spammers supposingly do, with only difference that their bot (client) is installed by user admission. But even if building botnet such way is legal, using it for any purpose is illegal. While BlueFrog is attacking supposed spammers, many intermediate hosts and routers are affected, lots of businesses and individuals expierence technical problems with low or neglected chance to detect the real cause. Using DDoS to stop single spammer site is like throwing a nuke to the city with single terrorist and million innocent people.</p>
<p>2. All the buzz with attacks to Blue Frog is a self-PR of BlueSecurity and must be investigated.</p>
<p>First point: Too much buzz over it, too many data sources, all against all, but the net effect is the raise of BlueFrog community. IMHO, that was predictable and clearly states the stakeholders. I consider BlueSecurity has enough power bots to launch DDoS to itself, just as it did to spammers, and until now nothing voted against it.</p>
<p>Next point: just try to google PharmaMaster and you find it is mentioned only in context with BlueSecurity's initiated report. That's a serious consideration that it is faked up. At least no clues against it - whoever can track supposed ICQ talk?</p>
<p>Next point: one of the "spammer strikes" was with BlueSecurity whois information. One can see prolexic anti-DDoS protection within it. Prolexic is a costly service and usually hooked up on-accident - e.g. one must be prepared to be attacked first.</p>
<p>After all, Prolexic is known to effectively stop minor to major DDoS within minutes. And instead of it we have company officals stating that several hours or may be days their site was out of net and they even had to (and that is the most abusive point) to switch their site DNS to the blog in suppose DDoSer will stop and finally change to 127.0.0.1 blah-blah-blah. That's hardly to believe - when the site is protected with Prolexic no such DNS dance ever need to happen - because all DNS entries are initially set to Prolexic "filter tube".</p>
<p>So these are my points and if there are Wikiusers out there which are not BlueSecurity's employees I'm sure they would found at least some of the points useful to consider.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Blue Frog signed up with Prolexic after the attack. And Spammers are known to use fake IDs so PharmaMaster could have made his one up just for Blue Security</dd>

<p>this is getting totall y insane. i've received yet another email formulation from the spammer and their logic just totally escapes me. i'd go on and analyse their claims and failed affirmations but it's just really ridiculous. i mean it's even getting quite entertaining to see PharmaMaster struggle with their repeated threats. <a href="http://evilloop.com/blue.security.3.png" class="external free" title="http://evilloop.com/blue.security.3.png" rel="nofollow">http://evilloop.com/blue.security.3.png</a> - <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenzizi_56d4.html" title="User:Zenzizi">Zenzizi</a> 14:02, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "Spammers' next attack levelled at CEO Eran Reshef" section as currently worded makes no sense. The spam that it quotes is being sent to lots of people (not just BlueFrog users or BlueSecurity customers; I am neither and have probably seen fifty copies by now), and is just a straight ordinary joe job: spam that appears to be sent by the victim, for the purposes of getting the spam recipients mad at the victim.</p>
<p>So the sentence "The implication in the e-mail is that with such a past history, the Blue Security venture, which is still in a beta test phase, should not have been susceptible to a DDOS attack" is beside the point. The quoted spam doesn't mention any DDOS attack on Blue Security at all; it will seem to the vast majority of readers to be just ordinary spam sent by Skybox Security / Carmel Ventures / Blue Security. If in fact this spam is a joe job and not actually sent by who it claims to be sent by, the paragraph in this section should just note that the quoted spam (is it an actual recent or old press release, or just something the spammers made up?) was sent out by the spammers in the name of Skybox Security etc in order to damage their reputation (by making them appear to be spammers themselves).</p>
<p>(Or if this article is shortened as much as it probably ought to be, that whole section should be removed.

<p>On May 2 the anti-Blue Security attack entered stage 3. The spammers performed a "<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_job.html" title="Joe job">Joe Job</a>" attack designed to</p>

   Below is a sample of the Joe Job attack. Spammers sent these to people on their lists who were known to be the most strident spam complainers. The From address was forged as    
        "Blue Security Member" &lt;user address&gt; where user address was taken from their Blue Security address list.

        Subject: Bringing spammers to Their Knees        
                 
        Bluesecurity.com hopes you'll join thousands of others in an army capable        
        of crippling spammers' Web sites.        
                 
        A few thousand spammers have ruined our internet. They've clogged our    
        mailboxes with filth. Already, 90% of email traffic is made up of        
        spam. Let us no longer blind ourselves to the irrefutable facts:         
        current measures have failed to stop spammers. The experience of the     
        past several years has proven that passive measures are just not the     
        answer.          
                 
        Retribution is the only real answer to spam. We must punish spammers     
        ourselves to prevent them from taking over cyberspace. We must reclaim   
        our territory. We need direct action to eliminate spammers for good.     
                 
        The magnitude of the task which lies before us is great. We are fighting         
        for the future of the Internet. What we need to do now is get as many    
        users as possible into our community. We already have a botnet with      
        hundreds of thousands of computers working together to induce commercial         
        loss on spammers and their ISPs. We have launched numerous       
        Denial-of-Service Attacks on Chinese spam networks with great success,   
        and plan many more!      
                 
        We have excellent financiers who allow us continued success with our botnet      
        growth and Denial-of-Service Attacks. We thank the government agencies   
        involved for their continued cooperation. We thank our leader, Eran Reshef,      
        for continued strategies of DoS attack operations. Also, US-based Rembrandt      
                 
        Ventures &amp; Skybox Security for their extensive funding &amp; continued support.      
        And a very special thanks to Douglas Schrier who has helped our botnet come to   
        life.

        If your friends have not yet joined us, we will convince them to do so.          
                 
        Let's stop filtering spam and start eliminating spammers.

   ==Spammer continued attack included extortion and forgery==      
        On May 6 2006 the spam attack took a new direction. Blue Security members received an email purporting to be from Blue Security by its signature, but containing extortionate threats from the spam attackers. The content is included here. The zip file referenced was not actually successfully attached.     
</pre>
<pre>
    
                 
        Dear Blue Frog Member,   
                 
        As a follow-up to our previous emails, and, as promised, we are stepping up in the fight         
        against Blue Security.   
                 
        The Blue Frog member email database has been compromised, and is currently being distributed     
        worldwide to spammers and to the public. Attached to this email, you will find a zip file        
        of the Blue Frog database, which includes your own personal or business email address(es).       
        If you have not uninstalled Blue Frog yet, we highly suggest you do so now in order to avoid     
        your involvement in this war any further.        
                 
        Leaving your email address on the Blue Frog list is a risky choice, as we will uphold our        
        promise not only to increase your spam by 20 times the amount you are receiving now, but         
        to continue to make this list publically available as well. Also, as the Blue Frog member        
        database is updated, we will find more creative ways in which to use it, and frequently          
        release it to whomever we wish.          
                 
        Blue Security, Inc

   ==Spammers' next attack levelled at CEO Eran Reshef==    
        On May 7 2006 the spam attack dealt an even lower blow. Blue Security members received an emailed News Release concerning Blue Security's CEO, linking him to his previous ventures. It highlighted his previous roles as co-founder and chairman of Skybox Security Solutions that offered services for simulating DDOS attacks. The implication in the e-mail is that with such a past history, the Blue Security venture, which is still in a beta test phase, should not have been susceptible to a DDOS attack.

        Simulated DDoS Network Attacks and Network Intrusions    
        Customer Challenge:      
        Large corporations often hire consultants to conduct quarterly penetration (DDoS)        
        testing on specific segments of their corporate network. This testing can cost over      
        hundreds of thousands of dollars, and also exposes the network to many potential         
        disruptions. These disruptions are the result of the intense DDoS attacks testers        
        can impose on live networks in order to isolate vulnerabilities and weaknesses.          
        Since the network is constantly changing, and DDoS attacks are rarely dispersed          
        from a centralized location, the penetration test results often become nullified and     
        end up being limited to a small portion of the total network.    
        The Skybox Solution:     
        Skybox Security performs accurate and non-intrusive DDoS attacks across a larger         
        portion of the corporate network. The tests are modeled and analyzed through an          
        automated process via our large botnet network rather than manually performed on a       
        live network. As a result, the tests are repeated rigorously on a scheduled basis        
        without any fear of network disruption. Through DDoS attack and access simulation,       
        vulnerability exposures as well as security control weaknesses are revealed instantly.   
        DDoS attack simulation discovers all possible attack scenarios and reveals the step      
        by step process that an attacker or worm may follow. It illustrates specific vulnerabilities     
        to be exploited and network access traversed for each exploitable path. Access simulation        
        calculates network access privileges determined by firewall and routing configuration.   
        Our botnet helps characterize the interconnectivity between any two given points, reporting      
        not just whether access is possible, but also the detailed path to reach a final destination.    
        Based on these combined results, security personnel are able to determine what additional        
        DDoS attacks are necessary and where to deploy our organizations penetration testers.

<p>I got the message from the spammer when Blue Frog was shut down too, however this guy is just a pathetic loser that is on the losing side of this war. If he really had the email addresses of all members then why did this "message" arrive in only one of my emails registered with Blue Security and not the other two registered? This guy only sent this message to users who were on a specific email spam list. My spam has not increased and I still forward to Blue Security because spammers blow.</p>
<p>The spammers offer nothing positive and are just a tiny bit of all that is wrong with the world; like Hitler, Hussein and Ahmadinejad, they will all get what's coming to them and good will prevail over this evil!</p>

<dd>The day before the huge amounts of spam, I got that message to take myself off the list. I only got it in the first address I signed up with.

<dd>The lesson to be learned, Reshef said, is that large ISPs and governments need to recognize that spammers are connected to criminal syndicates and that they, not a small startup, are the only ones who can shut down these networks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that a successor would need backing from a government or a backbone connectivity provider to make themselves "un-DDOS-able". Let's hope someone picks up this ball and starts running with it.

<p>If the frog is dead, I say it should rise again. Make the blue frog software Peer-To-Peer. Call it the Gray frog! The undead frog. The frog who can no longer be killed!

<p>Now that things have settled down a bit, we should probably start cleaning up this article.</p>
<p>I've just put a <a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV-section_63a3.html" title="Template:POV-section">Template:POV-section</a> tag on the "Controversy" section. I've just put a lot of <a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">Template:fact</a> tags in as well. Also, I think the first paragraph under "Attackers identified" is out of date: while Eran Reshef did identify the attacker as PharmaMaster earlier, recent reports seem to point to different culprits.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that lots of misinformation has been spread about Blue Frog, especially the false claim that they <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denial-of-service_attack.html#Distributed_DoS_.28DDoS.29_attacks" title="Denial-of-service attack">DDoS</a>'d or DoS'd spammers. Apparently an article in <i>Information Week</i> is responsible for a lot of this.</p>
<p>We should also remember that lots of spammers have the know-how to edit Wikipedia ...</p>
<p>On a specific matter: does anyone have a URL for a press release by sixapart about the attack? All I found was <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2006/05/typepad_update_1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2006/05/typepad_update_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2006/05/typepad_update_1.html</a>, which is rather terse.</p>
<p>Also, I've added URLs for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/16/AR2006051601873.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/16/AR2006051601873.html" rel="nofollow">two</a> <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/05/blue_security_surrenders_but_s.html" class="external text" title="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/05/blue_security_surrenders_but_s.html" rel="nofollow">items</a> by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Krebs_22fc.html" title="Brian Krebs">Brian Krebs</a>, both of which I recommend.</p>

<p>Regarding part of the article that recommends Blue Frog should be removed, it sounds like the spammers posting rubbish to try and stop Blue Frog. Is there a proper source with this info?</p>

<dd>Well, the link in the article is to a thread on a web forum.

<p>I'm glad that there is an open source initiative to help curtail this spam. I'm all for any BlueSecurity 'way of thinking' initiative. It's awesome that since a spammer pretty much closed down BlueSecurity that a group of people are creating a P2P based solution.

<dd>Anyone who thinks any such sort of thing will stop spam is flat-out insane. So long as spammers are able to control thousands of virus-hijacked "send" machines, there's absolutely no way that any of these "rebound mail" schemes can possibly work. (But of course *I* must be a professional spammer if I am on the internet criticizing Blue Frog -- its Koolaid Kultist followers can fathom no other possibilities in their false-dicholoty universe. Meanwhile, out in the real world, many people use places, like Yahoo!, which auto-filter spam efficiently.)--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 23:56, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bouncing email, of course, would be useless. BlueFrog submitted one unsubscribe request per spam to the advertised website, once administrators confirmed it was a real spamvertised site not respecting CAN-SPAM restrictions. Please correct others with this common misunderstanding. Blue Security also reported scams and phishing emails to authorities and ISPs. All of these actions actually affected the spammer by affecting his money source, with potential for a lot of growth because it was legal. Filtering is also legal, but does not have such an effect, particularly because the primary targets of spam (naive new internet users) will not have filtering software installed and properly trained. --Jtheory 05:39, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it might be helpful for you to go back and read up on what Blue Frog was initially about. Their FAQ is undoubtedly cached somewhere. Many of the people posting here — and nearly all of the media in past weeks — have missed the point entirely. Because of the deliciously newsworthy "angle" of using spam vs. spam, most reporters have molded Frog to fit that news story, but not to represent what it actually was.</dd>
<dd>Blue Frog didn't automatically focus on every Spam that was submitted. It focused on the ones where it could do the most good. To be specfic, the developers would identify Spam that had been submitted to the most Frog members and originating from Spam networks that were not in compliance with the Blue Frog opt-out list.</dd>
<dd>Then the developers would visit the page and develop a script/bot that would submit opt-out requests using the E-Commerce or "For More Information" forms on the website.</dd>
<dd>Give this, I think it's pretty unlikely that someone would get hit by accident, dont you agree? Frog was never a completely automatic process. It required intervention and that's a good thing.</dd>
<dd>Blue Frog won because it was systematically beating the big spammers into submission, one spammer at a time.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ok folks, let get a few things straight.</dd>
<dd>Blue Frog was NOT effective as a denial of service attack or distributed denial of service attack. It was never meant or designed to be. The Russian spammer said it himself - they never brought down our servers, they only served as "a daily nuisance". The nuisance was this: for every spam that the spammer sent to the some 500,000 Blue Frog members, an automated script (bot) visited the website advertised and filled out the form for snakeoil, home refinancing -- whatever was being hawked. But instead of filling it in with valid input from someone interested in what the website was hawking, it filled it in with a legitimate plea from a single person to Opt-out of being spammed further. With me so far?</dd>
<dd>The spammer — or worse, the spammer's client — in turn, goes to check on their database of people or leads to which they can hawk their snakeoil and generic viagra and low and behold, instead of being filled with legitimate contacts of people they can do business with — it's filled with hundreds upon thousands of opt-out requests.</dd>
<dd>Undoubtedly there are real requests from potential business contacts in there. But first they have to filter out all the opt-out requests that Blue Frog has submitted.</dd>
<dd>Sound familiar? It sure does. It's what we've been putting up with for years. We open our Inbox and instead of seeing email from friends and business associates, we first have to sift through and filter a few gazillion pieces of spam — each with "Hi How are you?" and "Important Account Information" fake titles. Only then can we get down to the email that's actually sent to us. It's a nuisance.</dd>
<dd>Blue Frog forced spammers to deal with the SAME NUISANCE they cause us. And the spammers didn't care for it too much. They don't care about opt-out requests, the Internet, what people think of them, possible prosecution — all they care about is making money and they're making it by the truckload. The fact that Blue Frog actually bothered them enough to use their botnets to attack is VERY encouraging. It means we've found a way to kick them in the ass and make it hurt.</dd>
<dd>Please don't compare Blue Frog to a DDOS or DOS. As the Russian Spammer demonstrated with his attack, what little network disturbance Blue Frog causes for the spammer or spammer client server pales in comparison to a real attack. Mainly because it isn't meant to be an attack in the first place.</dd>
