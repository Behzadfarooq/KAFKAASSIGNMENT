<p>Thanks for adding the trivia bit for <i>The Fountain</i>... do you have a citation for it?

<dd>Thank you for trying to cite the trivia bits, but IMDb is not a verifiable source of information. I've removed the redundant mention of the musical score contributors, and I located a better citation about macro photography and Peter Parks. (Compare that citation to IMDb Trivia; the information comes straight from the director, which is as verifiable as it gets.) As for Hugh Jackman shaving his body for the last third of the film, I've read this somewhere, but I think there could be a better citation than IMDb Trivia. Think you can find where it's originally mentioned? I do appreciate your contribution, though! --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> 22:25, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Hi, I apologize about the vandalism that this school has been doing, as you know that all schools will have this problem and don't have respect for shit. I am a serious contributor to Wikipedia (my username is BlueMint). My friend (username: nick125) and I actually started a petition in our school to unban Wikipedia from being used on our computers for obvious reasons. We were very excited to know that our petition worked, but now there are vadalism problems that we have expected. So if you could ban our IP address (71.216.49.150) from editing articles on Wikipedia, that would be great. If you need any sort of signature from the principal or the server administrator I can get that to you in a snap.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Much appreciated,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Lars Moede a.k.a. BlueMint</i></dd>
<dd><i>P.S.</i></dd>
<dd><i>If I should send this to someone else, such as a higher-level administrator, please tell me. Thanks.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi, your IP address was not banned but was merely temporarily blocked as a result of earlier vandalism. Vandalism blocks on IP addresses generally last only for a couple of days (this one expired after 31 hours). We do not generally "ban" IP addresses (block them permanently), especially since IP addresses are sometimes re-assigned to different users. See our <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking policy</a> for details. Looking at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.216.49.150_7d0c.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.216.49.150">contributions for this IP address</a> shows that most of the edits it has made are useful, and that blocks of contributions are usually a week or two apart, and that all the vandalism took place on one day (and was probably the work of one or two people). Fixing the odd bit of vandalism and issuing a temporary block is routine here, and we can simply repeat this if it happens again. We don't consider it worth discouraging useful edits by blocking indefinitely if the problem is not a serious one.
