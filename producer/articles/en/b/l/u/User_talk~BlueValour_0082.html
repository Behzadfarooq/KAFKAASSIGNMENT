<p>You said "I find it rather sad that someone has spent so much time on something so pointless, but then I guess I'm an old softy!" Don't worry, it didn't take me long, and I'm not attached to the articles, they were useful in the short term, and may have been of use to someone else later.

<dd>Following on - I've just come across a situation where an article's already been through AfD, deleted, and someone's re-instated it. The AfD discussion is frozen administratively from the previous AfD. What's the procedure fro proposing it once more?

<dd><b>Endorse deletion</b>. This is a straight forward procedural matter. The creator had two bites at the cherry. Either he could have lifted the PROD or he could have challenged PROD-deletion and requested referral to AfD. Having done neither, I am afraid that he has no further resort. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:05, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pure gibberish. The article had been in the system for several months (it was fallout of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dictators.html" title="List of dictators">List of dictators</a> deletion debate) and not a soul told me (or anyone else) that it had been proded. And did I mention that no reason was included in the prod tag? I don't know what process you think is being used, but it sure as hell isn't the one you describe.</p>
<p>As I said, I don't care about the article. I do find it annoying that DRV might be frequented by ADHD-afflicted robots. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 10:38, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Would be to rename the article <i>self-sacrifice</i> and redirect the words <i>Mesiras nefesh</i> to this article so it won’t interfere with the linked articles.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps call it 'Self-sacrifice in Judaism' or 'Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law' since we are not dealing with self-sacrifice in all culture! Which would you prefer? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 20:40, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>one more point (this might be what you were trying to say in the discussion page) although true someone that is killed for not giving up the fate is called a martyr, but the act of doing so is self-sacrifice for which one afterwards is called a martyr.</dd>

<p>I've seen this line in most of your comments to delete articles on US college athletes. In many parts of the country, there are no professional teams for hundreds of miles, so the amount of coverage the local or state university team will receive approches that of the big-city media towards it's hometown team. Where I'm from, the closest professional teams are 75 miles away, and the closest NBA team is over 200 miles away. We don't have a <a href="../../../l/e/b/LeBron_James_9f63.html" title="LeBron James">LeBron James</a> to cheer for, so <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Pittsnogle_cc5e.html" title="Kevin Pittsnogle">Kevin Pittsnogle</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Gansey_c05a.html" title="Mike Gansey">Mike Gansey</a> gets all the press.</p>
<p>With the exception of baseball and hockey, there are no second or third division professional leagues of note, and relegation or promotion to or from the top tier is out of the question (although it would encourage some of the perrenial cellar-dwellers to put forth some more effort). So college players in the major sports will reach a notability level here rivalling or exceeding many professional players. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 20:58, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, this is helpful background. I am persuaded that college athletes can be notable but not that they are inherently notable. There have been dozens of articles created recently where the achievements have not been particulalrly outstanding. I hope that you can come with me and just keep the notable ones. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:26, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've concurred with one already.&#160;:) My best analogy is to consider NCAA basketball and football as similar in level to Scottish Football League First or Second Division, or 'The Championship' and 'League One' (or whatever the name of the month is) in England. Just without (Why can't they settle on a name and stick with it? Premiership and First Division were simpler to understand and weren't mucking about with semantics.) --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 21:51, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whether you consider NCAA basketball notable or not is up to you, as it's only a matter of opinion. You are very much entitled to your opinions. But for the love of God, please stop listing articles for deletion, when there are people like me who consider them notable. Top tier, all-american collegiate athletes are too notable to be listed on afd. --Summonmaster13 04:01, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I have argued for keeping most of these articles, I feel that BlueValour is indeed acting in good faith. I feel that he honestly was not aware of the points raised by DarkAudit. If anything, its good to have these sort of discussions from time to time to gauge where the community stands. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">ahoy-hoy</a>)</small> 13:35, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, as I say above, I have moved to accepting that they can be notable based on DarkAudit's excellent reasoning. However, the case needs to be demonstrated each time and Summonmaster13's argument that there should not be an AfD because he finds them notable is not in any guidelines that I can find&#160;:-) More seriously, a number of the profiles are not sourced which is a bad ommission when facts and figures are being relied upon to establish notability. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:32, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sounds good; sorry for underestimating your knowledge&#160;:-) I was watching Lancashire v Yorkshire, a 17,000 sell-out (v.good for cricket). This is in a new format called <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty20.html" title="Twenty20">Twenty20</a>. Twenty overs per side, and lasts under 3 hours to appeal to those with a short attention span!

<dl>
<dd>I'm all in favour. It gets more people watching cricket and, hopefully, they will take their interest into the longer form of the game. Some of these matches start at 5.40pm which enables people to go there after work, have a couple of pints with their mates while watching cricket in the sunshine and still get home in reasonable time for the family. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:58, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm been away playing chess&#160;:-) I am assuming that the reference we have deals with all the key points under 'Requirement' (I'll leave that with you) so perhaps we need a source that uses the two Hebrew phrases and interprets them as we have done under 'Useage'?

<p>You wrote, regarding the article <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_9th_congressional_district_election%2C_2006.html" title="Florida 9th congressional district election, 2006">Florida 9th congressional district election, 2006</a>, that it <i>seems to duplicate <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_elections%2C_2006_ed6d.html#Florida" title="United States House elections, 2006">United States House elections, 2006#Florida</a> to which it seems not to be linked (unless I missed the link which is entirely possible!). It seems to me that the better course is to merge your content into the substantive article - what do you think?</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>You're correct that there was not a link. I intend to fix that, in both directions. As to duplication, the U.S. House elections page contains only one paragraph on the race, which is typical of that page's approach, since it covers dozens of races. The article I wrote on the Florida 9th has substantially more information (though far less on Busansky than was on her deleted page), and I would expect that more will be added as November approaches, while the U.S. House elections page information will remain at a paragraph or so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would expect that as wikipedia continues to grow, every competitive Congressional election will get its own page - something that will be of continued interest to those looking back at the careers of Congressfolk or the electoral history of a district. The U.S. House elections page, which is essentially continually updated to show "current" status, is unsuited for this purpose. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 12:01, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why would you deny people from Canada to have access to researching this individual. He appears on the government of Ontario and Government of Canada registry for active lobbyists. I think this needs to be opened up to a wider discussion. How can that take place. Also, it should be encouraged to review already public information on google and on the government of Ontario Integrity Commission website at: <a href="http://lobbyist.oico.on.ca/Integrity/RegistrationGeneral.nsf/PublicFramesWeb?OpenPage" class="external free" title="http://lobbyist.oico.on.ca/Integrity/RegistrationGeneral.nsf/PublicFramesWeb?OpenPage" rel="nofollow">http://lobbyist.oico.on.ca/Integrity/RegistrationGeneral.nsf/PublicFramesWeb?OpenPage</a></p>
<p>Also, a number of collegues also have entries in Wikipedia including: Leslie Noble, Deb Hutton, Gerald Caplan, Ian Brodie, Rod Love</p>
<p>Why is this individual singled out? Perhaps he is not in the right category on wikipedia?</p>

<p>I have removed your speedy tag. Please review the precise definition of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Wikipedia%7EPatent_nonsense_6c73.html" title="Wikipedia:Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a>, as it is quite limited. The content on the page in question is clearly not a string of random text; likewise, it does not come close to meeting the other possible requirement of "patent nonsense," i.e.: "Content that, while apparently meaningful after a fashion, is so completely and irredeemably confused that no intelligent person can be expected to make any sense of it whatsoever." The article clearly does not merit inclusion into Wikipedia, as I've indicated with my earlier {{prod}}, but it does communicate a perfectly intelligible message. Ergo, "patent nonsense" does not apply. Please be more mindful of using speedy tags in the future. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RidG_4a2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 05:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, hope you're doing ok. You put tags asking for sources/references in two articles I recently worked with (Petra discography). I would like to know exactly sources to what part of the article, or references to what. Thanks in advance for your help.

<dd>Basically, where you got the information from? Either a webpage, the title and ISDN of a reference book etc As you know, being a very experienced editor, it cannot be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a>. For example on 'No Doubt' you say 'New keyboardist Jim Cooper was a keyboard technician for former keyboardist John Lawry for several years. When Lawry retired, Cooper replaced him.' Now you may simply know this but that doesn't cut it; it needs a source.

<p>I intended to reply at AN/I, but I thought, in view of my tendency toward verbosity and the less-than-specific nature of Blue's query, I might do well instead to reply on Blue's and Slim's talk pages:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think Slim's reversions of the <i>peer review</i> formulation to have been correct, but I certainly agree that she might have been more decorous in her edit summaries and her message on Blue's talk page, where she ostensibly failed to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, or at least was gratuitously provocative (the presumption that Blue's [ostensible] views apropos of animal rights informed his editing need not to be made and certainly focuses on a contributor rather than on content). No one is immune from the impulse to respond cursorily toward that which one thinks to be other than an attempt to improve the encyclopedia, but, to my mind, it is far from clear that Blue was acting in view of other than encyclopedic motivations. I have difficulty believing, though, that any new editor would be so disturbed by Slim's comments (several of which appear to have been altogether jocular, in furtherance of the collegial and civil spirit on the maintenance of which the project depends) as to leave the project, and I'd be inclined to believe that anyone so irked would be unlikely to be able to contribute to the project. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 04:08, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I nominated the article for AfD, as I was entitled to, and the Community, as they are entitled to, took a 'no concensus decision'. Let us move on from that. I can see that what I have done in removing the link in question may construed as vandalism, but it was an honest attempt to make the article better. Statements such as 'If it continues, I will report you for it' are not helpful to the Project. I look forward to working with you in the future to improve this and other articles. As always I will continue to treat you with respect and will expect you to reciprocate. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 00:05, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you. I appreciate that. I have to clarify that it wasn't only the removal of the link, but also of the byline that was the issue, and I wonder whether you're confused between <i>References</i> and <i>Further reading</i>. Links can be removed from <i>Further reading</i> if regarded as inappropriate. However, a citation in the <i>References</i> section means the material has been used a source in the article, and full citations must therefore be given: byline, name of article or book, name of newspaper/magazine/journal/publisher, date of publication, and a URL if one is available. Not to source material is a violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and sources should never be removed from articles or from the <i>References</i> section, unless the material it served as a source for has been removed or re-sourced. However, I'll say no more about it, and hope we can put it behind us. Thank you again for your note. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I am busy currently patrolling with VP, the new edit came up for inspection, VP was used simply as a means to perform a rollback to allow me to continue with my patrol, with an appropriate message on the talk page. You will note that no Vandalism warning was issued to you. Had I thought it was vandalism I would have done so in the same way that other editor have warned you, at the top and bottom of your talk page, about breaking the 3 Revert Rule. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Harvey_bc06.html" title="User:Richard Harvey">Richard Harvey</a> 21:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're welcome! It's very useful, particularly when used in combination the {{R to disambiguation page}} tag -- see, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Robertson_%28disambiguation%29&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Robertson_%28disambiguation%29&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">John Robertson (disambiguation)</a>. I got ticked off when I put dab pages at xxx (disambiguation); that's only appropriate when the xxx page is much more significant than the others. But the combination of {{otherpeople|xxx}}, the {{R to disambiguation page}} tag in [[xxx (disambigaution]] and {{otherpeople}} in each article allows the dab page to be moved if needed. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 18:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good to hear from you again. The short answer is no. T&amp;C which allow non-commercial use is not good enough for Wikipedia&#160;:-( The problem is that Wikipedia content can be used for /any/ purpose, including commercial use, so pictures that are uploaded need to permit any use. There is a boilerplate email around that you can send to the company asking for permission.

<p>It appears that you have a hobby of marking articles PROD, usually arguing that the subject is not notable enough. I am curious why, especially since a quick web search would easily establish notability in many cases such as the one above. It's sad that informative articles might be removed from Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuadfranklin_3f67.html" title="User:Joshuadfranklin">Joshuadfranklin</a> 05:09, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am curious about your interpretation of the notability policy. In my view a short article about an establishment of local or region interest is notable (assuming the other criterea are met, i.e. not "Starbucks number 1234") if users are coming to Wikipedia looking for it. It takes a lot of work to write the pages, then more time and effort to go through the whole AfD process; I would prefer this time were spent writing more or removing obvious vandalism. Based on your comments on the above page, you disagree. I would love to hear more details of your thinking. Again, this is a good faith question and I hope to get an interesting answer. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuadfranklin_3f67.html" title="User:Joshuadfranklin">Joshuadfranklin</a> 19:06, 6 August 2006 (UTC)e</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your constructive response. The next step is to eliminate POV words such as <b>prominent</b> singer and <b>eminent</b> lecturer, and later words such as outstanding, famous etc The achievements in the article should speak for themselves. Further, 'chatty' comments such as his travels, lecturing should come out. Finally, the full filmography is not need - people would not be interested in so much detail. Better to summarise the information whilst higlighting the really notable ones, such as those for which he has recieved an award. HTH. Please get straight back to me with further queries. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 16:10, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. Remember me? Probably not, but you helped out a few weeks back. I'm having a little difficulty with <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fields_of_the_Nephilim_3fd3.html" title="Fields of the Nephilim">Fields of the Nephilim</a> and the user fieldsofthenephilim.com. If you take a look at the article history (and his user talk page) I have tried to explain that links to advertising sites are not suitable sites for external links, but he just disregards and keeps re-inserting. Now I realised that I carelessly violated the 3RR myself, which may draw some sanction, but am I being unreasonable in considering the link unsuitable? If not, would you be so kind as to helping to have appropriate action taken. Thanks. I have raised this query with more than one of the people who have assisted me in the past. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 14:02, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because our School Divisions here in Virginia are legally separate political subdivisions of the Commonwealth of Virginia from the counties, towns, and independent cities they serve, we have been maintaining separate articles for school divisions, articles which are growing in many cases by contributions by student and teacher users. I think the info you added under <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake%2C_Virginia_f264.html" title="Chesapeake, Virginia">City of Chesapeake</a> would be more appropriate in the article <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_City_Public_Schools_3b96.html" title="Chesapeake City Public Schools">Chesapeake City Public Schools</a>, where it will probably generate more similar contributions.

<p>Please keep the sentence in. It is grammatically better, emphasises the inherentness of the notability, and makes it easy to quote. There's a bit of confusion at the moment with some AfDs issued today by the looks of things and it would really help to have it precisely laid out. There really are bigger things to deal with than continually reverting my edits... <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 17:14, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>you said (along the lines of): "you moved sorcery in the sky, please move redirects as well" I did not do that.

<dd>Ah, I see what's going on. You had merged the original Sorcery article into the MGM article and pointed the Sorcery redir to the MGM piece.

<dd>I am very happy to explain. In my view, an individual article on each detainee is not appropriate. I think that there should be a combined article with a summary on each detainee. First of all, that would make the article easier to navigate. Secondly, this amount of detail is not, in my view, suitable for an encyclopaedia. We are here to record important facts and these articles go too far. Wikipedia is not, and should not be used as, a vehicle for pressing individual cases. I am based in the UK and have no 'partisan political motives' (to the extent that I understand that phrase). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 23:53, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A combined article, with a summary on each detainee?</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Have you done the math? The DoD acknowledges holding 759 detainess in Guantanamo. We know something about close to 500 of them. And we know quite a lot about close to 100 of them. So, this combined article of yours couldn't possibly be less than dozens of pages long. It could end up being more than one hundred pages. It could end up growing to hundreds of pages. An article of this length would be far too long to be useful.</li>
<li>I know that to a lot of wikipedia contributors merging articles seems to be obviously the right thing to do, that leaving the wikipedia composed as a constellation of smaller, more tightly focussed articles, is inconceivable. I think I have read all the arguments for merging related articles. But I haven't found those arguments convincing. And I find myself getting pretty frustrated that none of those fans of merging see how limiting that would be.
<ul>
<li>The wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. Paper documents are inherently linear. From top to bottom, from front to back. It is very limiting. With old fashioned, linear, paper documents, the author blazes the trail through the universe of human knowledge. The wikipedia I would like to see would be composed of a larger number of shorter articles -- allowing the reader to browse through the network of human knowledge in the directions that best suits them.</li>
<li>Consider Al Fouzan. You stated that you think coverage the wikipedia has of him should be in an (enormous) article about all the Guantanamo detainees. That Al Fouzan is just another Guantanamo detainee is just one possible way of classifying him.
<ol>
<li>Al Fouzan is also alleged to be an alumnus the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Nasir_training_camp_f2da.html" title="Abu Nasir training camp">Abu Nasir training camp</a>. Some of us have been documenting all the Taliban and al Qaeda training camps. So far Al Fouzan is the only alleged alumnus of Abu Nasir. But we have about two dozen alleged alumni of the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalden_training_camp.html" title="Khalden training camp">Khalden training camp</a> and the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Farouq_training_camp_2e6c.html" title="Al Farouq training camp">Al Farouq training camp</a>. Each of those articles on training camps is linked to the articles on the alleged alumni. If we followed your approach each of those links would then be redirected to that unusably large single article on all the Guantanamo detainees.</li>
<li>Al Fouzan is also alleged to have worked for the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Haramain_Foundation_1fa8.html" title="Al Haramain Foundation">Al Haramain Foundation</a>, which the US government alleges is no longer a real charity because some of its resources have been used as a cover for terrorist projects. If I come across anything that suggests that the US allegations against Al Haramain are based on real evidence I will add that to the article on Al Haramain. Meanwhile I think it is worthwhile to link the Al Haramain article to the articles about the detainees who remained in detention because they were believed to have ties to Al Haramain.</li>
<li>Al Fouzan's name is reported to have been found on various suspicious lists. This is interesting because while there are detainees whose names were found on multiple lists, I haven't come across detainees whose names were reported to have been found on so many lists. Take another look at factors 4 and 5 under the connection heading. I would guess that the site referred to might be the UK based <a href="http://cageprisoners.com" class="external text" title="http://cageprisoners.com" rel="nofollow">cageprisoners.com</a>.
<ul>
<li>As some of the detainees pointed out to their Tribunals, a site advocating the release of those Guantanamo detainees who were innocent bystanders does not establish a tie between that site and terrorism. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the UK based human rights group Reprieve all listed details about some of the Guantanamo detainees before the DoD released their transcripts and official lists. Does that imply that the organization is linked to terrorism?</li>
<li>As some of the detainees pointed out to their Tribunals, even if it had been established that a site advocating the release of Guantanamo detainees was linked to terrorism, does merely being listed on that site imply the detainee is a terrorist?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note factor 7, Al Fouzan's known alias was found on a list. After reading several hundred transcripts I have reached several conclusions about the American intelligence analysis efforts at Guantanamo. I am extremely skeptical of the claims that Guantanamo provided "invaluable intelligence". I find it pretty clear that those in charge of managing the files had zero knowledge of how <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_names.html" title="Arabic names">Arabic names</a> worked. Consider <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faruq_Ali_Ahmed_3d86.html#One_new_allegation_against_Ahmed" title="Faruq Ali Ahmed">Faruq Ali Ahmed#One new allegation against Ahmed</a>. Many detainees, when responding to the allegation that one of their "known aliases" was found on a list, denied having any aliases. Many of them asked what the alias was. The Tribunal officers couldn't tell them. They didn't know. Earlier today I responded, at length, to another wikipedia contributor who was under the mistaken impression that by holding the Combatant Status Review Tribunals the USA had fulfilled its Geneva Convention obligation to convene competent tribunals to separate the prisoners who were entitled to POW status, from those who were innocent civilians, from those who had stripped themselves of POW status. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUnlawful_combatant&amp;diff=73582335&amp;oldid=73425107" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUnlawful_combatant&amp;diff=73582335&amp;oldid=73425107" rel="nofollow">Take a look.</a></li>

<dd>You are absolutely correct. Advocacy is not the role of the wikipedia. But I just re-read Al Fouzan's article, and I fail to see how you can describe it as advocacy. Please explain further. IMO I have confined myself to the bald facts. It is up to the readers to draw their own conclusions as to whether Al Fouzan's detention is lawful, or wise, or well-conducted.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I commented on your nomination of the Harry MacEwen for deletion. IMO that nomination was contrary to wikipedia policy. Nominating Al Fouzan for speedy deletion is even more clearly a lapse in observation of wikipedia policy. I don't see how it meets any of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>. And you haven't offered a criteria you think it fails to meet.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IMO one of the wikipedia's greatest flaws is that there is no well-known forum for discussing the future shape of the wikipedia. Instead, what I see, are chaotic, and, IMO, disrespectful, attempts to reshape the wikipedia by people who feel okay about using the apparatus of the wikipedia without regard to the intended purpose of those apparatus. It probably sounds like when I think I am noticing the mis-use wikipedia's apparatus it really bugs me. It does really bug me. Last fall I was intensely troubled by another wikipedian who followed around my edits, like a stalker. This wikipedian, in addition to hundreds of abusive comments, routinely misrepresenting my positions, dozens of baseless accusations, this wikipedian routinely initiated wikipedia procedures in violation of policy, ignoring civil request to defend their use, and routinely placed bogus wikipedia tags, similarly ignoring civil requests to defend their use.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is wikipedia policy to seek consensus. Some people read the <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> guideline as granting them permission to ignore real wikipedia policies and other guidelines.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I think that is a misreading of the guidelines.</li>
<li>Policies should trump mere guidelines.</li>
<li>The guideline encourages new users to be (relatively) bold about their first edits. It doesn't encourage people to recklessly delete whole articles.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You and I can have an honest, respectful difference of opinion as to whether the cases of the Guantanamo detainees are "important". If so, we should have a civil dialogue about the issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In most of the {afd} discussions I have been drawn into I find I face an uphill battle. In most of those discussions, I am afraid, it seems a significant portion of the participants are not interested in reading the opinions of those who disagree with them, and have no intention to seek consensus. If they think those of their opinion outnumber those who hold a differeing opinion, they are perfectly happy to ignore any points the those of a contrary opinion offer. And, it seems, if they don't outnumber those of a differing opinion, they don't try to offer arguments to bolster their conception. They just withdraw and seek out another venue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for replying to my request. If we are going to have a dialogue on Al Fouzan, or on the articles related to Guantanamo detainees in general, should I wait for you to explain more fully why you don't think they are important? Should I wait for you to be specific about which details you regard as excessive?</dd>

<dd>For future reference, the question of whether to delete copyvio revisions from an article containing good and bad revisions is a tricky one. The instructions on the <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> page say to "Revert the page to a non-copyrighted version if you can: The infringing text will remain in the page history for archival reasons unless the copyright holder asks the Wikimedia Foundation to remove it." This is obviously a less-than-ideal solution, as it would be best if we removed unfree content altogether, but as a time saving measure and out of concern that deleting revisions can raise GFDL issues, the standard practice is that it's OK to leave such revisions in the history. That said, this case seems resolved satisfactorily, and it isn't a huge deal either way. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 18:34, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why in particular? I am familiar with the Tony Blair article (which is excellent)- if you mean to suggest that it in any way resembles the current state of affairs with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a>, then I would suggest you have another look. The Tony Blair split is (to my mind) a model example of how to go about these things. The main article has a more than adequate (8 paragraph, ~750 word) summary (in flowing, reasonably good prose, fairly well-referenced and NPOV- not a juvenile, stylistically drab and uninformative bullet-point list). The spun-off criticism page is also reasonably well put together. Most important of all, there was actually a <i>reason to do it</i>. Tony Blair, at 90+ kb, was genuinely a very large article, and stylistic changes are justified when a piece reaches that stage in order to maintain readability. Note that, despite the fact that this split took place a matter of days ago, both the original and the derivative article have retained excellent form and quality. I must stress that I am in no way against deconvolving articles, provided that a) it is done right, maintaining POV and readability, and leaving an adequate prose summary of the excised material (per WP guidelines) and b) there is actually an imperative to do it. At 34kb, there was no way that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> required such an extreme move. What we had was one mediocre article (where to my mind many problems were at their roots caused of the constant addition of <i>Controversy-of-the-week</i> style items when Prescott was on a sticky wicket a few weeks ago). The solution to a mediocre article is to rewrite it and make it better, not to split it into two even cr*pper ones. <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> is an object lesson in how to manage and properly maintain a growing article- <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Prescott_aa59.html" title="John Prescott">John Prescott</a> is an object lesson in how <i>not</i> to do the same. Your comparison is not really valid. There was no necessity for the split, there was no consensus for the split and, according to the AfD, there is a reasonably strong majority (if not a consensus) that the articles should be merged again.

<dd>I have not removed any articles. What I have done is merged the content of single sentence articles into their locality articles where they sit much better. This is recommended by <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> which says:
<ul>
<li>Initially, information on places of local importance should be added to an article on the community where that place is located.</li>
<li>This information should generally be written in sentence form, but where only basic information is available about a group of places in the same community, you might consider presenting this information in list or table format.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The guidelines go on to say:
<ul>
<li>As more verifiable information on local places is added to the community article, the article or individual sections will start to get overly large. Since large articles should be written in summary style, the longer sections should be broken out into articles such as "Education in community" "Transportation in community", etc. when this occurs.</li>
<li>As these articles get overly large as more verifiable information is added to each of these articles, information on individual places should be broken out into individual articles, beginning with places with the most verifiable information on them.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>This is the normal way in which articles are developed.</dd>
<dd>The AfD, that will certainly result in a 'Keep', simply addresses whether the content of the article should be in WP; it does not go to where the content should be located. That is for future editorial consideration. I would urge you to consider accepting that the locality article is the best place. Not only does this meet the Guidelines but it means that the attractions can be read in context. The alternative is a large number of small articles, relating to a locality, which is much more awkward for the reader to navigate. Finally, I should like to compliment you on the ND Project, which is helping to improve WP. I simply ask that you reconsider moving to an organic growth approach, rather than one that creates many stubs that, in truth, are likely to remain so. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 15:11, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I do not agree that North Dakota's golf courses are purely of local interest; indeed, articles on them are probably of more interest to tourists than to their local users. It is true that they could be longer, but at this time WPND is in a stub-making mode rather than an intensive article-development mode, and I would ask for your understanding.</dd>

<p>Hi there Blue Valour. Firstly I should point out I am a newbie to Wiki but, as I detect you've noticed, I am both genuinely literate and hold a deep fondness for my home town; I have also worked within style guidelines before, albeit not recently so I'm rusty, and am aware that they can be subject to interpretation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, now I've found your page I will add that I worked with style guides since I last played Bridge but, on trying to find a suitable partner since moving back here I've become rather too accustomed to a bipolarity of responses ranging from glazed stares to incredulity. I've not been successful. But if you know anyone who's looking to partner up on the bottom rung then maybe in time I might end up participating in one or other of the local clubs.</p>

<p>If you'll give me the benefit of the doubt on this, I had reason to clear my cookies in the early hours of this morning and, this being the first time I've logged into wikipedia since, I was surprised to find that you'd left 3 messages for me that wiki simply hadn't informed me of. I see the cookie clearance and wiki catching me up with what's been written on my talk page as directly linked and can understand if you translated this as rudeness on my part.</p>
<p>I simply wasn't aware you'd been trying to contact me.</p>
<p>I accept that as a newbie there are habits I must get into and will admit putting off giving the the style guide a thorough reading for longer than is reasonable, though I still don't know how to use wiki to find out who kept removing my list entries.</p>

<p>I note that the letter of the guide differs from the philosophy and trust you did observe I hadn't deleted any other contributors' entries, partly in recognition of my relative inexperience and partly because it's vandalism, and saw requesting verification, e.g., Wilf Lunn, as a polite way of raising the matter. I know the guidelines for such things say if somet's wrong then cut it, but they also imply that wanton cutting is vandalism, so I erred on the side of caution.</p>
<p>I know Richard Lunn's done well in television but I don't recall Wilf's lad being called Richard. Again, I requested verification of the relationship from the original contributor by way of a needs verification tag and added to the list of productions Richard Lunn has worked on. However, Wilf having strong ties with the HD postal and STD code area, both his children were educated here so far as I understand it.</p>
<p>I am happy to nip down to Queen St South to get the edition number and date of the Examiner in which the relevant chapter appeared abridged. It was about 15 months ago. I can see him turning into a Patrick Stewart.</p>

<p>I have to state now that I consider Lead Violin in the Hong Kong Phil as equivalent to captaining a premiership side--which is somet' Andy Booth's never done! It is the instrument to which the rest of the orchestra tune, which given the temperaments on intonation that can come into play in stringed instruments is some responsibility, and they are a professional orchestra on the world stage. I feel confident that if she'd made this position in the Halle or the LSO you'd not have quibbled it. So why is the Hong Kong Phil not good enough.</p>
<p>I'm aware Jeremy Perkins played in the pits for West End shows such as Cats (again by way of the Examiner) but wouldn't dream of adding his name as this is akin to making Town's second team squad.</p>

<p>And although it's BriSCA it is BriSCA Formula One which, so far as I'm aware, interfaces with the FIA in terms of regulations and suchlike. Similarly, wiki has a worldwide audience and Stock Car racing is popular in the Netherlands, where Kev went on to race after winning the World Championship several seasons concurrently and also in New Zealand, where a recent Examiner article reported he is emigrating to...</p>

<p>Jamie Whitham also made the Motorcyle News week in week out as well as the various sports channels, and his cross-Pennine rivalry with Carl Fogarty was reminiscent of that when Nigel Mansell's winnng streak overlapped with the young Michael Shumacher's early entrie onto the podium in the share of the commentary minutes they got in the '90s, before he had to retire from racing to battle cancer.</p>
<p>Again, he has a worldwide media profile and is possibly a bigger figure in the international consciouness than, much as I admire him, Wilf Lunn ever will be. And although I'm not up to date on how his team's doing, he does own the team as far as I'm aware and they are still competing in one or other of the Superbike classes--i.e. regularly televised sport which, again, is a bit more than anyone can claim for Andy Booth.</p>
<p>Perhaps you consider these aren't sufficient achievements to warrant a wiki entry at this point</p>

<p>I met her in and around the town a number of times prior to her securing the Time Team gig, which again made an article covering most of a page, with photo's, in the Examiner at the time. Spring 2003 I think it was. As the show is popular and wiki is in effect a vital front end for recruiting diligent and motivated students to the town I think she's worth a mention, although I am unclear as to whether she was back here as a native terrier or simply got one or other of her degrees at the Uni'.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be a chore if we had to include able people as well!?!?!?! Now, back to being serious again, have we got William (Willie) Watson on? What about the guy who played in the 66 cup squad and ran the funeral parlour at Outlane? I've been told it was Frank Worthington but I know it wasn't, although isn't he from here originally too? Ball sports aren't my strong suit you understand, but what level did Howard Willerton end up playing cricket for Yorkshire at? I thought it was county level and, again, I know he was born here.</p>
<p>I'm unclear as to whether violinist Billy Currie joined Ultravox after studying in Scotland or whether he simply studied here coming originally from Hibernian climes, but he has a Huddersfield connection too.</p>
<p>I've added an entry on Richard Oastler to the Fixby stub as he ran the Estate there whilst pushing the Short Time (Poor) Laws through. Do you think he's worth mentioning explicityl on the town's page as it was an estate away from the town at that time?</p>
<p>And I seem to recall that Daniel Defoe wrote a graphic account of the Pennine climate following the Pack Horse trail and staying in Huddersfield, although I may be entirely wrong and it's Halifax or Bradford he wrote about. Whichever way I am keen to work historical figures with genuine associations in.</p>
<p>Do you think it worth starting a stub about the Ramsden family? Or including an account of the Heraldic Crest?</p>

<p>I really, really don't appricate you having that particular article that I started nominated for deletion. You said that we already have a catagory for that called <b>Motorsport announcers</b>. Well let me tell you something, that is too vague of a category to simply skim over the selected few who had the chance to call NASCAR's biggest race. Motorsport announcers can't be narrowed to purely NASCAR since we have the Indy Car series, drag racing, Formula 1, and many many others. And simply listing the announcers by each race is not as easy as it sounds to you because it's a step-by-step process rather than simply being right in front of you. <a href="../../../t/m/c/User%7ETMC1982_1023.html" title="User:TMC1982">TMC1982</a> 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Twice you have changed my arrangement of the image to what is, to my discerning eye, a much inferior setup. Before I am forced to improve it once again; could you please refer me to the section of the STYLE GUIDELINES that suggests your visually ugly mess is better than my aesthetically pleasing layout?</p>

<dd>As I explained in my edit summary, the layout has to look right in all screen modes. There is simply too little text for your layout to work in 800x600 - you probably have been viewing on a flat-screen monitor. In 800x600 there is a thin column of text that meets your delicate and tactful description of a "visually ugly mess". I have now restructured the layout in a way that looks fine in all modes and I hope will meet approval with your "discerning eye". p.s. the picture and map can be swapped L-R if you prefer. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 18:19, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Blue, that is indeed much better then your previous arrangement. Even on my old CRT screen. I think best to leave it as it is - all the maps in this category are on the right. (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 20:28, 21 October 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Game summary This article has already had one problem with a game summary being adapted from a website. The present game summary is so detailed that I wonder where it came from. Does anyone know its origins? Is there any assurance that an editor can give that it does not breach a copyright, please? BlueValour 23:31, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wrote the game summary myself because I have a tape of that game and I had to make this page for class. I found this article was a stub and that is one of my favorite games ever so I watched the game as I wrote the game summary on the page. Adk4786 14:37, 24 October 2006 (UTC)Adk4786</p>
<p>Games statistics/Scoring summary I have removed these as possible Copyvio from <a href="http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/010303aaa.html" class="external free" title="http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/010303aaa.html" rel="nofollow">http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/010303aaa.html</a> . They should not be replaced. BlueValour 22:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>They were copied from that site but I didn't think it would be a big deal for a couple of reasons. They are actual fact because I could have gone anywhere to get the information and make the table myself and the scoring summery but I found it on there. Also, I figured that if that article was already sited at the bottom of the page then it wouldn't be that big of a deal. I want to thank you for doing so much work on this article but I would really appreciate it if we could put those back on the page by citing the table and scoring summary inside the page after each of those two sections. I am also trying to put images on this page if you could help me out with that in any way. Adk4786 14:37, 24 October 2006 (UTC)Adk4786</p>
<p>Alright Blue, You and I are having some differences at the moment but I only put the table and game summary back in for a moment so that I could print it out with the images for my teacher. My intentions were to stick with the compromise that you made and I apologize for not taking them out after I printed the article as I planned. If you can I would appreciate it if you went back to the compromise and kept the images and the rest of the article.

<dd>The key point is that you are trying to insert unsourced material. Saying <i>Look at a map</i> is not a source. Find a source that says that Ormskirk is on a hill, ridge or whatever and that's fine. On a different issue, GallowGlass does a great deal of valuable work around here and has built up a reputation as a responsible editor. My suggestion is that you concentrate, in this early stage of your Wikipedia career, on making sourced additions to articles (or start a new article on something that interests you) rather than engaging in pointless edit warring. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 16:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi there. I hope you're not annoyed by me moving the section on Fresher's flu. But since we laready have a discussion of how colds are not flu and this is a slang term for a event in a small minority of the world's population, I didn't think it deserved more exposure than the 1918 pandemic, which did not get a section to itself!

<p>Please may I enquire the +prod on my new article. The source and information is from mame. As you can see from all my other articles, I am going alphabetically through mame to add any missing arcade games.

<dl>
<dd>With regard to the sourcing that is a matter of setting up the reference. The other issue, though, is whether the game is notable enough to be worth its place. The fact that it was issued is not, in itself, enough. It needs to have been an outstanding game of its type, innovated or been newsworthy for another reason. Again, a reference is needed for its notability. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:33, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought wikipedia is factual; who am I to decide whether a game was outstanding or innovative, that is a matter of opinion. Also, what about Jimmy Wales' mission - 'the sum of all knowledge of mankind' - now there is something being left out because someone thought it was not outstanding enough. Also, I am doing a lot of hard work and spending a lot of time on this; now if some of my articles are going to be cut off then it's not worth it for me to try and have an arcade game complete listing; <i>thereafter beefing up each article</i>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandman30s_9826.html" title="User:Sandman30s">Sandman30s</a> 13:53, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A better link: go to Category:Arcade Games and clear out all non-notable games. Heck, why stop there at arcade games? Go all the way to all video games I can't point you to the policy that says that all games are notable. It doesn't exist, obviously. But if you want to go through, and I'm not exagerating, 10,000+ video game articles to impose your opinion on which games are notable, go for it. At this point, all we got is comprehensiveness in dealing with the subject matter as a policy to follow. Whether or not the article needs to have a lot more information is not up for debate. I disagree with how it was made. But you can't decide that it's not worthy of an article unless you're going to be consistant across all video game articles, and that's not really possible at this point without a ridiculously immense amount of effort. --<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> 06:38, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My original criterion for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_addresses.html" title="List of famous addresses">List of famous addresses</a> was that the address had to be recognizable on its own.

It has no dedicated article upon itself but the address indeed exists as a redirect and the address is mentioned in the intro of the article.</p>
<p>I know One Police Plaza is NYPD headquarters; I've seen it referenced by the address and not just on Law &amp; Order.

<p>Hi! I've done a small copy edit to reduce the 'Cultural Events' section and make it more NPOV, also a content reduction to the sports section on Rugby and motorsports. Could you apply your sports knowledge to make sure I haven't messed up the rugby. Though I understand another user is looking to give it a good going over.

<p>You added <i>It is important to note that no historical account of the resurrection exists outside of religious texts.</i> to the article and it was reverted. I am not the one who reverted you, and I think editors should be a little more kind and explain themselves when reverting others. So I am here to give you a few pointers. All new content, when added to wikipedia, should be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and the best way to do this is to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Also, instead of saying "it is important to note" you should say why it is important, or at least why certain scholars think it is important (if there are any scholars that say that). By doing this, you make your addition verifiable and neutral, and it will be harder for other editors to simply erase your contributions. Hope this helps. If you have question, feel free to ask me personally, or discuss this further on the article talk page.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 01:46, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because you need to wait while someone types an answer :-) The image size is determined so that the page looks professional in all screen modes including 800x600.

<p>Hi BlueValour! I just noted the rather nice Hudds FC brochure image and thought it worth giving you a 'heads up message'. There are a few editors at the moment who are cracking down on what may be classed an unfree or copyvio images. Could you please enlarge the source info you put on your uploaded image, IE: if you actually created it, or from where it was scourced and if permission for use is freely given. It will save having it tagged for possible deletion. Its too good an image to lose!

<p>Hi BlueValour! You seem to have a better grasp than I about local journalists. Could you take a look at this new article Joseph dennison which I assume was created to link to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighouse.html" title="Brighouse">Brighouse</a> page, which has an incorrect link to it due to the lack of a capital letter on the surname of the article page. Is the person sufficiently notable for an article page? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Harvey_bc06.html" title="User:Richard Harvey">Richard Harvey</a> 12:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you know, I am always looking to save local articles of merit. However, I see no merit in this - unsourced, no relevant Google hits and no real notability. I would support you to AfD this one. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 00:19, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Rather than go through the lengthy process of an AfD I have tagged it for a speedy delete, with a modified {{db-bio}} tag, under the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Living person Biograpy guidlines</a>. which will get rid of it sooner. I have also e-mailed the Brighouse Echo's Editor, with the link to the article, asking for confirmation of the persons existence, just to be sure. Additionally I have also removed the incorrect link from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brighouse.html" title="Brighouse">Brighouse</a> article. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Harvey_bc06.html" title="User:Richard Harvey">Richard Harvey</a> 09:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! First allow me to thank you for the large amount of work that you seem to do in updating the records of the English Football League. It is people such as yourself rather than dabblers like me that keep the flame burning. I would request your help, however, in correcting a problem that has arisen with the football clubs of my home town, Bournemouth. The current records of a lot of the league seasons (and I would presume, other references) link back to the club called <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth_F.C._e5e8.html" title="Bournemouth F.C.">Bournemouth F.C.</a> However, this is an amateur club based at Victoria Park; they have never been a league club. As you can verify in Wiki and other sources the links for Bournemouth's professional club should go to <a href="../../../a/2E/f/A.F.C._Bournemouth_7f7c.html" title="A.F.C. Bournemouth">A.F.C. Bournemouth</a>, the club based at the Fitness First Stadium. The records will need to be changed and I would ask you to help in ensuring that the right club is referenced in future changes to the records. Thank You! <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritmax_f927.html" title="User:Britmax">Britmax</a> 00:05, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for those sentiments. I have changed the main redirects and league records but there is still some chasing down to be done that I shall leave with you. It is helpful yo know of the problem and I shall bear it in mind. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to let you know that I think I have now tracked down and edited all the links that point to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth_F.C._e5e8.html" title="Bournemouth F.C.">Bournemouth F.C.</a> rather than <a href="../../../a/2E/f/A.F.C._Bournemouth_7f7c.html" title="A.F.C. Bournemouth">A.F.C. Bournemouth</a>. The problem comes when using the {{subst:fc|Bournemouth}} template which will automatically point to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth_F.C._e5e8.html" title="Bournemouth F.C.">Bournemouth F.C.</a>; using {{subst:afc|Bournemouth}} gets round the problem, albeit via a re-direct. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaemonic_Kangaroo_c251.html" title="User:Daemonic Kangaroo">Daemonic Kangaroo</a> 05:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hello, I keep receiving a message from you when I look on Wikipedia. You say I changed one of your pages, Anfield I think.

<p>Hello. Is it your intention to dispute <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Richman_6b6e.html" title="Chaim Richman">Chaim Richman</a>'s membership in the present "<a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_attempts_to_revive_the_Sanhedrin_5f9f.html" title="Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin">modern attempt to revive the Sanhedrin</a>? We normally accept statements from organizations we have articles on that a particular individual is a member. If you dispute the notability of the organization, perhaps you should propose an AfD for the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_attempts_to_revive_the_Sanhedrin_5f9f.html" title="Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin">Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin</a> article. Given that there's an article on the organization, membership would seem to be a relevant fact. Given that you appear to have been a long-term contributor to Wikipedia, I assume your recent deletion of the reference in a "no change" reorganization was purely inadvertent. I of course express no personal opinion on the activities of either the individual or the organization. I'd appreciate it if you'd respond on my talk page.

<p>Hi. I'm a new user so I'm not quite sure if I'm doing this right. Can I just ask why you deleted my update on supporters of Huddersfield Town Football Club? You said it was classed as vandalism and I'd just like you to explain to me why that is. Original Hell Child</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi; Vandalism is a harsh sounding word but in general parlance means an unhelpful edit. If you want Lukas Wooller to go down as a Town supporter then it needs to be sourced. What someone says he said on a radio programme is not encyclopaedic because it cannot be verified i.e. checked out. If you want to add him then you need to find a reliable and reputable source, preferably on the Internet, that indicates his support.
