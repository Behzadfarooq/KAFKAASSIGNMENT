<p>Hi Bluestripe,</p>
<p>I am experienced editor who can adopt you if you like - can help out with either technical or procedural issues. Leave a message on my talk page if you are interested.

<p>Hi there Bluestripe,</p>
<p>Adoption confirmed, so straight on with your questions (generally if you could ask questions on my user talk page that would be cool, I will reply on this page)...</p>
<p>Initial reactions - new users often find it difficult getting started with Wikipedia (I certainly did), and long term users eye new users with some suspicion as a lot of vandalism is caused by such users, though they will normally <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> wherever possible.</p>
<p>In many respects Wikipedia is anti-elitist with outside "experts" being treated as everyone else, when they may expect differently. With respect to the technical and procedural aspects of Wikipedia, experienced users will often make decisions that seem to be a bit harsh, but they should always explain what they have done and why they have done it to you, as well as how to take the issue elsewhere if you think what they have done is inappropriate. Normally a civil conversation on the user's talk page can clear everything up pretty quick.</p>
<p>All the comments left by other users on your talk page seem appropraite, so you will have to show me where people have been attacking you and calling you an <i>astrosurfer</i>, what ever that may mean. One of the comments that has been made on this talk page, is about editing articles that you are directly involved in. If this is so, you should read up about <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflicts of interest</a> in Wikipedia and how we manage it. Often the easiest thing to do in these cases, is if you want to change/add content of a article you may have a conflict of interest in, better to explain what edits you would like to be seen on the talk page.</p>
<p>I hope that answers some of your initial questions. If you want me to have a look at why <i>X</i> said <i>Y</i>, then point me in the right direction and I will do so. Look forward to hearing from you Cheers <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethaniol_eabe.html" title="User talk:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 13:48, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe this is one of the articles you are involved in. The discussion here seems quite frank but friendly. The issues they have raised are with concern that this page might be an Autobiography - suggest reading up <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> which explains the problems and solutions to this. Also the main reason for the deletion discussion is that the subject may not be notable (with respect to Wikipedia). Suggest that you need to find some references that show that this person is important and present it to the discussion (read up here - <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)for</a> the type of info you need).</p>
<p>Also you need to explain to the discussion why you think the article should be kept, i.e. why it is important/notable. Your input would be very welcome. Cheers <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethaniol_eabe.html" title="User talk:Lethaniol">Lethaniol</a> 13:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Concerning the users Hansonc and LastChanceToBe, yes this is a little bit defensive. <s>They</s> <i>Hansonc</i> thinks that you have been adding inappropriate material, and seem to want to work together <i>with LastChancetobe</i> on this matter. It is not the most civil of things, but then your articles have not been deleted out of hand using something fast like <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, but have allowed much more discussion with <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, where the discourse has been fair. So I would not worry about it, maybe even explain to both of these users where you are coming from - so that they understand your contributions better. Also take up any opportunities to discuss and explain and defend your articles.</p>

<dd>Hi there. I noticed this communication via the "what links here" page for my user page. There is no gang mentality going on here. I never heard of Hansonc before he/she left a message on my talk page, and please note that I took no actions as a result of Hansonc's message. Suggesting that there is collusion is failing to assume good faith on Bluestripe's part. And, even if we had decided to work together, working together is the entire purpose of Wikipedia. I have left a copy of this message on Lethianol's talk page, which is what links to my user page. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELastChanceToBe_b802.html" title="User:LastChanceToBe">LastChanceToBe</a> 03:56, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your comments LastChanceToBe, I should have checked further to see if you had taken any actions, which you have said you have not. My comments above are to do with Hansonc alone then (I have corrected for future reference), but as I was trying to explain to BlueStripe above, nothing has been done that has been unfair in this case, and that BlueStripe should not worry about these comments, and instead concentrate on taking any opportunities to discuss these issues.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree good faith should be assumed but from some perspectives the fact that two users may be collaborating to prevent good faith edits (whether they are notable or not) may be seen as slightly uncivil. In this case I can not see any ganging up, and the fact that the discussions have been taken to AFD and CSD is a good sign. Again thankyou for your comments LastChanceToBe.</dd>

<dd>I suggest BlueStripe you read up the policy <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, as we should all to remind ourselves from time to time. The vast majority of editors on Wikipedia all want the same thing - the best encyclopaedia possible, and it is best to think that people are doing their best even if they say something that may seem inappropriate. Do not worry about this case, and do not let it put you off editing Wikipedia. 13:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bluestripe, I have just voted on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Scott_R._MacIver_5791.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Scott R. MacIver">the deletion for the Scott R. MacIver article</a>. The article is well-written, but in my mind he's not notable yet. I want to commend you for your writing abilities and want to encourage you not to get down if this article does get deleted.

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Two things. First, I would feel more comfortable if you maintained a user page. The idea of the red link to nowhere is disconcerting. Second, it is the Natural History of South Asia that is encyclopedic; not the mailing list addressing same. The mailing list might be included in a broader article that deals with the Natural History of South Asia. So, I posted this "comment" on your user page to create that destination. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluestripe_e40e.html" title="User:Bluestripe">Bluestripe</a> 22:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Like you suggested, I wrote a few lines on my user page, instead of leaving it blank or as a redlink, when you get time can you kindly help me Archive my talk page, please do it anytime you get time. Thanks. As for the mailing list I firmly think it is a pioneering example from the region and is hugely notable and hence Encyclopedic&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/t/u/User%7EAtulsnischal_985f.html" title="User:Atulsnischal">Atulsnischal</a> 23:12, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah an easy question good. The + numbers (in green) and the - numbers (in red), indicate the number of bytes of info (I think that is the right technical term) that is either added or removed during that edit. Therefore a minor edit will normally will below 100 either way, above 1000+ is a big addition (pretty normal, especially on talk pages), and generally -1000 is a big loss of content (often vandalism or archiving).

<li>Hi, you changed the license tag to fair use and removed the no source template. However you still have not provided any <b>source</b> information (who created the image or hold the copyright to it). So I have re-added the no source tag. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 00:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I hope that is the right way to source it. The photo is one taken by staff of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deloitte.html" title="Deloitte">Deloitte</a>. It is meant to be used in the public domain. And there is no individual associated with the image; just the firm: Deloitte.
<ul>
<li>Well the source should be visible on the page, not commented out. I fleshed it out a bit based on what you said here. Also please note that in the context of copyright <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> pretty much means "no copyright", not that's it's released to the public, a rater significant difference. Since the image is now used under a fair use claim there is a couple of additional things that need to be taken care of though (never ends does it&#160;;)&#160;?). Please see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>. Notably you need to add a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">fair use rationale</a> for the use of the image on that article. Also note that one of the criteria to include non-free licensed images in Wikipedia is that a free licensed work that provide the same information can not be created. That generaly means that photos of people who are still alive rarely qualify (unless they show a historicaly significant situation) since it would still be possible to create or obtain a free licensed photo of them. I'll cut you some slack and not list it for deletion a 3. time right now, but it probably will become an issue one of these days. You may want to consider <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYREQ_7bbc.html" title="WP:COPYREQ">contacting Deloitte and asking them to release this photo under a free license</a>. If they agree things will become a lot less complicated, and the image can be moved to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a> where it can be used by other Wikimedia projects (Wikipedia in other languages for example) and others who do not permit "fair use" material.
