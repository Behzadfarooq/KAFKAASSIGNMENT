<dd>To sum up, if anything should be at <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_7488.html" title="Blue Monday">Blue Monday</a> other than a disambiguation page, it should probably be the Fats Domino song. My personal opinion is that it should be a disambiguation page, or a page that covers what I've quickly put together above and more. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 13:10, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've already gone through this with someone else. The New Order version of Blue Monday has been covered or sampled by <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kylie_Minogue_fac0.html" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/g/Orgy_%28band%29.html" title="Orgy (band)">Orgy (band)</a>, and others; its the biggest selling 12" vinyl of all time, and most importantly for the Wikipedia; it has an article. A disambiguation page full of red links is completely and utterly useless. There is no article for the Fats Domino track, or an album that it was on; or even a mention of it on his page. Theres no reference to the economic theory anywhere; or the graphic novel. This is the only article that uses the term at the moment, or for the forseeable future. Its also arguably the most notable that will ever use it - Fats Domino is unknown outside of a much older age group than the current and future internet users, and the song sold less in the first place, and cannot be argued as being influential - however, look around for how many bands cite New Order or this song in particular - <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underworld_%28band%29.html" title="Underworld (band)">Underworld (band)</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_%28band%29.html" title="Orbital (band)">Orbital (band)</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Killers_%28band%29_bab4.html" title="The Killers (band)">The Killers</a>, etc. These are far more important to current music than a song with no article or no mention anywhere in the entire Wikipedia.</dd>

The "Blue Monday" song is mentioned in paragraph three. Note: One reason the song doesn't "score" as high on Goggle is that you would have to do a search for each of the dozens of recording artists who have recorded the song to find all of the mentions of the song. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 16:15, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I'll admit I missed that. However, Orgy have released a direct cover of this song, Kylie Minogue has sampled it, etc.</dd>
<dd>The Orgy version alone has more hits than the Domino track, or the Gershwin opera, or the graphic novel. The Kylie Minogue live sampling gets more than Gershwin and close to the Domino figure</dd>
<dd>What is more notable here is extremely clear. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 16:27, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>George Gershwin's "Blue Monday" has an historical importance because it was the precursor to his <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porgy_and_Bess_8d07.html" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>. The fact that it doesn't get that many Google hits makes absolutely no difference because, of course, the internet is going to be heavily skewed towards more modern music. There are plenty of 21st century one-hit wonders that will get more hits than the Gershwin piece, but in the end, they will just be ephemera, but the importance of the Gershwin <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operetta.html" title="Operetta">operetta</a> will remain. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 17:26, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And New Order's Blue Monday was basically the first European <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_music.html" title="Dance music">dance music</a> track. In terms of the music of the past 25 years, it carries far more weight than an operetta. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 17:40, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And the arguments for other songs, books, whatever are pretty much nullified by the fact that they have no articles. If they're that important and worthy of being full links of a full disambiguation page, why has nobody covereved them in the, what, 1.1 million pages we have ranging from stubs up? --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 17:43, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>google.ie for <b>Blue Monday kylie minogue</b> - 89,000 hits - this is a live-performance sampling of the track</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel this establishes something:</p>
<ol>
<li>New Orders Blue Monday is the most common usage for the term</li>
<li>The economic theory is the next (but hasn't got an article)</li>
<li>The graphic novel series would be next (and hasn't got an article)</li>
<li>THEN the Fats Domino track comes in (no article either)</li>
<li>Then the Gershwin opera (and no article)</li>
</ol>
<p>IF, and only if, 3 of the other 4 eventually have articles, should they have a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28disambiguation%29_d172.html" title="Blue Monday (disambiguation)">Blue Monday (disambiguation)</a> page, linked to from the top of the New Order track. If only one or two of them get pages, they should be dab-headered in. There is an obvious, and huge notability difference here.</p>

<p>I'm the "someone else" to whom Kiand referred above. And I certainly see even <b>more</b> reason to oppose his proposed move. I had heard of Fats Domino's song, but not New Order's OR several others mentioned here. Kiand seems to have gotten into a crusade here; he can't seem to understand that there are lots of people who aren't into his genre of music and couldn't care less about New Order's "Blue Monday." I definitely vote to have "Blue Monday" be a disambiguation page; all the others can be linked to from there. -- <a href="../../../b/r/g/User%7EBRG_b05e.html" title="User:BRG">BRG</a> 13:52, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm into more than one genre of music. This is about notability. The other songs, etc, aren't notable. Theres a good chance a 1-liner stub on the Fats Domino track wouldn't even survive VFD for that purpose. Theres FAR more people who couldn't care less about a 50 something year old RnB track - so many, in fact, that nobody has ever written an article on it. Implies theres around 600,000 things that people do care more about.

<li><s><b>Support</b> move unless/until there are actual other articles for multiple other uses. I could swear it's written somewhere more explicitly than I can find at the moment, but in general, doing any disambiguating before it's <i>necessary</i> is discouraged. There's no real point to moving [[Foo]] to [[Foo (specific)]] if [[Foo]] is going to be left as the resulting redirect to [[Foo (specific)]] (the only exception I know of is if another naming convention comes into play, such as [[Seattle]] being a redir to [[Seattle, Washington]]. Since the New Order/Orgy song is the only usage that currently has an article, no disambiguation is necessary. Since the New Order song has substantially more common usage, an article on the Fats Domino song can be name <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28Fats_Domino_song%29_1d3a.html" title="Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)">Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)</a> (or whatever) with a header disambig from the first one. Most of the other books, etc. mentioned above have more to their title than just "Blue Monday"; if they get articles some day, they should be at their full title, referenced from <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28disambiguation%29_d172.html" title="Blue Monday (disambiguation)">Blue Monday (disambiguation)</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 15:02, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</s></li>

<dd>The only reason that "Blue Monday" was left as a redirect was that, before I got around to changing it to a disambiguation page, Kiand got into this argument, and I've been spending all my computer access time arguing with him.

<dd>Google is a good indicator, and you can't really deny (regardless of what you think of the song or the group) that New Order's song "Blue Monday" played a bigger role in the evolution of music and is culturally more significant. It was the biggest selling 12" ever by the way, if that and Google don't satisfy you as to its popularity, I'm not sure what will. Significantly more people will be searching "Blue Monday" for the New Order song than the Gershwin opera or the Fats Domino song. Plus, please note that this has the same implications for the other pages that a disambiguation page does - it's not like the links are hidden down the bottom of the article in a minute text size - they're the first words you read .--<a href="../../../h/n/_/User%7EHn_fc77.html" title="User:Hn">Hn</a> 08:46, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Oppose</b>--keep new disambig page at <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_7488.html" title="Blue Monday">Blue Monday</a>. Some of the other articles now exist. Also, since <i>"blue monday"</i> gets 450k hits, but <i>"blue monday" -"new order" -kylie -orgy</i> still gets almost 200k hits, that suggests at least 1/3 are for other uses than the New Order song, which seems to indicate it doesn't deserve primary disambiguation. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 12:42, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>--I think there are enough versions of the term to merit it being a disambig.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - The argument that there aren't enough articles for other uses of "Blue Monday" has been pretty well trashed, because there are several now. At this point there <i>needs</i> to be a disambiguation page. I've been a fan of the Manchester band since shortly after Ian checked out and have the 45s to prove it, but I think the other uses are signficant enough to recommend against the assumption that their "Blue Monday" is the one people are <i>"really"</i> interested in. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 22:38, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've added information for all three releases to the infobox. It seems to hold up, albeit the result is quite cluttered. The 1988 release might be significant enough to warrant a separate infobox under the current one... although then there would be no good place for the 1995 release (which would be no great loss, IMO).

<dd><i><b>Peter Hook (bassist, New Order)</b>: Bernard [Sumner] and Stephen [Morris] were the instigators. It was their enthusiasm for new technology. The drum pattern was ripped off from a Donna Summer B-side. We'd finished the drum pattern and we were really happy, then Steve accidentally kicked out the drum machine lead so we had to start from scratch and it was never as good. The technology was forever breaking down and the studio was really archaic. Kraftwerk booked it after us because they wanted to emulate Blue Monday. They gave up after four or five days. It was a collection of soundbites - it sort of grew and grew. When we got to the end I went in and jammed the bass; I stole a riff from Ennio Morricone. Bernard went in and jammed the vocals. They're not about Ian Curtis; we wanted it to be vague. I was reading about Fats Domino. He had a song called Blue Monday and it was a Monday and we were all miserable so I thought, "Oh that's quite apt."</i></dd>
