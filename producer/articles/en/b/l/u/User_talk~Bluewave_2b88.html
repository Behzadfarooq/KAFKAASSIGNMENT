<p>Yeah - it needs a lot of work - I think the important thing is to get the information there first in chronological order. I think the King's reign heading is a little clumsy, but it's an easy way of ordering. St G's chapel may well need a subsection of it's own, as I suppose too should the state apartments. Thanks for the copy edit I can never see my own mistakes however hard I look. Glad you think that ugly and dull list should go too, I had made up my mind to shunt it off to a separate list page on its own. Where it should have been in the first place. I just thought I would wait and see who was watching me;-)! Life in the castle is not much better - do you think it need to be there at all. I think I'll just leave it for the time being perhaps what is there will eventually be able to be absorbed elsewhere. It's going to be quite long eventually as the George IV section will have to be quite lengthy. Please add anything you like, I don't want it to look like I am taking it over. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 15:48, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I expect I will offend someone starting here <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constables_and_Governors_of_Windsor_Castle_cc52.html" title="Constables and Governors of Windsor Castle">Constables and Governors of Windsor Castle</a>. Oh well be bold as they say here! I think I'll probably change the list of monarchs to something like Tudor Period and Plantaganet Period something like that and lump them in together, I just want to get thing sorted into some sort of timescale first. That's if no one reverts me first!!! <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 16:19, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes I like your plan - have you seen what I've done to the older one? Could you make the numbering on yours larger - say to the size of the plan I've uploaded now, then we could just insert yours in place of the older one. I just want to get up to finsh off the Wyatville stuff, and through the Victorian restorations and then leave it there for today, and tackle medieval stuff later. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 13:47, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No I think I'll prefer yours, its brighter and clearer. I'll stop editing and you can set it up etc. I'll leave the inuse there to stop anyone conflicting you. I won't edit agian after I sign this untill you remove the inuse OK. I've made several references to the letters on mine in the article, if yours are different they may need to be changed. I didn't maryk the towers etc because that old plan was to vague, a good idea on yours though - over to you - it's all yours untill I hear. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 14:07, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's much better isn't it? Brighter and cleaner altogether more concise. I wonder who uploaded the old one - hope there won't be any offense - it's not really needed now. There's a bit more to add yet about Quuen Victoria and Salvin, and his restorations, and there is quite a bit of repetition. This is the trouble with adapting an old article, often easier to start from new. There is oads more information to upoad on the earlier stuff, that's why I left the King's headings like that, but have removed tham as I'm writing properly, if you see what I mean. At least if its chronological order if someone dumps a great whad of information on the page as people often do it's easier to slot it in somewhere and keep the page readable. I don't think Charles I's portrait is quite right there either, I just put it there to try it out. What do you think about the rooms, there are so many - do you think it's just easier to mention the principal ones as they crop up in the history. There are so many of them, and if they have to have a description of the paintings and the furniture it will be a book not an article. I think we have to keep Charles I somewhere and slot in a few paintings from the collection too that are already out of copyright and availabel to give a flavout of the interior and keep the page looking interesting and atractive. I read <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palazzo_Pitti_3d78.html" title="Palazzo Pitti">Palazzo Pitti</a> the other day and quite like the layout and style there - take a look. Well done on the plan it's great. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 15:36, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Very poetic indeed. I would not put it in the page if you want it to make a Featured article. I've been watching carefully what goes on over there when it's something like finished we have to insert hundreds of footnotes to almost every fact. Although this is all very straight forward we should not need too many, just for quotes and things. Have you done a FAC before? It seems we can't say its beautiful or indeed anything complimentary, not too much about the Royal family, not even that a room is majestic or splendid. If you check out the two featured article attempts they took to get <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> through you'll see what I mean. I'm not sure I agree with it all, but it's easier to play by the rules I suppose. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 16:27, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Did you see I have created [Category: Windsor castle]] its surprising how much there is on the subject and its tangents. I wondered how toy felt about syphoning off the Security section, where it could be handled in far more depth than on the page itself. It should also include things like the defence and security, beginning with the siege of 1215 etc. I'm sure there must have been hundreds of incidents over the centuries concerned with this sort of thing. There is still a hell of a lot to go in about the castle proper, I know page length does not matter, but we want to hold interest to the end. If you look at what is in the Cat Windsor Castle there is probably quite a lot more that could be placed elsewhere. St. George's Chapel is though is a poor page which could be expanded considerably. What do you think? I think security looks incongruous where it is, especially as it could be so enlarged. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 12:52, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, I was covering myself with "one of" if you have the Guinness book of records can you re-insert "largest" with a footnote to the GB o R. Yes I see the page is being copyedited and added to, it's funny how the second there is large movement on a page, it draws others in, that is what is so good about Wikipedia. If someone dumps on the page now at least we can see where to put it, albeit on another page!</dd>

<dd>From what you say there is a lot more to add, I wouldn't be surprised about The Queen Mother story - it's amazing what seeps out especially to the locals. Sadly we cannot have a page Rumour and innuendo of Windsor Castle - or could we? You haven't committed yourself to your view on moving security to another page. from what you say there is a lot you could add, especially closing so much of the castle in the name of security, that is easier enough to prove, I have bought and early 20th century guide book which announces the tower is open - so that is easy enough.</dd>

We'll just have to write this page and then have a good look at it, but I don't want to leave important information out, just because of space and POV interpretation, and FAC regulations. <a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 18:05, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the message. The day job is a little pressing at the moment so not much time. The problem is going to be deciding what is directly concerned with the castle, and what can be shunted off. I think it would be a good idea to have seiges and battles on a security page, we could call it something alittle more exoting which embraces all aspects of defence over the centuries, Venn's cunning plan sounds interesting wonder what it was. Hope to have some time later this week.<a href="../../../a/s/p/User%7EAspern_7990.html" title="User:Aspern">Aspern</a> 17:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice work on the article. I teetered between a B and an A but leaned toward A based on the sheer number of refs. My personal preference is for book refs over web refs and the article certainly has an abundance of those. To really push the article to the next level(GA review) I suggest you review <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITET_7f44.html" title="WP:CITET">WP:CITET</a>. The article refs are formatted for quick footnotes....but really should use the {citebook} and {citeweb} format. Again, great work so far and good luck with the "next step". I haven't listened to Pentangle for over 30 years?? But after reading that I am going to dig some old vinyl out of storage when I get home and refresh my memory. Is there an online "24 hour Bert radio broadcast"??? If there is I'll will make my enitre staff listen to it&#160;:) .

<p>I noticed Wisekwai put the GA nom on hold pending some of his issues. I wanted to give you a brief background on one of his comments. The WikiProject Guitarist concensus opinion regarding the {infobox musical artist} is negative. The main issue being the use of colours which are meaningless to the casual Wikpedia reader(not to mention very unattractive) That being said,the guitarist project does not object to the musician box completely and it has been used for some notable guitarists who fell into the "multi-instrumentalist" role.(example Mike Oldfield) Another article that comes to mind is the Buddy Holly page. The image of Holly holding a Fender Stratocaster is almost iconic in Rock n roll music history. But, Holly will probably be remembered most as a songwriter more than for his guitar skills so the musician infobox is used. As the "prime editor" on the article it is really up to you to use whichever infobox you feel conveys the best information about the artist. But you had asked for a guitarist project class review so I wanted to provide some history of how the project feels about the "rainbow box". The Jansch page has come such a long ways from when I first viewed it. I really wish you all the best in your efforts to get the article the GA status it is so close to achieving.

<dd>If you haven't listened to him, I would try some of the early stuff: 1960s or early 70s. At that time there was no-one who could touch him for acoustic playing (IMHO). The <i>Rosemary Lane</i> album is the most consistent. "Reynardine" from that album is quite characteristic. If you're familiar with Jimmy Page's Black Mountain Side, it is worth listening to the original&#160;:-) Blackwaterside from the <i>Jack Orion</i> album.

<p>You have convinced me that it’s in 6/4—obviously divided into triplets. Just as you convinced me that its source was a trumpet not a sax. So nit-picking, acompanied by the willingness to learn, is decidedly good. I guess one could compromise with the sleeve notes by referring to a slow triple time. I wonder whether you are a year or two older—or braver—than me and hit Les Cousins at its best? When I went there it was a bit decadent. It was usually John Martyn and he was always visibly scared of putting on the performance. Talk about stage fright! But he invariably gave a performance better than anything he managed on vinyl: even including <i>Bless the weather</i> or <i>Solid Air</i>. —<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Spackman_9ce0.html" title="User:Ian Spackman">Ian Spackman</a></p>
