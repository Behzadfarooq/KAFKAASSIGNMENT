<p>Ted Kord was a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete, sharing much more in common with the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Feature_Syndicate_58a0.html" title="Fox Feature Syndicate">Fox</a> original than did Charlton's earlier reimagining of the character.</p>
<p>Kord's signature equipment was his bug-shaped personal aircraft, which he entered and exited typically with a cable suspended from the cockpit. He also generally eschewed personal weaponry except for a pistol that made a blinding flash of light and, additionally, a strong airblast to gain the advantage when he closed in for hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>Ditko is best known as the co-creator (with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Lee_4d6e.html" title="Stan Lee">Stan Lee</a>) and original artist of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a>. While Blue Beetle and Spider-Man have some similar characteristics, such as being wise-cracking, acrobatic, arthropod-themed urban heroes, they evolved into very different characters. Both characters are accomplished inventors (Ted Kord considered one of the premier minds of the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a>), great athletes, and skilled acrobats. Both characters also have strong, if sometimes ill-timed, senses of humor that they use to mask their insecurities — more so in the case of the Beetle, who has no powers of his own (and in later years has to deal with occasional weight gain). On the other hand, the Beetle has none of the angst associated with brooding vigilantes like Batman. Unlike Spider-Man, Blue Beetle usually operates in a group rather than alone, but like Spidey, he is a loyal friend. In fact, Beetle has been the best friend of the slightly selfish superhero <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booster_Gold_a01d.html" title="Booster Gold">Booster Gold</a> when the two were paired in the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a>, and they would continue to feature as a double act until the end of said superhero team.</p>

<p>The Ted Kord Blue Beetle ran as a backup feature in <i>Captain Atom</i> #83-86 (Nov. 1966 - June 1967) before getting his own title, which ran from #1-5 (June 1967 - Nov. 1968). A sixth issue was produced, but published in the <i>Charlton Portfolio</i> by CPL/Gang. The <a href="../../../q/u/e/Question_%28comics%29.html" title="Question (comics)">Question</a> ran as a backup series, with the fifth issue featuring a quasi-team-up in which the Blue Beetle story continues in part in the Question tale.</p>
<p>An origin was given in #2, linking Ted Kord to the previous Blue Beetle. Ted was revealed as a former student of Dan Garrett, and when they were investigating Ted's Uncle Jarvis, they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in the battle. As he died, he passed on the responsibility of being Blue Beetle to Ted, but wasn't able to pass on the mystical scarab, a convenient means for Ditko to explain his preferred power-free character. There was a hint that one android was still left in stasis, but this would remain unresolved until the DC series of the late 1980s.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, the first issue of Charlton's anthology comic <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Bullseye_d9a0.html" title="Charlton Bullseye">Charlton Bullseye</a></i>, featured a team-up of the Blue Beetle and the Question. Later, <a href="../../../a/c/_/AC_Comics_47b4.html" title="AC Comics">AC Comics</a> would publish a story intended for <i>Charlton Bullseye</i> in <i>Americomics</i> #3, and a one-shot of a team-up of all the Charlton "Action Heroes", as the company called its lineup.</p>

<p>DC acquired the Charlton heroes in the mid-1980s, and used the <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></i> <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_crossover.html" title="Fictional crossover">crossover</a> event to integrate them all into the DC Universe. During this period Blue Beetle had his own series, written by <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Wein_4159.html" title="Len Wein">Len Wein</a>. Also published during this time was <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Origins_a3cd.html" title="Secret Origins">Secret Origins</a></i> #2 (cover illustrated by <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gil_Kane_c7c4.html" title="Gil Kane">Gil Kane</a>), which explained the origins and careers of the Ted Kord and Dan Garrett Blue Beetles in the post-Crisis <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuity_%28fiction%29.html" title="Continuity (fiction)">continuity</a>. They would also follow up on the hinted android in stasis from the Charlton series, which would eventually become 'Carapax, the Indestructible Man'.</p>
<p>Ted Kord was sometimes shown as an industrialist, the owner of <a href="../../../k/o/r/Kord_Industries_9f84.html" title="Kord Industries">Kord Industries</a>; more often he was short on money, leading to his entering "get-rich-quick" schemes with <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booster_Gold_a01d.html" title="Booster Gold">Booster Gold</a>.</p>
<p>A brief appearance in <i>JLA: Year One</i> showed the young Ted working in Kord Industries R&amp;D, where he designed the JLA HQ security system. Upon meeting the heroes he thought, "Screw the family business. I want to be one of those guys", possibly explaining the company's fluctuating status since he took over. In recent comics, it has been implied that Kord Industries has become a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises, headed by Bruce Wayne, also known as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>.</p>

DeMatteis">J.M. DeMatteis</a>'s lighthearted, five-year run on various <i>Justice League of America</i> titles (notably <i>Justice League International</i>), where he was memorably partnered with fellow third-string hero <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booster_Gold_a01d.html" title="Booster Gold">Booster Gold</a>, and the two quickly became best friends. Among fans, they were known collectively as the "Blue and Gold" team. For a while, Beetle grappeled with a weight problem, but with sheer determination and coaching from the hero <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Glory_f921.html" title="General Glory">General Glory</a>, he defeated it. After Giffen and DeMatteis left, <i>Justice League America</i> continued to run until #113. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Jurgens_6a94.html" title="Dan Jurgens">Dan Jurgens</a> tied the "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Superman_744f.html" title="Death of Superman">Death of Superman</a>" storyline into <i>JLA</i>, in which <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_%28comics%29.html" title="Doomsday (comics)">Doomsday</a> left Blue Beetle in a coma during his murderous rampage. Beetle and Booster both subsequently joined the short-lived Justice League offshoot known as <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Justice_807d.html" title="Extreme Justice">Extreme Justice</a>.</p>
<p>Blue Beetle then entered a period of relative obscurity. The <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniseries.html" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a> <i>The LAW (Living Assault Weapons)</i> reunited Blue Beetle and the other heroes acquired from Charlton, but the series met with critical disfavor.</p>

<p>Ted made several appearances in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_of_Prey_%28comics%29_dc53.html" title="Birds of Prey (comics)">Birds of Prey</a>, at first as Oracle's internet friend and later in person. It was hinted in several issues that Ted had a crush on Oracle.</p>
<p>Ted had gone back to his company, but still had many, many problems with it, problems Oracle tried to help resolve. During this time, it was revealed he had a heart condition, but this did not stop him from assisting when it was needed.</p>

<p>In the 80-page special <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown_to_Infinite_Crisis_db66.html" title="Countdown to Infinite Crisis">Countdown to Infinite Crisis</a></i>, published on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, 2005, Blue Beetle discovered a renewed <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkmate_%28DC_Comics%29_d30e.html" title="Checkmate (DC Comics)">Checkmate</a> organization led by <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell_Lord_df78.html" title="Maxwell Lord">Maxwell Lord</a>, former bankroller of the JLA, headquartered in a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> castle fortress, where Beetle was captured. Lord revealed to Blue Beetle that his intent was to use the organization to ensure that metahumans, including superheroes, would be kept under surveilance and control by humans. Kord then gave Beetle an ultimatum to join his organization. When Kord refused, Lord murdered him with a bullet to the head.</p>
<p>That same story had earlier reiterated that Ted Kord had thought the scarab destroyed back in <i>Blue Beetle</i> vol.1 #18 (1987); however, it had been rediscovered, untouched, in a temple in Egypt, and handed over to Kord. The wizard <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shazam_%28comics%29.html" title="Shazam (comics)">Shazam</a> took the scarab upon encountering Kord, fueling speculation about the possibility of the character's return during DC's <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a></i> series. This possibility was dashed when it was asked in the Wizard World convention if Kord would ever return. While not exactly answering the question, writer <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Rucka_d117.html" title="Greg Rucka">Greg Rucka</a> stated, "There was a breeze blowing through his brain, and he was incinerated. How much clearer can it be?"<a href="http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&amp;threadid=40070" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=f7a18efa469e4edc763fec8bd47ffe94&amp;threadid=40070" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>An individual that looks like Ted as Blue Beetle has shown up in <i>Manhunter</i> vol. 3 #27 (January 2007), before Wonder Woman's trial for the death of Max Lord. Claiming to be amnesiac, and have forgotten all about his trip in Switzerland, he manages to gain Manhunter's trust.

<p>Ted had no superpowers, however he did possess a genius-level intellect and he was trained as an acrobat and in multiple forms of martial arts. Ted created numerous gadgets which included suction pads, sight-enhancing lenses and a protective costume. He has even created a functional artifical arm, as part of a suit of battle-armor that also acted as life support for his friend Booster Gold. His BB gun was a handheld weapon that could blind villains with a flash of light, knock them out with a sonic boom, and also featured a grappel device. Blue Beetle's ship, the Bug, was filled with weaponry and could fly at 600 mph.</p>
