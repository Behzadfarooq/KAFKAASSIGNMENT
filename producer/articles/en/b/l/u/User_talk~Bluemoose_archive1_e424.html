<p>Hi, you're making helpful edits, but please use edit summaries, it lets us know what you've done so us experienced editors don't have to check every diff. Multiply that by the lots of us that watch these pages and you'll save a lot of people a lot of time. Just put something in like 'formatting fix' or 'grammar fix' or 'expanding a bit', or be even more detailed about what you added if you want.

<p>Hello! I noticed that you - among others - had attempted to change the general stub message in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genderfuck.html" title="Genderfuck">Genderfuck</a> into a more specific one. So far I have reverted all those attempts, because the categories you assigned it to were completely inappropriate.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not a "sex-stub", because genderfuck has little to do with sex (the equipment) and less with sex (the action). Whoever uses that one ought to get a grip on the differences between gender, sex (the equipment) and sex (the action).</li>
<li>It is not a "psycho-stub" because people who genderfuck hardly belong into the same category as undisputed mental illnesses. And the other articles there were about those.</li>
<li>And it is not an "lgb-stub" either, since while lgb people might do genderfuck too (although most do not), it is certainly not a matter limited to lgb people.</li>
</ul>
<p>So either find a category that <i>fits</i>, or make one, or leave the generic stub message in absence of any usefull specific one. Thank you very much! -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 08:59, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why did you re-add the {{station-stub}} template to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresh_Air_deea.html" title="Fresh Air">Fresh Air</a> article (after I had removed it, the first time you added it)?

<dd>sorry, its because when you search for radio on the list of stubs it gives you that stub, does this call for a radio program stub? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Bluemoose</a> 21:13, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is linked too from 'List of unusual place names' or somesuch. I don't know whether it's a real place or not, though there are villages called America in the UK.

<p>Hi Bluemoose. Thanks for the thanks!</p>
<p>I shifted the content of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_information.html" title="Perfect information">perfect information</a> onto a new page about <a href="../../../c/o/m/Complete_information.html" title="Complete information">complete information</a> because the article described complete rather than perfect information. The difference is that in a game with perfect information all the players know what actions other players have taken in the past. With complete information, every player knows what sort of game they're playing. All players know the payoffs, what actions are available to their opponents (what their opponents' types are) and so on. Scrabble and poker are not examples of imperfect information because every action is observed by the other players. For example if I discard 3 cards you know I've discarded 3 cards. However, they are examples of incomplete information because not everybody's cards (or tiles) are on the table (face up). You don't know <i>which</i> 3 cards I've discarded. I can't think of many recreational (board or parlour) games that have imperfect information. In fact, I can't think of any off the top of my head! Hide-and-seek, perhaps, that great game of strategy!

<p>Hi there! I have not had the chance to respond to your msg earlier, sorry for the delay. However, despite what you say, I have not been stubbing since that message, having had other things on my hands. However, I've done a lot of stubbing (a full run of Deadend pages) so you're likely to run into more of it. Other than that, you're right about me having to memorize more stub categories (which I'm working on).</p>
<p>Given the size of a stub it really doesn't matter if the notice is at the top or the bottom, though, so I fail to see why that's a problem.

<p>Hi. I'm thinking that <a href="../../../b/-/a/B-actor.html" title="B-actor">B-actor</a> might be stubbed into the "filming-stub" category either in place of or in addition to the "actor-stub" category. My thinking is that the definition of a B-actor depends on the definition of a B-movie, which would be associated with the "filming-stub" category. I've not double-stubbed yet as I thought I'd ask your opinion first.</p>

<p>I think how these terms are used varies in economic literature anyway. I'd say that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginal_benefit.html" title="Marginal benefit">marginal benefit</a> is possibly a broader term than <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginal_utility.html" title="Marginal utility">marginal utility</a> since one might talk of the marginal utility of/to a user, but probably not a firm; whereas one could use marginal benefit for both. Also, benefit is essentially the 'opposite' of cost, but utility has a more specific meaning.</p>
<p>However, I don't think they merit separate articles and any difference between their meanings could be made adequately clear in one article. Treborbassett 09:39, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy, Bluemoose. I've come across your name a few times in economics articles, usually fixing categorization.

<p>Hmm, yes. It's a messy mix of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_counties_of_England_c09e.html" title="Traditional counties of England">traditional</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_counties_of_England_ab3c.html" title="Administrative counties of England">administrative</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_counties_of_England_16dc.html" title="Ceremonial counties of England">ceremonial</a> counties.

<ul>
<li>There are too many <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_counties_of_England_ab3c.html" title="Administrative counties of England">Administrative counties of England</a> and they do not map well with people's expectation of "counties" by dividing places like East &amp; West Sessex.</li>
<li>Traditional counties are vague, and it is long since Northuberland owned Tyneside, for instance</li>
<li>That leaves us with Ceremonial counties ... we could change all the List of Places pages such that they mapped to the ceremonials, since there are not too many of them</li>
<li>Or else we could do some hybrid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever we choose, I think we should be clear as to which of these schemes we are using, in the text of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_places_in_England_4c83.html" title="List of places in England">List of places in England</a> page, and in each <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_places_in_Northumberland_b854.html" title="List of places in Northumberland">List of places in <i>County</i></a>. My vote would be to go for a hybrid, of Ceremonial counties with exceptions for East &amp; West Sussex (combine into Sussex) and the Yorkshires (again, combine).

The regulation of its secretion, the mechanisms that protect gastric mucosa and the disorders make it an extensive topic.

<p>Hi Bluemoose,</p>
<p>I appreciate you removing the typos from some of my edits, Bluemoose.</p>
<p>It seems that some of the contributors here have discussed the Wikimedia edict not to write articles "defining terms". I tried to obey this rule until I realized that it fundamentally meaningless; every article defines a term. Even if some distinction could be drawn it would not help the encyclopedia because the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a> isn't the place for complicated jargon.</p>
<p>If the "no term-definition" rule were rigidly enforced it would mean that every article using the words "<a href="../../../s/u/p/Superior_goods.html" title="Superior goods">Superior goods</a>" would have to define what the phrase meant; this is a problem because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It means different things to different people, and therefore leads to internal inconsistency in Wikipedia.</li>
<li>It wastes valuable reading-time in complex articles; the advantage of a hyper-text encyclopedia is that the novice reader can instantly lookup terms they don't understand, where the expert will only need to know what's new on a page.</li>
<li>A "term" might seem to require only a simple definition, but infact there's a vast amount to say about <i>everything</i>. Over time, the "history of a term" may become an interesting article in itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hi Bluemoose. I like all the uk infoboxes you've been adding, so keep up the excellent work. One thing I noticed, however, is that in most of the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridgeshire.html" title="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a> village boxes (and possibly elsewhere, I don't know), you've added the longitude as West rather than East. I've been correcting them when I've spotted them (eg Template:Coor dm NW -&gt; Template:Coor dm NE, but thought I'd let you know, as the map link comes out wrong. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmb1001_1f43.html" title="User:Smb1001">Smb1001</a> 21:50, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, they're N and W on multimap, but the longitude on Cambridgeshire is negative, meaning east. Not to worry. <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmb1001_1f43.html" title="User:Smb1001">Smb1001</a> 12:30, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bluemoose - just to let you know I reverted a change you made using humanbot to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9_74eb.html" title="Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a>. When I saw the edit summary ("could of -&gt; could have") I was horrified that I could have made that mistake, or let it remain, when I was working on the article, but thankfully further checking revealed it was part of a sentence reading "while this could of course be...", so 'could of...' was correct. Just wanted to let you know so you don't think I'm defending a grammatical howler&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
