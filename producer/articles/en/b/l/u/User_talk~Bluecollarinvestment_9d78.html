	    <p><b>About Blue Collar Investment:</b></p>
<p>Who are we and why should you listen to us? That is an excellent question. I can start by telling you who we are not. We are not salesman; therefore, anything you buy really doesn’t benefit our pocket book. We are not national personalities pulling numbers from thin air; we have a customized system that deals with the mathematical and psychological aspects of stock in general. We are not water dealers. What is that? Water dealers are a group of people that pour water from their basements in Pittsburgh, plug it into a plastic bottle and place a fancy label on it and call it imported. Therefore, in trading terms, we don’t “dress up” the stock to make it look and act other than what it is.</p>
<p>We are not Donald Trump with hair plugs. We are not Mercedes driving, want-to-be elitist. We did not attend an Ivy League School. We do not believe that money is more important than morality. More importantly, money doesn’t define who we are. We do not crave fame nor expect to receive it.</p>
<p>We are not psychotic fundamentalists. We are not card carrying members of the NRA. We neither support nor oppose any political organization. We do not believe that our opinion is more important than others.</p>
<p>Who are we? We are hard working individuals trying to close the gap between middle class and upper class. We are a group of people that believe that not only is our success important but the success of our “fellows” is as important as well. We hold the values of family high and want to see our children succeed. We put in sixty hour weeks to make sure there is a roof over our family’s heads and food in their mouths. Our purpose is to unite as a group of people to create a larger body for a greater good; but who we really are is you and you are us.</p>
<p>The Blue Collar Philosophy:</p>
<p>At Blue Collar Investment, we apply the Cardinal Virtues to all aspects of life. More importantly, we apply these to each and every endeavor. These virtues weigh heavy upon us, thus, it is important that Blue Collar Investment represents strength and honor not only in the realms of business or personal success but within the community as well. Cardinal Virtues Sapientia (Prudence): "Classically, prudence is considered to be a virtue, and indeed, one of the Cardinal Virtues. The word comes from Old French prudence (13th century), from Latin prudentia "foresight, sagacity," contraction of providentia "foresight". It is often associated with Wisdom, Insight, and Knowledge. In this case, the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions, not only in a general sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with knowledge, all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are courageous, as opposed to reckless or cowardly, for instance, was an act of prudence. This is why it is classified as a "cardinal" which is to say "pivotal" virtue.</p>
<p>Although prudence would be applied to any such judgment, the more difficult tasks, which distinguish a person as prudent, arethose in which various goods have to be weighed against each other, as when a person is determining what would be best to give charitable donations, or how to punish a child so as to prevent repeating an offense.</p>
<p>Conventionally, prudence is the exercise of sound judgment in practical affairs.</p>
<p>In modern English, however, the word has become increasingly synonymous with cautiousness. In this sense, prudence names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks, but when unreasonably extended (i.e. over-cautiousness), can become the vice of cowardice."</p>
<p>Temperantia (Temperance): Temperance (Sophrosyne in Greek) is the practice of moderation. It was one of the four "cardinal" virtues held to be vital to society in Hellenic culture. It is one of the Four Cardinal Virtues considered central to Christian behavior by the Catholic Church and is an important tenet of the moral codes of other world religions?for example, it is one of the Five Precepts of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Classically, temperance was defined as governing natural appetites for the pleasure of senses according to the bounds of reason. No virtue could be sustained in the face of inability to control oneself, if the virtue was opposed to some desire; this is why it is classified as a cardinal virtue, where "cardinal" signifies "pivotal."</p>
<p>Fortitudo (Fortitude): Fortitude is the ability to confront fear, pain, danger, uncertainty or intimidation. It can be divided into "physical courage"; in face of physical pain, hardship, and threat of death and "moral courage"; in the face of shame, scandal, and discouragement.</p>
<p>The precise view of what constitutes courage not only varies among cultures, but among individuals. For instance, some define courage as lacking fear in a situation that would normally generate it. Others, in contrast, hold that courage requires one to have fear and then overcome it.</p>
<p>There are also more subtle distinctions in the definition of Fortitude. For example, some distinguish between courage and foolhardiness in that a courageous person overcomes a justifiable fear for an even more noble purpose. If the fear is not justifiable or if the purpose is not noble, then the courage is either false or foolhardy.</p>
<p>Iustitia (Justice): Justice is the moderation between selfishness and selflessness; treating all people equally to oneself and to each other. The just man renders to each and all what is due to them, which are their moral and legal rights to do, possess, or exact something. This is equal insofar as each one receives what he is entitled to, but may be unequal insofar as different people may have different rights: two children have different rights from a certain adult if that adult is the parent of one of them and not of the other.</p>
<p>It is closely related to the practice of charity because it regulates the relationships with others. It is a cardinal virtue, which is to say "pivotal" because it regulates all such relationships, and is sometimes deemed the most important of the cardinal virtues.</p>
<p>Blue Collar investment finds a great deal of comfort within these virtues; we hope that our subscribers will find the same.</p>
<p>Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</p>
