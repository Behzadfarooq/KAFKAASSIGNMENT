<p>There is compelling evidence that Blue sea and Steven Banks are one and the same person.</p>
<p>This is evident from a simple observation of the editing record of all three "users".</p>
<p>Take today, 25 January 2006, for example. Please note the times each "user" began his editing session and when it finished. Please also note that all three are editing the same type of articles, which have for all intents and purposes been lifted from another website in clear contravention of Wikipedia policy. Guess we'll have to report you for this too.</p>

<p>I am afraid the user Damac is a lier as he is Greek and does have a Greek POV. This article is full of lies and propaganda and the usage of the word pogrom is used to incite racial hatred. peopel should not use Wikipedia for there own racial sensitivities. Wikipedia is not here for such hooliganism. Though as more Greeks inflitrate the international satge - such as tennis - even hooliganism will become prevalent there. I will do my own objective research on this issue and changes will be made. I take serious issue with many disputed events that are being recorded here as historical FACT. Or apart from "not being" a Greek is Damac a learned historian, too?</p>
<p>I will also bring forth reasons for the riots, which are not made clear, such as retaliations for the Greek governmental perscution of Thrace Turks, where they cannot praticse their religion, women kidnapped, raped and forced to change their names and religion [1].</p>
<p>Greece has been taken many time to the European court of human rights on this matter. I will prepare an article on these issues. It is time that the truth really was written.</p>
<p>I am sick to death when people hijack Wikipedia for their own bigotry and prejudices.</p>

<dl>
<dd>First of all, I'm not Greek, but am from Ireland. Secondly, I am an historian and hold a Ph.D. in history. What are your qualifications?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is nothing in that article that has not appeared in the Turkish press and there are a number of Turkish articles listed in the sources section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For your information, I am researching the history of Ottoman mosques in Greece and think it is a disgrace how these buildings have been neglected by the Greek authorities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Feel free to make any changes to the article in question as you see fit. I will review each one for its merits.</dd>

<p>Tell me, what is your problem? There were two articles with very little context and no cited sources under extremely POV titles; they were ripe for AfD, which is not <a href="../../../s/d/_/WP%7ESD_2382.html" title="WP:SD">speedy deletion</a>, but is the initiation of a debate over whether articles should be deleted. Wikipedians then comment and vote over whether the article(s) in question should be deleted. I did not request their deletion, I requested for comment on initiating an <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AfD</a> debate. Normally, I would <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> on your part, but your personal attacks are unacceptable and so I consider myself freed from the obligation to do so. You yourself referred to those articles as "pro Turkish sites", thereby confirming the need for their deletion. One of Wikipedia's most important policies is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> (neutral point of view); partisan articles like those are simply not allowed. Perhaps you have to wrong idea about Wikipedia. I encourage you to read <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_22de.html" title="Help:Contents">Help:Contents</a> and to pay particular attention to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">the five pillars</a>, so that you can gain good idea of what we are supposed to be doing here.

Please note that I am likely to <a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">remove</a> trollish and abusive attacks from my talk page and other editors are likely to do the same, so I advise you to avoid making them. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatinus_7925.html" title="User:Latinus">Latinus</a> (<a href="../../../../el/%CE%BB/%CE%B1/%CF%84/%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7_%CF%87%CF%81%CE%AE%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%7E%CE%9B%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%82_826d.html" class="extiw" title="el:Συζήτηση_χρήστη:Λατίνος">talk (el:)</a>) 00:16, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well well well- you have changed your tune Latinus. I wonder why?</p>
<p>My problem is I see you as a Greek Wikipedian terrorist - attacking articles with a secret agenda - and I watch all your contributions with interest. Your exact words to Damac were whether you though you could "GET AWAY" with getting those articles deleted. And hiding under the excuse of trolling you are not even man enough to keep my posts on your discussion page - and in this respect at least your fellow <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">Wikipedians</a> have more guts than you do. Maybe that is because you have more to hide.</p>
<p>I have seen many pro Greek, pro Kurdish pro Armenian sites on Wiki - writing out histories of music as though half of the middle East is in fact a recognise Kurdistan, Armenian allegations of genicide sticking in fiction as fact, uprisings in Istanbul called pogroms, even the smallest details of the Ottoman Empire attacked by Greeks on Wikipedia - and let us not forget the Cyprus issue. And what has any Wikipedian done about it? Nothing&gt; Those that have tried <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">to do something</a> have given up. Why is it only when a site shows a favorable light on the Turks and their culture is it partisan?</p>
<p>That is why I have lost faith in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You don't know it, but it is not the likes of me but the likes of you that will eventually damage the credibility of Wikipedia - the minute people start quoting these sites as "supposedly" reliable evidence of certain events - one day there will be a slip up and it will not only be I that questions the adinistrators here and people like you.</p>
<p>And I have message from a friend called Tasos. He says you are a religious traitor or not really Greek and he thinks the Pope is the devil incarnate. I thought I'd just put the last one in and do you the favour of giving you an excuse to take this off your page again.</p>
<p>I can't help it - I pity you. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_sea_e248.html" title="User:Blue sea">Blue sea</a> 05:58, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you want to know what the latest developments are, check out the following:

<p>First, off, I blocked you because you were vandalising and using personal attacks. Besides that, I personally have no opinion whatsover about this subject area myself. I am not Greek or Turkish, and know little about the subject. However, your claim that there is a definite Greek POV in Wikipedia seems doubtful to me. We have several policies, such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> that should ensure that this does not happen. However, if you still feel that this is the case, there are avenues that you can pursue.</p>
<p>First of all, the following policies and guidelines should always be followed, which you have not done, and this makes resolving the conflict more difficult. Please read them again before proceeding. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. Comments like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJacoplane&amp;diff=38861509&amp;oldid=38846963" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJacoplane&amp;diff=38861509&amp;oldid=38846963" rel="nofollow">this</a> are simply unacceptable, and I think you realise that you won't get anywhere by using such measures.</p>
<p>Now, if you feel you can have a civil discussion and wish to resolve this, you can ask the community to comment on the situation at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>.

<p>I too realized there are Greek and Armenian Wikipedians with an agenda to promote especially on the articles related to Turks. Why do you think they are so concerned about Turkish articles? Because Wikipedia is their chance to rewrite history from their own perspective, it is a form of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> for them. But this is not the way to prove a point, play by Wiki rules, relax a little bit, what makes you think they have the upper hand? If progress could be made or wars could be won by complaining while scratching balls then Greeks would rule the world by now.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 14:15, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. You comepletely misunderstood what I have written. i didn't say I heard or read that he said he was gay. I said I know about these things, meaning the gossips around his private life. if you had read carefully what I wrote you would hve seen I tried to persuade the editor to back up his sayings with relevant sources. I'd appreciate if you would be kind enough not to judge my articles without having seen them first. Umarim anlatabildim.
