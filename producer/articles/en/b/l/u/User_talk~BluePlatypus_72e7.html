<p>Hi, BluePlatypus. Let’s not let this go any further. I strive to have good relations with my Wiki colleagues, and you are no exception. I guess from your name that you’re an Aussie, so even more reason to stay mates.</p>
<p>I’ve already publicly apologized for my statement that you called "arrogant", and I wasn’t intending to reopen that issue.</p>
<p>I was merely commenting on your apparent propensity to use pejorative labels, like "arrogant" and "pretentious". I certainly do appreciate the difference between a personal criticism, and a criticism of a person’s actions. But using labels to make a criticism - even of actions - has little or no value. It places you in a more intellectually superior position, one where you can look down and decide what something is. That's not what this is about. If you want to disagree with someone’s statement, or want to add something to it, do so, but that can be done just as well without labelling it as any particular thing. Even calling someone’s contribution something positive (eg. “excellent”) is just as judgmental as calling it something negative (eg. “arrogant”). Best to avoid such terms altogether, in my view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you notice the delicious irony, by the way? I asked you to refrain from characterising other people's contributions in pejorative terms. Your response was to … guess what, characterise my earlier statement in pejorative terms, <i>That's because your answer the other day was arrogant.</i> I love it. I might keep that one for posterity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I’m not sounding preachy. God knows I fail daily, mea culpa. I would just caution you to be careful of practising what you preach, otherwise karma will come back and bite you. Let me give you an example. At the Science reference page, you made the statement that <i>No mental disease or disorder can be diagnosed merely from a single symptom</i>. There’s a separate debate about that. I haven’t said so in that debate, but I will say here privately that, despite (or perhaps because of) you acknowledging up front that you have no expertise in psychiatry, I still think this is bordering very, very close to being what one might term "pretentious". I’ve told you above why I wouldn’t normally use such language – I just use it here to illustrate my point. But if you’re going to continue to use such terms, you have to make sure you own backyard is squeaky clean. That’s all.</p>
<p>Oh, I would also ask that if you’re going to quote me (as in, using inverted commas), please use my exact, verbatim words – otherwise you’re making an untrue statement about what I actually said. What I said was <i>Now you're all just making it up as you go along</i>, which I followed with 2 other sentences. You’ve translated this into <i>nothing more than "You don't know what you are talking about"</i>. Hardly the same things, are they? Cheers, mate <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 03:09, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let <i>what</i> go any further? I'm sorry, but the only impression I have of what's going on here is that you're pissed off about me criticizing your astrology crap, and now you've decided to go pick a fight with me wherever you can, by making off-topic replys on the Reference Desk, and now by leaving messages on this talk page. I think that's childish behaviour. But now that you've convinced yourself now of how evil, stupid and hypocritical I am, then I hope you can move on and let me continue to make comments without you standing over my shoulder to nit-pick at them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You wrote: <i>Do your research, study the subject, then make comments. Uneducated comments can sometimes be quite amusing, but on this occasion ....? Nah.</i>. That is arrogant. Most people would agree that is an arrogant response. I said it was arrogant, and I stand by that. And now you criticize me for being pejorative. Pluck the beam from your own eye, dude. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 12:57, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that sure didn't get the response I was hoping for. But I am letting go and moving on. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 05:32, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well perhaps next time you should say what you want, e.g. "I'm angry at you and demand an apology!" instead of that holier-than-thou act, because noone's buying it. I do not think many people would find that comment pretentious. (Which the dictionary tells me means: "Claiming or demanding a position of distinction or merit, especially when unjustified."). Given that I wrote "I am not a psychiatrist", I would say it's anything but pretentious. Most of the responses on the Reference Desk are made by non-experts. Most of them do not openly acknowledge any lack of education on the subject. So by your standards, most people answering questions there are far more pretentious than I.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, the <b>truth</b> is that this has nothing to do with my comments in themselves. You are the only one who has found them objectionable, while several others have voiced support of what I've said. I don't see you raising similar objections to similar responses from other people either. It's pretty obvious you're the one with an axe to grind here. In the future, I'd appreciate it if you'd be upfront about it instead though, instead of starting these tedious arguments that noone is buying into. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 13:53, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. I wasn't ignoring you, I really had moved on. I see no value in going over old ground any more. I had forgotten to take you off my watchlist and the posting below brought you up again, so I just peeked in out of curiosity. I have learned many things from recent events. One lesson is to accept responsibility for the consequences of my statements, whatever merit they may have in themselves. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 03:11, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having read two recent responses of yours (to the question apropros of one's ability, having been well-versed in grammar, to break the conventions of grammar for literary effect and to the proselytzing Christian polemic) at the Reference Desk, I am moved to write to commend you not only for the salient sublimity of your answers but also for the perspicacious and pithy nature of those answers.

<dd>That is <b>your problem</b>, HydrogenSu. If you ask "Is this right?" and it isn't, then are people supposed to tell you? Should we lie to you just to make you happy? Do you think your university teachers are going to do the same? You're right. I <b>don't</b> care about your feelings. Those feelings won't help you pass courses, or get into university, or get a job. You know, I've taught physics at a university. (which was <b>not</b> in the USA). One thing you learn teaching is how to tell what the person knows from the questions they ask. The questions you ask give me the impression you have missed some of the basics, and that's the reason you're making mistakes now. So am I supposed to lie to you? Just because your feelings will be hurt if I tell you "Go back and look in the book"? Grow up and stop taking this stuff so personally. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 15:22, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say it was wrong. However, the Laplace transform <i>is</i> an integral. It doesn't, in itself, help you solve them. If someone asks "How do I show that some integral has this value?", Then I assume they're asking how to calculate the integral. So the intended solution to your homework problem involved identifying a certain integral as the equivalent of a Laplace transform and looking it up in a table of Laplace transforms. That doesn't make my answer wrong. I'd say it was the better answer, because "Look it up in a table of integrals" isn't what most people want when they're asking that kind of question. But since you've said you're not interested in what I have to say, perhaps someone else should explain this. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 10:49, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Page blanking a talk page is vandalism because it removes the materials from discussion and prevents editors from reviewing and restructuring the materials and trying to agree.

<dd>I did not blank the talk page. I removed the part you cut-and-pasted from the Merkey article. Secondly, the main article is almost always used as a reference for discussions of merging. That's how the merge tags work on Wikipedia. Go look at any article that have been merged, and you'll find that it's been done with a merge tag. It is not done by cut-and-pasting the entire article to the talk page. Please follow the proper procedure if you want to suggest a merge, by adding a merge tag to the article and let people discuss it on the talk page. Don't clutter up the talk page with off-topic material like that.

<dd>Well, thank you too! Here's some info: Science is actually my main subject (in terms of amount of education). So my edits reflect that, in the sense that I don't edit as much on science subjects! I do enough science at work.&#160;:) Anyway, I prefer anonymity because first, I don't really like appeals to authority, and anonymity is a good way to stop me from doing it. But it also stops having my authority challenged, and from personal attacks. Second, I simply value privacy, I've got a pretty unusual job, and a very unique name. Googling for my surname in its current spelling will only result in hits pertaining to my immediate family. So naturally I'd want to be a bit careful about what gets associated with that online. (In particular since I predict what goes online in Wikipedia, will stay online. For a long time.) --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluePlatypus_82c6.html" title="User:BluePlatypus">BluePlatypus</a> 03:18, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I write to compliment you on and for your excellent comments at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Talk%7ERicin_a66a.html" title="Talk:Ricin">Talk:ricin</a>. Both at the Reference Desk and on the talk page, the question as to the propriety of the article's including relatively specific directions for the production of reference was posed as what is surely a false dilemma, viz., either that one opposes the inclusion of the directions in view of their prospective use by, inter al., terrorists (or, at the very least, in view of the "image problem" that possibility creates for Wikipedia) or that one supports the inclusion of the directions on the grounds that <i>Wikipedia is not censored</i> (or, at the very least, that the information is readily available elsewhere and our concern must be for the dissemination of info above all else). As you have illustrated, there is an additional side, to-wit, that, the former grounds notwithstanding (it would be wholly stupid, to pick a relatively blunt term, to delete the material simply because it might aid terrorists), the information doesn't belong in the article because it's unencyclopedic and exorbitantly detailed (I assume, though I have yet to check, that our articles about similarly-styled substances don't have directions for creating them). In any case, thanks for adding some sanity to a debate that certainly might have gone down indecorous or intellectually infirm roads. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:31, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I just saw your contribution to the Dutch Cold Pack question on the reference desk. You seem to have some command of the Dutch language, which I find very admirable. Indeed, I find it exceedingly admirable; as it happens, I'm trying to have a few lines of songtext translated and by now I'm near to despairing. We're going to do a public reading in Vienna next weekend, and I'd dearly like to contribute mock-serious analysis of one truly silly Dutch song containing hilarious animals noises and atrocious carnival style music. I'm going to post it in the language help desk, as a last resort. Maybe you might like to take a look at it?
