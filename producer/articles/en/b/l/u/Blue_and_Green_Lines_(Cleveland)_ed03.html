<p>The two lines begin their route separately in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_Heights%2C_Ohio_1975.html" title="Shaker Heights, Ohio">Shaker Heights</a>, to the east of Cleveland. Much of this section of their route is at grade, reflecting this portion of the lines' history as <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetcar_line.html" title="Streetcar line">streetcar lines</a>. The two lines meet just over the Cleveland city line at <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_Square_7e71.html" title="Shaker Square">Shaker Square</a>, and share trackage for the rest of their route. They use grade-separated trackage to reach <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_City_Center_f1fa.html" title="Tower City Center">Tower City Center</a>, 2.6 miles (4.2 km) of which, including two stations (<a href="../../../e/a/s/East_34th-Campus_%28RTA_Rapid_Transit_station%29_c261.html" title="East 34th-Campus (RTA Rapid Transit station)">East 34th-Campus</a> and East 55th), are shared with the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_rail.html" title="Heavy rail">heavy rail</a> <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapid_transit.html" title="Rapid transit">rapid transit</a> <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Line_%28Cleveland%29_ef09.html" title="Red Line (Cleveland)">Red Line</a> in an arrangement unique in North American rail transit. Shared stations have low platforms for the Blue and Green Lines and high platforms for the Red Line.</p>
<p>After leaving Tower City, the two lines head for the lakefront in a relatively new section of track known as the <b>Waterfront Line</b>. Trains travel north through <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flats_9a67.html" title="The Flats">the Flats</a> to <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Erie_5da4.html" title="Lake Erie">Lake Erie</a> and east along the lakeshore.

Although Waterfront Line stations are branded as such by the RTA, there is no separate Waterfront Line service; all trains on this portion of the system are Blue and Green Line trains.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_Heights%2C_Ohio_1975.html" title="Shaker Heights, Ohio">Shaker Heights</a> was incorporated in 1912, and the next year the first section of the Cleveland Interurban Railroad opened, 1.6 miles (2.6 km) from Coventry Road east down the median of Shaker Boulevard (then part of Coventry Road) to Fontenay Road (west of Eaton Road). The line was connected to other streetcar lines via a line along Coventry Road through <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Heights%2C_Ohio_8034.html" title="Cleveland Heights, Ohio">Cleveland Heights</a> to the north.</p>
<p>As construction progessed on Shaker Heights, the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Sweringens_52c3.html" title="Van Sweringens">Van Sweringens</a>, the owners of the streetcar suburb, planned for a grade-separated <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-of-way_%28railroad%29.html" title="Right-of-way (railroad)">right-of-way</a> all the way to downtown. In 1915 they acquired a majority interest in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York%2C_Chicago_and_St._Louis_Railroad_8c3c.html" title="New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad">New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad</a> (aka the Nickel Plate Road), mainly to allow for a line next to a relocated NYC&amp;StL. The next section of line opened in 1920, running west from Coventry Road down the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Median_%28highway%29.html" title="Median (highway)">median</a> of the new Shaker Boulevard to Woodhill Road, then across the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Short_Line_Railway_7bbd.html" title="Cleveland Short Line Railway">Cleveland Short Line Railway</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Central_Railroad_c622.html" title="New York Central Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>) and alongside a CSL branch to 55th Street. West of 55th, where the CSL branch crossed over the parallel Nickel Plate, the new streetcar line also crossed the Nickel Plate, continuing west between the branch and Nickel Plate to the intersection of the Kingsbury Viaduct (34th Street) and Broadway. An existing line of the Cleveland Railway along Broadway provided initial access to downtown for this line, numbered <b>38</b>.</p>
<p>Also in 1920 came a short extension east from Fontenay Road to Courtland Boulevard, as well as branch, to the south and east of what was Moreland Circle (today, Shaker Square), which makes up the bulk of today's Blue Line. This line (numbered <b>58</b>) split from the other (Green) line at <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_Square_7e71.html" title="Shaker Square">Shaker Square</a> and ran southeast down the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Median_%28highway%29.html" title="Median (highway)">median</a> of Moreland (later, renamed Van Aken) Boulevard to Lynnfield Road, where the 61 streetcar continued east. In 1930 the 58 was extended along the 61 tracks to its present terminal of Warrensville Center Road, and the rest of the 61 was removed. Extensions of the other (Green) line were built in 1928 to Warrensville Center Road and the rest of the way to Green Road in 1936.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Union_Terminal_f7e5.html" title="Cleveland Union Terminal">Cleveland Union Terminal</a> opened in 1930, along with a new grade-separated right-of-way with side-by-side lines for steam railroads and electric streetcars. The ramp to Broadway and 34th Street was removed, and all Cleveland Interurban Railroad cars were operated via the new line into the north part of the Union Terminal.</p>

<p>In 1944 the City of Shaker Heights took over the financially struggling lines and began operating them as Shaker Heights Rapid Transit. The Van Sweringens had planned to build several other lines, but financial problems prevented this. In 1955 the first section of the city's new rapid transit line, now known the Red Line, opened east from Union Terminal. This included 2.6 miles (4.2 km) and two stations shared with the Shaker Heights Line, necessitating split platforms with low-level sections (for Shaker Heights cars) and high-level sections (for rapid transit cars).</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Cleveland_Regional_Transit_Authority_dddc.html" title="Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority">Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority</a> took over the Shaker Heights lines in 1975.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, both lines were extended through downtown into a new section, called the Waterfront Line, connecting <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_City_Center_f1fa.html" title="Tower City Center">Tower City</a> to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Coast_Harbor_46ab.html" title="North Coast Harbor">North Coast Harbor</a> area. Plans have been drawn up to loop the Waterfront Line back through downtown to Tower City along city streets, but it seems unlikely to move forward in the near future. There has also been a proposal to extend the Waterfront line, from the current South Harbor (Muny Lot @ East 14th Street) eastward along the lakefront to possibly the Glenville or Collinwood neighborhoods or, perhaps, even further to Euclid or beyond. This eastward expansion is still a part of the Cleveland Planning Commission’s extensive Lakefront Development proposal but nothing concrete has been established to date.</p>

<li>Tower City is the first of three transfer points to the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Line_%28Cleveland%29_ef09.html" title="Red Line (Cleveland)">Red Line</a>. From Tower City, the Blue, Green and Red Lines share grade-separated trackage built in 1930 through two more stations:</li>

<li>East 55th - Central Rail
<ul>
<li>After East 55th, the Blue and Green Lines split from the Red Line, and continue grade-separated along a 1920 right of way, still grade separated, past the following stations:</li>
</ul>

<li>East 79th</li>

</ul>
<p>At Woodhill, the line begins to run below grade in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Median_%28highway%29.html" title="Median (highway)">median</a> of Shaker Boulevard. Approaching Shaker Square station, the line rises to grade level, and has its first <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grade_crossing.html" title="Grade crossing">grade crossings</a> with the roadways of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaker_Square_7e71.html" title="Shaker Square">Shaker Square</a>.

<li>At Warrensville, the median of Shaker Boulevard widens for a never-built <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeway.html" title="Freeway">freeway</a> upgrade, and the Green Line is once again grade-separated for its final three stops:</li>
