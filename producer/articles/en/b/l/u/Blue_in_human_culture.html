<p>Blue may denote the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a>, derived from the traditional colour of factory <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform.html" title="Uniform">uniforms</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue-collar.html" title="Blue-collar">Blue-collar workers</a> are industrial workers and are often contrasted with <a href="../../../w/h/i/White-collar.html" title="White-collar">white-collar</a> office workers. However, in contrast to "blue collar," the phrase "blue blood" is used to mean "from an <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocratic</a> background," because pale, untanned skin–historically, a sign of nobility–allows blue-tinged veins to show through.</p>
<p>Several vocations are associated with blue. <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_enforcement.html" title="Law enforcement">Law enforcement</a>, and uniformed <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a>, often wear blue uniforms and have become associated with the color, as seen in phrases such as "boys in blue," "blue line," and "blue wall." Most <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_car.html" title="Police car">police cars</a> have blue colors, (once in a blue moon having red as well) and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peacekeeping.html" title="Peacekeeping">peacekeepers</a> are uniformed in blue and white. "Bluecoat" (akin to "<a href="../../../r/e/d/Redcoat.html" title="Redcoat">redcoat</a>") refers to a uniformed police officer. Police in the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> changed the color of their uniforms from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green.html" title="Green">green</a> to blue in the late 1990s, partly to emphasize their civilian role.

<li>When the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> became independent from the Army in 1947, it inherited ultramarine blue as its distinctive color.</li>

<p>Blue often denotes injury, such as in the phrase "<b>black and blue</b>," since it is the color of a <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruise.html" title="Bruise">bruise</a>. Blue is used also as a word to denote a sad or melancholy state, as in <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression_%28mood%29.html" title="Depression (mood)">depression</a>, or simply a state of deep contemplation (however, the phrase "blue skies," referring to sunny weather, implies cheerfulness).

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Blue is often a color used to symbolize honesty and trustworthiness. Hence it is used by mortgage companies and banks, as well as the clothing of businesspeople.

<li>Although blue is traditionally associated with infant or baby boys as <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink.html" title="Pink">pink</a> is associated with infant/baby girls, there have also been periods in which pink was considered proper for boys and blue for girls, and times when no set color convention appears to have been in place. <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=238733" class="external autonumber" title="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=238733" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
