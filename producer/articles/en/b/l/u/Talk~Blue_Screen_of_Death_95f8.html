<p>The consumer versions of Windows have their own blue screen, but I've never seen the true Blue Screen of Death -- at least to my usage of the term. You get messages like 'The system is waiting for a program to complete, esc to continue or ctrl-alt-delete to reboot'. Generally the three fingered salute is the only effective way out, but one can gamely try the alternatives. Windows 3.1, if I recall correctly, would even do this for things like a floppy disk being ejected while a file was being accessed from the floppy. --<a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelltower_4989.html" title="User:Belltower">Belltower</a></p>
<p>Windows 98SE BSoD's on some occasions when reading off of removable media, ie cdrom and floppy, and the media is removed in the process, not very ammusing. --<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreaktop_dee0.html" title="User:Creaktop">Creaktop</a></p>

<p>As a reluctant Windows user (used to be a Mac user), I have seen what I always thought was called the blue screen of death far too many times--it's a common feature of all Windows systems, I thought. I've changed the article to reflect this. What I didn't know is that there are some people who restrict the usage only to the screen that occurs on Windows NT. Here's an example where programmers' usage and common usage might diverge, and where the article might usefully contain information about that divergence. Of course, I could just be confused. --<a href="../../../l/m/s/User%7ELMS_bc9d.html" title="User:LMS">LMS</a></p>
<p>It is a silly distinction. Even the folks at Microsoft on the Windows 95 team called their version "blue screen of death", though they knew it was somewhat different from the NT version. The public certainly calls all of the Windows blue-screens that. --LDC (Who actually understands the number on the real NT BSoD)</p>
<p>I have one right now, and I'm tempted to try to fix it myself, though it doesn't seem like just a boot error. This is on one of my other computers, as this works. But the BSOD does slow you down, and Windows makes it irritibly confusing on some parts on fixing it. - Narf</p>

<p>Uhh...hate to burst your bubble but the statement "The following is a re-creation of a Windows NT/2000/XP BSoD: " would be untrue because Windows XP does not have a BSOD, it is a more annoying dialog box which makes the problem even worse. <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_a09d.html" title="User:Ilyanep">Ilyanep</a> 18:52, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Windows XP, and all versions of NT have a BSOD. It looks different than their 95/98 counterparts. It is officially called a STOP error. Windows XP is stable enough such that many people never even see one. You only get a BSOD in XP if something REALLY goes wrong such that the system cannot proceed. You won't see one just because an application crashed.</dd>

They're called STOP errors, which is a new name for the same thing. But still, a BSoD pops up. However, this time all the RAM is dumped straight to the disk so you don't lose any work (yay!).

<dd>Typical Microsoft doublespeak... In Windows 3.0 program crashes were accompanied by screens that called them UAEs (Unrecoverable Application Errors).

<dd>I can report a very specific instance of BSoD on WinXP SP2. I installed a <a href="../../../d/-/l/D-Link_6034.html" title="D-Link">D-Link</a> GWL-G630 802.11g 54Mbps Wireless PCMCIA Cardbus. I missed the instructions and plugged the card before installing the shipped drivers. I did not have cable connection for two weeks and I was stealing connection from some other open-access Linksys Wireless router down the hall (It's an apartment). It was a very low signal strength - I could find a sweet spot in the room where I would get a medium signal strength, but after staying with it a while, whenever I moved the laptop a little so that it would move out of the middle strenght point, it would go BSoD. Basic system specs are Thinkpad T21 P3 800/256. SP2 with all security patches installed. Saw the BSoD five times over some 40 hours of use. (Two weeks of computer use). Then the cable guy arrived. --<a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonghokim_09ea.html" title="User:Yonghokim">Yonghokim</a> 5 July 2005 02:28 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Windows has a BSOD.. it's just not one you can get out of. Stop errors aren't BSOD's, they are just, stop errors. I would show the BSOD, but I would have to get a digital camera out to take a picture of it. There are BSOD's you guys. Driver failure is common, but then that would involve a boot error, one of which I don't have, it is something else, and I have no idea right now. - Narf</p>

<dd>No, WB is right. It has not been looking right for a while; since the upgrade to MediaWiki v1.5. It looks like the last edit changed it; but it didn't. It has been not right for a while now; it's because with MediaWiki v1.5 came more disabling of HTML you're not supposed to use like the stylesheets used in the &lt;pre&gt; tags. The removing of these arguments (arguments as in HTML use; in this case the stylesheets) didn't make a difference because MediaWiki v1.5 disabled it anyway. However the &lt;pre&gt; tags by themselves seem to still work. But someone should somehow get it looking right again properly, or maybe remove it?

<dd>I can only get the Win9x mockup to look right if I don't centre the 'Windows' line: apparently MediaWiki removes (partial?) styling on block level tags inside other block level tags.

<p>I know this is not the right place to ask for help regarding my BSoD but I am just trying my luck if someone among you, folks, may help. There are plenty of technical troubleshooting on the web (including on Microsoft website) on how to fix it but my case is a bit different.</p>
<p>It all started when I first upgraded from Windows ME to XP. After rebooting the system, I got the BSoD and never could recover it. The problem is that I can't access the BIOS in order to boot from a CD and try to install Linux instead and therefore get rid of Windows problems. The BIOS is protected by a password that I don't have! Maybe clearing the CMOS jumpers or reset the BIOS by removing the CMOS battery for a while would work?</p>
<p>If not, would I need a Operating Disk System from the manufacturer to boot from? Or maybe, the best idea is to sue Microsoft?</p>
<p>My email is Szvest@gmail.com in case you feel sorry for my case&#160;;). Cheers in advance. <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 20:21, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, that's not how this works. This is the discussion now. 'Keep' and 'Merge' are currently both on equal footing as a result of the AfD. This (and the subpages) are now the place to discuss this. There is no numerical requirement for how many users support/oppose either motion, nor do you get the final say in this. There is no 'statute of limitations' on merges.

<p>Would anyone care to summarize the arguments for and objections to merging these articles, preferably without directly addressing the opposition? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 23:50, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Here's my view of the argument: First of all, Wikipedia is not the place to be posting error reports. That's for the tech forums. The reason these articles deserve to be here at ALL is because of their inherent relation to the Blue Screen of Death (BSoD). The BSoD has become a cultural icon, having been seen by millions of users worldwide for almost a decade (the article goes in-depth about this, so I won't repeat what's already said). The reason we even have the names we do for these articles is because of their inherent similarity to the BSoD. On their own, there is very little to say about any of there. They're just bugs. Few people have actually seen the XB360SoD as of yet (and, since the system is still in development, it might stay that way), and NO ONE will ever see the RSoD (due to it's recent removal from Windows Vista pre-release). Therefore, we've got the textbook description of the perpetual stub here. Couple this with an ideal (and intuitive, for my money) place to merge to, and it seems cut and dry to me. I'd also like to state, however, that I make these remarks about the XB360SoD, the RSoD, and the B(lack)SoD, as these are the first two are the only ones that were being debated in the first place. Frankly, I question the validity of the YSoD and GSod articles at all, but that's another debate entirely. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 00:15, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I came here from the RFC. I agree that the other SoDs should be merged with BSoD for the reason InShanee outlined: the BSoD is a cultural icon and can easily be expanded to an interesting, encyclopedic article. However, I do not feel that the others have the same detail and they belong best as a subcategory of BSoD's article, with a redirect of course. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodfox_2c77.html" title="User:Todfox">Kit</a> 00:27, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>RSoD so far is not displayed as a kernel / OS error like the BSoD. As I understand a Windows Manager's <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1814654,00.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1814654,00.asp" rel="nofollow">response</a>, it is a missing boot file error (and potentially fixable). The Xbox 360SoD makes sense being with an xbox or console article on errors, if one exists. Fuzzyslob 06:43, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>We do not know enough about the RSoD to decide on the articles. Longhorn (I like this name) or rather Vista was NOT released yet, therefore we should wait. We also do not know whether Vista will have the BSoD as well as the RSoD. If it will crash a lot (like Windows usually does), it may need two different kinds of error screens to indicate it.<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreedom_to_share_b12c.html" title="User:Freedom to share">Freedom to share</a> 16:14, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>My reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li>The blue and red screens of death are all Windows-related critical computer errors. They should be in the same article, possibly with a color-neutral name, and redirects from both. An explanation of the difference of the two should be included, with references to Vista/Longhorn betas.</li>
<li>Nothing is a "screen of death" unless it causes a critical, usually unrecoverable, error in an operating system. Many of the others relate to non-critical, easily recoverable processing errors in application software. They are simply plays on the buzz-phrase "screen of death".</li>
<li>Application software error messages do not warrant their own articles. They should be at most a small section on the page about the program. The blue screen of death is a cultural phenomenon as much as it is a critical error message. It is akin to a kernel panic/guru meditation/sad mac page and IS worthy of an article.</li>
<li>Until the Xbox 2 error message becomes a cultural phenomenon, it does not warrant its own article.</li>

<p>Sorry I've been a bit inattentive, but it seems like this has died down a bit. With pretty much every interested party weighing in, here's my suggested resolution to this debate.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any argument that anything but the Blue screen of death is a significant cultural phenomenon in its own right. The closest thing would be the RSoD being anxiously scarfed up by people desparate for Vista news, and the 360SoD likewise, but for Xbox 360 news.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_screen_of_death.html" title="Red screen of death">Red screen of death</a> is merged and redirected to BSoD, as RSoD is a red BSoD. Likewise, as the RSoD is only present in an alpha version of Vista, that article is not likely to expand past its current size.</li>
<li><a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360_screen_of_death.html" title="Xbox 360 screen of death">Xbox 360 screen of death</a> should be merged and redirected to <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360.html" title="Xbox 360">Xbox 360</a>, with a brief mention and link in this article. Crashing X360s is not (yet) a cultural phenomenon. Please note that we do not (and should not!) have a separate article about the PlayStation 2's disk read errors, and they have been and likely will be covered and discussed much more than the 360SoD has been or will be.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_screen_of_death.html" title="Green screen of death">Green screen of death</a> should definitely be merged to <a href="../../../t/i/v/TiVo_95d2.html" title="TiVo">TiVo</a>. It will never expand beyond a stub.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_screen_of_death.html" title="Black screen of death">Black screen of death</a> is a tough case. It's about two different system errors on two separate OSes. As such, I suggest its content about DOS crashes in Windows be merged into BSoD, its content about OS/2 crashes be merged into <a href="../../../o/s/2F/OS_2_4b39.html" title="OS/2">OS/2</a>, and that <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_screen_of_death.html" title="Black screen of death">Black screen of death</a> should be made into a disambig among <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_screen_of_death.html" title="Blue screen of death">Blue screen of death</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/2F/OS_2_4b39.html" title="OS/2">OS/2</a>, and <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360.html" title="Xbox 360">Xbox 360</a>.</li>

I also think that as Windows Vista will come out, more will be kown to the public about the RSoD.</li>
<li>RSOD so far seems to be a variation on BSoD; I say merge it. Keep the Black SoD a separate article. X360SoD seems to ahve already been resolved. Merge YSoD into Mozilla and link as "See Also" from BSoD. The others should stay articles.

<li>I think this is a good idea, but according to the Vista article, the RSoD was dropped in the 5112 build of Vista. Of course it is still speculative to know for sure what color the final screen of death will be. Maybe it should be merged with the Vista in a section about beta Longhorn builds. The rest of the points I agree with completely.--Nbody 21:33, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The blue screen of death is the only widely known screen of death, and the only one likely to be significant as an article by itself. I believe that most users looking up a screen of death, other than the BSOD, would most likely be looking out of curiosity about colored screens of death in general. If that is true, then the best thing to do would be to create a single article "Colored screens of death", and have each existing article redirect to its part in the main article. Few SOD's would make an article by themselves, but all of them together could constitute a decent article. What are you're opinions? --<a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenb215_75c5.html" title="User:Kenb215">kenb215</a> 01:48, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now that this article has actual images of BSoDs, I don't think the text recreations are needed anymore.

<dd>I agree with both of you. However, what this article truly needs is at least one indication that "BSOD" while a very common term is by no means an official term and therefore is not endorsed by Microsoft. It is in fact somewhat of an "attack" on Microsoft. The fact that this is not clarified give the article a bias. It is by no means neutral. Whomever first coined the term was most certainly unhappy with Windows.</dd>

<p>Although I didn't place it on there, it does kind of seem like it isn't very neutral. Would you really see an article called Blue Screen of Death in a real encyclopedia? In any case, it's most referred to as this, and people seeking information on it will probably type in Blue Screen of Death or BSoD. Robot Chicken 20:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This event could not go unmentioned! So I added it to the article. One thing though... If you look closely at the video, the BSoD seems to float in from the side rather than simply popping onto the screen. Furthermore, when the BSoD appears there are still some icons at the bottom, i.e. the BSoD does not cover the whole screen. I've never seen or heard of the BSoD exhibiting these behaviours. Of course they might be an artifact of the ancient Litepro they were using at the time; although I'm inclined to think the whole event was a gag (known to Gates, or not.) Anybody heard anything?

<p><i>"The Blue Screen of Death (sometimes called "bluescreen", "stop error" or just abbreviated as "BSoD") is a popular name for the screen displayed by Microsoft's Windows operating system when it cannot recover from, or is in danger of being unable to recover from, a system error."</i> The only difference consists in the fact that this particular BSoD is not very useful to treat the problem that just occured. Well, unless you can read binary (which I think the output on there is), in which case it might be vital.

<dd>Sorry Guys, but this is NOT a blue screen of death. The color does not mean anything in that case. We refer to Blue Screen of Death as a *controlled* way of stopping the system when something non-recoverable goes wrong. It is -in WinNT systems- made to ensure that no more data can get harmed at this point, other than in Win9x where it actually is able to continue but without any guarantee. In both cases system info is displayed in human readable form (i.e. english). The Win1.0 "blue screen" is a coincidence because the boot logo screen was with a blue background, nothing more! The data on the screen is not a controlled output such like a BSoD on NT or 9x systems. Lofote 19:34, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When going here, I saw that the BSoD for Win 9x is only in the form of a textual link, no actual blue background or anything. I tried editting the page to try and fix this, but it doesn't seem to work no matter what I throw at it. All others load just fine. Refreshing the page didn't work and trying several variants didn't work. I'm not sure if this is my browser causing this (Firefox 1.5.0.6), or if there's something wrong not on my end. If I click the text-only link, it loads just fine and I can see it that way, but it doesn't appear at all on the main document. Ulillillia 09:58, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If we are going to talk about red then someone needs to write more about the green screen error on windows. I have seen this myself twice in 3 years of work with windows XP machines. It's much less common than blue errors like UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME but someone should substantiate it more. I added in what I know but someone should clean it up.</p>

<p>No trace on Google. (Searched for "Green Screen XP -site:wikipedia.org"). Original had a link to a Photoshopped image as an example. You decide if it should be added on again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A green screen error also occurs in Windows XP much less frequently than a blue screen error (about 1% as common). This error seems to be a high level kernel panic of some sort. It is fixable with a destructive reinstallation of windows.</p>

<p>Alright, thank you for being formal about it. All I know is that I have seen the green screen kernal panic and so have at least two of my associates who work at a computer technical helpdesk on this college campus. Over two and one half years I have seen two instances of it vs about 100 or 200 blue screen manifestations. Since it is so uncommon perhaps it doesn't even deserve to be put in the article anyways, but someone should really contact Microsoft technical support and i'm certain if you spoke with a high level tech(probably not the front line flunkies) then you would hear something intereting about the error.</p>

<p>The article says in the red screen section that the screen can also be found (but rarely) in versions of Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system. If that screen exist, is it similar to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mangee/41523592/" class="external text" title="http://flickr.com/photos/mangee/41523592/" rel="nofollow">following screen</a> that have black text and red background? --COstop 22:19, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my many, many years of repairing Windows based PC's, I've only encountered the Windows 98 "red screen of death" twice in my life. I can't recall if it's similar to that screen or if it was a red background with white text, but it sure as heck shocked everyone in the room. Both times I encountered it was after replacing an older motherboard with a newer ACPI motherboard. 24.36.153.235 21:27, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. Red Screens of Death in Windows 98 were ACPI-specific errors. <a href="../../../s/n/i/User%7ESnickerdo_538d.html" title="User:Snickerdo">Snickerdo</a> 08:26, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recieved a red screen in Windows XP Oct, 19th 2006 1:28am repeatedly after nv4disp.dll became damaged and was causing my video card to enter infinite loops.</p>
<p>driver reinstalled fixed it, but I don't see the red screen mentioned for XP, it is definitely there.70.13.185.196</p>

<p>Um... it's a big computer with a giant screen that happens to be blue. No writing on it, either, as far as I can remember.

<dd>The BSOD has existed in versions of Windows prior to 95, though you are correct that 1988 would be a bit too early. Mind you, am I the only one who fondly remembers hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL from a DOS program in Windows 3.1 and being given the option to kill the task by hitting Enter?
