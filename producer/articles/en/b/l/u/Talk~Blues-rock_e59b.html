<dl>
<dd>Yeah. Country rock is a <b>lot</b> more country. Gram Parsons is country rock, Lynryd Skynyrd are Southern rock. They don't sound all that similar. Naturally there's a crossover&#160;: <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Feat_096b.html" title="Little Feat">Little Feat</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_Cody_dc13.html" title="Commander Cody">Commander Cody</a> et al. Country rock tends to be song and vocal based -- country songs with a rockier arrangement, Southern Rock are mainly rock songs with a countrified arrangement and harmony. Southern rock thinks nothing of filling entire sides of a double album with instrumental jams (Hey, the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allman_Brothers_Band_ab0f.html" title="Allman Brothers Band">Allman Brothers Band</a>, this means YOU!)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Southern Rock is arguably a fusion of country rock with <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues_rock.html" title="Blues rock">blues rock</a>, with a lyrical emphasis on Southern culture. Of course, all three subgenres are diverse and tend to overlap. Heck, the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Tucker_Band_3c3d.html" title="Marshall Tucker Band">Marshall Tucker Band</a> was countrier than most of what gets played on country radio these days. Just my 2Â¢. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_35bb.html" title="User:Archola">Archola</a> 01:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, whoever is deleting ACDC and John Mayer doesn't know what article they're editing. ACDC are known as being pioneers of Blues Rock, certainly far greater influences than bands such as the Rolling Stones, who're a rock n roll band who've dabbled in it.</p>
<p>In the same breath as I mention that, John Mayer has been removed from the listing. Now, all three of his studio albums have been intrinsically blues-rock based, with influences deriving from pop, country, ska and folk, but (arguably) every song he's ever written has been blues-rock, or just plain blues if not.</p>
<p>I'm putting both of them back in tehre, because there's no reason to delete them. Plus if it's taken out again, I'll remove The Rolling Stones. They don't even belong on this page, really, as they certainly didn't pioneer anything in this arena (as is suggested).</p>

<dd>How about providing sources for those claims? I'm not going to argue about the actual music, because that would violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, but according to <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:68q2g4k9tv6z~T1" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:68q2g4k9tv6z~T1" rel="nofollow">allmusic.com</a>, John Mayer is nowhere near blues-rock, and from what I've heard from other sources, only his most recent album is very close to the blues tradition. The rest of his music is acoustic pop-rock. It would be like calling Bob Dylan blues-rock, just because his most recent album fits into the genre. You're missing the point of the list if you think that listing "blues-rock based" artists is the objective; the point is to list straight-ahead blues-rock artists in order to give the reader an better idea of the sound.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for AC/DC, I can't recall one of their songs which follows a 12-bar blues. For god's sake, they play mostly <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_chord.html" title="Power chord">power chords</a>. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:axk0ikx6bb89" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:axk0ikx6bb89" rel="nofollow">The Allmusic guide</a> would seem to support this argument, not including them in the genre, while the <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifoxqr5ldje~T1" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:aifoxqr5ldje~T1" rel="nofollow">Rolling Stones</a> are described as blues-rock. Personally, I can think of several Stones songs which follow a 12-bar blues, such as Carol.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, I am going to revert the article back. If you have better sources than Allmusic, feel free to post them here, but otherwise, please do not engage in an edit war.

<dd>I did keep John Mayer as an example of a contemporary artist, though, as his recent work does represent the genre well. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_Esperanza_ee71.html" title="User:Cielomobile/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 06:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, well we seem to be at an impasse. I personally consider Allmusic to be run by a bunch of hacks (who're swayed by the glint of a little green) and would sooner respect the reviews from <a href="../../../s/p/u/Sputnik_music.html" title="Sputnik music">sputnik music</a> but generally, my overall preference is to follow Rolling Stone and reputable newspaper music reviewers. Anyway, with relation to AC/DC, I believe they belong in the list as their involvement is to contribute the heavier side of blues-rock with blues riffs and licks being implemented at every turn, being much of the reason that they're - like Aerosmith - somewhat outcast in contrast to other heavy rock groups of their same era, such as Alice Cooper or Black Sabbath, who're primarily rock based and have no blues infusions or influences. Again, this I admit is subject to much discernement.</dd>

<dd>Actually, I <i>agree</i> with the removal of AC/DC. Sure, they might be blues rock, but they're more hard rock than anything; I'd say they're more representative of the <i>latter</i>, and not the former. Just like the HTML comments above the list say, not to add any old band. Isn't rock rooted in the blues, anyway? You can hear the influence even in Metallica's <a href="../../../l/o/a/Load_%28album%29.html" title="Load (album)">Load</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/ReLoad_%28album%29_4a59.html" title="ReLoad (album)">ReLoad</a> albums, which are a lot more closer to AC/DC; but you wouldn't list Metallica here. Even I can see AC/DC's the odd-one-out in that list. --Dayn 06:28, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Precisely why I keep removing them. While some of their music may fit into the genre of blues-rock, they really are more of a hard rock band. I can't even think of one of their songs of which the chord structure resembles a twelve-bar blues. While this is not the sole criterion for blues-rock, it's an important one. Imagine some kid wonders what blues-rock is, sees AC/DC, a well-known group, and immediately associates the genre with them. They're not really indicative of the genre, so listing them would be misleading. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_Esperanza_ee71.html" title="User:Cielomobile/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 06:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

A couple of artists I haven't heard of give me an idea as well... so I think the current list works well, covers a wide area for a lot of eventualities.

The bands are lesser known which gives people an option to listening to the most common and well-known blues-rock bands, and also give bands online exposure on wikipedia in which can be helpful in revitalizing interest in the band itself. thanks. user:Typicalhyjink101</dd>

<dd>I should bring to your attention that adding things simply for exposure is pretty much a no-no, as it equates to advertisement. --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDayn_6af1.html" title="User:Dayn">Dane</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDayn_e931.html" title="User talk:Dayn">~nya</a></sup> 02:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To reiterate what Dayn said, it is highly frowned upon to use Wikipedia to advertise, see <a href="../../../a/d/v/WP%7EADVERT_0952.html" title="WP:ADVERT">WP:ADVERT</a>. I know that many of the bands you added are definite blues-rock bands, but this list needs to remain short and concise. Its purpose is to provide people who are not familiar with blues-rock with a short, exact, and easily identifiable list of artists that fit the genre. I am fairly familiar with the genre, and I haven't even heard of some of the groups you added. If you can present valid reasons to include some of the artists, I'd be happy to have a few of them back on the list, but otherwise, I think it should remain as is. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 03:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Happy Valentines day to you for tomorrow as well. Why do you think each band deserves to be on the sample list, apart from exposure? Are they drastically different enough to warrant inclusion, for an overview of what blues rock is all about? --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDayn_6af1.html" title="User:Dayn">Dane</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDayn_e931.html" title="User talk:Dayn">~nya</a></sup> 05:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why the fuck are there no desciptive resons as to why all the other bands are on the list. My whole point in the first place was to add bands in which are blues rock which fit in the specific genre. If you want a reason as to why I added these bands then make all the others reasons visible for all the bands and just not make me right a reason for all the bands when I only see a few reasons for the present bands present. Groups like Steamhammer and the Black Crowes give people who wouldnt know blues rock a good example of blues rock. Why is there such a tough standard on the amount of bands which can be on this list, unlike the prog-rock and southern rock page when there is seemingly no limit. Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman brothers should be in the southern rock section and bands like Juicy Lucy and Cactus would be a clearer projection of the style blues rock truly represnts and has represented this century. What the fuck just make sense with your authority. Also why cant there by a seperate page where there can be an extended list if blues rock bands in which can be found of many other music genre type pages. Also how can someone tell me certain bands dont belong when you have not heard them. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Typicalhyjink101 (<a href="../../../t/y/p/User_talk%7ETypicalhyjink101_c91c.html" title="User talk:Typicalhyjink101">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Typicalhyjink101_59e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Typicalhyjink101">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>First, calm down, or we won't be going anywhere. It's only a list, don't get worked up about it. Second, the list itself says a "sample" list, not a complete list. The present bands already added give a good sample list of well known bands; the catch here is <i>well known</i>, so people who come here and learn about blues rock can <i>easily</i> identify it. If you add obscure bands, how on earth will they know what it sounds like?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is just a sample list, and really, those other pages should trim down as well; I have no doubt there's some non-notable bands in there. Okay, you mention Steamhammer and the Black Crowes. Do they offer anything different, than those already listed? If they don't, leave them off; if they do, can you explain how they enhance the list, instead of just adding to it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And it's not "my authority" or "Cielomobile's authority", or "anyone's authority". Wikipedia works by people discussing changes, and establishing consensus. So there is no authority other than the policies, and majority doesn't rule; value of an argument in a discussion is imperative to making it work. And personally, I don't believe there should be separate articles for lists at <i>all</i>, for <i>anything</i> unless it's a short sample on an article, with links to categories down the bottom. Sure, I maintain many of them, but I would rather them all eliminated in favour of categories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I can't remove bands just willy-nilly; it would need to be discussed first, if anyone wants changes to the current revision. But to answer your question about how I can say they don't belong if I haven't heard them? Well that's just it. Why list obscure bands no-one has heard of, if it's meant to be a sample of the blues rock sound?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So can you please answer how adding them to the list will enhance it for the purpose of recognising the sound of blues-rock? It wouldn't have come to these large blocks of text with arguments, if changes were discussed first, so let's get to it. And remember to sign your posts with four tildes (~) please. --<a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDayn_6af1.html" title="User:Dayn">Dane</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDayn_e931.html" title="User talk:Dayn">~nya</a></sup> 05:55, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I second what Dayn has said here. The lists on the other articles contain too many groups, and they should probably be changed at some point. Categories are much better than lists, so if you want to create a category for blues-rock artists ( for example), go ahead and do so. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 06:10, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to have a meaningful discourse, it would bode you well not use such vulgar language and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">not to attack us</a>. Anyway, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Black_Crowes_7494.html" title="The Black Crowes">The Black Crowes</a> aren't even described as "blues-rock" at allmusic.com, and after listening to some music samples from the iTunes music store, it seems to me that they are more of a hard-rock band than a blues-rock band. I can't say much about <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steamhammer_%28band%29.html" title="Steamhammer (band)">Steamhammer</a>, but their Wikipedia article is short, and they don't have any music on iTunes, so I see little reason for their inclusion. If you want to make a seperate article for blues-rock artists, that's fine, but don't marr this article with bands that either not relatively well-known or don't represent the genre to a point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you need to provide sources for your claims that a lot of these groups are blues-rock. I suggest allmusic.com; it is a pretty reliable source. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 06:08, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
