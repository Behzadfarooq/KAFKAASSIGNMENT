<p><b>Filiocht</b> [Reponse to Filiocht's argument on the Voltaire discussion page] First off, it is not a chat room. I will ask you to refrain from using "chat room" as it is deragatory in this context. My debates are informal, ongoing debates on specific points of Voltaires's philosophy. We are not "chatting".</p>
<p>Second, I looked over the Wikipedia guildlines and found no mention of debate sites being rejected as anti-Wikipedia, so it becomes your job to prove 1) that my debate site lacks content on Voltaire and his philosophy, 2) my site is commercial (which it is not), 3) my site is for self-promotion, not the promotion of Voltaire's philosophy 4) that I am the only participant in my debates.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, my site is NOT SPAM; it is content rich and on topic. Please make your counter-argument.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Noisy</b></p>
<p><b>Independently, I have removed your link from Adam Smith. I'm afraid this doesn't fit in Wikipedia.</b></p>
<p>Masta! Masta! You think my website does not fit Wikipedia? Please explain why.</p>
<p><b>I see that your additions had been characterised as spam by another user.</b> That user does not know what spam is. Spam is commercial and off-topic.</p>
<p><b>It seems that you have a great interest in philosophy,</b></p>
<p>Flattery will not win this battle.</p>
<p><b>but directing people to debate issues with you does not really add to the goals of Wikipedia.</b></p>
<p>Are you suggesting that people are not interested in debating Karl Marx? In case you didn't know, Wiki is becoming an encyclopedia, dictionary, and online directory all rolled into one.</p>
<p><b>We would welcome your additions to the construction of articles within Wikipedia in the future, but adding external links is one of the lesser benefits.</b></p>
<p>There is no "we". Wikipedia is not a democracy. Therefore, as long as you intend to make facile arguments as to why my debates should not be included, you can consider my actions a Wikifilibuster.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Please refrain from adding multiple links that direct people away from Wikipedia for discussions on philosophy.</b></p>
<p>Sophistry. I am not "drawing" anyone away from Wikipedia. Surfers clicking on my link would be those interested in debating Marx. They would <i>choose</i> to click the link if they are interested in debating Karl Marx's philosophy - something philosophy dearly needs presently. Why are you barring people from discussing philosophy?</p>
<p><b>Also, please note that your edit to Karl Marx was immediately after some vandalism, which it would have been very helpful if you had corrected. Your intervening edits could well have prevented this vandalism from being spotted quickly.</b></p>
<p>My turn to lecture: If you were not so lazy you would not have to use sophistry to make you argument. That Marx's entry was "vandalized" is irrelevant to this discussion. You are simply trying to confuse the issue.</p>
<p><b>We would welcome positive additions to articles, but you must see that your additions – particularly when they are widely distributed – could easily be interpreted as spam.</b> How can my debates be considered spam if they are high-quality, non-commercial, and clicked by CHOICE? Only those not interested in debate would consider my links useless.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that you think you are being picked on: that is not the case. Wikipedia is a mass of rules, policies, guidance and whatnot (see <a href="../../../u/t/i/Wikipedia%7EUtilities_d04f.html" title="Wikipedia:Utilities">Wikipedia:Utilities</a> for just a partial list). I suppose that we should have <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wikipedia%7EWriters_rules_of_engagement_cc4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Writers rules of engagement">asked</a> you to revert the additions yourself, after offering our arguments, but when the first contributions by a new editor look like link spamming then the old vandal patrol mentality kicks in.</p>
<p>Please consider <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#What_should_not_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links#What should not be linked to</a> and try and look at it from the other side. In the harshest terms, it appears that all you are trying to do is drum up traffic for your own site by leeching off Wikipedia. If you had added a single link to the philosophy article, then that may have been (and may still be) considered acceptable.</p>
<p>I'm pleased that you think that I am clever enough to use sophistry, but sad that you entirely missed the invitation to step right into the fray and start looking out for vandalism yourself. Please have a look around: do some experimentation in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a>; work through the <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Wikipedia:Tutorial</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Wikipedia%7EAnnotated_article_85eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Annotated article">Wikipedia:Annotated article</a>.

<dd>"No thank you. I am quite comfortable editing." Failure to make use of the 'Show preview' button and misuse of Wikicode shows that you still have a lot to learn. I'd say that over 90% of the regular contributors would offer some help, but arrogance such as that does test the injunction to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>.</dd>

<dd>P.S. I looked up <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophism.html" title="Sophism">sophism</a>, and apparently a sophist is someone who gives "wisdom from knowledge".

Doesn't the fact that you've encountered universally negative reaction give you food for thought? <a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoisy_bc7b.html" title="User:Noisy">Noisy</a> | <a href="../../../n/o/i/User_talk%7ENoisy_7db1.html" title="User talk:Noisy">Talk</a> 14:35, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe OK to add "1. For albums, movies, books: one or two links to professional reviews which express some sort of general sentiment. For films, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic offer collections of reviews. 2. Web directories: When deemed appropriate by those contributing to an article on Wikipedia, a link to one web directory listing can be added, with preference to open directories (if two are comparable and only one is open). If deemed unnecessary, or if no good directory listing exists, one should not be included. 3. Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link."</p>
<p><br />
The Karl Marx entry is about Marx and his philosophy; therefore, readers should be directed to forums where they can discuss Marx's philosophy. <i>Discussing philosophy is intergral to philosophy</i>. The dominance of the paper encyclopedia is finished. No longer do we need limit entries to anti-dynamic entries. Forums where Marx can be discussed are crucial to the continued importance of Marx in intellectual life. Please refrain from deleting these links in the future, though I do invite you do judge each forum's quality.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Blueskyboris, please cease to put up links to forums on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> that are not specifically about Karl Marx. The quality of the forum is irrelevant to the fact that, first, linking to forums is <i>highly discouraged</i> on Wikipedia because this is not a web directory, and second, none of the three sites you have linked to are specifically about Karl Marx. Please stop adding links to outside sites which do not pertain directly to the subject of the article. <a href="../../../d/i/d/User%7EDiderot_346d.html" title="User:Diderot">Diderot</a> 12:40, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Blueskyboris. I wish to bring to your attention some of my concerns regarding your continued insertion of inappropriate external links into the Karl Marx article. If you don't mind I'll briefly list and sum up my thoughts with respects to each:</p>
<p>1. Communist Party of Canada — not topical to 'Karl Marx' in general, it belongs on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Canada_8370.html" title="Communist Party of Canada">Communist Party of Canada</a> (same for similar party specific forums).</p>
<p>2. Internet Infidels — how is this related to karl Marx? Internet Infidels are, of course, linked (topically) on <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">Agnosticism</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a>, etc.</p>
<p>3. Philosophy Forums — this, too, make little sense. It is about <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> in general, not Karl Marx specifically.</p>
<p>How do you account for this? Do these not occur to you as being out of place due to the reasons I cite above? Thanks for taking the time to read this. And a belated welcome to Wikipedia from yours truly, <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 13:16, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am afraid I am not satisfied with your response, which cited text not pertinent to the points I made above, and then proceeded to speak in vague generalities on freedom of speech and debate, also unrelated to the issue of topicality. Now, why single Marx? What about the many other philosphers, will that forum be inserted into these, too. I urge you to be more selective, and I'm sorry to say whenever I see these forums added to the Karl Marx article, I will revert on sight. I sincerely hope, then, that you will consider closely what I have said and try to approach the situation constructively and sensibly. Thanks again for reading. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 13:54, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
