<p>any? only seems to support bluray over hddvd. one i can think of is "vendor lock-in" potentials with blueray. obviously this applies to hddvd as well, but it is a reasonable point. pricing perhaps as well?</p>

<p>Why should Blu-Ray have capacities listed which currently are unavailable? Isn't that exagerrating the truth? Sure next year there might be 100 GB Blu-Ray discs, but they aren't available yet. That's like listing Notebook Harddrive capacity is 300 GBs, there are none available on the market, but it might be available next year. ~Michael</p>
<dl>
<dd>Either way, they will be on the market soon enough.Mbslrm 02:41, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do you know that? It took Sony a year to work out all of the kinks in the two layer BD. Now it looks like Sony is just grandstanding, overpromising and underdelivering like they usually do. ~Michael</p>

<dd>I agree with 70.251.197.67 (sign your posts, by the way) that listing unavailable capacities is inappropriate. I thought I had successfully purged both Blu-Ray and HD DVD of this speculative stuff. But it looks like 70.251.197.67 violated his own rule in this "in the future" edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HD_DVD&amp;diff=95825309&amp;oldid=95797384" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HD_DVD&amp;diff=95825309&amp;oldid=95797384" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> to <a href="../../../h/d/_/HD_DVD_5cc6.html" title="HD DVD">HD DVD</a>.

<dd>Try to put your personal problems with Sony aside and ask yourself why you think they'd be the only ones in a position to (not) deliver those higher capacities. If you had even slightly researched the topic you'd see that TDK is the furthest along with research into those higher capacities, having already developed an experimental Blu-ray Disc capable of holding 200 GB. --<a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKamasutra_0819.html" title="User:Kamasutra">Kamasutra</a> 05:41, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fingered if the Blu-Ray people weren't going to remove the "future" capacities that the "future" capacities for HD DVD should of been added. I didn't want to edit the Blu-Ray one because some one would probably just revert it. And yes I should get a user name so people don't have to refer to me as my ip address, lol. Maybe in that intro box it should be divided up into separate sections. One titled Current Blu-Ray/HD DVD capacity and one titled Possible future Blu-Ray/HD DVD capacity. Since the HD DVD had the triple layer 45 GB removed I decided to remove the future capacities for blu-ray. I hope it doesn't get reverted ~Michael</p>
<p>Either leave the triple layer capacity for HD DVD up, or leave the future capacities for Blu-Ray down ~Mike</p>

<p>SMALLER discs please please somebody SMALLER discs. Remember, mini versions of formats are always very limited in available content. Nice try Sony but the "Universal" Media Disc is a joke.</p>
<ul>
<li>Um, not here in Japan, as they remain a profitable, if niche, product line. And besides, UMD discs are just small DVDs, just as the CD single size standard in Japan until a few years ago was just a small CD... Similarily Sony is sure to make identically sized small Blu-Ray discs, which would be more than adequate to hold a movie and could be used in more portable players, etc. Theoretically existing memory cards, very small, could contain massive amounts of data, even an entire movie, and be played in existing PSPs, digital media players, etc, and be sold as stand-alone media titles should the price to produce them drop.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that as long as discs remain incredibly convenient and portable, as the standard CD is, the focus should be much more heavily placed on cost, reliability, capacity, and backwards compatibility. The last one is especially important, especially when looking at DVD play as a major factor in the game industry wars between the PS2, XBox, and Gamecube. The Gamecube's size never resulted in increased market share and only served to hinder its possibilities. I predict that as the next generation of consoles are released along with the release of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD players, the sides chosen by the gaming companies show the importance of incorporating certain formats. The fact that Nintendo will abandon its smaller disc format should show you that it is less attractive to the manufacturer as well as the consumer, and this can be seen as a microcosm for the digital media industry as a whole. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoove_K_10a2.html" title="User:Smoove K">Smoove K</a> 01:12, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would appreciate if the anonymous 130.233.16.105, who according to his user page specializes on 'crisp bread', would stop vandalizing my text regarding the obsoleteness of the Blu-Ray format. Sony and Philips finalized the DVR (now called Blu-ray) format in 1995-1996, which means it is 10 years old, and there is no other conclusion than that Blu-Ray's format, modulation code, error correction code, filing system etc, is obsolete. Dsc 06:22, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would appreciate it if you had any documents or papers from 1995-1996 proving the existence of the final format back then and showing its design considerations (what it's "optimized" for) and its relation to what is currently being pushed forward under the "Blu-ray" name. I also question your analysis about Sony and Philips' intentions and in what part they were motivated by DVD licensing income. FWIW, the earliest mentions I can find about "DVR-Blue" are from late 2000, which was still in design phase at that time.</dd>
<dd>I don't deny that design on the format wasn't started when DVD was finalized in 1996, but that alone doesn't make the format ten-year-old.</dd>

<p>You are right: you also contributed to the Mickey Mouse article. By the way, there is a 1998 article by Philips/Sony employees on the DVR format (now BluRay), namely <em>Optical disc system for digital video recording</em>, T. Narahara, S. Kobayashi, M. Hattori, Y. Shimpuku, Sony Corp. (Japan); G. van den Enden, J. A. Kahlman, M. van Dijk, R. van Woudenberg, Philips Research Labs. (Netherlands) ODS Conference, July 1999 <a href="http://jjap.ipap.jp/link?JJAP/39/912/" class="external autonumber" title="http://jjap.ipap.jp/link?JJAP/39/912/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Note the remark on the year 1995 that "the parity preserve principle was first introduced by us in: J. Kahlman and K.A.S. Immink: U.S. Patent 5,477,222 (1995), where the principle was applied in a (d=1, k=8) RLL code." Also patent applications by Philips/Sony employees can easily be found to be first filed in 1997, see for example J.A.H. Kahlman, K.A. Schouhamer Immink, G. van den Enden, T. Nakagawa, Y. Shimpuku, T. Narahara, and K. Nakamura, 'Device for encoding/decoding n-bit source words into m-bit channel word, and vice versa', US Patent 6,225,921, May 2001, first filed in Oct. 1997. And probably invented and tested in 1996. Dsc 06:23, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Very well. I can accept the reasoning to the extent that the physical format was finalized by 1999 (definitely not 1995-1996 as it is currently in the article) except for the transition to blue laser (by which time it was called DVR-Blue, for example at ISOM 2000<a href="http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=4922" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=4922" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), and that it is based on modulation and error correcting codes invented in 1995 and 1996. I don't think that still lets you claim that the format is "obsolete" (and the "some consider" way of putting it is fairly unencyclopedic since that way you can "find" support for just about any opinion). Anyway, the actual Blu-ray physical format, as it first appeared in the market in early 2003, wasn't finalized in that form before 2001. And the innards are still not fully finalized, as we all know..</dd>
<dd>Additionally, you did not provide any information supporting your claim about it being designed specifically for use in DV camcorders as a replacement to magnetic media. The article you linked repeatedly mentions it being designed for digital video recording (where, unsurprisingly, the name DVR comes from too), that is, recording HDTV signals in homes on rewritable discs. The editing of DV is mentioned, but the way I remember it was that it would allow editing and re-recording of DV streams with a tabletop device, with the DV streams being initially recorded on a magnetic media as usual.</dd>
<dd>The history&amp;background section still needs clarification as to exactly what parts of the format are old (modulation &amp; ecc), removal of the claim that the entire format is that old, adjustment of the claim about its design considerations, and show its design path (dvr (9 GB rewritable disc with red laser) to dvr-blue (22 GB rewritable disc with blue laser) to blu-ray (25 or 50 GB ROM/R/RW disc)) clearer, and information about what parts specifically are a hindrance to mass replication (more than just the thinner cover layer?). 130.233.16.105 12:42, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My dearest anonymous User:130.233.16.105, I just presented the requested literature and patents that clearly prove that Blu-Ray's physical layer was designed around 1995-96, just a few months after DVD's unification (Sept. 1995, after IBM's Lou Gerstner persuaded the electronics industry to accept EFMPlus). The 1995 DVR physical format, inclusive of 17PP channel code and 'picket' ECC code, address formats, wobble, headers, block structures, is exactly the same as that of Blu-Ray, and was never seriously modified. So I do not understand why you state that it was finalized in 1999 and updated in 2001. Please let me know what was finalized/changed in 2001? May be you can also explain why a physical layer technology designed around 1995 is not obsolete? Just think of Windows 95. No new insights since 1995? Higher efficiencies? May be User:130.233.16.105 also thinks that the 1979 CD format or 1985 CD-ROM format are not obsolete? Come on.</p>
<p>I have the impression that User:130.233.16.105 did not read the mentioned ODS2000 article. The authors of that article clearly state in the first sentence of Section 2 that their DVR format is intended for use in 'a' optical disc based digital video <em>recorder</em> . The authors fully explain the various design considerations, including address formats, wobble, headers, block structures etc, which were all designed in 1995-1996. They also explain which special measures had to be taken to construct a home recorder plus format requirements. I believe that someone with a normal skill in the art can understand that the designer of such a disk format has to trade various conflicting parameters, and when you opimize for home recording you cannot optimize for replication. Thus, I suggest that before User:130.233.16.105 vandalizes my texts again, that he/she studies the ODS article and tries to understand its implications, and tries to understand why it can be stated that Blu-Ray’s physical format is obsolete.</p>
<p>Therefore, I firmly conclude that, unless someone proves that Blu-Ray's physical format is not obsolete, i.e. no new insights/technologies were unveiled or added since 1995, the term 'obsoleteness' will be included again in the article. Dsc 15:30, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did read the article, thank you very much.</dd>

<dd>Labeling the system "obsolete" is POV (see the three points at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_Weight" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view#Undue_Weight" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - you're the first I've seen to make such conclusions about the format). While I don't dispute the facts (the origins of the physical format), Wikipedia is still not a vehicle for original research<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (that is, conclusions made by *you* unless there is wide support for such view in literature). Obsolete also implies that it already has a reasonable replacement in the market, which it doesn't. Of course better optical disc formats are introduced every year in research literature, but that doesn't make the current ones obsolete from the market's point of view. The articles about CD and DVD don't mention them being obsolete though they are based on even older technologies, so I guess you should go change them too.</dd>
<dd>I propose the following wording: "From a technological point of view, the physical format of Blu-ray can be considered outdated since it is based on modulation and error correction codes invented in 1995 and 1996". I don't completely agree with this though; I think it should just state the facts about the format's origin and leave the "outdated" or "obsolete" conclusion to the reader to make.</dd>
<dd>As for mass replication, I still question what in the physical format is an inherent hindrance to mass replication. Yes, there's the difference in the thickness of the cover layer, and the Durabis hard coating technology. I however can't see these as being inherently problematic for mass replication, merely as something that requires changes in production lines. If there's something else, please specify what.</dd>
<dd>With the word "finalization" I mean that there is a specification for the entire system (physical format *and* the data organization on the disc (that is: file systems, codecs, software)) available. Certainly there may have been working prototypes of the bare physical disc in 1999, but that alone does not a complete optical disc system make.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, I still do not see how you make the jump from the much-talked digital video recording (like a VHS, or a DVD recorder) to camcorders (video cameras). 130.233.16.105 18:50, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wulf, you are very quick with your conclusions and reverts. The loss of the DVD battle by Sony et al., leading to a) a small part of the royalty income and b) small influence in the DVD Forum, is essential to understand the history of Blu-ray, and must be part of the article. BD design started immediately after the conclusion of DVD in 1995-96. Since the engineers started so early and the standard was fixed, there was no opportunity to add new ideas to the format, and BD is therefore old-fashioned just like Windows95. This is not a POV, but a basic fact that can be checked (see above). So I am sorry but I will revert your reverts again. Dsc 07:02, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that interesting, and with some effort tangible, sections of the article were removed by Mirror Vax. It is also unfortunate that some contributors to the article, such as Mirror Vax, apparently miss required physics background to understand the physics of optical recording as someone with that background could immediately understand that there are great difficulties in BD’s mass replication. I have just added a note regarding the reading of thin discs in the presence of dust, fingerprints, and other anomalies. If you wish, I can add the name of a good physics book.

<dd>Obviously the hard coat is an acknowledgement that there are robustness concerns. Equally obvious is that these concerns have not prevented BD from attracting broad industry support.

<p>As explained, the hard coating will not solve the problem related to servo tracking. Polishing of BDs will be hard work. This difficulty was not mentioned by the previous 'coating' contributor, who apparently copied a brochure of a coating salesman. I added a note regarding the replication of BDs plus a reference (in order to make it non-POV) to the first paper published by Sony/Philips scientists on DVR, later called BD. It seems that some contributors to this article are mainly concerned in the fact that a commercial product such as BD attracts broad industry support, and less concerned in physics.

<dd>It is well known that BD has more replication challenges than HD-DVD. Every article about the subject mentions it. The rest is opinion.

<p>Good. I just scanned the Blu-Ray article and the term 'replication', as you mentioned of great relevance in comparing various competitive formats, cannot be found except for my addition. Rather strange is it? An earlier contribution regarding replication was deleted for reasons of POV. To answer your question: I do not know whether BD is appropriate, but I am keen to see a fair and non-POV BD article, which is based on facts, but this seems to be difficult since some contributors do not have the required physics background. The moment they see a physics-based argument, it is deleted as 'POV' or 'NOR'. Dsc 21:29, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

While the equipment needed to ramp up production of Blu-ray Disc may be more expensive, after production is started those costs will very nearly disappear as far as the end user (consumer) is concerned. With regard to the physics issue, you cite one article in particular over and over again. Sadly the link is worthless because you must be a member/subscriber to view the actual article (your link only shows a summary and the author names). In any event, that the error correction technology was developed back in 1995 says nothing of the overall technology used in Blu-Ray Disc.

<p>The DVR article, which details the premises of Blu-Ray is available from the website, is in my view public domain, but one has to pay a small fee. So Locke Cole is stretching the concept of 'public domain publication'. Yes, I admit, a system, built on a physical layer, which was designed in 1996, can work properly. Also Windows 95 works properly, but the moment you see an newer alternative like Windows 2000 you prefer the newer version. In ten years time interesting ideas has come to fruition that could not be implemented in Blu-Ray as the format was frozen.</p>
<p>One can easily delete remarks regarding dust and fingerprints susceptibility of thin substrates in optical recording, but one cannot ignore the laws of physics. After a tedious search for a free or low-cost publication, preferably on the web, (otherwise some contributors like Locke Cole might complain it is not in the public domain) I found <a href="http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/11/10/7/1" class="external autonumber" title="http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/11/10/7/1" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, where you can read about the severe difficulties associated with thin, 100 micron in BD, discs. For someone with a physics background this is obvious. Essentially it has to do with the size of the light spot on the substrate, where the light enters the substrate. The thinner the disc, the smaller the diameter of that spot. As a result, particles on a thin substrate will obscure a relatively larger portion of the spot than particles on a thicker disc. A particle with a diameter of around 100 micron will completely obscure the light of a BD disc, while in HD-DVD the same particle will only obscure 5% of the light spot area, causing a small, 5%, amplitude modulation of the read signal. So in the BD case we have a complete drop out, while in the HD-DVD case we can detect most of the read-out signal. Clearly, this will affect the read-out and servo tracking. One can improve the error correction to deal with longer burst errors, but the servo control will remain vulnerable as there is no way to solve that. Note that a special 'Durabis' coating can never mitigate these effects whatever the PR people may promise in their glossy brochures. That concludes my lecture for today.

This well-written survey paper, written by two authors affiliated with Philips, explains some laws of physics related to the choice of the disc thickness amongst others. The two Philips' authors explain them, though they do not mention that they can overcome these laws, but may be, as you claim, the Sony engineers can. May be in Tokyo there are different laws than in Eindhoven. Could this remark be against WP:NOR, since it is 'physics- based' and therefore against it?

<dd>I did read it. I also noticed that it was authored in 1998. I then noticed that it didn't contain the term "Blu-ray" anywhere in it. Based upon the date of the article (1998 again), I can surmise that it had no way of knowing about advances in technology since that time (unless you're now saying the authors invented a time machine). Just as I'm sure nobody believed we'd have beams of light bouncing off of optical discs back in the early 1900s, I'm sure the authors of that 1998 article believed they were right in their conclusions. Now, I invite you again to go read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

</dl>
<p>The Philips' authors explain the physics of optical recording in a general setting, i.e. the article does not deal with a specific system, and the year, 1998, when it is was written is absolutely irrelevant (for a physicist). It is a fine article written by excellent scientists. Anyway, I made another search for a free article on the web, and found <a href="http://www.licensing.philips.com/includes/download.php?id=4107&amp;filename=3081.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.licensing.philips.com/includes/download.php?id=4107&amp;filename=3081.pdf" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, written by Heemskerk in 2002, an author affiliated with Philips. On page 27, you read that this Philips' author admits that BD is 'relative' sensitive for dust, fingerprints, etc. So if the Philips' camp, BD's founding father, admits there is a 'relative' problem, then I conclude and know there is a big problem. You may observe on page 27, at the left, a diagram showing the obscuring effects that I tried to explain above. In addition, Heemskerk gives three possible solutions to cure this 'relative' difficulty, namely hard coat, cartridge, and strong ECC. Strong ECC is always a good idea, but it does not give an answer to servo tracking loss. A hard coating is also a good idea as it prevents the accumulation of scratches over time. A cartridge is a good idea, but may be consumers will not like it (higher price, compatibility with DVD and CD, etc?). I think, POV, that a hard coat alone is insufficient so that a BD without cartridge will be very sensitive for sticky debris on the disc (polishing again like the old vinyl records!), and that servo tracking will be very difficult to maintain. Let us just wait and see what will happen in the future. As a last point: HD-DVD will not be 'relative sensitive' for dust etc as the disc thickness is the same as that of DVD.

<dd>No, it's not absolutely irrelevant just because he's a physicist. Just as rantings of a scientist from 1899 are irrelevant if new technology/research has disproven his/her theories. Now, to your new article. First, let's start with the fact that it's from 2002. TDK announced Durabis in January of <b>this</b> year. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/tdk_durabis/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/07/tdk_durabis/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> But ignoring that, you'll note that page 29 states that "If no cartridge is used, a hard coat is applied: disc cleaning will not cause any scratches". On page 30 they show images and results from tests on discs with two types of coating and no coat at all. At the bottom of the page he states "very hard organic coats are possible too". On page 31, the slide titled "Abrasion Resistance Test", they use a sand roll to attempt to damage the coated disc on the left and the uncoated disc on the right. The disc on the left has "A little damage but the symbol error rate remained below 4x10<sup>-3</sup>". The uncoated disc, in "The area that looks like white is the damaged part and cannot be read". I'd say these are very impressive results considering that, in 2002, they didn't have TDK's hard coat technology "Durabis". Clearly the author doesn't believe there's a "big problem" or even a "little problem", <b>except</b> with uncoated discs (which <b>any</b> media without a coating of some sort would be prone to these same things). In any event, this is clearly <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> territory. -Locke Cole 23:09, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The caddy might have been a factor with the Japanese units that were sold in Japan for awhile, but I believe the major issue with manufacturing costs was regarding the need for new equipment (HD DVD has, supposedly, an advantage in that duplication plants can use existing DVD equipment (with modifications) to create HD DVD discs). For what it's worth, any sane person knows the "higher cost" excuse is bogus. The reason? See: <a href="../../../r/e/t/Returns_to_scale.html" title="Returns to scale">Economies of scale</a>. The fact is if a duplicator has to pay $1,000,000 USD for equipment but they produce millions of discs, then the cost per disc ($1,000,000 USD ÷ <code>TotalDiscsProduced</code>) will be negligble; pennies per disc over the costs of HD DVD. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 09:48, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find these emerging storage technologies very disturbing. I have collected a vast number of DVDs and the thought of re-buying them all over again is a nightmare I dont want. I know new players must have backward compatibility but how long is that going to last? One of the most common tactics for forcing consumers to adopt technology they dont want is to withdraw support for the alternative. Instead of using the vastly expanded storage to store more standard resolution video, theyre using it to store about the same amount of hisher resolution video. That sets a dangerous precedent of both expansion of storage and parallel expansion of space consumed by the content so we are constantly re-inventing the wheel and running desperately short of space now matter how big things get. I see a future where 800 Terrabyte discs store pitiful 4 hours of 6400x4800 video (HHHHHHDVD) because we...as a species...technologically...cant keep our pants on! <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Arwengoenitz (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwengoenitz_de69.html" title="User talk:Arwengoenitz">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arwengoenitz_17d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arwengoenitz">contribs</a>) 23:51, February 28, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Backwards compatibility will likely last forever. DVD uses MPEG-2 data compression, and both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD mandate MPEG-2 as a required CODEC. Further, both require Dolby Digital and DTS sound formats. Finally, DVD shares nearly identical physical characteristics with Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD. The only issue is providing the extra hardware to read the older formats (and I'd like to think that those will be cheap forever; DVD players are down to like $40 or less at Wal*Mart for example). There's really no reason to drop backwards compatibility. By the way, the HDTV resolutions provided by these new formats really are a lot better than DVD; probably as big an improvement as we had going from VHS to DVD. I don't think we'll see another higher resolution format for quite awhile though.</dd>

<p>Will I be able to convert my own home movies to Blu-Ray and then make a copy (this should be legal because: a)I don't intend to make money off of it as the Feds might break down my door; and b)it IS my own movie) for each person in my family? I have home movies on both DVD and VHS. They can't take that privaledge away can they?--209.12.51.206 19:16, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you're talking about your own home movies (i.e. films made by you), why would there be a problem? From a copyright standpoint, <b>you</b> would be the copyright holder. If you want to make a copy of a film you made, then that's your right. Encryption shouldn't be a problem either since, if it's your own movie, the DVD surely wouldn't be encrypted in the first place. I can't imagine there being any technical restriction on you copying your own home movies (which do not employ any encryption) from VHS to DVD to Blu-Ray.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In legal terms, it depends on who owns the copyright to the home movie. Assuming it's shot by you or someone in your family, the copyright will be within your family so there is no issue. However if home movies includes professionally shot movies (e.g. wedding, school concerts etc) be aware depending on your contract, the person who taped it may still own the copyright. This won't affect your ability to produce copys but it will affect your legal right to produce copies (although it won't matter what format you use)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In feasibility terms, be aware that bluray has a form of watermark detection preventing reproduction of disks with said watermark. What this means is if your home movies happens to have a watermark, it can't be produced. No one knows how sensitive this watermark detection will be. HD DVD also has audio water mark detection which is probably of even greater concern which will stop playback of movies with this watermark. Both of these are of concern. Technically, it's possible if you record a home movie and a watermarked movie is playing in the background, you may be unable to produce the disk (for bluray) or you it may stop playing (for HD DVD) because the watermark is detected! Logically, the developers would make it so that if it's only for a few minutes, there is no problem. But in practice, they might not do so because movie studios are extremely paranoid and appear to care little about consumer rights. And of course, if it so happens that your home movie is fairly long, and the audio of some watermarked movie is extremely audible and was in the background most of the time, for HD DVD, you'll probably be screwed no matter what. This probably won't occur with old home movies since afaik the watermark is not yet being used but it may occur with new home movies.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm assuming that both formats allow you to playback unencrypted bluray/hd dvd disks (which I don't know for sure). If they don't you might need to get a key to encode your disk and your key could easily be disabled in the future.</dd>

<dd>Well things are messier than suggested above. Blu-ray and HD-DVD both have DRM built in. They sahre a couple of schemes and differ in a couple. Those schemes, if designed and implemented correctly, have certain engineering behaviors. They reduce resolution of the video stream coming from the drive, prevent operation of the drive and so on. What triggers the engineering to do its protective thing is not directly connected with the legalities of copyright. So if something triggers the protection when it shouldn't have been... since this is software, and deterministic at that, even if buggy, content can be protected when there is no legal grounds to do so.</dd>
<dd>An analogy is piano rolls. When they were introduced various copyright holders objected. The statute which settled that conflict recognized a limit to the extent of copyright. As did similar decisions in regard to sound recording, Video tape recorders, and so on. The claim by the recording and movie industry that tyhey have complete control -- to the exclusion of existing rights of their customers -- would be legally over reaching even if the engineering did exactly what they intended it to do.</dd>
<dd>So it's possible, though probably not likely, that the DRM might very well do something it ought not to. And there would be no appeal to the software. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 00:24, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suppose that depends on how much of a demand there is for ultra-high-definition porn. In that market it sounds more like a gimmick than anything else, at least until the format's pricing drops to current DVD levels (at which point the format wars will be over, in all likelihood).

<p>The largest adult entertainment producer in the US, Vivid Video, is releasing its movies in both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. A smaller competitor, Digital Playground, made a stance to go Blu-Ray only. <a href="http://xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=13041" class="external autonumber" title="http://xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=13041" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> The-bus 16:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well porn does exist... just about everywhere. No, it's not a driving force, like everything in the current war for High definition content neither side has anything greatly better than DVD, except for picture quality. As it goes into the fall it looks like HD-DVD might have a lead as it was out first and appears to be adapting quicker, the PS3 which should have closed the door on HD-DVD is turning into a huge problem for Sony. With the 360 getting HD-DVD and the PS3 having multiple problems, the advantage is about equal.</p>
<p>Now if there was something where you could interact with the pornography, or that would definatly drive sales but as it stands, it looks like the only major advantage is Blu-ray's storaget capacity and HD-DVD's ease of production. Neithe technology assists pornography in any way which is one of the reason this war is so annoying. The only other major benefit is DRM, and unfortunatly that's not something that benefits the end user.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinglink_3676.html" title="User:Kinglink">Kinglink</a> 06:21, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

If using <a href="../../../m/p/e/MPEG-2_353d.html" title="MPEG-2">MPEG-2</a>, then yes, a single layer (25 GB) disc would only hold about two hours of HD video. However, if using <a href="../../../h/2E/2/H.264.html" title="H.264">H.264</a>, you could (conceivably) fit four hours of video.

<dd>I want to relate my personal feelings on this topic, which is that editors should be very careful with their wording when talking about "playback time". The fact is that there's almost no technical limit on playtime. Well, there is a theoretical limit, but: 1) this theoretical case will never actually happen and b) the theoretical limit is <i>probably</i> at least a few hundred times longer than the playback times we'll see in real use. Any mention about playback times should always make it clear that there's no hard limit. Comparisons about playback time should probably use <b>ratios</b> and not hard numbers, e.g., <i>"newer codecs allow about twice the playback time as mpeg-2 video, assuming similar video quality"</i> or (trivially) <i>"a double-layer disc offers twice the playback time as a single-layer disc, assuming similar video quality"</i>. Words like "up to" should always be avoided when describing playback times. Any mention of playback times should make clear the tradeoff against quality, as well as source material.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This may sound overly complicated, but it's not. It's pointless to dwell overly much on playback time. Just make it clear that it varies, there are tradeoffs, and more storage space is always helpful. Snacky 01:57, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think it would make even more sense if, since we are fine with the video quality we are getting currently, why not use a BD to record standard quality video, but have say, 25-50-200 times as much content (based on the disc layers)? Try and see it from my perspective though, I see this whole oredal as a great way to get ahead on the "quantity over quality" level. You could comcievably have the entire LOTR series on one disc, just as an example... user:Kukuhri 12:43pm (MT) 27 September 2006</dd>

<dd>The self destruct business is not so much halting and catching fire, leaving a lump of charred plastic. Let's say someone finds a key for the cryptographic software implementing DRM for the drive, and the 'crack' becomes known. As the scheme seems to work (viewed from the outside), this will require a new key to access protected content. If you don't get that key... Instead, the self-destruct is a possible failure to supply new keys for the crytpgraphic algorithms which give access to the content of a protected Blu-ray disk. Without that key, controlled by the drive maker, the Blu-ray disk Alliance, the content producer, ... the drive can't manage protected disks. probably still be able to play other sorts: your own content, othe rproducers' content (maybe), unprotected content generally, ... Not the nicest behavior from a piece of equipment you expect to work, and which is functioning perfectly. Save for a failed update of needed crypto keys. 71.247.246.63 03:42, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>CDs and DVDs use a single layer of lacquer over the reflective data backing (on the label side) and are more susceptible to damage than either HD-DVDs or Blu-ray discs.</i></p>
<p>If Blu-ray disks need a caddy, and Cd's don't, how the heck are CD's MORE susceptible to damage, especially since on blu-ray discs, the data is 'closer to the surface?' Also, what the heck does something being on the 'label' side matter? Does the article mean non-label side?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree the whole paragraph is poorly worded. The above quote is also WRONG. It sounds like it was written by someone who has never even used or seen a DVD. The DVD reflective layer is sandwiched between two layers of polycarbonate (as I believe bluray is) and enables double-sided DVDs to be easily made. The CD is on the top with a thin layer of lacquer. There are two sides to every single sided DVD and CD. In CDs, most people think the bottom side needs greater protection. This is not strictly true. If you scratch the bottom side, it may have reading problems but this depends on the drive and you can also try polishing the surface. If you scratch the top side (label side), your CD is well and truly dead. To be fair, the data is still there and some data recovery companies may be able to recover it (altho this is also true for damage to the bottom side) but you have absolutely no hope of recovering any data (that is contained in the part where the scratch is) with a normal drive. It is rather unlikely you an fix it either. With DVDs, it's a different matter. The bottom surface is most definitely the more susceptible side. Damage to the top surface (within reason) doesn't affect the DVD... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 02:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Partly wrong. "A View from Space with Heavenly Music" uses MPEG-2, and "U2: Rattle &amp; Hum" uses AVC.

<p>Something this article does not answer and I'd like to see someone discuss is why virtually all Blu-Ray releases so far have been so-called "vanilla" releases. That is to say, releases with no (or virtually no) special features. And in some cases, the version released on BR is in fact inferior to that released on DVD. For example, when Ultraviolet was released, the DVD version was the extended directors cut, but BR only released the shorter theatrical version. Is there a particular reason for this? I definitely think it's a bad idea considering HD-DVD appears capable of including at least some special features (though that format also doesn't seem to have as many extras as the DVD releases). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:46, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know of any reputable sources having stated any specific reason, but I can imagine any number of things being the cause for this disparity. One likely cause, as was pointed out previously, might be because the 25 GB single-layered Blu-ray discs so far issued all use the space-consuming MPEG-2 and often PCM codecs, which leave less room for extras than on 30 GB dual-layered HD-DVDs with VC-1. There might be other reasons such as prioritizing the highest image/sound quality (like the Superbit DVD editions) or problems with licensing of supplementary material. Another imaginable reason is that issuing a "vanilla" disc first means that more cash can be earned on special/collector's/ultimate editions later. I don't which (if any) of these is the main cause for the difference in extra content. When it comes to longer/shorter cuts of a film, I can't even begin to imagine why there would be a difference. The "double-dip" factor or even pure studio ignorance seem like likely culprits, but again - I don't know.

<p>Unless I am misstaken the word "rip" in the context of DVD:s specifically refers to *copying* the data off the disk. An extremely important point to make in regards to CSS and similar DRM is that they prevent unauthorized decryption *FOR ANY PURPOSE*, including *WATCHING* the content. I would like to update this paragraph to reflect the fact that CSS (and the proposed DRM for Blue-Ray) hinders playback on unauthorized devices (or with unauthorized software).</p>

<dd>The DRM business is so tangled with legal, cryptographic engineering, ordinary implementational engineering, end user issues, economics, and the delusion/confusion of the lawyers who seem to be driving this stuff, leading to partial required crippling of hardware, an army of letters going out to end users who don't do what the holders (and their lawyers) want (even if explicitly legal by statute ....), as to defy any simple (or non-controversial) account. I think this sort of stuff needs to be the article, as it will be a an important saspect of BD use in practice. But see Talk at <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_rights_management.html" title="Digital rights management">digital rights management</a> for the tangled web which is thereby woven. I've stayed mostly away from attempting to cover this here simply because I'm a coward. Can't be involved in too many controversies...</dd>

<dd>That is the sad truth. And because of that I don't understand why you guys call it "Digital Right Managemant". Like <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> already said, the only thing what DRM does in the case of Blu-ray (and the most other cases too) is taking away as much rights as possible from us. So is it really our "rights" which becomes managed there or rather the restrictions which they want enforce upon us? So if nobody complains I will rename this title to "Digital Restriction Management". --Wall unit 08:48, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll complain, since it's an incontrovertible fact that DRM stands for "Digital Rights Management" and "Digital Restrictions Management" is a tongue-in-cheek criticism.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Talk%7EBlu-ray_Disc_23c9.html" title="Edit section: 1080p60 (?)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1080p60 (?)</span></h2>
<p>I have a question....</p>
<p>Is Blu-Ray disc capable of displaying 1080p resolution movies at 60 frames a second, or just 30 frames a second?</p>
<p>I know that digital broadcast and cable/satellite can only broadcast 1080p30, (which is only 12% better resolution than 720p60&#160;:P ), because of bandwidth limitations of approximately 19Mbps. There is, however, no such limit on rate transfer on Blu-Ray disc; it might, however, be unable to store an entire 1080p60 feature-film on its 25GB of space.</p>
<p>Does anybody familiar with the specs know if 1080p60 is possible on Blu-Ray, and if-and-when we could see films released at that resolution on Blu-Ray disc? Pine 15:17, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is actually a pretty good question, and a big part of the problem here is how everyone is so sloppy with terms like "1080p". In an ideal world, everybody'd say "1080p24" when that's what they mean...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, the short answer to your question is, <b>no</b>. "1080p" here actually means ONLY 1080p24 (and the NTSC-friendly 24000/1001 fps). Other allowed resolution/framerate combos include 1080i60 (actually 60000/1001) and 1080i50.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="http://www.blu-raydisc.com/assets/downloadablefile/2b_bdrom_audiovisualapplication_0305-12955-13403.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.blu-raydisc.com/assets/downloadablefile/2b_bdrom_audiovisualapplication_0305-12955-13403.pdf" rel="nofollow">this whitepaper</a> for more details. I suppose you could also find this in the official spec, but I know of no (legal) way to get that for free.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And now, some answers to questions you didn't really ask, but which are raised by the words you wrote.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In <a href="../../../a/t/s/ATSC_7871.html" title="ATSC">ATSC</a> (and most satellite that I've had a chance to analyze), 1080p30 isn't used anywhere I'm aware of; it's always coded as 1080i60 in NTSC-land. But repeat-field flags are usually used to give content that's effectively 1080p24 or (much less common) 1080p30. This is known as <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecine.html" title="Telecine">soft telecine</a>. Bandwidth isn't really the issue IMVHO, and whether 1080i60 looks better than 720p60 depends on both the type of content, and the type of display being used - one isn't clearly always better than the other.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Max bitrate for Blu-ray is 40mbps, so, not unlimited as you suggested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The above info, and some of the info in that PDF I linked to, should probably be included in this article by someone...Snacky 15:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Wow, that really is eye opening! So, in essence, digital broadcast and cable/satellite usually only broadcast what an end-user would experience as 1080p24, and only <i>occassionally</i> what said EU would experience as 1080p30.</p>
<p>As for Blu-ray Disc's bitrate of 40Mbps, it is slightly more than double the bitrate of what ATSC defines as one "high definition" channel, (19.9 Mbps).</p>
<p>Does that mean that Blu-ray Disc has the ability to <b>display</b> 1080p60, (though not necessarily store a feature-length sample of it), or is there something else that I'm failing to take into account? Pine 14:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As Snacky already explained, Blu-ray does not support 1080p60. 720p60 is supported, though. Could they conceivably have chosen to implement 1080p60 given the bitrate and storage constraints? Yes. They chose not to. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 14:50, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>most films use motion blurs so 30 frames a second isn't a big deal. with video games, it obviously is, so sony's ps3 claims to be capable of displaying this (supposing the rsx and cell can keep up with whatever code, inefficient or unrealistically demanding, it is given). --<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatoatigrado_42e9.html" title="User:Gatoatigrado">gatoatigrado</a> 05:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>yeah, that's right, the Blu-ray DRM will be the first copy-protection technology in all of history not to be broken/decrypted/hacked/mod-chipped repeatedly by end users -- Sony has somehow found the Holy Grail of DRM. Gimme a break. I've read how it works but I didn't even need to read how it works: there is NO SUCH THING as a DRM system which is immune to expoitation by pirates because such a system is mathematically impossible -- for exactly the same reason that there will never be an unbreakable encryption formula, there will never be an unpirated video format. Full-stop. Five years from now Blu-ray bootlegs will be almost as common as DVD rips are today.</dd>

<p>The information as seen in the overview:</p>
<p>A Blu-ray Disc can store substantially more data than the common DVD format, because of the shorter wavelength (405 nm) of the blue-violet laser (DVDs use a 650-nm-wavelength red laser and CDs use an infrared 780 nm laser), which allows more information to be stored digitally in the same amount of space.</p>
<p>The information as seen in the Laser and optics topic:</p>
<p>The Blu-ray Disc system uses a blue-violet laser operating at a wavelength of 405 nm, similar to the one used for HD DVD, to read and write data. Conventional DVDs and CDs use red and infrared lasers at 650 nm and 780 nm respectively.</p>

<dd>While I'm fairly certain 100 GB and 200 GB discs are <b>not</b> part of the first specification, it's a known fact (and sourced here in the article) that engineers have developed (or are developing) quad and octo layer discs. In other words, it's very likely these 4 and 8 layer discs will become part of a future specification (though they won't be backwards compatible). —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 05:44, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the response. I'm more convinced than ever that 4- and 6-layer discs are research topics, and they don't belong on a page describing a current standard format. I understand that it sounds like a minor tweak -- just add more layers -- but there are two important points to make. One, it's very possible that 4-layer discs will <i>never</i> be mass-produced. Two, if they are released at some future date, they will be called something different (let's pray it's not "Blu+ray"). If it doesn't play on a Blu-ray player, it's not a Blu-ray disc. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpiel496_67ac.html" title="User:Spiel496">Spiel496</a> 06:29, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I am fully aware that 4 and 6-layer (for some reason I thought they were using 8 layers) discs are not "minor tweaks". They'll likely never work in existing playback devices, and read-only software releases are highly unlikely (except, perhaps, for computer use). The issue I see is that the article is blurring the lines between what is out now (and what is part of the specifications used to create playback and recording devices out right now), and what is possible at some later date as an upgrade or expanded format. I would be happy with seeing references to 100 GB and 200 GB media being moved into some "Future Directions" section (obviously the name needs), or with disclaimers being added that such high capacity formats are unlikely to be backwards compatible. But simply removing them, is IMO, unacceptable. There are sources provided for the statements, and I can't see how a whole article on 100-200 GB Blu-ray media would be anything more than a stub. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 21:04, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Mentioning single layer and dual layer capacity HD DVDs and Bluray discs is OK. We have established that Bluray has ~66% more data storage capacity than it's HD DVD counter part. However, mentioning triple and quadruple layer discs are unnecessary and possibly misleading. Information on more then dual-layer should be removed removed from the chart and possibly be put in its own section. Non-technical people may brag about 200GB being greater than 15GB, despite that more than 2 layers will most likely never be used for commercial or mass-market purposes, as with DVD. In addition, technical people who may in some way understand this data don't need a comparison chart to tell them that a 3 layer disc has three times the capacity.</p>

<dd>I agree with Can Not. These quadruple-layer discs aren't in the spec, so they aren't Blu-Ray discs. Why not have a column for a 50 GB CD-ROM? You don't think 50GB will fit on a CD-ROM? All you have to do is make the marks smaller, make the cover layer thinner, add another data layer, and read it with a 405nm laser through a 0.85 NA lens.

<p>"The Blu-ray Disc Association intends to ensure that only disks that contain the ROM Mark will be playable on Blu-ray systems. The ROM-Mark is expected to prevent the casual copy from BD-ROM to recordable media. It is a mechanism aimed to protect against bit-by-bit data copy. The ROM-Mark requires a special machinery in the disc mastering process in order to be inserted on disc and thus, it prevents malicious replications."</p>
<p>That's from this article and the <a href="../../../r/o/m/ROM-Mark_c851.html" title="ROM-Mark">ROM-Mark</a> article. I'm assuming home videos will be allowed to play, so how are they getting around the ROM-MARK? Maybe someone can clear that up in these articles?</p>

<p>I would like to say to the person who changed what I wrote about the DVD abrasion cleaners not be able to scratch the so-called scratch resistant surface that he is only listening to the makers propaganda. DVD ABRASION CLEANERS DO TAKE OFF THE ENTIRE DATA LAYER ON THESE BLU RAY DISCS EXPOSING THE CENTER REFLECTION LAYER. I know because I have seen it done. I guess this would classify as "original" research so I'm not allowed to include it in the article. When will I be able to include it, when TDK admits that it isn't so scratch resistant? And when will that happen?</p>
