<p>While navy-blue might be the most correct translation of the Polish word "granatowa", most of the historical works in English just call this formation "Blue Police". Google Book Search shows that "Blue Police" is a much more prevalent form.

<p>I was under the impression that the Blue Police represented Polish-Nazi collaboration with their German overlords, and that the Blue Police "primarily" consisted of Poles. Although I'm sure their were other nationalities employed in the force, it almost seems that the inclusion of <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian.html" title="Ukrainian">Ukrainians</a> is somehow trying to dilute its Polishness. Perhaps I'm wrong. Would anyone care to present the percentages of the various nationalities compromising the Blue Police. Rather than completely deleting the reference to Ukrainians, I chose to soften the impression of its significance. As a result of this being disputed, I will ask that unless a reference showing a "significant" percentage of the Blue Police was Ukrainian, that the entire accusation be removed as POV and irrelevant. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 18:01, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Blue Police was predominantly Polish or Ukrainian, depending on the region. Ukrainian units were created in 1940 in Kraków and Lublin district and later in <a href="../../../l/v/i/Lviv.html" title="Lviv">Lviv</a>. Other nationalities were less significant then Poles and Ukrainians, and had not their separate units. Would you be able to rephrase the sentence in the article in a way that addresses your concerns about "diluting the Polishness" but also maintains the information that the police consisted primarily of Poles and Ukrainians&#160;? --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 11:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you tell us what the percentage of the 10,000 to 15,000, Blue Policemen, were Polish and what percentage were Ukrainian?

<dd>I don't know the percentage. What I meant was that this depended on the time and the area, so a "flat" number would be meaningless anyway. What is important is that the majority of the personnel were Polish or Ukrainian and the number of other nationalities were not significant. This is not because Poles or Ukrainians were particularly "bad" but this is because of the way how these units were recruited. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 17:07, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I'm not judging "bad" or "good". I'm asking for a percentage to gauge if the inclusion of Ukrainians as a "primary part"of its membership along with the Poles, is appropriate. As for <i>it depending on the time and the area</i>, lets make the area, the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Government_f91e.html" title="General Government">General Government</a>, and the time 1939-1944, if it helps. For example, if the Blue Police was 95% Polish, and 4% Ukrainian and 1% everything else, Ukrainian would be inappropriate in the "primarily" context. Perhaps someone else can better elaborate on the numbers. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 05:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dan, limiting the scope to "General Government 1939-1944" does not make sense, as BP did not exist outside GG. As I explained above, its composition varied with time and depended on the region. This in fact is also explained in the article, as the Ukrainian units operated in SE parts of the GG. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 06:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not to waste too much time on this, what is the relevance, and more importantly, the necessity, to make this specific distinction of "smuggling" from other criminal activities? And was the Blue Police not used to combat the Black Market? It seems awkward and unusual. Perhaps a complete removal of this point helps put back the focus of the sentence, which would be to state that this nazi-collaborationist entity aided and helped the nazis perpetrate the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> in Poland. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 17:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some US citizens seems to be proud, that people of other nations collaborated. The problem is that the USA did what it did, even without German occupation - expelling St. Louis ship or not issuning visas (eg. for the family of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Frank_0eef.html" title="Anna Frank">Anna Frank</a>). Yes, there are Overpeople and Underpeople, and everyone knows that Americans under German occupations would have never collaborated. They would have even elect a non-Nazi government, the idea the Underpeople would never had.

<dd>Dan apparently forgot that the article mentions both aspects of the Blue Police. Both the fact that the entity aided the nazis perpetrate the Holocaust and that it helped the government fight against the nazis and the Holocaust. Anybody have any problem with that? <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 02:50, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are either of you saying that the Blue Police were "smuggling" Jewish refugees. If so, a reference for that would be more in order than needing one to explain that smuggling is a criminal activity, rather than a "patriotic" one. Even <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhett_Butler_0705.html" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a> did it for the money. And I'm sure that <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Police_6315.html" title="Blue Police">Polish-Nazi Collaborationist Groups</a>, had to have done some good things too. I don't have a problem with that. Does anyone else? <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 19:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I meant is that the Nazis attempted to degrade the Polish population of General Government amongst others by economic means. This included food limitation and rationing, and smuggling food from the Reich to GG was one of the countermeasures of the Poles. To call it a criminal activity is similar to calling the Home Army <i>Polnische Banditen</i>. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 21:27, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lot's of confusing info in your comment. <i>Polnische Banditen</i>, where have I heard that before? Everyone knows that there used to be a great emnity between the Germans and the Poles, otherwise we wouldn't have the gem, <i>Heute gestolen. Morgen in Polen</i>, in the vernacular. Just as the eminity between the French and the Germans has died down, so has it slightly died down between Poles and Germans. I hope the Wikipedia format doesn't start fanning these flames again. I know from personal experience it hasn't improved Polish-Lithuanian relations terribly much lately.</dd>
<dd>So then, was "smuggling" as written in the article limited to smuggling <i>food from the Reich to GG</i>, or any kind of smuggling? And my real question or confusion regarding the matter is why the specific distinction between "smuggling", "other criminal activities", and specifically the Blue Police's role in combating this "crime"? And one more thing, <i>...attempted to degrade the Polish population of GG amongst others by economic means (sic). This included food limitation and rationing...</i> Were the nazis trying to degrade their own population with food limitation and rationing too? They were also implemented in Germany, I'm sure you know. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 17:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Dan, this is a longer topic. German occupation of Poland was not as nice as the occupation of e.g. France. There's been a lot of policies explicitly targeted to exterminate the nation by various means. The food and other restrictions for Poles in GG and for Germans in the Reich are incomparable things, I even cannot believe you would not know this. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 17:26, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course I know they are not comparable. Just the same, why can't we focus on the term smuggling as it is rendered in the article? Why can't we address what the need to distinguish it from other criminal activities is? I can't believe that you believe, smuggling to be a "patriotic" activity, that was perpetrated to spite the Germans and to bolster the national pride of Poland. My issue is very simple, the activities of this collaborationist entity against the Jews needs to be clearly given a single spotlight, without a watering down of this tragedy with some blather about smuggling. Perhaps you can come up with a solution. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Dan_bfad.html" title="User:Dr. Dan">Dr. Dan</a> 05:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I only object to assuming the Nazi POV in the article and calling smuggling in the GG a "criminal activity". I bet you would not similarly call hiding Jewish people a criminal activity. As for highlighting the BP actions against the Jews, I don't know - how frequent they were&#160;? what was the character of these actions&#160;? I'm not trying to whitewash the BP, I know they were hated by Poles. But also I'd be reluctant to generalize too easily, we better find some references first. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 07:52, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If we can agree not to call smuggling in the reality of Nazi occupation in GG a "criminal activity", we can go on to see if and how to highlight the anti-Jewish activities. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 07:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would rather divide the policemen into two groups (and a whole rainbow among them) - those who cooperated with the underground and did only that, what they were oredered to, and those who lost any moral limits, like the real Franciszek Kłos (maybe the name is fictional). Only children believe they could have acted like James Bond or persons in <i>Halo, halo</i>. The pre-war policemen had little choice, those who joined the police later without any underground initiative, were guilty, like any policemen under Germans, never punished and sometimes distuingished after the war like the ones in the Channel Islands. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 16:24, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
