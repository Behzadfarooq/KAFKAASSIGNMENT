<p>Hey thanks for the work on The BW article &amp; voyeurs NP. I am working on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superior_National_Forest_88fb.html" title="Superior National Forest">Superior National Forest</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Mountain_%28Minnesota%29_eaf5.html" title="Eagle Mountain (Minnesota)">Eagle Mountain (Minnesota)</a>.

<dd>Hrm - I'll wait until more up-north articles have been created to think more about a template. There should probably be a Minnesota Tourism category. Also I think your <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilderness_Act_of_1964_2e4e.html" title="Wilderness Act of 1964">Wilderness Act of 1964</a> stub looks good. You could probably start the article with the quote if you want. I have seen another article that did that, and it looked nice. P.S. I added <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tettegouche_State_Park_490c.html" title="Tettegouche State Park">Tettegouche State Park</a>, any suggestions about it? -<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> 17:59, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I have seen your comments. The environmental radioactivity page was started after a long edit war on the subject of uranium was brought to an end with the banning of one editor (<i>an editor who seemed to have a personal cause</i>). At that point wikipedia looked in a poor way on the subject of the relationship between man and the radioactivity in the environment. So a set of pages were started by me. The environmental radioactivity page is a overview of the whole subject and sub pages on uranium, radium/radon, fission products and the actinides (other than U) now exist.</p>
<p>You wrote <i>I agree that Be-10, Be-7, Cl-36, etc should be included in "the subject of radioactive materials in man and his environment", but not at the expense of a thorough discussion of them in their own right, in their own article.</i> I am unsure if a discussion of these isotopes existed already in wikipedia before I started to move things around.</p>
<p>If you have a much larger page on the dating of rocks, then I think that the best thing would be to add a link from the environmental radioactivity page section on the dating which has already been created to this new page.</p>
<p>As you are an expert in geology there is something which I would like to ask you if you would be willing to help out with. I would value your input on the subject of the mobility of different elements in soil and other underground things. I know already that the Cs and Pu tend to bind tightly to soil mineral but I know too little to write a good review of this subject. If you see the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fission_products.html" title="Fission products">fission products</a> page and the page on <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actinides_in_the_environment.html" title="Actinides in the environment">actinides in the environment</a> then you will see a small discussion of how Cs and actinides bind to soil, this could be a lot better if it was expanded.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 08:01, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nice work, thanks! I've added a ref for 'northern Europe' generally, but (annoyingly!) can't find the ref for Russia. I know I've seen it somewhere, but can't remember where, so I'll leave Russia and Siberian Spruce out for now - the best source to check would be Schmidt-Vogt's monograph <i>Die Fichte</i> (which means a trip to a distant library for me, so I'll not be able to do anything about it for a fair while). Noticed the page has a mix of Canadian and US spellings (flavour, flavor), which should be converted to all one or all the other; I'd reckon Canadian is the most appropriate (as the major producing country) but don't have a strong opinion. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 14:27, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
