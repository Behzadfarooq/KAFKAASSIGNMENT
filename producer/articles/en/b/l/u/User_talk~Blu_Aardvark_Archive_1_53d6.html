<p>FYI, I just made a proposal on the talk page that I think gets at some comments you made earlier, that the OC group helps bolster the "gay speculation" paragraph. It's on the talk page, but I'll reproduce it here in case you haven't seen it. If you have a minute, I'd appreciate your thoughts. <i>I thought on this a bit last night, and if what folks are unhappy with is having Openly Clay listed in the external links because its fan base isn't large enough compared with the top, say, two or three, how about then just listing it in the text? It seems to me that it could be naturally incorporated into the paragraph on gay speculation. Something like: Some have speculated that Aiken is gay, and indeed there exists a group of fans who enjoy discussing the rumor (link). However he has denied such suggestions and in fact good-naturedly lampooned the rumors by playing a member of a gay chorus when he appeared as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live's February 7, 2004 show. It's in proper context, isn't "in your face" about the group, but ensures that it's mentioned and linkable somewhere. What do you think?</i> · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 15:38, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was merged by me, as a result of someone else requesting a merge, as follows</p>

<li>The source text is already at WikiSource</li>
<li>Salvagable content about Eusebius and Biblical Canon was already moved to <a href="../../../e/u/s/Eusebius.html" title="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Canon_d086.html" title="Biblical Canon">Biblical Canon</a>.</li>

<p>Firstly let me say that I am sorry to have to bother you.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wish to let you know that a recent VFD that you took part in has closed. The result was that 32 people voted to keep all individual bible verses as seperate articles, and 34 voted that they shouldn't (2 abstensions, and 3 votes for both). This is considered by standard policy not to be a consensus decision (although the closing admin stated that it was a consensus to keep them).</p>
<p>Thirdly, the subject has now been put to a survey, so that it may remain open until there is a clear consensus for what appears to be a difficult issue to resolve. You may wish to take part in this survey, and record a similar vote to the one you made at the VFD there. The survey is available at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Wikipedia%7EBible_verses_f874.html" title="Wikipedia:Bible verses">Wikipedia:Bible verses</a>.</p>

<p>Normally I would have just speedied it, but I was adding it to a VfD that it seemed to be connected to.

<p>Did you add that note about my note on the talk page for Childhood (comic)? Please don't do that!

<li>That's fine by me. The reason I added the text the way that I did is that I hope that it will encourage people to expand the articles, and avoid deletion.

<li>I recognise that there was no consensus to delete this article – and that is unlikely to change. But I still have grave concerns about it. The author’s insistence in linking it to other Biblical studies articles, is giving the impression of a scholarly theory that simply does not exist I did warn –Ril- that his involvement in the second re-listing was likely to be counterproductive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A-Ril-&amp;diff=19363402&amp;oldid=19361330" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A-Ril-&amp;diff=19363402&amp;oldid=19361330" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but to no avail. I am left wondering how many of the ‘keep’ votes were influenced by –Ril-‘s antics. But getting this article right is more important that –Ril-‘s behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the last vote <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Authentic_Matthew_8546.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Authentic Matthew</a> 21d , 12k, 4m – I note that 4 of the ‘keep votes’ expressed a desire for a renaming. So that would indicate a 29-8 feeling that it was undesirable to have this article at this name. Is there room for an acceptable compromise? I’d like to move it to Possible origins of Matthew’s Gospel and place it the context of the real scholarly debate on Matthew. There would some overlap with both the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_problem.html" title="Synoptic problem">Synoptic problem</a> – but that I for one could live with. I could just ‘be bold’ and do this, but it is likely to be reverted, and I’m likely to get abuse, – so I’m looking for some agreement that this has a consensus – preferably from some of those who didn’t vote ‘delete’.

<p>You are wrong, Blu Aardvark, everyone came in said delete because they didn't like the creator, someone showed reasons for why it should be kept, and then no one responded it.
