<p>Please write me out a list of important questions you would like answered and I will try and answer them as honestly as possible on my user page. I don't want this debate about the breed to continue. I would rather have the article deleted than have damage come to the breed. I am willing to cooperate with changing my article to make it better, but without deleting every single resource that I have written. We do have more articles being written for us by other websites (not publish yourself ones) and in magazines (in USA, so in English) and I will continue to add them as they appear. I may delete the other resources that you don't approve of once I have these. But for now they are all I have and I believe all a lot of dog articles have are links to clubs and breeders sites. I can email you the other newspaper article but it is in Finnish and do you trust me enough to translate it for you? It does however have a picture of the breed and mention the name quite a few times throughout the article (its the same name as in english so easy to spot. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlufawn_62af.html" title="User talk:Blufawn">Blufawn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>How about you start the sub-user page, and I'll <i>rewrite</i> my questions there? Note I am suggesting this as a sub-user page, not a user page. They are not the same thing. If you don't know what I'm talking about, let me know what you would like your sub-user page to be called (Dogs makes sense to me, since you appear to be interested in several kinds) and I believe I can make it for you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding articles in Finnish, you don't need to take the time to translate it. If I find an electronic copy, I can find a third person to translate it for me. It's not that I don't trust you to translate it accurately. It is that having a third person will make it's content even more verifiable ... i.e. the article's author plus the translator plus then you as a reader and then me as a reader. That's 4 people, who will all have the opportunity to get on the same page about the same information. That's a lot stronger than you just translating the article for me, asking me to first believe that the article exists, even though I have not been able to find it yet on my own, and second, to believe that you've translated it with 100% accuracy. Hope that helps. Let me know if you'd like help creating your new SUB user page. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 12:52, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your right I have no idea what a sub user page is?? I would like you very much to help me though. I can't seem to find an Electronic version of the article either. I can however take a photograph of the newpaper at 100% and then zoom in on the article for you to read?? Does this make sense to you? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlufawn_62af.html" title="User talk:Blufawn">Blufawn</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok. I love helping!
<dl>
<dd>1) For the <i>Our Dogs</i> article, I think I saw that this weekly has a one week free trial to their journal, so, I may be able to get the article printed by them that way. I'll give it a try later today or tomorrow.</dd>
<dd>2) For the Finnish article, for starters, can you look to see if the journal it comes from has an <a href="../../../i/s/s/ISSN_0f3e.html" title="ISSN">ISSN</a>? If I remember correctly, you provided one of these numbers for <i>Our Dogs</i> (which I think I then changed, once I found the journal on-line).</dd>
<dd>Do you have access to a scanner that is attached to a computer? Often times when you scan a document, if it is connected to a computer or some other kind of computer network, it is possible to scan such that you create a .pdf file. If you were able to do that, then you could post this article on one of the many web sites that you manage, and I could access it there. Or you could email it to me as an attachment. Or you could make it available as a link of of either the WP article on the breed or as a link available off of your soon to be created sub user page. If you don't have access to a scanner, then we can pursue your idea of taking a picture with a digital camera (I assume) ... or ... go back to the fax idea or use the good ole postal mail. (I am a stamp collector, with a particular fondness for Scandinavian stamps - Finland has wonderful stamps; Iceland is my favorite though.)</dd>
<dd>3) I'll fiddle around with creating a sub user page for you now, and will let you know when it is done. I will call it "Tamaskan dog" to align nicely with the current WP article, and in hopes of things being less confusing as you learn more of this WP stuff. One of my sub user pages is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Keesiewonder/ML_Test" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Keesiewonder/ML_Test" rel="nofollow">this</a>, for example, since I have been doing editing on that article. I think the only thing to be careful of is to not assign your (sub)user page to categories, or the folks that maintain categories get upset (for good reasons).</dd>

<li>Ok, you should see a red link to Tamaskan Dog on your user page ... I think you can now go to the main article, copy whatever version you want as a baseline from its edit history, and paste it on your new sub-page. Then remove the category listings from your sub-page (or ask me to). BTW, your sub-page has it's own talk page, so, once it makes sense to you, we can relocate there for this discussion.<a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 16:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>That is a very good subpage, I vaguely remember watching a film about Martin Luther not so long ago. I do actually have quite an interest in religion myself, but not so much that I consider myself to actually know much about it (if you understand my meaning).</p>
<p>I do not actually own a very good scanner, you tend not to be able to read the writing, my photo camera is much better. Perhaps I could do both for you?? I did look for an ISSN number but I could not find one, it is a newspaper not a journal, should it have one??? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlufawn_62af.html" title="User talk:Blufawn">Blufawn</a></p>
<p>ok done, thanks, I feel like I can fiddle around with it more now and add loads more pictures of my own doggy. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlufawn_62af.html" title="User talk:Blufawn">Blufawn</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I most certainly did not write that sub-page. It is a copy of the main article on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>. I was working on some tricky formatting thing ... and wanted to experiment with the whole article, but not in the "live" environment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, do which-ever one is easier first. Is it a newspaper or a newsletter? I think if it has a paid subscription base, it should have an ISSN. I'll have to think about this a bit more and get back to you. Perhaps when you're providing the article, you can include an extra page for the "mast head." This is the part of the publication that tells you who the editors are, who to contact for this or that, who holds the copyright, etc. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeesiewonder_14b3.html" title="User talk:Keesiewonder">talk</a></sup> 16:20, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
