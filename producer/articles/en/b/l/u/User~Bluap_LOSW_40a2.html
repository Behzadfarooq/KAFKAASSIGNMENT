<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_LOSW_40a2.html" title="Edit section: The &quot;Summer Wine&quot; trio">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The "Summer Wine" trio</span></h2>
<p>The focus of 'Last of the Summer Wine' has been a trio of retired men, whose differing views of life provide much of the comic tension. Until the death of Compo in 2000 (following the death of the actor Bill Owen), two of the trio consisted of lower-class "Compo" Simmonite, middle-class Norman Clegg, and a "third man". The character playing the third man varied over the years, but was always an authoritarian figure, playing the ring-leader in the escapades of the friends.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_LOSW_40a2.html" title="Edit section: William &quot;Compo&quot; Simmonite">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">William "Compo" Simmonite</span></h3>
<p>(<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Owen_6f3e.html" title="Bill Owen">Bill Owen</a>, 1973-2000) Working class, and dressed in scruffy trousers and wellington boots, Compo rarely (if ever) worked for a living, preferring the lazy life. A great physical comedian, Compo is often used as the butt of jokes caused by the many dirty jobs, stunts and escapades that are a central feature of the series. Another recurring theme of the series was Compo's lust for the ladies - espicially his next-door neighbour, Nora Batty. The character was killed off in 2000 following the real life death of Owen a year earlier. Although Compo was already seriously ill, it was the sight of Nora Batty in fish-net stocking which finished him off and he died with a smile on his face</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_LOSW_40a2.html" title="Edit section: Norman Clegg">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Norman Clegg</span></h3>
<p>(<a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Sallis_da78.html" title="Peter Sallis">Peter Sallis</a>: 1973-present) Middle-class Clegg aims for a quiet respectable retirement, but is continually involved in the schemes of Foggy and the others. Despite having been married, Clegg shies away from women - especially the forward Marina. In many senses, Clegg represents the eye of the viewer into the escapades. As such, he is notable for his wry philosophical asides.</p>
<p><a name="Cyril_Blamire" id="Cyril_Blamire"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_LOSW_40a2.html" title="Edit section: Cyril Blamire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cyril Blamire</span></h3>
<p>(<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Bates_d650.html" title="Michael Bates">Michael Bates</a>: 1973-1975) The first third man, and the most childishly argumentative. When Bates left the cast due to illness in 1975, Blamire was written out of the series: it was said that he had left to get married.</p>
<p><a name="Walter_.22Foggy.22_Dewhurst" id="Walter_.22Foggy.22_Dewhurst"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_LOSW_40a2.html" title="Edit section: Walter &quot;Foggy&quot; Dewhurst">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Walter "Foggy" Dewhurst</span></h3>
<p>(<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Wilde_9473.html" title="Brian Wilde">Brian Wilde</a>: 1976-1985, 1990-1997) The successor to Blamire, Foggy is generally considered the definitive third man. A former soldier, he likes to boast of his exploits in Burma during the Second World War (in fact, he was a sign-writer). Although he considers himself to be very regimental and heroic, when confronted Foggy is generally meek and incompetent. He considers himself the leader of the trio, and frequently takes charge of the lazy Compo and Clegg. When Wilde left the series in 1985 to star in his own sitcom, it was explained that Foggy had moved to Bridlington to take over his family's egg-painting business. Returning in 1990, he claimed he had tired of a life of egg painting. In 1997, when Wilde's illness prevented him from taking part in filming the series, it was said that Foggy was swept away to Blackpool by the local postmistress.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_LOSW_40a2.html" title="Edit section: Seymour Utterthwaite">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Seymour Utterthwaite</span></h3>
<p>(<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Aldridge_46b0.html" title="Michael Aldridge">Michael Aldridge</a>: 1986-1990) Retired headmaster Seymour feels that it is his duty in life to educate the masses, and in particular Compo and Clegg. He likes to invent, but the resulting inventions invariably lead to disaster - especially for Compo, the reluctant guinea pig. When Aldridge left the series in 1990 to care for his sick wife, Seymour was last seen leaving on a bus to take up a new job as an assistant headteacher at a private school.</p>

<p>(<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Thornton_cebd.html" title="Frank Thornton">Frank Thornton</a>: 1998-present) A retired policeman, Truly is more relaxed and fun-loving than his predecessors as "third man". Divorced, he frequently makes disparaging comments about "the former Mrs Truelove".</p>

<p>Following the death of Compo (following the 1999 death of actor Bill Owen), the classic "trio" format of Compo, Clegg and one other was no longer sustainable. For several years, the show had become more of a ensemble performance: instead of viewing all events through the eyes of the trio, recurring characters had their own, independent plotlines. Several new characters were introduced, and previous guest stars became regulars. New characters included Compo's son Tom Simmonite (played by Bill Owen's son <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Owen_20fc.html" title="Tom Owen">Tom</a>), who was widely reported in the press as being a direct replacement for the Compo character. In fact, the closest direct replacement for Compo was in the form of Billy Hardcastle (played by <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Clifford_9584.html" title="Keith Clifford">Keith Clifford</a>), who is often shown walking with Truly and Clegg, though without the stunts associated with Compo. With the introduction of Alvin Smedley (played by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Murphy_05ea.html" title="Brian Murphy">Brian Murphy</a>), the stunts, and an element of physical humour returned to the series.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_LOSW_40a2.html" title="Edit section: Other regular characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other regular characters</span></h2>
<p>=== Billy Hardcastle === (<a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Clifford_9584.html" title="Keith Clifford">Keith Clifford</a>: 1999-present) An avid outdoorsman, who claims to be the direct descendant of Robin Hood, Billy Hardcastle attempts to follow the lifestyle of his ancestor - usually without success. The character was initially one-off guest role in 1999, which proved popular enough to return in the millennium special. Following the death of Bill Owen, Billy Hardcastle was written in as a permament character, filling the role of Owen's character Compo in traipsing round the hills with Truly and Clegg.</p>
<p>=== Nora Batty === (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Staff_d00f.html" title="Kathy Staff">Kathy Staff</a>: 1973-2001, 2003-present) Compo's next door neighbour, Nora is proudly devoted to strict housework, and stands as a monument to classic Northern women. Before his death, she used to keep her husband Wally very much under her thumb. Despite Nora's gruff manner (and famously wrinkled stockings), Compo is desperately in love with her: a lust that is used to great interest in generating comic situations as he attempts to impress Nora.</p>
<p>=== Wally Batty === (<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Gladwin_0748.html" title="Joe Gladwin">Joe Gladwin</a>*, 1975-1985) Nora's husband and Compo's next-door neighbour, Wally Batty was a short quiet man, kept on a short leash by his wife. His relationship with Nora stood in stark contrast to Compo's unrequited lust after her. Wally had a passion for racing pigeons and owned a motorbike and sidecar, occasionally taking Nora for a spin around the countryside. With the death of Joe Gladwin in 1985, the character died off-screen, but is still occasionally mentioned.</p>
<p>=== Sid === (John Comer: 1973-1983), bluff tea-shop owner, who featured prominently for the first ten years, before his death in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Ivy remembers him fondly, and often mentions him in conversation. Sid was one of the few characters who actually seemed to enjoy getting involved in the misadventures of the three central characters. === Milburn, aka "Crusher" === (Jonathan Lindsey: 1985-1990) Ivy's nephew, although bearing a striking resemblance to Sid. Helped Ivy out in the cafe for a few years after Sid died.</p>
<p>=== Ivy === (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Freeman_8b9a.html" title="Jane Freeman">Jane Freeman</a>: 1973-present) joint owner of tea-shop with husband Sid, with whom she would often have blazing rows in the kitchen, until his death. She now runs it solely, and viciously scolds anyone who dares misbehave or criticise the food. Generally the wisest and most level-headed of the show's female social circle. === Edie Pegden === (Dame <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thora_Hird_6b5e.html" title="Thora Hird">Thora Hird</a>: 1986-2003), a highly opinionated older woman, sister of Seymour Utterthwaite and houseproud host of the women's coffee mornings. She was introduced, along with Seymour, her husband Wesley, daughter Glenda and son-in-law Barry in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> episode "Uncle of the Bride". Wesley restored a convertible car for her to drive, despite the fact that she is a terrible driver. When Hird died in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Edie was also said to have died. === Wesley Pegden === (<a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Wharmby_7d40.html" title="Gordon Wharmby">Gordon Wharmby</a>: 1982- ) Edie's husband, who spends all his time in his workshop/garage. He constantly has to walk on newpaper in his home because he is covered in oil, and Edie won't stand him making a mess. When Wharmby died in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Wesley also died, and a funeral was held for him. The men would often come to him for mechanical assistance when the situation called for him; it always seemed Wesley would rather stick to restoring old motors. === Glenda Wilkinson === (<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Thomas_%28actress%29_bb50.html" title="Sarah Thomas (actress)">Sarah Thomas</a>: 1986-present) daughter of Edie and Wesley. It is considered by the other women in the group that she is somewhat naive, despite her being middle-aged. Whenever she attempts to join in a mature conversation, her mother would snap "drink your coffee!" She speaks glowingly of her husband Barry but is often insecure and unsatisfied with him at home. === Barry Wilkinson === (<a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Grady_0070.html" title="Mike Grady">Mike Grady</a>: 1986-1990, 1996-present) hen-pecked husband of Glenda. Dull and ineffectual, Barry strives for adventure but seems destined for paperwork and domesticity. === Howard === (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Fyfe_4eb7.html" title="Robert Fyfe">Robert Fyfe</a>: 1985-present) shy, simpering, henpecked husband, and lover of Marina. A creative but unconvincing liar. === Pearl === (<a href="../../../j/u/l/Juliette_Kaplan_206e.html" title="Juliette Kaplan">Juliette Kaplan</a>: 1985-present) Howard's long-suffering wife and a bit of a shrew. === Marina === (<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Fergusson_99ba.html" title="Jean Fergusson">Jean Fergusson</a>: 1985-present) flashy but over-age, Howard's love interest. Marina works in a supermarket. She insinuates a smoldering past between herself and Clegg, which Clegg is always quick to deny. === Aunty Wainwright === (<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Alexander_01d1.html" title="Jean Alexander">Jean Alexander</a>: 1988-present) sly and grasping junk shop owner. She is Howard's "Auntie" and while both have a general predisposition towards sneakiness, Auntie Wainwright is much more adept at applying it. === Roz === (<a href="../../../d/o/r/Dora_Bryan_5e14.html" title="Dora Bryan">Dora Bryan</a>) Edie's sister, who has always been more romantically adventurous, to Edie's unending shame. === Smiler === (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Lewis_%28actor%29_d553.html" title="Stephen Lewis (actor)">Stephen Lewis</a>: 1988, 1990-present) sour and not-too-bright comic foil. Seems to be suffering some sort of indentured servitude to Auntie Wainwright. === Eli Duckett === (Danny O'Dea: 1986-) extremely near-sighted bumbler. Eli has not appeared since the death of O'Dea, though the character has not been killed off. === Tom Simmonite === (<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Owen_20fc.html" title="Tom Owen">Tom Owen</a>: 2001-present) Compo's son on the show and in real life. Tom is a layabout like Compo but seems a bit more enterprising in his attempts to maintain his slothful lifestyle. === Lola Avery === (<a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_T._Wallace_d8af.html" title="Julie T. Wallace">Julie T. Wallace</a>: 2001-) Tom's live-in "associate"; much larger than him yet somewhat easily manipulated. This was not to last; she threw him out out their flat and disappeared from the series after a couple of years. Arriving on the scene with her and Tom was her niece Babs, who was considered a rather lame character and was gone with the end of the season. === Entwistle === (<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burt_Kwouk_2a77.html" title="Burt Kwouk">Burt Kwouk</a>) Electrician and fortune-teller. His real name is McIntyre but he changed it so people wouldn't mistake him for a Scotsman. === Alvin Smedley === (<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Murphy_%28actor%29_f9e6.html" title="Brian Murphy (actor)">Brian Murphy</a>) Nora's neighbour after Compo dies. He publicly claims he can't stand her but he can't seem to resist trying to liven up her life a little. === Policemen === (originally Ken Kitson and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Capstick_9413.html" title="Tony Capstick">Tony Capstick</a>; <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Emerick_0c3b.html" title="Louis Emerick">Louis Emerick</a> replaced the late Capstick in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>) generally seen driving around the moors and trying not to get involved with <i>anything</i>. === Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge === library workers involved in an affair which they believe is secret. The two only featured in early episodes, when Compo, Clegg and Blamire would frequently visit the library. Though the characters disappeared as the library was written out as a favourite haunt the storyline was resurrected and used for Howard and Marina. === Miss Davenport === (<a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephine_Tewson_0e9f.html" title="Josephine Tewson">Josephine Tewson</a>) the current librarian, a very emotional woman.</p>
