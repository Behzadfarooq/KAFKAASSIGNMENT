<p>Thanks for the work, and don't worry about losing any of my deathless prose. Honest to God (sorry), I don't know how I got involved, except extreme irritation, since I have no strong feelings on atheists or geeks. Geez, it's not as if they're the first batch of self-righteous types intent on using Wikipedia as some kind of soapbox/promotional vehicle. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:12, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see you said (before Gabriel deleted your comments) that he only had three reverts in 24 hours. Please see a list of them at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Gabrielsimon_9319.html#Evidence_of_disputed_behavior" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Gabrielsimon">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Gabrielsimon#Evidence of disputed behavior</a> at # 26. By my count he has at least four if not five, but he tries to split them up and make other edits at the same time so as to confuse the comparisons but always manages to revert the same basic chunk. I'd appreciate it if you relook at it. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:35, August 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>also , it might be good to look and check the edit summaires of Dreamguys in relevence toi his accations of my violations, because for one thing, if its about my RFC page, and it was tonight, that wasnt even me, as i explained on the talk page, and which i am very embarrassed about. for other 3rr accusations , please check for bait9ing in the edit siumam,ries, on Dreamguys part ( rude and insulting edit sumaries)</p>

<p>Now that the TfD on {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-bio_82c9.html" title="Template:Nn-bio">nn-bio</a>}} has been closed I have renamed all the speedy deletion templates to names that start with "db-" as discussed in that TfD discussion.

<p>The copyright infringement for Medical Alert you mention is simply wrong. The site you point to as the copyright holder has no copyright for the term "medical alert". In fact, the [www.medicalert.org MedicAlert Foundation] is the holder of the copyright. However, they have permitted the [www.consumeradvisorycouncil.org Consumer Advisory Council] to use their trademark where it serves to help resolve consumer confusion between medical alert alarm systems and MedicAlert bracelets. What's really alarming is that instead of pointing consumers to either the MedicAlert Foundation or the Consumer Advisory Council, you have pointed them to a site that copied most of its text from the Consumer Advisory Council Medical Alarm FAQ.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the copyright infringement is wrong, why not make note of it on the article's talk page? As for the copyright, I didn't suggest that the term was copyrighted by that site - I instead pointed out the fact that the text in the article was an <b>exact</b> copy of text from <a href="http://www.realarticles.com/Medical-Alarm.html" class="external free" title="http://www.realarticles.com/Medical-Alarm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realarticles.com/Medical-Alarm.html</a> - which is not in the public domain. A google search for the text did not turn up the Consumer Advisory Council, and I see no support for your claim that the site copied it's text from the Consumer Advisory Council Medical Alarm FAQ. Nice try though. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 17:06, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay, you win. If you'd rather degrade the value of Wikipedia by sending consumers to a Google Adsense site, so be it.</p>
<ul>
<li>That site is what a search turned up when I pasted a chunk of the articles text. It appears to be a copyright violation, infringing upon the copyright of the site I linked to. I'm not sending consumers anywhere; I'm simply noting an apparent copyright infringement. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 17:20, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've just been reading your suggestions to fix Wikipedia, and while you've got some good points, others strike me as downright odd. Arbitration members are not allowed to vote in cases which they are a party to already. Wikipedia does not have a policy of removing citations from articles, and actively encourages their addition. Policies are already reviewed and voted upon by the community. Hmm. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:15, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Some of 'em are a bit odd, actually. I haven't observed much in the way of ArbCom; I've just heard reports, secondhand, that they are allowed to vote in their own hearings. If this is not the case, then, great! All the better, and part of the way there. As for the removing of citations from articles, again, secondhand. The more, the better. And as for the policy part, I was suggesting that current policies be re-reviewed. This is actually a minor thing, but might foster positive discussion. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 05:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi there. In the TfD for this, you said we should keep it because we need a small template for long-term protection. But, as I said in the debate, we already have {{sprotected-small}}, which doesn't have the misleadingly titled name of the nominated template. Indeed, the notion of a semi-permanent semi-protect should not be enshrined in a template as there is no basis in policy for it. For <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W.

Oh, and before you call 207.118.103.139 a sockpuppet of Internodeuser, you should do a whois on it. It's a CenturyTel IP, and geolocates to Canyon City, OR.

<p>I'm sorry that you find my version of the template insulting; I imagine you have no idea how insulting the present version is to every admin whose only transgression has been to interpret policy as best they can. Am I to understand that you no longer assume good faith? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 16:16, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A further question. If you're so pissed about admins ignoring policy, do you intend to prove these violations and hold us horrible bastards responsible? By all means, file a Request for Arbitration. Call for my head. Otherwise, I'd ask that the black armband come off, because it's not accomplishing anything except stirring up factionalism. I'm here to write an encyclopedia. Are you? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 16:37, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, factionalism is a necessary part of Wikipedia. It isn't necessarily a good thing, but Wikipedia's systematic flaws support it. Userboxes do not. As for dispute resolution, it's already been tried. Perhaps you remember <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Kelly_Martin_c312.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Kelly Martin</a>? I distinctly recall that when that case was brought before the arbitration committee, they unanimously decided not to hear it, despite the clear dispute, and the abusive actions and statements.</dd>
<dd>Second, the template does not say "This user is pissed...", it says, "This user is annoyed". It also is a bit more specific, and says "This user is annoyed at admins ignoring policy". It really doesn't apply to admins who don't ignore policy. As for specific evidence, feel free to check the logs and contributions of admins like Marksweep. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 21:59, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I remember the arbitration case quite well; I urged acceptance at the time, in a long-winded outburst of wasted eloquence. Over time, I changed my views, mainly because of the sort of attitude I see expressed above. Factionalism is not, to my mind, a necessary part of Wikipedia. Those of us who've been here a while try to avoid it as much as possible, because it interferes with getting things done. I've always taken a collegial attitude, which is probably why my arbcom candidacy was supported by several users with whom I'd been in prolonged content-related disagreements.</dd>
<dd>Something else to consider is that many of us believe MarkSweep, Doc glasgow, myself, and others acted in good faith based on what Jimbo said, and take Jimbo's utterances fairly seriously. We're here for the encyclopedia, and we agree that userboxes are polarizing and divisive. Look how much energy has gone into this new phenomenon–a couple months ago we didn't have them, and I think it self-evident that the encyclopedia functioned just fine without them.</dd>
<dd>Finally, just who, exactly, is an admin who ignores policy? Who decides that? I checked Mark's contributions and I saw plenty of in-process speedy deletions. Consensus isn't required for a speedy deletion. It never has been. The process for such is to delete based on policy. The policy is to delete certain userboxes. Some admins tend towards a more liberal interpretation of the policy, some don't. What irks me, and irks others, is that it doesn't seem to be possible for an admin to make a good-faith deletion around here; no one will believe it. Because these boxes express a POV, removing them becomes a strike against that person's viewpoint, even though it's not. Countless keep votes on DRV express that sentiment, even though it's obvious from the delete logs that the admin in question doesn't give a damn which POV is being pushed (now, an admin who only deleted one kind of POV–<i>that</i> would be abusive).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, this is a long comment, but perhaps something to think about. Best, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 23:34, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The forum has moved, and the "libelous" postings (not that there was actually any libel) have not been copied over at any point. But thank you for pointing out your ignorance. <i>That is another reason it will not be linked to from Wikipedia</i>. No, the reason it will not be linked from Wikipedia is because SlimVandal is throwing a temper-tantrum because members of the board criticized her actions. Well, there was the near-porn picture by Selina, but we've already covered that. <i>If you assure me that you will stop creating live links to this website on Wikpedia</i> I won't create live links to the site, no. <i>and will stop helping others to do so</i> If you censor somebody's comment, I have every inention of restoring it to it's unadultered form, unless you can explain your actions, which you have not done. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 08:31, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The forum is never going to be taken seriously. Why do you insist on banging your head against a brick wall on this? As long as it continues to be run by banned users (especially Selina who has shown a penchant for disclosing users' personal information) with access to IP addresses of posters, this will remain the case. No disenter in his right mind would post there. I sure as hell refuse to. The past reputation of the old board isn't lost by changing to the new location. But go ahead and call this <i>censorship</i> and hyperbolically rant about it in posts over there. It won't do anything to raise the tenor of the debate. Anyone familiar with the history of the site and the personality of its sysop would perfectly understand Slim's actions. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 19:55, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your request to be unblocked is denied. First of all, you're purportedly on a WikiBreak, so why do you care if you're blocked? (See, perhaps, <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GoodBye" class="extiw" title="meatball:GoodBye">meatball:GoodBye</a>.) Second, your block was justified by your behaviour, so don't expect it to be removed quite so quickly. Some indication that you understand why you were blocked, that you understand that your block was justified, and that you will not engage in such behavior in the future would be a good start. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 22:02, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why do I care? Because I have trolls such as <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">User:Jayjg</a> launching personal attacks on me on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, and I have every intention of responding to their falsehoods and trolling. Second, because those users ARE trolls... I cannot interpret their statements and abuses of power in any other way. How is it a personal attack to call a troll a troll? You call Lir a troll, you call us trolls, but it's a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> to conclude that such accusations, without any basis in actual fact, are, in fact, trolling? You call Willy on Wheels a vandal... that's a personal attack if you want to stretch it that way. You also are not neutral.

<li>OK Since your latest posts indicate a slightly cooler tone, it is probably worth an attempt at going the extra mile.

<p>Hi. We never interacted before, but you've generated a lot of attention lately. Just so I can understand a little better why you've come back, could you comment on the following <a href="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=02f8ab59d559fee0d5153b0cddf200d9&amp;showtopic=485&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=3027" class="external text" title="http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=02f8ab59d559fee0d5153b0cddf200d9&amp;showtopic=485&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=3027" rel="nofollow">posting of yours</a> on Wikipedia Review?</p>

<p>Wikipedia Review was initially founded in November 05, or perhaps earlier. I joined the initial WR in December. Selina joined it in January, shortly after the userbox fiasco.</p>
<p>The site was relatively small and exceptionally non-notable at the time, hosted on a proboards server. The administrator of the forum was "Igor Alexander" (quite probably the same person as User:Amalekite), who appointed me as a global moderator over the forum in mid-December, and later passed partial adminship to me. In early 2006, a poster using the screenname "jackwelsh" (who is quite probably the "Disruptive Apartheid Editor" whome Jayjg describes on a user subpage) joined Wikipedia Review, and began posting some comments of an anti-semitic nature. I chose not to take action, because I did not see his posts as "hate speech" particularly, and although they were offensive, were not offensive enough to warrant taking action. This created some conflicts between myself and some Wikipedia editors who were active there at the time (including El C), who felt that I should have banned him and deleted his posts rather than allowing him the privelage of posting there, and that my refusal to do so was an indication that I was either anti-semitic myself, or at least nazi-apologetic. In response to this conflict, and the hateful attitude expressed towards Igor by many members of the forum (since it was assumed that Igor was Amalekite, and that Amalekite was <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Linder_e7a0.html" title="Alex Linder">Alex Linder</a>), Igor "reclaimed" the forum, banned many participants there, and used the board as an apparent platform for neo-Nazi politics. However, Igor explained his intentions to me by private corresponse, and I defended him because I understood and respected his explanation. This, of course, heightened the conflict between myself and users who assumed that I held neo-nazi viewpoints. (For the record, I don't. I do, however, believe firmly in free speech, even if the speech is unpopular or even offensive. I do recognize reasonable limits, however. If a neo-Nazi is explaining his beliefs in a coherent, civil manner, I see no reason why that is unnacceptable. If they are calling for the blood of Jews, there is a problem with that.)</p>
<p>I believe it was in late January I created my first sockpuppet accounts, which were used as a form of experiment prompted by discussion with Lir. Orange Flowerpot, Another Orange Flowerpot, and related accounts were used to leave messages of a nature similar to posts by Lir on Raul654 and Snowspinner's talk pages. The results of the "experiment" were posted on Wikipedia Review. Technically, this was sockpuppet abuse, but I felt justified because it seemed the only way to test certain presumptions about how Wikipedia functioned.</p>
<p>Wikipedia Review moved to its own domain and away from Igor's adminship in mid-February. Appointed as admins over the site were myself, <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">Lir</a>, Qwerty, and <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_f76f.html" title="User:Mistress Selina Kyle">Selina</a>. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Blissyu2</a> declined adminship.</p>

<p>I would like to thank you for giving wikipedia another chance. You had many reasons to walk away, yet you didn't, and it shows a lot of character to persist at improvement. Even if this does not turn out for you, you have shown many wikipedians that not all banned users lose faith and walk away. You broke the mold.

<dd><s>I'm no longer planning on returning, ban or no ban, sockpuppet or no sockpuppet. While I do appreciate your encouragement on my behalf, the messages sent by a powerful subsection of the community are pretty clear. I believe bumm13, in his bad-faith judgement, explained it best -<i>#wikipedia: You have parted the channel: requested by ChanServ: "Is_not_welcome_here_added_by_bumm13_on_6-15-06"</i>.</s></dd>
<dd><s>I don't intend to contribute to a project where I am not welcome. That's a waste of my time, and it's a waste of the project's time. The arbitration committee may not have made a final decision just yet, but I can read from the voices who have contributed to the proposed decion so far the message that I am not welcome. That's what a ban of a year is a statement of, and I'm no fool. That's what selectively applied evidence that is also misleading or just plain false is a statement of, and I can read the message plain as day. While that ban has not been finalized just yet, it is all but certain that it will be, and I'm not going to waste my time trying to grasp at the wind.</s></dd>

In response to the following message on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yup, here, both in content and in edit summary, invoking WP:IAR. Problem is, there is a massive difference between ignoring the rules and ignoring specific instructions by ArbCom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, there is no difference. From the version of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> that I was familiar worth, one of the purposes behind the concept in the first place is to avoid the red tape and bureaucracy of Wikipedia for the purpose of constructing a quality encyclopedia. The very defination of ArbCom is "bureaucracy". My edits that I made were constructive, and beneficial to the cause of constructing a quality encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair to Cyde, the block was within policy, and I don't object to it on any purely technical grounds. However, the block was clearly <b>not</b> made in good faith, even if it is defensible by Wikipedia's policies on ArbCom proceedings. I don't care if I am unblocked - blocking me is only superficially effective anyway, as I can make either good or bad-faith contributions even while blocked - but Cyde shouldn't try to kid people into thinking that his actions were in good faith. He's had an issue with me ever since I opposed him on his RFA. His initial one-week block of my account for "personal attacks" was made in bad faith, and his lies on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and elsewhere were also made in bad faith. I still stand that Cyde does more harm than good as an admin, and the project will improve dramatically once he is desysopped.</p>
<p>Even worse than the block, however, was the fact that another user went by and reverted some of those constructive contributions - one of those contributions involving the removal of text that violates copyright, and another contribution adding a note that an article on a real person was unsourced. Those reverts were innappropriate, even if defensible by the banning policy. I have restored those edits. If reverted again, I will leave it be, but I do caution FeloniousMonk or other over-zealous admins to think before reverting. Is Wikipedia an encyclopedia, or an MMORPG? You decide. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 00:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A final note: One has to admire the irony that a contributor recieved an indefinate block after removing copyvios and reverting vandalism. Most indefinate blocks are handed out for precisely the opposite reasons. Something to think about. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 00:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you here. It doesn't make sense to revert good edits just because they were made by a banned user. But at the same time, it doesn't make sense not to block a user violating ArbCom sanctions just because they happen to be making good edits at the present time. I hope you understand. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 04:16, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand, and on a purely procedural level, the block was within policy and within process. However, don't kid people that it was also in good faith. You and I both know better.</dd>

<p>Of course, his final actions were nothing more than an attempt to sow confusion by playing the "Ohh look at me, I'm making good edits but you're blocking me anyway!" card. That is to say, he wasn't editing because he truly cared about making the encyclopedia better, only to try to make us look bad. --Cyde↔Weys 04:17, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't doing anything to sow discord or confusion. It's interesting how you expect me to assume good faith of your actions, but you cannot assume good faith of mine. Please note, I have no hard feeling against you for performing the block, and you were technically justifiable in doing what you did - but you were still in the wrong.</p>
<p>I was editing to edit, to improve the encyclopedia. To go out with a bang, but on a different note than last time. Yes, part of it was a social expirement of sorts, to see who would block me for what reason, and when, but primarily, I was interested in making some positive contributions, if for no other reason than to detract from the cherry-picked evidence (and flat-out falsehoods) on the ArbCom page.</p>
<p>And still another part of me had to laugh at the irony of it all. I was well aware that I would likely get blocked for my contributions, but I have to admit that I chuckled when someone actually did perform such a block. Because according to the central Wikipedia philosophies, it made no sense whatsoever. According to the overdeveloped bureaucratic and legalistic structure that Wikipedia has devolved into, however, it was perfectly justifiable. I think this final block in and of itself speaks louder than any of my contributions on Wikipedia Review ever did. I'm only curious now to see who decides to listen to the facts and try to improve things, and who decides to hold their ears and scream until I go away.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is broken. It has failed to live up to it's ideals, and is devolving at a rapidly-accelerating pace. In a sense, it has reached <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal_September_c081.html" title="Eternal September">Eternal September</a>. The longer Wikipedia's critical flaws are ignored, the more serious they will become, and the harder it will be to recover from the mess. Unfortunately, the preferred method is to ignore the cesspit that lies underneath your handful of featured articles and well-developed egos, and instead brag about how big Wikipedia is getting, failing to realize all the while that the bulk of Wikipedia is unreliable, unsourced, and badly-formatted, and the content undergoes constant vandalism, pointless revert wars, and worse.</p>

<p>Blu Aardvark started off, as many of us do, as a good earnest newbie Wikipedian. He did a few questionable things and got a taste of some of the Wikipedia community's officiousness. He did not handle it well and flamed out in a puerile fashion. He then co-founded a criticism site, quite likely with good intentions, but just stood by when it got out of hand and other members launched some vicious attacks. He had a change of heart and tried to come back to Wikipedia, but the community was unforgiving and reacted with anger. This time he left with class and maturity, trapping us in our own officiousness in a nice coup de grace. It sounds as if he has matured and learned from the debacle; let us hope that, in time, the Wikipedia community will as well. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 04:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This summary is mostly accurate, except that I did not cofound the board. I joined an older board, and retained a nuetral stance on Wikipedia. I got a taste of the Wikipedia community's officiousness after I joined the forum. I helped to found the second board, but I was involved with Wikipedia Review long before I had a conflict with any Wikipedians. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 01:31, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't even have to click that link. I know that the ArbCom members are fucking liars already. Cherry-picked, selectively endorsed evidence, and much of it isn't even true to begin with. You'd think that ArbCom would be able to at least hold a pretense of nuetrality, but they can't even manage that.</dd>

<dd>Alrighty. Not that either matters much, in either case. The whole point in selecting a ban of a year is to discourage a user from ever coming back. That's why the arbitration comittee goes for the maximum length whenever possible. Maybe I'll be back when the ban expires, maybe not. Maybe I'll wait a few weeks, and come back under a new sockpuppet - maybe not (technically, that's against the banning policy). I'm not sure what I want to do, but I do intend to wait at least a month before making any decisions. It is regrettable, however, that the arbitration comittee was so hard-pressed to find evidence of abusive actions on my part that they resorted to falsifying and misrepresenting the actual facts. I never encouraged Amorrow to stalk AnnH - I encouraged him to, if he was going to sockpuppet around bans - be constructive. I did once refer to Jayjg as "Jewjg" offsite, but that was in an off-hand manner, and wasn't strictly intended as a personal attack, and definately not intended as a slur. It was also nearly three months ago. But the arbitration comittee doesn't care about the facts, only the result that they get to hand down. Which is sad, really, because they are *supposed* to have the best interests of the project at heart. Only one of them was able to even hold a pretense of nuetrality, and he was in a position where he had to recuse himself. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlu_Aardvark_ff0c.html" title="User:Blu Aardvark">Blu Aardvark</a> | <sup><a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlu_Aardvark_4b92.html" title="User talk:Blu Aardvark">(talk)</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Blu_Aardvark_5a61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Blu Aardvark">(contribs)</a></sup> 12:26, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
