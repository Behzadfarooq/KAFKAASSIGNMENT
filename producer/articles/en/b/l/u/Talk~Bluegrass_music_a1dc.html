<p>As <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluegrass_music.html" title="Bluegrass music">Bluegrass music</a> is named for the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Bluegrass state</a>, it merits the Top importance designation. The article was a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_3e1a.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article">good article</a> until recently, when it was delisted for not using inline citations. As such, I have rated it A-class, and hope someone will clean up the references soon so it can be renominated. <a href="../../../a/c/d/User%7EAcdixon_593f.html" title="User:Acdixon">Acdixon</a> 16:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Due to the Good Article delisting, and the lack of adequate citation (inline or otherwise), I am lower this to B-class. It is also probably "High" importance rather than "Top" (incidentally, Bluegrass music is not named for the state, it is named for Bill Monroe's band, the Blue Grass Boys). <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 21:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think Monroe named the boys after the "Bluegrass State", then of course there is the grass itself that grows there too ('cept in the mountians where its too rocky). B-listing makes sense until someone can give a decent effort here. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 22:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having grown up pretty much immersed in bluegrass music and also studying it in school, I have never even heard of Gundula Krause. She may play bluegrass or related music, but she is probably not an artist of significance to merit encylopedic inclusion in a bluegrass article. To me artists listed in the bluegrass article should either be exemplars of the "core" bluegrass tradition (Blue Grass Boys, Flatt &amp; Scruggs, JD Crowe, Doyle Lawson, Dolly Parton) or notable outliers who influenced subsequent musicians (New Grass Revival, Seldom Scene, David Grisman, Béla Fleck). Just being a musician who plays bluegrass, or being a musician who plays music related to bluegrass is not enough, although perhaps some of these could be noted to further explain what is and is not generally considered bluegrass (e.g. although Chris Thiele has recorded bluegrass and the band performs some bluegrass/folk related songs, Nickel Creek is not usually considered a bluegrass band: they never use a banjo, bass does not keep the beat as you would expect in bluegrass - Chris has even said that he does not believe they are playing bluegrass). <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 13:11, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that bluegrass is popular all over the world! Just look at the events listed in <i>Bluegrass Unlimited</i> each month, with listings for Australia, England, and France. My mother and stepfather were founding members of the Adirondack Bluegrass Society in upstate NY, which has been around since 1972 and is still going strong.

<p>Someone continues to remove Jesse McReynolds from the "core" list. He has played music with his brother for over 50 years (his brother died in 2002), and has invented a new style of mandolin playing called crosspicking. This has become extremely popular with mandolin players around the country. He has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry for over 40 years. He not only had a TV show, "The Jim and Jesse Show" in the 1970s, but had recorded with Chuck Berry, the Doors, the Who, and John Prine. He is a legend of this music.</p>
<p>I moved Uncle Charlie Osborne to the "known for other stlyes" area, because, while his albums were bluegrass, he was known primarily as a mountain musician.</p>
<p>If someone wants to remove them again, I'd like to see a good reason first.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I made those changes, which, along with the rationale, appears in the page history. Because he is primarily known for his work with his brother, I replaced "Jesse McReynolds" with "Jim &amp; Jesse". I removed George W Osborne; I have never heard of him and his Wikipedia article states, "he never played bluegrass..." I removed Uncle Charlie Osborne for a similar reason; he is known for traditional/folk music, but not as a bluegrass musician (bluegrass music is nowhere mentioned in his article).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Keep in mind that the goal is not a comprehensive list of all bluegrass and bluegrass-related musicians (there is a page for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bluegrass_musicians.html" title="List of bluegrass musicians">list of bluegrass musicians</a>) but to provide someone unfamiliar with the genre with a short list of exemplars and (potentially) suggestions for listening. We have more than 30 musicians already listed in this article; I think that to keep it from duplicating the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bluegrass_musicians.html" title="List of bluegrass musicians">list of bluegrass musicians</a> we should probably not increase that number (if a musician/band needs to be added, perhaps a less significant artist can be removed).

<p>I agree with Jesse McReynolds merged with Jim and Jesse, but keep in mind they are major pioneers of this kind of music. As for Charlie Osborne, in his early days he was known as an excellent bluegras session fiddle player if you could convince him to do it. The Stanley Brothers had him on several live shows and uncredited on one or two records. (anon 15 July 2005)</p>
<p>I've missed Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell on the list as "Duelling banjos" is one of the most famous Bluegrass tunes. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelly42_6826.html" title="User:Melly42">Melly42</a> 16:44, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a notable tune, and perhaps the article could have a section for notable songs/tunes and notable albums. However, I think Weissberg and Mandell are probably not important enough (apart from this tune) to be added to this list.

I just caught this: (removed The Earl Brothers, nonnotable, the line appears to have been added so they can list Wikipedia on their website)</p>
<p>I put them in to begin with, and I have nothing to do with the band. The Earl Brothers are a nationally touring act that has been featured at IBMA and write almost all of their own material. Their music is innovative while retaining a traditional feel, and many people in the bluegrass community consider them to be the most interesting original development within the genre in recent memory. On what basis are they "nonnotable"? I don't know how to sign this...C. Ruth</p>

<dd>I think this whole "4th generation" thing needs more attention, or should get axed.

<dd>Well, I've yet to remove any names from this page, but I would support this removal. As stated many times elsewhere in these discussions, the "agenda" is to create a good overview and introduction to the music, not to create a definitive history or catalog of bluegrass music. With this goal, it's necessary to restrict ourselves to only the most notable and influential artists. There's a bunch of additional removals I'd like to make. Listing every notable artist is inappropriate. Moore et. al. may very well warrant their own wikipedia entry, but I agree that they are not appropriate for this page. By the way, if you create a user account then people can discuss their edits to your contributions with you, and questioning the "agenda" of other editors is not really constructive. People have different viewpoints and opinions and the whole point of this thing is to find a way to work together and find an agreeable common ground.<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinepoundjammer_d66d.html" title="User:Ninepoundjammer">Ninepoundjammer</a> 22:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to question whether some of the people removing things really know that much about the music. A few points: there is a "third generation" that is pretty distinct, one of the more popular bands is even called IIIrd Tyme Out in homage to this fact, as is mentioned in the entry. Also, for fans of traditional bluegrass, bands like the Earl Brothers and Open Road are rather important. Both are nationally touring acts who have multiple commercially available recordings and they have both been showcased at the IBMA. The point of talking about NEW bands is that some of the people around the periphery of the music probably will NOT have heard of them. That doesn't mean that they are irrelevant to an introduction, however, because a mention of new currents that those in the know are tuned in to is an appropriate part of such an article. Why are they being removed? I also have a hard time believing that anyone who knows about bluegrass would delete Charlie Moore. The entry is not supposed to be only about bands that only those with the most cursory knowledge of the music have heard of. Also, Chris Thile is more marginal than these names, despite his popularity, because he plays very little bluegrass. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by C Ruth (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_C_Ruth_e2c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/C Ruth">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I haven't removed anything myself (nor contributed much either), but can you point to a source that discusses the 3rd generation concept as distinct from the Crowe/Bush/Rice era (all of whom are still very active).

I asked Ray, 'What do you think about the name 'Third Time Out'? He said, 'Where'd that come from?' I said, 'You know, this is your third professional bluegrass group to be associated with. It's my third professional bluegrass group, and it's also Mike Hartgrove's. So, this is kind of our third time to venture out in the bluegrass world, maybe the third time will be a charm.

<dd>I'm not saying you're wrong on all counts, I'm just wondering if it would be better to organize the history in terms of changes in the music that have occurred in various decades rather than somewhat ambiguous "generations". Also, since you seem to know a bit about bands like IIIrd Tyme Out, Open Road, and the Earl Brothers, you might work on some articles for these groups. I suspect they have been removed because they are all red links and thus not very helpful as examples. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 14:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments. I was probably wrong about the significance of "IIIrd Tyme Out." The second generation appellation covers a period of time beginning in around the late fifties. In other words, if we deny the existence of a third generation, the first generation is composed of bands that started in about a ten-year period, and the second generation is composed of bands that started in about a fifty-year period. This is unsatisfying, and furthermore the term "third generation" has general currency. However, I will search for documentation to clean up my act here and try to define a third generation.C Ruth 18:21, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, the IBMM has a "founders" category which lists bands that began up until 1954. That's the closest I could find to any sort of quasi-official categorization. At the very least, it seems clear to me that bands from the late '70s and '80s constitute a 3rd generation (such as the Johnson Mtn. Boys). I am mystified as to why the burden to provide evidence would be on someone claiming a 3rd generation, rather than someone claiming only two, since the taxonomy that includes a third is in common usage, and many claim a fourth is emerging. The defender of the two-generation taxonomy has to justify one generation lasting from 1945 to 1954, and another lasting from 1955 until 2006. This is extemely counter-intuitive, and therefore I submit that the evidential burden is on the people who say there are only two generations. C Ruth 01:05, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand. If "Third generation bluegrass" is a term of common usage then what is the problem with providing a source? If there is no source for a thing, how can it be common knowledge? What generation is <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Krauss_c476.html" title="Alison Krauss">Alison Krauss</a> (b. 1971)? Or for that matter Sierra Hull (barely a teenager and already having a <a href="http://www.tnvacation.com/events/109/" class="external text" title="http://www.tnvacation.com/events/109/" rel="nofollow">festival named in her honor</a>)?

I'm not defending the use of two genrations versus three. Both are ambiguous. Could the history be better divided by decades, notable events, or something more clearly defined?

</dl>
<p>I'm saying that "third generation" is common parlance, not that it has a citable pedigree. Where is any source cited here for generations at all? Why are we even talking about a first generation, then? The fact is that these are loose terms in common usage, not a complete and unified taxonomy. Also, the "generation" label does NOT seem to be applied to when people are born, but when they began playing. The only official source I know of is the IBMM's list, which only deals with first generation. If you'd rather have "first generation," "second generation," and "more recent devlopments," go for it, I won't change it. But "more recent developments" would have to start some time around the late 70s. CRUTH (not logged in)</p>

<dl>
<dd>To support CRUTH on the difficulty of sourcing these terms...Bluegrass has not recieved much attention in academia, nor in popular media (outside of genre media). So while certain terms and definitions may be reasonably widely accepted within the bluegrass music community, providing citations can be very difficult. That said, it is fairly likely that - if it must be cited - the idea of identifying musicians by "generation" has been discussed or at least mentioned at some time in genre media (such as Bluegrass Unlimited). I don't have adequate access to look for this, but I'm sure it can't be that hard to find such a reference. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 21:59, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I removed Earl Brothers, Open Road, and Jumping Willies from "recent section".

<dd>I have no idea who the Jumping Willies are. I put the Earl Brothers and Open Road in and, not only hasn't there been a flame war, there haven't been any cogent reasons given for taking them out. For fans of traditional bluegrass--still the core of the genre--Open Road is one of the most notable recent bands (recently broken up too, unfortunately). The Earl Brothers have had a lot of buzz on Bgrass-L, just to give a fairly objective reference. Who are all these other bands that could just as well be added? If any are good examples, maybe they should be added, rather than removing these. After all, what's the point of "recent developments" even being in here if we don't want to list any recent developments? And why is it that the only acceptable name under "4th Generation" is someone who doesn't even play bluegrass (with a few exceptions, apparently a song or two on his new album are BG)?</dd>
<dd>As for the word "generation" being a "neologism" (by which I can only conclude you mean coined by this article), that is just nonsense. For one thing, look at the album "Second Generation Bluegrass" by Whitley, Skaggs and Ralph from the early '70s. A simple scan of Google would have shown you numerous colloquial uses of the term (although not, unfortunately, any authoritative taxonomies).</dd>
<dd>I have no idea what standards we are supposed to be adhering to as far as "generations" and artists go, but the article is starting to read like its written by dilettantes who may know some artists from the classic years but recently are only familar with country stars who have crossed over to bluegrass, or bluegrass musicians who have gained mainstream acceptance by playing other styles of music, all of which is TANGENTIAL to the putative purpose of such an article, which should be to give an account of the state of BLUEGRASS music.

<dd>I'm absolutely dumbfounded that someone took it upon themselves to remove the Earl Brothers and Open Road without even bothering to respond to the following: "Also, for fans of traditional bluegrass, bands like the Earl Brothers and Open Road are rather important. Both are nationally touring acts who have multiple commercially available recordings and they have both been showcased at the IBMA. The point of talking about NEW bands is that some of the people around the periphery of the music probably will NOT have heard of them. That doesn't mean that they are irrelevant to an introduction, however, because a mention of new currents that those in the know are tuned in to is an appropriate part of such an article. Why are they being removed?" I will restore them until reasons are given. C Ruth 19:40, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>C Ruth, you turned this into a flame war long ago. Multiple editors, including myself, disagree with your subjective opinions, and you refuse to adopt any sort of objectivity. I'm done with this article, it's yours to butcher (not that you seem to need my blessing or to exist within the community). Not cool, you've really destroyed my opinion of wikipedia.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinepoundjammer_d66d.html" title="User:Ninepoundjammer">Ninepoundjammer</a> 18:32, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure where I've done any flaming. I gave an argument for the inclusion of those bands that you never responded to. Can you name any other notable new bluegrass bands that meet the criteria I presented--nationally touring, featured at IBMA, discussed by BG fans on a national level (see the Bgrass-l listserv for discussions of both bands)? Then list them, I have no idea why your doing so would be objectionable, since "recent developments" is always going to include bands that aren't famous outside of BG circles. Chris Thile, on the other hand, plays almost no bluegrass--I heard there were a couple of BG songs on his new album, but that's the exception, not the rule. Can someone explain to me why someone who is famous and peripheral to bluegrass is a more significant development in bluegrass than someone who is fairly well-known within bluegrass circles, according to verifiable criteria that I have proposed, and--most importantly--ACTUALLY PLAYS BLUEGRASS? Please, give me ONE ARGUMENT as to why my approach is wrong, and I'll stop adding the Earl Brothers and Open Road. Personally, I think if there were 7 or 8 more bands lited under "recent developments" it would be even better--but those are the only ones I can think of that are not basically local acts. C Ruth 21:01, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I did think of another band that meets those criteria, Cherryhomes. I'm not a huge fan, but they are actually way more popular than the two I originally added. I'm sure there's a few more that would be relevant, and I see no reason why they shouldn't be included. Currently the criterion seems to be mainstream fame, hence all the Alison Krauss/Thile stuff, but I think these bands are more relecant to bluegrass. C Ruth 21:07, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>C Ruth, regarding flames, why don't you read your passage about "dilettantes" above and think a little more carefully before you post such remarks. I am NOT a Cherryholmes fan, quite the opposite, but they're out there headlining small festivals and I could get a hold of a CD easily enough. I can't objectively dissent on their inclusion. If we want to get strict about playing "bluegrass", sure seems that the Earl Brothers consciously avoid the word bluegrass in describing themselves, and there are those that would certainly not call them bluegrass. I'm not such a stickler though. I'm more concerned about how widely these groups are known compared to similar groups. Amazon stocks Cherryholmes. Amazon does not stock the Earl Brothers (available through resellers). That's a fair measure of how many people are actually listening to these groups as far as I'm concerned.--<a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENinepoundjammer_d66d.html" title="User:Ninepoundjammer">Ninepoundjammer</a> 17:52, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Bluegrass Now" can be found, logically enough, at www.bluegrassnow.com, as a google search would have revealed to the curious. Here's a reference to the "third generation" from the magazine of record (unfortunately, but that's another story) "Bluegrass Unlimited": "In the years since it briefly flourished, NGR has spawned and inspired not just one but two generations of young newgrass Turks (Nickel Creek being one of the most prominent of the third generation) who have continued to erase boundaries between bluegrass and other popular musical styles while sometimes giving hard-core bluegrassers a bad case of dyspepsia in the process!" (<a href="http://www.bluegrassmusic.com/index.php?em192=88932_0__0_~0~443~751_-1_10_2006_0_0&amp;issue=88796" class="external free" title="http://www.bluegrassmusic.com/index.php?em192=88932_0__0_~0~443~751_-1_10_2006_0_0&amp;issue=88796" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluegrassmusic.com/index.php?em192=88932_0__0_~0~443~751_-1_10_2006_0_0&amp;issue=88796</a>) References to the "first generation" are most common, indeed so common as to be not worth citing, if nobody insists. It stands to reason that if there is a "first generation," there has to be a second. It also stands to reason that if the first generation encompasses ten years, the second probably doesn't encompass 50 years, hence there is probably at least a third. "Third generation" is used in the bluegrass parlance and I have yet to hear a cogent argument against its employment. "Fourth generation " is certainly debatable. The point, however, is that these are terms of convenience--nobody is going to find platonic forms of the generations that end all debate forever. If the terms are somewhat fluid and arguable, it's still preferable to use "third generation" than to make the ridiculous claim that Red Allen and Chris Thile are of the same "generation" of bluegrass.

<dd>The truly curious might have followed my aforementioned link to the title of the article at "bluegassnow.com". The problem is that the content of the article is not online so unless one has access to a collection of back issues the article's subject is left to speculation. Who is claiming Red Allen and Chris Thile are of the same generation? My point has been that no taxonomy of generations is sufficiently well-defined to organize a history of bluegrass (I have <i>never</i> said that two is better than three or four or five for that matter, and I wish you'd stop getting stuck on that point). Still, I'm willing to let those actively working on the article organize it however they please for now, but if you can cite a source to define the terms you are using please do. The article really does need better sourcing (as has been noted below regarding the GA re-review). -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 20:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, my last post was hasty, in regard to 1. my snide comment about where to find Bluegrass Now, which I apologize for and retract--I assume one could just email them about back issues. And 2. I guess I was still arguing against your earlier post which seemed to suggest there were only 2 generations, but if your thing is to get rid of the generations altogether, I wouldn't object if you did. This is pretty common parlance, but we are probably never going to get a strict taxonomy unless someone takes it upon themself to propose one, unless the book you cited has already done so. I personally am now convinced it would be much better to go by decade, and that would result in a richer and more complete account than we have now, but I haven't the time and energy to do that myself right now. How about a show of hands, as it were, as to whether this is a good idea in principle, though? Ideally, I imagine, it could start with bluegrass precursors in the '30s, and it could mention under the account of the '50s which artists are still considered "first generation."

<p>I don't think the article's lead sufficiently summarizes what bluegrass music is. The second sentence touches on it, but the first sentence (50% of the lead) mostly relates bluegrass to other musics (English, Irish, Scottish, blues, jazz, etc.). Not sure yet how to fix it, as the question "What is bluegrass?" is a complex one to which the only answer I've found is the circular response "Bluegrass music is the stuff played by bluegrass bands." <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 16:04, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know your format for editing, or suggestion for change.. but dern. This whole article needs re-authored by someone with more knowledge on the subject. You state bluegrass became popular after the 1940's.. Please tell me then what my ancestors were playing after dinner (from my family's oral history) 30 years prior to the civil war? When speaking on the historical side of a subject, it's not typical to date its origins to the era in which the subject's popularity rose. Don't take my statement the wrong way, I'm not saying the whole article is 100% incorrect.. I'm stating that Bluegrass music was around more than 100 years longer than you're giving it credit, and *yes* it was called Bluegrass back then, not "folk" music ,"old time" music, or "Appalachian Folk" music as your article would lead others to believe. I remember many times as a youngster hearing an ancient bluegrass tune about building the slave walls! I'm sorry, if I'm posting in the wrong format.

<dd>According to the <i>Rough Guide to World Music</i>, "It goes against every instinct held by a folklorist to assert that a music has been 'invented', but bluegrass comes the closest. In 1938 Bill Monroe... formed a group of musicians which he named the Blue Grass Boys. Monroe was born in Kentucky, the Blue Grass State -- hence the name of the band." <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 07:02, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Minstrelsy: Yes, but minstrel music (probably the first specifically commercial music with American folk roots) doesn't sound much like bluegrass. "Turkey in the Straw" and "Oh, Susannah" are about the closest it comes. -- 23:05, August 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was just suggesting a possible source for a "tune about building the slave walls." There are a lot of songs commonly played in bluegrass which predate its beginning: <i>White House Blues</i>, <i>Molly and Tenbrook</i>, and <i>John Henry</i>, for example probably began life as broadsheet ballads (or something like that) in 1901, 1878, and the 1870s or 1880s, respectively. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 12:06, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Appalachian music of the 1920s and earlier <b>does</b> however sound like bluegrass. I've heard examples, and my own grandfather played bluegrasslike music going back to before this says bluegrass existed and I have recorded samples of his playing to prove that. Just because a people lacked record deals or the connections to get on sheet music doesn't mean they cease to exist. There is an oral history, and among modern historians this can be deemed quite valid. "Bluegrass" as a term is a creation of Bill Monroe in the 1930s, but as a kind of music it is far far older. Traditional Scottish fiddle music from the 1700s is what I'd consider the origin, not "minstrelry." The person who complained was right too and the dismissals of the complaints strike me as a bit of snobbery.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<p>I think I may have found my confusion. International Bluegrass music association mentions part of the origins being from Scotland in the 1600s.<a href="http://www.ibma.org/about.bluegrass/history/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ibma.org/about.bluegrass/history/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> However this kind of music was apparently called "mountain music"<a href="http://www.zianet.com/elm-st-station/blu-hist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zianet.com/elm-st-station/blu-hist.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> or North Carolina Scots-Irish music.<a href="http://www.nativeground.com/originsofbluegrass.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nativeground.com/originsofbluegrass.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. To be honest I think the North Carolina Scots-Irish traditional music and "mountain music" sound enough like bluegrass they're often now just called bluegrass. That's probably what I, and the complaining person, were thinking of. The article mentions many songs now counted as bluegrass are traditional Appalachian folk medlets. The main difference being bluegrass took these influences and added others to make it more populist.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>Well, like all genres of music, bluegrass' exact boundaries are fuzzy. "Mountain music" does sound like bluegrass, but it's not the same thing, and it isn't usually called <i>bluegrass</i>, I think. Bluegrass evolved out of, among other things, the largely Scots-Irish music of Appalachia, of which North Carolina mountain music is a regional variety (and, IIRC, a particularly important one in influence on bluegrass). This article doesn't really cover origins too well, I think, but does mention and link to "<a href="../../../o/l/d/Old-time_music.html" title="Old-time music">old-time music</a>", which amounts to more or less the same thing in this context. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 04:52, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having grown up in Central Virginia (b. 1957), and spent many idle childhood to teenage summers in the mountains of Southwest Virginia (which is the only creditation I have) I would say Bill Monroe:</p>
<p>1) Followed up in A.P. Carter's footsteps by bringing mountain music to the masses. Your own article on Mr. Carter talks about him recording staples like Keep on the Sunny Side before 1940, as well as Carter bringing a blues musician with him to help transcribe the music in the mid-30's. This sort of shows bluegrass' influence on Blues, IMHO.</p>
<p>2) Gave the music it's name.</p>
<p>3) Found Earl Scruggs. Again, an opinion, but I believe Scruggs had as much to do with Monroe's sucess as the other way around. The banjo was pretty much strummed (ala ragtime, also influenced by mountain music) before Scruggs. He brought it to the front, and gave the music another lead to alternate. This was always done with the mandolin and fiddle, until Scruggs.</p>
<p>Monroe was definitely important, and he may have formally named it, but he didn't invent it. And I think Bluegrass is the influential music on country, ragtime, and jazz, not the other way around. IF, the music was invented by Monroe in the 40's (66 years ago?) how does a guy 90 years old play it? And I saw guys in their late ages (60's 70's 80's...) playing at MANY, MANY "Fiddler's conventions", "Bluegrass festivals", whatever you want to call them, in the 70's.</p>
<p>How long have the Western North Carolinians been "clogging"? You need Bluegrass music to clog, or (as we called it) flatfoot to. These are the styles of dance. And, again, I've seen OLD guys flatfotting at Fiddlers conventions. What I mean is, a guy in 1975, a person that was, say 60 (being conservative), would have been 25, and just going to WW2 in 1940. Their music was Big Band. Now, he's flatfooting to bluegrass in the mid 70's. If the guy was 70, he was 35 when Monroe hit it. Will either of these guys ( at the ages of 25 and 35, in 1940) be learning new dances? Not likely. They learn to dance to it when they are 10. That means a guy 75 years old, flatfooting to bluegrass in 1975, learned how in 1910. And he learned it from his sister, or cousin, or maybe his mother and/or fatner to help socialize at gatherings. Which means it was taught by someone maybe 20, who learned it from... well you get the idea.</p>
<p>Mountain music has been around(in some form) just about as long as English, Irish and Scots have been in the US. It evolved and changed, slowly, because the players were mountain folk. It wasn't played in town much, it was always Old Timey. But it changed and evolved. A. P. Carter took it one step, Bill Monroe another. But the people have played it and danced to it for a long time.</p>

<dd>Bluegrass is a very specific style of music. It is related to musics that have been around for longer. To some degree, the line separating bluegrass from other styles is blurry and arbitrary, as it is for all music genres. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 02:39, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To take an analogous matter in very different music: sure, in retrospect early Jonathan Richman sounds like punk, and so does even much of the Velvet Underground and the New York Dolls and maybe even very early Who, but we don't usually say anything before 1976 or so was "punk". - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:06, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just for starters:
<ol>
<li>Most of it is unreferenced.</li>
<li>It talks about what genres influenced bluegrass, but doesn't give any description of the nature of the influence (what came from what genre, what was dropped?).</li>
<li>It's about a genre of music, but there are no musical snippets.</li>
<li>We don't track the geographical spread, and we don't say much about how it fit into the music industry.</li>
<li>We don't have a notably good reference list for further reading</li>
<li>The one image in the article is pretty indifferent.</li>

<dd>I've reorganized this a bit into a format that is more like how Wikipedia's music genre articles are evolving. (it's not really standard yet, but they're moving in that direction) The "social and musical impact" section may or may not be necessary in this case (it's hard to think of any social impact, though there's certainly some musical impacts that could be stated). I've put the movies in a subsection there, though that really ought to be made into prose or moved to list of movies with bluegrass music or something -- I know there's a bluegrass book I read once that had a whole chapter on bluegrass in soundtracks, but I'm not sure which one. I've also removed the whole "notable artists" section as unnecessary. The Associations, Publications and Museums sections could probably be merged, along with festivals, into a section (maybe "Organizations, media and festivals"?), which would need to be prose, not a list. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 02:52, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Social impact was, I suppose, not divisible from musical impact, but bluegrass has played a role in various interpenetration of cultures: it's been one of the bridges between Southern traditions and the counterculture, and it's been a worldwide symbol of aspects of America that are not as slickly commercial as most pop music. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:10, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Bluegrass bands have included instruments as diverse as drums, electric guitar, accordion, harmonica, mouth harp, and piano, though these are not widely accepted within the bluegrass community."</p>
<p>Have electric versions of other string instruments also been used? Is there any information on Bluegrass rock?203.214.75.127.</p>
<dl>
<dd>All of the common bluegrass instruments have been played in an electric version. I know of the following being used: electric guitar, electric mandolin (possibly also electric mandola), electric fiddle, electric bass (guitar or upright), electric banjo (very rare), electric keyboard/piano, pedal steel. I have never heard the term "Bluegrass rock" before, but I can certainly think of some instances in which it might apply. (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Grass_Revival_6a9a.html" title="New Grass Revival">New Grass Revival</a> in the late 1970s playing with Leon Redman, Earl Scruggs Revue, <a href="../../../o/s/b/Osborne_Brothers_632d.html" title="Osborne Brothers">Osborne Brothers</a> as well as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_8dce.html" title="New South">New South</a> in the mid-70s, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Druh%C3%A1_Tr%C3%A1va_6d51.html" title="Druhá Tráva">Druhá Tráva</a>, etc.) Most of those groups used drums, electric bass, electric guitar, and possibly electric fiddles and keyboards. This is more commonly just considered an outgrowth of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_bluegrass.html" title="Progressive bluegrass">Progressive bluegrass</a>. In considering the idea of "Bluegrass rock" you would also have to consider the flip side ("rock" or other "mainstream" musicians influenced by bluegrass), which could include <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Byrds_72ba.html" title="The Byrds">The Byrds</a>, and cross-over artists such as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Skaggs_28d8.html" title="Ricky Skaggs">Ricky Skaggs</a>. This also raises the question of where you draw the line between electrified bluegrass and country music. I suspect it comes down to use of the banjo and (as anyone who has played with <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._D._Crowe_d0c5.html" title="J. D. Crowe">J. D. Crowe</a> would say) timing. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmadler_e33e.html" title="User:Cmadler">Cmadler</a> 12:47, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are you shooting for with "Bluegrass in Movies"? Excepting "That High Lonesome Sound" and "King of Bluegrass: The Life and Times of Jimmy Martin", it seems to be a list of commercial movies with examples of a few pieces of bluegrass music in the soundtrack. I would suggest a more comprehensive listing or a correction in your heading. For instance, "The Ralph Stanley Story" directed by Herb E. Smith in 2001 and "Earl Scruggs: His Family and Friends" directed by David Hoffman in 1971 as well as many other films aren't mentioned. -AFinney 71.139.38.142 04:46, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a source that talks about possible links between bluegrass and reggae. I have noticed that fast bluegrass always has a strong offbeat emphasis from the rhythm instruments while the bass hits the downbeat. That is very similar to reggae and current popular music in Africa. A good history of Bluegrass seems like a good place to start looking. There isn't anything mentioned in the article about this offbeat in bluegrass. I have seen lots of people in webpages talk about that. Need sources. It would be nice to describe why bluegrass is different than country. I've talked to foreigners who can't tell the difference between pop and country and its getting hard these days.<a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunchy_Numbers_8121.html" title="User:Crunchy Numbers">-Crunchy Numbers</a> 23:21, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
