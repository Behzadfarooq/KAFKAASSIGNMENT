<p>I'm not sure how to make articles, but if you would be so kind as to start an article on Pumpkin Festivals and Shows and possibly another on a List of Pumpkin Festival and Show Queens, I'd be happy to flesh these out and move all references to these articles from the Pumpkin page. Then, we could just have a See Also link to the Wikipedia article. Let's work together on this! Again, just start a stub, and I'll flesh it in. After all, there are easily more than a half dozen festivals for pumpkins that go back decades, some even as far back as a century! So, it's relevant enough to have an article or two. Best, --164.107.92.120 17:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just add a section to the pumpkin article, called ==Festivals== or similar (a separate article is not necessary). But remember the section must contain encyclopedic information, otherwise it is liable to being removed. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 17:40, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think a separate article could be warranted or maybe just separate articles for each major festival, as there already is one for the Circleville festival. --24.154.173.243 00:38, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The new page is wonderful and definitely a great start. I have no qualms about not re-adding those links to the pumpkin article, as the separate article on pumpkin queens is an excellent solution and does indeed provide sound references and enough information already to be justified. I think it's fair to say that the pumpkin page no longer needs protection as the dispute is resolved and I'm not going to re-add the links back to that article.

<p>You said "Hi, I noticed you moved Veblen good to Veblen goods, all the other good articles are singular, and my econ dictionary is singular as well. So either the move needs to be reversed or the other articles need to be moved as well. thanks Martin 08:29, 4 October 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Martin,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, apologies for the name change. I started off as RichBerry but, since I dabble from the office, I wished to be a little more anonymous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes I did notice, when I moved the article, that there are many other articles that use "good" in the singular.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I must confess that, being a new Wikipedian, it was during a sudden rush of blood to the head that made me decide to "be bold" and make the change. However, I was daunted by the scale of the task when I started following the links.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was hoping that the article's name change and the comment I left on the discussion page would lead to some enthusiastic debate. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm for debate, or perhaps the article I elected to change is a little too obscure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously I feel strongly enough about how the word is used to have made the change, but I don't want to bombastically impose my will either. So, perhaps the two of us can start the ball rolling on the <a href="../../../v/e/b/Veblen_goods.html" title="Veblen goods">Veblen goods</a> discussion page?</dd>

<p>Hello, Martin. Would implementing something like [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage&amp;diff=79917298&amp;oldid=79905174" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage&amp;diff=79917298&amp;oldid=79905174" rel="nofollow">this</a>] help to reduce your stress? I think that it would allow you to clearly answer users who should not have the tool based on their past inappropriate behavior. Essentially, the tool is powerful and in the wrong hands could allow a vandal to harm a very large number of articles in a very short period of time. Let's just state that and then hopefully then you can get back to what you like to do and not have to worry about all this disruption. If you don't object, I would be happy to make the changes on the checkpage header. --<a href="../../../a/f/t/User%7EAfter_Midnight_e273.html" title="User:After Midnight">After Midnight</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/f/t/User_talk%7EAfter_Midnight_381d.html" title="User talk:After Midnight">0001</a></small></sup> 11:14, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Martin, Cheers for the input =)</p>
<p>I now tend to use a copy of AWB from the SVN.</p>
<p>I was looking at the database scanner, is it the AWB specific 'Typo' that would need to be scanned for?</p>
<p>Also, for the dump to grab, am i after pages-meta-current.xml.bz2?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<dl>
<dd>Hi, yes the typos are the AWB specific ones (it loads them up when you start the scan), the file to get is pages-articles.xml.bz2, this doesn't contain user pages etc. so is quite a bit smaller. When scanning the database, the first results tend to have a lot of false positives as they have already been checked, so don't worry if you are finding a lot to start with. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 17:40, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If this is just the account you run AWB on, why call it a bot? AWB's article explicitly states that it isn't a bot.</p>
<p>If you are using AWB personally (and not automated), what procedures have you developed?</p>
<p>What do you use it for?</p>

<p>Hi, Martin . I see you're preparing new release of AWB. Please don't include latest IRCM from CVS - it's kinda undertested and does not support checkpage yet. I'll try to get it to work in next two days. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxSem_bf93.html" title="User:MaxSem">Max<font size="+1"><i>S</i></font>em</a> 21:02, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think I've done it. Two issues: 1) IRCM has the different version number, so either it should be synchronized with AWB, or checkpage format should be modified. Decision is up to you. 2) List of sysops on check page isn't needed, I load priveleges directly from Query API. Later, I'll integrate this code into UpdateWikiStatus(). <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxSem_bf93.html" title="User:MaxSem">Max<font size="+1"><i>S</i></font>em</a> 20:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hallo Bluemoose. I don't know if this is the best place to ask this, but how would you suggest preventing repeated AWB "corrections" of alternate spellings? See <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josias_Priest_795a.html" title="Josias Priest">Josias Priest</a> ([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josias_Priest&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josias_Priest&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Josias_Priest&amp;action=history</a> history) for example, where a man born in the 17th century has an alternate spelling of his name, Preist. This has been corrected to Priest by AWB runners a couple of times, even in the persondata "alternate names" field, where I would think that if someone were physically checking the edits they would catch it. Is there any way to not have to just perpetually revert AWB-in-bot-mode edits on that article? I've already put in a &lt;!--comment--&gt;, but since it's already been changed three times in the fairly obvious "Alternative names" field, I'm worried the comment isn't going to help.

<p>Re: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consecrated_life.html" title="Consecrated life">Consecrated life</a>, thank you for your warning. It does not really fit the existing categories, because - as the article shows - it comprises not only "religious orders" but also individuals not organized into "orders". How about allocating the article to "Christian group structuring"? Or "Christian law"? Or change the title of a suitable exisitng category to "Consecrated Life/Religious Life"? 81.159.184.112 19:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Quick question regarding the sources for AWB/Wiki Functions /Visual Studio</p>
<p>You have AWB and IRCMonitor referenced to the bin folder for WikiFunctions.</p>
<p>I have noticed that when you swap between Debug and Release, it changes the dir in the WikiFunctions Bin folder to get the WF to place in the AWB/IRC folders.</p>
<p>I was just wondering how you got it to do that, and also how you tell it to compile the DLL first</p>
<p>Do you need setup in Solution properties, common properties, project dependicies? And tell the project it depends on the DLL, as well as adding it as a reference?</p>

<dd>The way to add references like this is not to reference the dll/exe but to reference the project by doing: add reference =&gt; Projects =&gt; select project.

<p>Thank you for taking part in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_SB_Johnny_b3c2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/SB Johnny">my RfA</a>. The RfA was <b>not</b> successful, mostly because I did a pretty bad job of presenting myself. I'll run again sometime in the next few months, in the hopes that some will reconsider.</p>
<p>In the meantime, one of the projects I'm working on is <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Wikimedia_Administrator%27s_Handbook" class="extiw" title="b:A_Wikimedia_Administrator's_Handbook">A Wikimedia Administrator's Handbook</a>. This is a wikibook how-to guide intended to help new administrators learn the ropes, as well as to simply "demystify" what adminship entails. If you are an administrator, please help out with writing it, particularly on the technical aspects of the tools. Both administrators and non-administrators are welcome to help link in and sort all of the various policies regarding the use of these tools on wikipedia in particular (as well as other projects: for example, I have almost no experience with how things work on wiktionary or wikinews). Users who are neither familiar with policy or the sysop tools could be of great help by asking questions about anything that's unclear. The goal is to get everything together in one place, with a narrative form designed to anticipate the reader's next question.</p>
<p>A second project, related but not entailed, is a book on wikimedia in general, with a history of how various policies evolved over time, interesting trivia (e.g., what the heck was "wikimoney" about?), and a history of how the wikimedia foundation itself came about and the larger issues that occurred during its history (such as the infamous "Spanish Fork").</p>
<p>Again, thanks for your input on the RfA, and thanks in advance for any help you might be able to provide for the handbook. --<a href="../../../s/b/_/User%7ESB_Johnny_4962.html" title="User:SB Johnny"><font color="green"><b>SB_Johnny</b></font></a>|<sup><a href="../../../s/b/_/User_talk%7ESB_Johnny_91f0.html" title="User talk:SB Johnny"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup>|<sub><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:SBJohnny" class="extiw" title="b:User:SBJohnny"><font color="green">books</font></a></sub> 13:26, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Martin. I've got a question about AWB. I've noticed on several articles that AWB users are converting <a href="../../../f/r/a/Template%7EFrac_96e1.html" title="Template:Frac">template:frac</a> to the Unicode equivalent. I'm not sure this is a good idea. The frac template produces more readable fractions (at least on my machine) with slightly large nominators and denominators. More importantly the frac template makes it easier for editors to change the values, as many people don't know how to generate Unicode characters and some machines can't. Further, the frac template allows any arbitrary character to be produced, while some fractions aren't in the Unicode character set. This means that some corrections can't be made using Unicode characters alone.</p>
<p>As far as I know there isn't a Manual of Style guideline that suggests the use of Unicode characters over the frac template - if one exists please let me know. Many thanks, <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 03:20, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its not really an AWB question, if you disagree with someone's edits then you should take it up with them, I would expect them to stop what they are doing until an agreement has been made. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 12:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>p.s. Just for clarity: AWB does not <i>automatically</i> convert the frac template, or do anything to it. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 13:29, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That was my first thought. I asked <a href="../../../h/m/a/User%7EHmains_e270.html" title="User:Hmains">User:Hmains</a> about it as he was converting frac templates. His reply was: "I use AWB for several purposes. One of the default automatic options is to convert the article to unicode. I just use the default; I am not looking to change fractions, etc. What I have found in that the AWB defaults seem to implement MoS so I do not question them. Could you perhaps take this up with the AWB owner/maintainer?"</dd>
<dd>Can you clarify? Hmains believes he is using AWB default settings, you're suggesting its something in HMains' settings. I'd like to track down where this is coming from if possible.

<dd>If you mean edits like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_industrial_narrow_gauge_railways&amp;diff=88152488&amp;oldid=88081877" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=British_industrial_narrow_gauge_railways&amp;diff=88152488&amp;oldid=88081877" rel="nofollow">this</a>, it's no mistake, since <tt>&amp;frac12;</tt> is not a template inclusion, but HTML entitity that corresponds to Unicode character Â½, whereas template looks like this: <tt>{{frac|1|2}}</tt> and expands to <small><sup>1</sup><big>â</big><sub>2</sub></small>. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxSem_bf93.html" title="User:MaxSem">Max<font size="+1"><i>S</i></font>em</a> 16:30, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought of making an article "Shrinathji" on Wikipedia. I found it already existed as stub. I was so happy and delighted to see external web-site incorporated by you. "Shree Krishna Sharanam Mam:" chanting made my morning pleasant.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. I am doing non-sense now in the process of making an article. With the blessings of "Shrinathji", I will certainly be instrumental in creation of this article.</p>
<p>I look for your help and well wishes.</p>
<p>Thanks once again.</p>
