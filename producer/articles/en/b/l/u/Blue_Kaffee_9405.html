	    <p><b>Blue Kaffee</b> (commonly referred to by the acronym <b>BK</b> and contracted by some to <b>Bluekaffee</b>) is a web-based <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community.html" title="Community">community</a> founded and operated in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_4e85.html" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. It provides standard social community features, including a web-based journal system, a messaging system, and a set of web forums. It is unique in terms of geographic scope as well as size; according to the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">Alexa</a> web statistics service, Blue Kaffee is the most popular web site in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador as of April 2006 (but has claimed the rank of second and fifth for certain months during 2004 and 2005). The validity of this statistic is disputed as the site ranked number one on the occasions that Blue Kaffee was ranked number two, La Senza <a href="http://www.lasenza.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lasenza.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, is that of a lingerie store company based in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Québec</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> with store branches around the world. La Senza has since been removed from this list.</p>
<p>Blue Kaffee has a community of approximately 20,000 members of which about half are frequently active. The web forums contain roughly one million posts in 50,000 topics, the journal system is home to approximately 700,000 journal posts, and over 4.5 million comments have been left on journal entries, writings, gallery images, and news posts. It has been featured prominently in local media, including the feature article<a href="http://www.bluekaffee.com/topicview.php?topic=22243" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bluekaffee.com/topicview.php?topic=22243" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> of the <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> issue of The Express <a href="http://www.theexpress.ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theexpress.ca" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>The main audience of Blue Kaffee are teenagers in the Newfoundland and Labrador geographic area, although members in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and other provinces of Canada and members as old as forty five years of age can be found.</p>
<p>The name "Blue Kaffee" is mispronounced by some as (phonetic) <i>blü kafā</i> (like <i>café</i>). The proper pronunciation is (phonetic) <i>blü kafē</i> (like the German word for coffee: <i>kaffee</i>).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Organization and History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Organization and History</span></h2>
<p>The site was created in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2002.html" title="October 2002">October 2002</a> by Chad "Kaffee" Levesque as a local replacement to the popular <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html#Other_sites_running_the_LiveJournal_engine" title="LiveJournal">DeadJournal</a> journal service. At the time, the site was hosted from Chad "Kaffee" Levesque's home PC using a residential <a href="../../../a/d/s/ADSL_ed50.html" title="ADSL">ADSL</a> Internet connection. Over the first few months it had evolved from primarily a personal journal project of the creator to the community-oriented web site it still is at the time of this writing. After a server crash caused the loss of all of the data associated with the site in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2003.html" title="February 2003">February 2003</a>, Blue Kaffee 2.0 was launched, promising additional functionality, increased security, and optimized <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code.html" title="Code">code</a>.</p>
<p>The site was hosted for most of 2003 and the early months of 2004 by the Exodian Network <a href="http://www.exodian.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.exodian.net" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, administrated by StealthCat. During his administratorship, the task of programming new features and cleaning up existing code was taken care of by the community at large. Programmers included Mike "vh1" Wyatt, Shane "kr4z" O'Connell, Steven "Wilson" Wilson, Gerry "pandemic" Hall, and StealthCat himself. While this period resulted in the implementation of several critical features and a large expansion in terms of userbase, the implemented code was often sluggish, unresponsive, and proved to be a technical setback for future administrators.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2003, Blue Kaffee began to issue <a href="../../../t/-/s/T-shirts.html" title="T-shirts">t-shirts</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoodies.html" title="Hoodies">hoodies</a> as a way of raising a nominal amount of income and promoting the sites brand amongst local teens. The merchandise proved to be quite successful and spawned a follow-up run in the summer of 2004.</p>
<p>Plans for a new, third version of Blue Kaffee emerged during this time period. The effort was initially spearheaded by StealthCat before being passed off to Tracey "Raisin" Hickey and later to Aaron "stump" Rudkin before finally being scrapped in favour of an incremental development process.</p>
<p>After a disagreement on the areas of finances and administration, Kaffee purchased a dedicated server on a 10 <a href="../../../m/b/i/Mbit_s_4d84.html" title="Mbit/s">Mbit/s</a> line provided by Layered Technologies <a href="http://www.layeredtech.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.layeredtech.com" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> to take care of the site. The sudden need for funding resulted in Blue Kaffee fundraising events, including "movie nights" and concerts featuring local youth entertainment.</p>
<p>Starting in April 2004, Blue Kaffee launched a community <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_radio.html" title="Web radio">web radio</a> station called "Blue Kaffee Web Radio" run primarily by administrator Steven "Wilson" Wilson. This service has been provided intermittently until January 2005 but was revived in March 2006.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2004, Aaron "stump" Rudkin rejoined the sites administrative team, expanding the feature base of the website, rewriting existing programming code, and assuming administrative duties. The site is now programmed by stump, Wilson, and Kaffee and is constantly optimized and expanded. Administrative affairs are taken care of by a team of local youth, including the three programmers, Heather "Dagny" Labonté, Jason "Typhoeus" Peddle, and a wide team of moderators who work to enforce strict rules against harassment and inappropriate content.</p>
<p>As of 2005, Blue Kaffee was widely recognized across the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, was undergoing exponential growth, and was financially independent without resorting to advertising or pay-for-access features.</p>
<p>As of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_5.html" title="March 5">March 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the website was officially declared temporarily out of service. This resulted in a lack of funds being raised. Most of the site's donations came from concerts specifically created for the site. The most recent one saw the lowest number of guests, even lower amount of money and resulted in a loss of $250. Of the estimated $400, only about $64 was raised. This in turn forced the administration to shut the website down until its former goal of $650 was reached. Response to this action was high and immediate and the goal was exceeded the next day by 35% before the site was restored.</p>
<p>The site was moved to another Layered Technologies server on a 100 Mbit/s line on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> as the expense to do so had decreased from previous rates.</p>
<p>As of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">March 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, the site employed the use of Google Advertising to help pay for the cost of maintaining the site, after private funds, and donations ran out.</p>

<p>The core functionality of Blue Kaffee has always been an online journal or "<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>" system. The vast majority of users are introduced to the site through this feature, which allows users to write about anything they see fit and customize visibility and display options.</p>
<p>Blue Kaffee features an easy to manage "friends list", allowing users to identify and contact friends or acquaintances and categorize them, not unlike similar features offered by <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a>, or other online communities.</p>
<p>Blue Kaffee offers an online photo and art gallery service, similar to <a href="../../../d/e/v/DeviantART_5bd3.html" title="DeviantART">deviantART</a> and plans to expand to host user-submitted images in the future. Blue Kaffee also offers an online writings portfolio service, allowing users to share poetry, short stories, and other writings.</p>

<p>As with any community appealing to young web users, Blue Kaffee has been criticized for allowing youth to share what some say is excessive amounts of information to an unknown userbase. Site owners disagree, arguing that all information shared is completely voluntary, that young users are warned before sharing information, and that parents should engage in filtering should they desire to control the access their children have to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. The site was cited during Fall 2004 web safety sessions provided by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Newfoundland_Constabulary_d2a9.html" title="Royal Newfoundland Constabulary">Royal Newfoundland Constabulary</a> at local schools as being a significant privacy threat, although no known instances of abuse or harassment have resulted in charges or damage being done.</p>

<p>During Winter 2005, Blue Kaffee came under fire by a <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_2caf.html" title="St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador">St. John's</a> high school, arguing that students were making use of the journal service to post <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libelous</a> remarks against teachers and school administration. Blue Kaffee administration responded by warning users that they would be liable for any illegal remarks made on their journals, and urging users to exercise discretion and to make use of available privacy features.</p>

<p>Many local schools have prohibited access to Blue Kaffee via school computers because they claim that it, similar to other online communities, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_messaging.html" title="Instant messaging">instant messaging</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solitaire.html" title="Solitaire">Solitaire</a> have resulted in a significant drop in student and employee productivity.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Mocha Café">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mocha Café</span></h3>
<p>Several derivatives of Blue Kaffee, vying for the same audience but started by members of Blue Kaffee, have emerged since 2002. The most popular, Mocha Café started on Jun 16, 2004 boasts 111 active members (they delete all inactive members) by the time it closed on May 20, 2005. Some users have traditionally preferred Mocha Café to Blue Kaffee, given its lax moderation and content control policy. Ironically the only users that abused Mocha Café were moderators of Blue Kaffee. Mocha Café locked up the site permanently on May 20, 2005, because the owner lost interest. On August 10, 2005 the site was unlocked and no longer belongs www.themocha.com. However there is no active members and little moderation mainly because not many people know about its new URL.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Moderation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Moderation</span></h3>
<p>Some users and former users have alleged that site administration is inconsistent, heavy-handed, and focuses on quality control rather than user freedom. Other users have complained about a perceived drop in site quality as the community expands. Moderation and Administration replies indicate that while they are aware of these problems, they believe it to be impossible to find any one solution to the issue.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of Moderators - Administrators, Moderators, and Forum-Specific Moderators.</p>
<p>Administrators are the head decision makers on Blue Kaffee, and are involved with banning of users when necessary.</p>
<p>Moderators: These individuals are charged with the safe operation of Blue Kaffee as a whole.</p>
<p>Forum-specific Moderators: These moderators have control over the operation and safe maintenance of an individual section of the forums page.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Folklore">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Folklore</span></h2>
<p>In the almost three year history of Blue Kaffee, several significant elements of folklore have emerged.</p>
<p><a name="Blue_Kaffee_Battles" id="Blue_Kaffee_Battles"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Blue Kaffee Battles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blue Kaffee Battles</span></h3>
<p>In early 2003, Kaffee started a popularity contest between prominent members of Blue Kaffee called "Blue Kaffee Battles". Thirty two of the most prominent members of the site were paired off and eliminated until moderator Cheryl "trix" Ozon, and users Greg "yiQ" Dale and Becky "bex" Fulford were pitted head to head in a final round that resulted in "bex" being crowned the "Queen of Blue Kaffee".</p>
<p><a name="Blue_Kaffee_Pope" id="Blue_Kaffee_Pope"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Blue Kaffee Pope">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blue Kaffee Pope</span></h3>
<p>In the run-up to the death of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>, several members of Blue Kaffee entered into a community <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_pool.html" title="Dead pool">death pool</a> placing predictions on when the Pontiff would die. The winner, crowned "Blue Kaffee Pope" was Mark "MarquisMark" Butt. Since then there has been a second Pope named. Tyler "Tyle!" Power was made a second Pope for reasons unknown to most Blue Kaffee users.</p>
<p><a name="George" id="George"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: George">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">George</span></h3>
<p>George is an imaginary administrator of Blue Kaffee, who issues messages to users about system issues and supposedly protects Blue Kaffee from hackers and other ruffians. An invented personal drama involving George and his relationship with other moderators and administrators (specifically Heather "m33p" Stares) is a running joke on the site.</p>
<p><a name="My_inbox_is_a_big_white_screen.21" id="My_inbox_is_a_big_white_screen.21"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: My inbox is a big white screen!">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">My inbox is a big white screen!</span></h3>
<p>A bug that originated in late 2004 involving malformed colour tags caused the message inbox of a users Blue Kaffee account to appear as a distorted white screen. Despite the fact that a fix was posted immediately instructing users how to avoid the problem, and that this issue was referenced in multiple separate locations, users continued to complain about experiencing the problem, leading some users to wonder if the users complaining had even tried to solve the problem before complaining. This issue was resolved in August 2005.</p>
<p><a name="Jabber" id="Jabber"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Jabber">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jabber</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/b/Jabber.html" title="Jabber">Jabber</a>, an instant messaging client, has a special place in the folkloric history of Blue Kaffee. Many users, when asked to provide a Jabber contact, have been known to write what they feel to be humorous remarks in the text field. An example of such a joke is "Jabber? I'll Jabber you in a minute!"</p>
<p><a name="Joke_Pages" id="Joke_Pages"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Kaffee_9405.html" title="Edit section: Joke Pages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Joke Pages</span></h3>
<p>The administrative team of Blue Kaffee, especially Kaffee himself, take delight in occasionally replacing the design of the site with an altered version. The first of these jokes appeared on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, when Kaffee changed the site to "Pink Kaffee". Future incarnations, including "Drunk Kaffee" and "Green Money" have confused users and generated a firestorm of controversy and laughter. Other less laughable additions include "Zombie Kaffee" <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallowe%27en.html" title="Hallowe'en">Hallowe'en</a> and "Christmas Kaffee" <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>
