<p>The <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railway</a> had an earlier history under the name Blue Ridge Railway which was organized before the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> and had some rather ambitious projects which never were fully developed. One of these was to build a road from Wahalla, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chattanooga.html" title="Chattanooga">Chattanooga</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> which would have shortened the route to Chattanooga by cutting off Atlanta and thus creating an economic boon to the border areas of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, South Carolina and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a> with this connection to the West. The Blue Ridge Railway had begun business around the late 1840s and connected <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina_d5d8.html" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a> with the Upstate from the original tracks that ran from Charleston to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg%2C_Aiken_County%2C_South_Carolina_1537.html" title="Hamburg, Aiken County, South Carolina">Hamburg</a> (North Augusta, SC today). It ran from Columbia to Greenville via what is now Newberry, SC. thence to Abbeville and Belton and from there to Greenville, SC. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Chesnut_0ad1.html" title="Mary Chesnut">Mary Chesnut</a> in her diaries mentions this road. It was for a long while the ONLY upstate railroad until what is now the Norfolk and Southern built a road around 1890.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ridge_and_Atlantic_Railroad_22f8.html" title="Edit section: Legend">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legend</span></h2>
<p>Because of its early operational period to the upstate; the Blue Ridge railroad has been the subject of legends and mis-information for over 100 years regarding the Fall of Richmond. Folks in <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbeville%2C_South_Carolina_0766.html" title="Abbeville, South Carolina">Abbeville</a>, S.C. will swear that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Jefferson_315b.html" title="President Jefferson">President Jefferson</a> brought a steam locomotive train load of Confederate gold from Richmond's Banks to Abbeville and buried it near the present railroad tracks or near the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savannah_River_5856.html" title="Savannah River">Savannah River</a> (now under water). People in Chester, SC and in Washington, Ga will tell the same tale. This is simply not true. Davis left Richmond by train for Danville, Va and from there he went to Charlotte, N.C. where he was coolly received; thence to Chester, South Carolina where tracks ended. The party continued to Abbeville via Conestoga WAGONS (wagon train)to Hodges, SC and thence to Abbeville. While they could have taken a train from Newberry (then called Lawrenceville); it was just too dangerous and for that reason to avoid capture the wagon train(now the reader can see how steam trains got mixed up with wagon trains) continued south by wagon train until Davis was captured just below Washington, Georgia. What gold there was returned to Richmond Banks by 1910. although some has never been accounted for. While it can not be proven; what became of the unrecovered Gold probably ended up in a Bank in Charleston, SC with a mysterious Rhett Butler figure who was treasurer of the Confederacy and who became inexplainably rich after the civil war running a bank in Charleston.</p>

<p>Work in earnest began before the Civil War much of it done with slave labor as well as that of paid Scotch-Irish and German Immigrants(who founded the town of Wahalla) and the road was finished as far as Stumphouse Mountain area (in Oconee County) where they were blasting a tunnel through the Mountain before the war brought a halt to the project. Supposedly, the tunnel was being dug and blasted from both sides of the Mountain but this writer has not found the roadbed from the other side, although there are shafts cut from above into the tunnel which one can fall into if one is not familiar with the top of the Mountain.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ridge_and_Atlantic_Railroad_22f8.html" title="Edit section: Closure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Closure</span></h2>
<p>The railway ceased to exist around 1890 as the Blue Ridge Railway and went into foreclosure. Some of the tracks were taken over by Norfolk and Southern which continued the tracks to Atlanta and in 2006 is still operational after more than 100 years of service. The tracks from Columbia still exist and are used by successive companies. However, the tracks that ran from Abbeville to Augusta,SC(or Hamburg) sit abandoned and rotting and are basically unusable, creating at the same time modern South Carolina ghost towns, or towns on the verge of being so, especially between Abbeville and McCormick, SC. The Belton route tracks are in 2006 still functional, at least in the Greenville area.</p>

<p>The uncompleted rail tunnel remains and was used for many years as an ideal place to make and store <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_cheese.html" title="Blue cheese">blue cheese</a> by Clemson University (formerly Clemson College). This cheese is and was genuine <a href="../../../r/o/q/Roquefort.html" title="Roquefort">Roquefort</a> except for the domaine of origin. During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, a Clemson professor had obtained the native strain of spores of Penicillium roquefortii in Roquefort,France and thus began the Clemson Cheese Industry. The University ceased using the tunnel around 1960 and the cheese making was moved to campus and moved again around 1980 to a more modern facility near Anderson, SC.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ridge_and_Atlantic_Railroad_22f8.html" title="Edit section: State Park">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">State Park</span></h2>
<p>Today the tunnel is a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Park_8f77.html" title="State Park">State Park</a> near spectacular Isaqueena Falls. (please note that Isaqueena is the original correct spelling, since DOT folks mis-spell it). Isaqueena Falls is supposedly the name of a Cherokee Indian Princess who jumped to her death when her father would not allow her to marry her lover and forbade her to see him again according to local legend. Some towns, such as Six Mile, are named for how far she ran according to the legend. The legend probably is not true considering the same story in various other parts of the Continental US and in Guam ("Lover's leap") there. In fact, the name sounds phony and sounds more like pre-1950 Black English dialect, which if broken down says, "I'se a queen +ah" (r in proper English, "I am a Queen"). However, there was significant rockslide in the tunnel early in the 21st Century, so access to it has now been closed and access to it blocked off.</p>
