<li>If you need any <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_0ce0.html" title="Wikipedia:Help">help</a>, post your question at the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Help Desk</a>.</li>

<p>It is so <i>not</i> speculative ... he's acknowledged as much himself — in statements when he was younger and by writing a paper to that effect in boarding school. Everything currently in the article is sourced. Did you sign up just so you could do this? There is such a thing as being <i>too</i> bold ... I am wary here of people whose first move after creating an account is to slap NPOV tags on articles.</p>
<p>In any case I've already this dicussion on the Talk page for the article, and I believe it's been resolved as the user who originally brought it up has not continued the discussion after I made changes to the article in its wake. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 16:30, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Amazon reviews are <i>not</i> considered <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Using_online_sources" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li>I am having <i>serious difficulty</i> <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> here. You set yourself up with a user account here only two days ago; my user page gets vandalized for the first time in almost a year since I set it up; you <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored_for_the_protection_of_minors" title="WP:NOT">erroneously claim that "Wikipedia is not for children"</a>, and then you add section heds to the Robin Bush talk page which weren't there before.

<li>I accuse you of <i>nothing</i>. I'm merely noting that it occurred for the first time today despite a year of engaging in some often contentious edits. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:52, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry for all this ... I've been through some edit wars where it was clear to me that the other side was not acting in good faith, and I tend to get suspicious. Since my user page was vandalized today I was especially edgy. I think what we all decided to do was best, and I like the result.</li>

<p>I removed the claim added to <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copwatch.html" title="Copwatch">Copwatch</a> about the July 2005 scandal. It was not cited and I could not find any information about it online. If you have a reference, please cite it. Also, please clarify which Copwatch group was involved, as all of the groups are autonomous and self-governing. <a href="../../../m/y/c/User%7EMycota_bb0a.html" title="User:Mycota">Mycota</a> 23:37, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Once again I removed that claim. You stated that you have "personal information" about the incident but do not want to disclose the source. This definitely does not count as a reliable source according to Wikipedia standards. See <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> for information about this policy. Here's what it says about primary sources: "We may not use primary sources whose information has not been made available by a credible publication." If the information has been published in print or online, you must include the citation. If not, you may not add this allegation to the article. <a href="../../../m/y/c/User%7EMycota_bb0a.html" title="User:Mycota">Mycota</a> 01:55, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I emailed the Oakland County Sheriff's Office about this issue and here is the response I received from a commander:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not aware of any issues that our department has with Copwatch. They did not release any personal information on any of our department members.</dd>

<p>I will assume this issue is resolved unless an actual source for the allegations can be provided. 216.19.216.84 18:35, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't have cite, but the reason given where this is mentioned as <i>commonly known</i> is the improbability that <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudy_Giuliani_d5f0.html" title="Rudy Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> could have been mistaken that he shared a great grandparent and not a great-great grandparent with <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regina_Peruggi_63de.html" title="Regina Peruggi">Regina Peruggi</a>.

<p>I think a vote of some sort should be set up on the redirect. I don't want to get into a pety edit war. Scalito clearly is not offensive to Judge Alito as he had an opportunity to address the name in his hearing and showed no objections to its use. I think the Dubya parallel, which at some level plays on his stereotype as a southern hillbilly, is quite relevant. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonarch75_50f1.html" title="User:Monarch75">Monarch75</a> 17:07, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know you meant well with your addition of the vandalism notice to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Norris_8c98.html" title="Chuck Norris">Chuck Norris</a>, but that notice was self-referential and doesn't make sense as a part of the article text. Remember, the article text is supposed to be the final stuff that would end up, say, being printed out into a dead tree edition of the encyclopedia. In that context a vandalism notice doesn't make sense. That's why all self-referential/non-encyclopedic text is put into templates (i.e. {{<a href="../../../s/p/r/Template%7ESprotect_0796.html" title="Template:Sprotect">sprotect</a>}}, {{npox}}, even {{<a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoiler_6a46.html" title="Template:Spoiler">spoiler</a>}}). What I ended up doing was put a similar comment as an HTML comment inside the article source, so people won't see that when reading it, but when they go to edit it (like, say, to add more "Chuck Norris Facts") they will see that comment. Check out how I did it.

<p>You recently voted in my Requests for adminship, unfavourably. Please read the page again, as I have tried to clarify my position. I did not mean to imply that I find Wikipedia <i>too</i> large, nor that I would like to standardise spelling.

<p>I noticed you removed an entire section from the Bush article, calling it "weasel words" I think this was a mistake. Straight up, the removed text does technically contian weasel words, but the section is a summary of a linked article. The "critics" and "opponents" the text referes to are properly explained and cited by the linked article. The entire Bush article is this way. Please reconsider your edit, or at least improve the text and not simply delete it because you don't like it.</p>
<p>I completely understand your point, but its sort a Wikipedia guideline (I know that link is somewhere around here!) that instead of removing text that's not great, its better to improve it. And it you can't, something is better than nothing. You could have pointed out the issue on the talk page instead of just deleting it. If you are unable to improve and article, maybe someone else could have. <a href="../../../e/h/l/User%7EEhlkej_b5de.html" title="User:Ehlkej">Ehlkej</a> 08:24, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Could you please not edit war about warnings on IP talk pages. 67.163.110.126 was carrying out vandalism, and therefore it was quite proper to warn them. If you had comments/suggestions about the exact nature of the warnings the proper place to discuss them is on Scaife and your talk pages (I see you did, but discussion should have remained there).

<dd>Personally I probably wouldn't have gone to test4 from test1 (i.e. probably used 2 or 3 first). I was saying was that discussion over this should have been kept away from the IP talk page. Could you please point out the personal attack against you by Scaife on <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.163.110.126.html" title="User talk:67.163.110.126">User talk:67.163.110.126</a>?

<p>i can't spell <i>arbitrariliy</i> either which is why cut it from your edit box entry &amp; pasted it here. i only put <i>"arbitrariliy removing"</i> in italics because i had used your words. I probably didn't need to. I didn't put much thought into it really. honestly, i'm <i>not</i> trying to wind you up. i apologuised above <i>only</i> for arbitrary removal of the tag without much discussion. however, after giving good reasons why your <i>nigger</i> analogy doesn't work, asking for elaboration on why you dislike the term <i>islamist</i> and offering proof that the notable media use this term, i felt it was reasonable to remove the tag. i'm not sure why your comments on my usertalkpage were labelled <i>"Chill out"</i>. <a href="../../../v/e/e/User%7EVeej_150c.html" title="User:Veej">Veej</a> 13:42, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, I couldn't get back to you quickly. The reason I opposed your RfA is because I felt you would take too confrontational an approach in dealing with <b>potential</b> disruptors as evidenced in your answers. The fact that somebody claims a scientific theory is false does not mean he is a bad-faith disruptor and banning him immediately without having a dialouge much less giving him the usual number of warnings only antagonizes people against Wikipedia. I believe a better solution would be to revert the user's changes and explain to him why the article in Wikipedia is written the way it is, hopefully by citing our relevant policies as well. He may come back and say that criticisms of the theory are not cited in the article, and you may come back and say that Wikipedia does have a way of outlining the minority view <i>as the minority view.</i> Then, you may act as a mentor for him to edit Wikipedia within the constraints of our policies. I believe this would work better than to play the role of police officer with a stick. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueGoose_a607.html" title="User:BlueGoose">BlueGoose</a> 03:06, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments. Not to carry on this discussion extensively, but it seems like you weren't aware of Cyde's entire question. The hypothetical situation involved a vandal who in addition to proclaiming that a scientific theory was false (as you explained thoroughly in the above statement) also vandalized a page with a <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse</a> image.

<dd>Actually I included MLK Jr. for precisely the opposite reason, which was to show that I wasn't being racist. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegendary_Steve_68b5.html" title="User:Legendary Steve">Legendary Steve</a> 00:09, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bluegoose, I'd like to point out that Legendary Steve also created a 'White criminals' category and including Joseph Stalin and Kenneth Lay before it was taken down. I don't think he's acting in bad faith, or that he's racist. I do think that the categories are unnecessary, though. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 00:35, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Even if an editor thinks that those categories are desirable, writing, "Many criminals have been white, especially white-collar and other victimless crimes requiring high intellect" implies that other races, like African Americans, have lower intellects. Such unsourced assertions do not bring credit to this encyclopedia. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 03:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i very much agree with you that the page has become unreadable. I think that somebody should go ahead and look at that "history". The comments were deleted not once, but twice by merecat, the first time i was working and in the middle of cleaning things up.</p>

<p>I have thought of creating a WikiProject for South Park since it is now near its' 10th anniversary and has more articles than ever. I feel we could all do the following things through this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanup any short/poorly written/unformatted articles</li>
<li>Merge/lengthen the many character articles</li>
<li>Improve the South Park main page</li>
</ul>
<p>I have seen your South Park fan template and wondered if you were interested in joining. If so reply to my talk page and I'll get back to you as quick as I can.

<li>Hi BlueGoose, thanks for your message. Yes, you are exactly right. If the AfD closure was out-of-process, then the right thing to do is to list it at Deletion Review.

<p>Hey BlueGoose –</p>
<p>You opposed <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Joturner_6f55.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Joturner">my last RfA in March</a> on rationale I believe may have been related to <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">my user page</a>. In the time since then, I have changed my page to be more <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universalism.html" title="Universalism">universalist</a> (which still conforms with my personal beliefs) and removed the majority of information regarding my conversion to Islam in favor of a section on my philosophy (as well as yours if you desire). Now, I'm looking for your feedback on what you think of the redesign of the page and whether it is sufficient in quelling the March controversy over the page as well as solving the issue about possible inability to maintain a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, especially in religion-related articles. For what it's worth, the reason I kept a condensed version of the timeline was because there were, and still are, many people who find it interesting instead of a form of proselytization. Many people have also given me positive feedback on <a href="../../../j/o/t/User_talk%7EJoturner_5671.html" title="User talk:Joturner">my talk page</a> regarding the look of the page. I personally believe that it is okay to insert individuality onto user pages, especially if it still promotes a sense of community. That is what I was going for with this current version of my user page.</p>
<p>Please make comments regarding the user page on <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Joturner_d14f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Joturner">my editor review page</a>.
