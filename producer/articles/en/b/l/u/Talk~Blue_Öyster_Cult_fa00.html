<p><b>The Name <i>Blue Öyster Cult</i></b></p>
<p>This article says: <i>"The umlaut on the "O" in their name started the trend for using the "heavy metal umlaut" in band names. It was suggested to Pearlman by rock critic Richard Meltzer. [1]"</i></p>
<p>But the BOC Official website (<a href="http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html" class="external free" title="http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html</a>) says: <i>"It was at this time that the band was named, by Sandy Pearlman, “Blue Oyster Cult.” (<b>The umlaut being added later by Allen Lanier</b>). Initially, the band was not happy with the name, but settled for it, and went to work preparing to record their first release at David Lucas’ studio."</i></p>
<p>Which is right? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDon_41bb.html" title="User:WikiDon">WikiDon</a></p>
<p>I read Blue Oyster Cult is an anagram for Cully Stout Beer, which the band was drinking when trying to think of a name. Admittedly, it may not be true.(<a href="http://members.aol.com/bocfaqman/boc_faq.html" class="external free" title="http://members.aol.com/bocfaqman/boc_faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/bocfaqman/boc_faq.html</a>)</p>
<p>I have read that as well. <i>"I read Blue Oyster Cult is an anagram for Cully Stout Beer"</i> Where I read it it was listed as a fact, not a myth. Let me find the book and I will place it here. Alantio 17:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I pulled the photo from the tour, "media", section of their website. I have emailed them asking for something better, but like all the LAME organizations out there, I have received ZERO response. These people seem not to care that they may actually received some free publicity by helping us out. You would think that these groups would care about their fans. If you have something better, go for it. If you can get a better response, go for it.

<li><i>"Eric Bloom later said in an interview that Gene Frenkle was absolutely fictional and that during his <b>whole</b> career he had never met or worked with anyone named Gene Frenkle. Bloom also <b>told</b> that it was he who played the cowbell on that recording."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>"Whole": A) He is NOT a loaf of bread. It should be entire, or better yet delete the word all together. B) He is not dead yet.</p>
<p>“Told”: he is NOT a three-year-old child “telling” on his brother.</p>
<p>How about this:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Eric Bloom said in an interview that Gene Frenkle was, 'absolutely fictional; and that during his career, he had never met, or worked with anyone named Gene Frenkle.' Bloom also said that, 'he played the cowbell on the recording.'"</i></li>

<p>"They became a successful heavy metal band during the 1970s. At a time when the genre seemed tired and old-fashioned, Blue Öyster Cult released records that combined powerful music and intelligent and funny lyrics. They are still playing in the 21st century."

<dd>Absolutely. In fact the band may well have been the source of naming that particular genre, via their producer. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 16:44, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed a reference to 'Bevin' who was listed as an ex-drummer 2004-6. This is incorrect, as no drummer called Bevin has been associated with BÖC. Secondly, no drummer was employed between the departure of Bobby Rondinelli and the arrival of Jules Radino. <a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDizietSma_2eb8.html" title="User:DizietSma">DizietSma</a> 07:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think I read somewhere that the cross logo isn't questioning Christ at all. In fact, it has nothing to do with Christianity, being a symbol for Kronos or some other old Greek god.

<p>I love Supernatural as much as anybody, but does it really have a point on this page? -AC</p>
<p><br />
While Cowbell deserves its own section perhaps the supernatural section could be expanded and renamed. Talk about all the pop-culture references to the band. I know they have been used in The Simpsons and That 70s show as well. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Grigg_9c03.html" title="User:Andrew Grigg">Andrew Grigg</a> 21:34, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then maybe we can have a Blue Oyster Cult in Pop-Culture section. I agree, Cowbell definitely deserves it's own section. But, if we had an individual section for each time BOC was mentioned in ever movie or on ever tv show, there would be a <i>lot</i> of sections. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuitar_freak_10_a17d.html" title="User:Guitar freak 10">AC</a> 20:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read that section as movies which BÖC had composed soundtracks for (i.e. just <i>Bad Channels</i>), not movies that they had contributed a song to.. but then, the Video Game Soundtracks section lists games that feature a single song, and not one written specifically for the game!

<p>Does anyone know what "stun guitar" means? The first time I saw it I thought it was a joke, but he's credited that way pretty consistently. He seems to play guitar on more tracks than Lanier and almost as many as Buck Dharma.... <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoris_B_a324.html" title="User:Boris B">Boris B</a> 06:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Accoring to the BOC FAQ: "Eric Bloom is listed on the first 4 BOC albums as playing "stun guitar". There has been much discussion on BOC-L as to exactly what a stun guitar is. Some have heard that it refers to a guitar that was wired for a constant "fuzztone" sound. Other people have suggested that it may be an inside joke with the band, referring to either Eric wanting his guitar turned up loud (according to Albert Bouchard, there used to be some arguments among the band members about how loud Eric's guitar should be during BOC's concerts), or possibly that he did not play much guitar on the albums (again, according to Albert Bouchard, Eric did play some guitar on most of the albums, although Buck did most of the guitar work). Others have jokingly said it refers to Eric's guitar-playing skills (Editor's note: Eric may not be Buck Dharma when it comes to playing guitar, but Eric can play. However, he was originally brought into the band as a singer, not as a guitar player). According to Albert Bouchard, the true meaning of "stun guitar" is as follows: "He played fuzz parts on 'She's As Beautiful As A Foot' and other songs on the first BOC album. They were all pretty easy so we decided to make it more mysterious by calling it Stun instead of Fuzz." According to Bolle Gregmar, however, a more accurate description of the parts that Eric played would be that they were "muted" (i.e. placing one's hand over the guitar strings to eliminate sustain of the played notes), and cites underlying guitar parts on "Stairway To The Stars" and "O.D.'d On Life Itself" as some of the better examples of Eric's stun guitar work. Of course, it is only appropriate to hear Eric's logic in this matter. In an interview in 1975 with *Circus Raves* magazine, Eric states "Originally, I got 'stun guitar' from Star Trek, I was a very big Treky...if you recall the line 'set your phasers on stun', that's where I got 'stun guitar' from. I was really into the Star Trek technology." "</dd>

<p>"In the Summer of 2005, Blue Öyster Cult performed at Retrofest in Chilliwack, British Columbia, with Rick Derringer, Edgar Winter, Jefferson Starship, and It's A Beautiful Day."</p>
<p>Is this line really necessary? BOC still plays dozens of shows all across North America and in Europe every year. Why does this particual performace receive a special mention?</p>
