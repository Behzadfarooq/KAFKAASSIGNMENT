<p>Hi. We had an edit conflict on Talk:Spiritualism in the "Blatantly POV" section. I put my comments above yours, I was just wondering if you thought I was right on my specific points. --<a href="../../../v/a/e/User%7EVaergoth_76e7.html" title="User:Vaergoth">Vaergoth</a> 08:40, 23 July 2005 (UTC) (UPDATE) I wouldn't mind working on the cleanup for Spirituality, but you weren't at all clear on which parts you thought needed clarifying. I could make it my pet project, but since you placed the tag I'd like to know what needs to be done. Do it here or on my talk page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, I think you're absolutely right. This'll teach me to read/respond to Wikipedia discussions when I'm that tired &amp; can't properly form my thoughts into words. I assume you meant Talk:Spirituality? I wonder if Maprovonshal confused spirituality with spiritualism. Which says he didn't really read it carefully perhaps! I need to work on the Spiritualism article also, it needs more detail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On Spirituality, sentences need to be tightened up and clearer definitions provided. What Maprovonshal was objecting to as "Fox News style" is actually the use of passive voice ("the car was owned by George W. Bush" as opposed to "the owner of the car was George W. Bush"), which is considered very bad style nowadays by journalists as well as people in the legal professions. But this is easily remedied. Spirituality has several definitions depending on context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Spirituality vs. religion</i> - Generally, the word "religion" refers to organized belief systems and outward expressions. It's when someone else tells you what to believe, or tells you what to do if you believe. The word "religion" comes from a Latin word for tie or binding. This would have more to do with reinforcing our ties to a particular set of belief systems, or a particular society (cf. Fundamentalist churches with their emphasis on the American flag and "patriotic" messages). Spirituality in this sense is related to personal feelings about spiritual matters such as "is there a God?", life after death, etc. rather than an outward practice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But people also speak about spirituality where the word "religion" is too narrow a term to describe what a certain group is doing. I have seen a lot of references to "Native American spirituality", for instance, referring to cultures where there is no separation between the everyday and the spiritual. Every act, even the most mundane, has spiritual significance of some kind, but there are also specific ceremonies that can be seen as religious. Even in societies such as the Plains Indians' where one's personal relationship to the Great Spirit is given the highest value, there are many group ceremonies, and again these tend to reinforce cultural norms or values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When the article says "Those given to speaking of "spirituality" rather than "religion"", or "'Being spiritual' is often discussed as goal-directed," a good idea is to cite examples and sources, usually from weblinks or quotations from books. (There are lots of links at the bottom, but putting citations right in the paragraph where they are talked about, or at least footnoted, is good practice.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It should be brought out that spirituality has several meanings and the tone of the article should be elevated so as to eliminate the idea that spirituality is merely another piece of New Age drivel. One of the things that bugs me the most about so-called "skeptics" is that they keep citing New Age as "proof" that all religious and spiritual ideas are unworthy of belief. I'll have to think of more later. Thank you, we'll work this out! --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 20:36, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi; you have requested some information on Hindu walk-in legends of yore. Hindus acknowledge many bodies: a physical body, an astral body, a mental body, a refined body of the soul, and so on. The only essence that is not a body, and therefore not tranferrable, is the <a href="../../../a/t/m/Atman.html" title="Atman">Atman</a>. So, a walk-in, as described in the book <i>Merging with Siva</i> by <a href="../../../s/i/v/Sivaya_Subramuniyaswami_1898.html" title="Sivaya Subramuniyaswami">Sivaya Subramuniyaswami</a>, can take one or many of these bodies. This is a story turned legend of a yogi taking up to the mental body of a recently dead boy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1979/05/1979-05-06.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1979/05/1979-05-06.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Saint Tirumular's story is very interesting. He was an accomplished yogi, or siddha from the Himalayas in North India, and he was sent on mission from there by the rishis of the Himalayas to South India to spread the purest teachings of Saivism to the people there. Hinduism is a missionary religion. Everyone within it is on a mission or is purifying himself through sadhana enough so that he can be given a mission for the religion from some great soul or a God perhaps. This is the pattern within Hinduism, and Saint Tirumular's mission was to establish at one point in time the final conclusions of the Sanatana Dharma, the purest path of Hinduism, Saiva Siddhanta.</p>
<p>When Tirumular arrived in the south an extraordinary miracle occurred, a boon from Lord Siva to help him in his task. As Tirumular was walking through a forest he came upon a pitiful scene. A herd of milk cows were standing around their young cowherder who had just died for some reason, and it was evident from the lamenting of the herd that they had loved him very much. So touched was Tirumular by this scene that he was inspired to relieve the anguish of the gentle cows through his siddhas, or yogic powers, by bringing the dead cowherder back to life, if only for a short time. So he sat down in deep meditation, left his own body and entered the body of the cowherder, causing it to stand up again and carry on as usual. He comforted the cows and led them back to their village, leaving them there. He returned to the forest for his own body, but no matter how he searched he could not find it! It had simply vanished! Again he sat down in meditation to see what he could discover and by his spiritual insight he discerned that it was Lord Siva Himself who had taken his body, leaving him with the cowherder's body.</p>
<p>Tirumular accepted the will of Siva immediately and went on his way in his new physical form. This exchange had a real advantage, however, for he could now speak Tamil, the language of all of south India at that time, and he knew all the culture and customs of the South as a native Tamilian.</p>

<p>Do you have a cite for the suspicion/allegation that Laurel/Lauren faked her own death? Given her past history of fraud and misrepresentation, it certainly <i>seems</i> plausible, but given my past history of mental and physical illness, it seems more than plausible that she died at the age of 61. I only ask because someone is bound to complain about a rumor in a Wikipedia article that lacks verification, especially considering that Willson/Stratford still has a very vocal (if only miniscule at this point) contingent that supports and believes her claims. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadbryant_f5a9.html" title="User:Chadbryant">Chadbryant</a> 23:10, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw what you said in my talk page about equating her faking her own death with Elvis' or Morrison's. The thing is she has a lot more motivation for it and I just wouldn't put it past her after all the stunts she's pulled. Again, until I get further proof, maybe that speculation should be taken out. -- <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 08:42, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also read the article regarding her death, and while I still agree that it is plausible she could have faked her death (as much as it's plausible for <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> or <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> to have done so), I personally would not have any reason to doubt her demise.</dd>
<dd>As an aside, I should also note that my grandparents (an ordained minister/teacher and his wife) knew her as Laurel, and a Google Maps search of one of her Bakersfield addresses listed in the original <i>Cornerstone</i> article revealed that she once lived less than a half-mile from the house where I grew up. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadbryant_f5a9.html" title="User:Chadbryant">Chadbryant</a> 17:09, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I'm not <i>completely</i> guilty of wanting to delete the article ;-) ... The article was actually on the speedy deletion list, but I was not so sure that it applied, as a quick Google seemed to indicate that she had at least some notability. So I took the much less drastic step of rather putting it on proposed deletions, where "You may remove this message if you improve the article, or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason." So, if I were you, I'd remove the message and put an explanation on its talk page. :-) Kindest Regards, <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> 12:35, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Bluejay Young! On the Miracles at Lourdes page we are having a problem with Barbara Shack reverting the page, a possible violation of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> rule (you already know the situation).

<p>Would it be a good idea to have the page as "Lourdes (apparition)" rather than "Miracles at Lourdes," and to move the part on St. Bernadette Soubirious' incorruptibility back to her page (where it belongs), while leaving the part on miracles, but adding the information about the apparitions also (I already have some of the apparition info there--unless Barbara Shack reverted it again!). <a href="../../../j/b/o/User%7EJBogdan_c268.html" title="User:JBogdan">JBogdan</a> 19:38, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! A while back, I believe it was you who tagged the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">Fan fiction</a> article for clean up (and rightly so - what a mess it was!).</p>
<p>I and a couple of other people have been working like mad on it, and I was wondering if you felt it was worthy of removing the clean up tag yet? I've got a vote on the bottom of the Talk page there. Regards, <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 20:33, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're more than welcome. :) When I put the article up for Peer Review, somebody suggested reorganizaing the subgenres and terminology into sub-groups by theme, and, well, obviously it was a good idea so I went ahead and did it! ;) I'm glad you agree with my decision on the reorganization, and that you liked the way I went with it. I still think one or two things may need reorganizing there (by which I mean, one or two terms may not really fit where I put them... for instance, Hatefic - is it really a "format", per se? For that matter, I've actually never really heard of it used in that context, if at all, should it even be there if it's not all that common a term?), but it's MUCH better than it was, that's for sure! <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 07:19, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I zilched "hatefic" a few minutes before I was pinged with your latest. I just haven't seen enough evidence that it's that necessary. I plan to get my ace legal terminologist in-house to take a look at the Legal Issues section and see if he can do anything with it.

<dd>Wow. Great Wikipedians think alike? :P I'm thinking of zilching "Suethor", since it's really not all that necessary compared to "Mary Sue" and certain other terms, and besides of which, is mentioned briefly in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Sue_e6e3.html" title="Mary Sue">Mary Sue</a>'s main article. Good idea on snagging a lawyer in to look at the Legal Issues section; I was considering seeking out a few lawyers here on Wiki myself to do it! 'Cause I mean... I'm pretty scared to touch it, other than mild tweaks here and there for phrasing, and correcting that silly thing about for-profit fanfic dôjinshi being "totally legal" in Japan, when they're really not (they just are tolerated, is all).</dd>

<dd>Well, he isn't a lawyer, he's a paralegal. We do have a lawyer friend on Wikipedia, and we may ask him to examine it also, although copyright law isn't his specialty. Also, we have two online friends who are presently students in Japan, who can verify the thing about dojinshi being illegal. I'm going to zilch "Suethor". I've never liked that term anyway, particularly since the time I was accused (in the discussion section of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Sue_e6e3.html" title="Mary Sue">Mary Sue</a> article) of being one. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 08:33, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh yeah! I forgot that was you that got accused of being a "Suethor". I don't mind the term in and of itself; perhaps it's because I've recently been theorizing that EVERY creative mind, especially one that's aimed at storytelling, goes through a "Suethor" stage, like a coming of age, as it were - once you start realizing that genuine flaws and limitations are more fun to write ito a character than a mostly-perfect character who is never disliked by a sympathetic character, etc., then you've sort of had your writerly Bar or Bat Mitzvah(sp?) and are on your way to being a "full-grown" writer who can create some truly appealing and interesting characters that older audiences can relate to. By my theory "Suethor" would be no inherently worse a word than "child" or "prepubescent" would be, it would only be a bad thing to use it specifically as an insult (as it usually is, similarly to how generally, calling someone a "kid" or "child" is often insulting). However, that's just my theory, and again, the term is covered in the main Mary Sue article, and it's a very minor term that really, isn't half as important as its mother term is for understanding fan fiction. ^_^ I created the entry there, but I'm perfectly fine with it being deleted from the page. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 09:17, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't really comment on your Suethor phase theory. Don't know enough about it. When I attempted to write fiction as a teenager, most of my characters were slightly whimsical private investigators (I was somewhat influenced by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Persuaders_ec24.html" title="The Persuaders">The Persuaders</a>), or reformed villains who sought to right the wrongs they'd done. I never wrote fan fiction. I read plenty, but never saw any Mary Sue type characters. I've written on the Mary Sue discussion page about what I think Paula Smith was thinking when she came up with that story.</dd>

<dd>Ah, I see. Well, I never saw any of that in the 60s and 70s; I didn't write that way, and neither did anyone I knew. There definitely were fanzines back then and the different stories were reviewed, commented upon and thrown back and forth, and I'll never forget the way so many people found <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraith.html" title="Kraith">Kraith</a> so exquisitely fascinating that they wanted to write Kraith stories themselves and were actually provided a "Kraith Creators' Manual" by the original author, just for that purpose. It's all online now at <a href="http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/kraith/" class="external free" title="http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/kraith/" rel="nofollow">http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/kraith/</a> if you are interested... and, like I said in the talk page for the Mary Sue article, I think one of Paula Smith's sources for the idea might have been T'Rruel, while another might have been Sherrith McRaith. My problem is that I never saw the Sherrith story when it was first published, and that I <i>did</i> see "Spock's Affirmation", which is T'Rruel's story, and instantly fell in love with her.</dd>

<dd>What you were much more likely to see back then were stories about Spock getting in trouble in order to rescue Kirk, and I mean <i>extreme</i> trouble; powerful ladies in positions of authority, who did or did not have an affair with Kirk, Spock or whomever; followups to episodes (What happened in the mirror universe? Did McCoy ever get back together with Natira?) and stories like <a href="http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/quartetplustwo/thethousanthman.html" class="external text" title="http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/quartetplustwo/thethousanthman.html" rel="nofollow">Ni Var</a>, which was part of <a href="http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/quartetplustwo/" class="external text" title="http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/quartetplustwo/" rel="nofollow">Quartet Plus Two</a>. Those types of stories were the most common. The one teenage character I remember was a boy named Szrich, son of a Vulcan father and a Taman mother. This was in 1969 and '70 and the Tamans were not the ones who say Darmok and Jilad at Tenagra. They were much more like Gem's people. Szrich was apparently orphaned (it turned out later his mother was okay but in another dimension) and the Enterprise picked him up and he kind of gravitated to Spock in a mentor relationship for a time. He was not overly powerful, his problem was that he had abilities (both Vulcan and Taman) he had never been trained to use.</dd>

<dd>I wondered at first if the types of characters you describe tend to be more prevalent now because the age at which fans begin writing is younger, but I don't think this is true. The age spread -- from fifteen to about twenty-five -- seems to be just about the same then as now. In fact, the oldest writer was about fifty, and I couldn't stand her stuff. She had a tendency to confuse the ideas of "rape" and "ravish", and I shudder to think at her effect on young girls reading her stuff and learning that "all women feel a shudder of visceral pleasure at the thought." This was in the liberated 70s, no less. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 23:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>NOTE: Some more extensive changes have been made to <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">Fan fiction</a>. Later today, I hope to seek out some sources to cite the theories and even terminology, perhaps, and possibly go on a "hey, would you please look at this for me?" spree amongst the Wikipedian Lawyers category. But right now, I was hoping you'd hop back on over and at least lemme know what you think of some of the tweaks I made today so far. For instance, I only today realized that in "Formats of", I didn't even mention regular, non-manga, textual-only, online-published (namely, <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webserial.html" title="Webserial">webserial</a> for serial works) as a format. If we're going to cover formats at all, we should cover all major ones, no? Although perhaps it would be more beneficial to cut down on the description for each format, since every one of them has its own main article, and they're formats, not genres or anything, right? For overview purposes, it might be just fine to delete all or most of the description for each. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 11:11, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I had previously never heard of "healthy mulitiples", and 'til now had never met someone who was (or at least said they were) a multiple.

I.e. it should be a jumping-off point of sorts, with the related major issues and terms being optional jumping-into points from the main article. Considerig how (to use my own words) "massive the concept is", this may be the only way to achieve a relatively concise, accurate article on fan fiction in general that technically covers everything without being so big as to be overwhelming for the reader. :)</dd>

<p>Howdy! As for your recent edits, I understand the NPOV status you are trying to reach, but it needs to be in the proper format. When "reported" is used, who was it "reported" to? If Bernadette and everyone else was reporting their sightings to the local newspaper, we would write "Bernadette reported to the <i>Lourdes Daily</i> that..." If it was to the government or to the ecclesiastical committee, we might used "testified." Usually we use "reported" to mean that the person actively wanted at least one other person to know and usually it also means that it should be made public. According to the recources I used, Bernadette did not want to tell her friend and sister in the first place, but when they continued to pester her about the matter she finally told them, but told them to keep the matter a secret. When they got home, the secret was betrayed to Bernadette's mother, and when she found out...well, you probably know the rest. So, in at least one instance, I had used the word "admit" rather than "report."</p>
<p>Also, did you know that this article is on both answers.com and reference.com, along with virtually all the Wikipedia articles? And to top it off, although the articles are occasionally updated (I saw some of my more recent edits to the Moses article on the sites also), it cannot be edited like on Wikipedia and the article is listed with other articles from professional encyclopedias!<a href="../../../j/b/o/User%7EJBogdan_c268.html" title="User:JBogdan">JBogdan</a> 22:37, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>HI I reverted your readdition of the link because I don't think a livejournal page is going to add anything to the article. If people want to find communities than they can use google. If it is any consolation, I also removed all the other links for advertising, copyvios and membership only groups and your link was the most appropriate of the lot.

<p>I'm not sure if in <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amok_Time_42b6.html" title="Amok Time">Amok Time</a> they said Vulcan males endure pon'far every seven years, but I know for a fact Lt. Saavik said they did in <i>Search for Spock</i>. I'll have to wait to see "Amok Time" again to make sure. What seems odd is in "Amok Time" McCoy said if a Vulcan doesn't mate, he'll die - but apparently that is not the case, since Spock at the end of the episode never mated and still lived, likewise in <i>Search for Spock</i> the young Spock underwent pon'far and lived although Saavik sort of eased his pain - doing the caressing fingers bit - which I think in a non-canon source said was similar to humans kissing. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 22:19, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are in support of merging The Frost King article in with Helen Keller. If so, can you guide me through the process?

<dd>I decided to remove the merger tag on The Frost Kings. The merger tag on Helen Keller was already removed and frankly, I am tired of being worried and thinking about it. Maybe when everyone has calmed down, we can try again? I'm assuming a month is more than enough time to have a general consensus?

<dd>Re <i>voted to delete the article because it was considered to not have sufficient sources</i>: I think the article should discuss it as a cultural phenomenon, at the very least. It is an accepted state of being in other cultures, and WP should at least document that, in addition to the growing 'rights' movement here. (Sorry I'm 'late to the party': I'm struggling with some health issues. I want to thank you for <i>boldly</i> pointing to multiplicity resources, btw -- your pointers/links have been a big help. :&gt; )</dd>
<dd>Btw, there's a fascinating article in a recent Newsweek -- unfortunately I can't find it or the book it's discussing anywhere online <i>yet</i> (and I read the mag in a doc's waiting room so I don't even have that). The article has excerpts from a new book put together by Robert Faggan -- it is a publication of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sandburg_33f6.html" title="Carl Sandburg">Carl Sandburg</a>'s notes to himself. The name of the article, and possibly the book, is "The man with two brains". <i>Y'all</i> might find the way Sandburg wrote in 'different voices' to work out his art as riveting as <i>we</i> did.</dd>
<dd>Now I understand that there are both science-types and religious-types, in <i>Western</i> culture, who try to explain the phenomenon in ways that exemplify both 'good and bad faith' (nice duality, eh?), so I think the article needs sections (I can't see what was there before, sorry) for each of their explanations: science, which sees it as a disconnect in <i>translating</i> btwn input/output areas of the brain in which healthy multiplicity can be a benign coping mechanism, or else a disruption; and some religions, which can blindly disregard their own guideline of 'judging them by their works/intentions' and literally demonize the state. And then there should be sections exploring other 'names' for the state in other cultures and other fields of study....</dd>
<dd>Actually, I wonder if 'Healthy multiplicity' couldn't simply be a section under <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiplicity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Multiplicity (philosophy)">Multiplicity (philosophy)</a>. That article could be expanded to include 'a multitude of sins', so to speak -- see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=multiplicity+psychological" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=multiplicity+psychological" rel="nofollow">google search</a>. Healthy multiplicity could then redirect there... ?</dd>
<dd>Sorry if I'm just 'talking out loud' here. I hope to be able to do more than that in April or May. (By the way, do y'all use a <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunisolar_calendar.html" title="Lunisolar calendar">lunisolar calendar</a>? I just realized yesterday that we/I have been <i>following</i> one without knowing.

<p>I saw the discussion of this on LJ and came here to see what on earth had happened, but I can't find the AFD for Healthy multiplicity. Do you know where it is? If there wasn't an AFD, why was the page deleted? <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 16:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your response. I guess what I really want to know is, technically speaking, did it go to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>, and if not, who deleted it and why? There are procedures for this kind of thing, and I can't imagine that it would have been prod deleted. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 21:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks! Looking at that, it does look as if the delete result is iffy, but without sources people will consider reliable a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> is unlikely to be successful. Oh well. <a href="../../../v/a/s/User%7EVashti_aa77.html" title="User:Vashti">Vashti</a> 08:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
