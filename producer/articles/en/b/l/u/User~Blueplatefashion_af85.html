	    <p>It is not a story of rags to riches. It is not a story of a sudden shower of wealth. It is a story of a lady who has trod the rugged mountainous path all alone, with an occasional helping hand, and finally reached the pinnacle of success. This, from a young Indian housewife is a rarity. Even so, when she had the calamitous circumstances of loosing her husband at the age of 26 years to a tragic car accident.</p>
<p><b>Shashi Anand</b> can certainly be a beckon of hope for the millions of Indian women who get lost in the all-encompassing presures of family life, especially when they are widowed. She is an exemplification of the capacities of the Indian women who perseveres through honest and sincere hard work.</p>
<p>Shashi was a happy housewife with two daughters till her husband died in a car crash in 1972. Although her family had a roaring business in surgical instruments in New Delhi, she preferred to do it all on her own. She joined the YMCA for a secretarial course, much to the chagrin of her in-laws.</p>
<p>After completing the course, she started working for the Asia '74 Exhibition and R.B. Rodda &amp; Co. with the encouragement of her parents. This soon proved to be a turning point for her to make it big. In 1974, she came to New York with the help of her maternal uncle, Kosh Raj Handa, and began her life with a secretarial job at $75 a week.</p>
<p>The financial pressures and the innate desire to grow, propelled her to shift to another job with a garment importer paying her $250 a week. She learnt the trade over the following two years and spent her weekends selling miscellaneous goods to earn some extra money. In the evenings she used her secretarial skills to earn some more money.</p>
<p>At the end of the two years, Shashi found that she had been able to save around $30,000 from her small time weekend trade. She invested this money to set up a small shop, Seema Boutique, on 58th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue located by the Plaza and Windham Hotels in New York City. The business grew over the years and by 1980, she managed to save $60,000.</p>
<p>In 1980, an exporter from India, Prahlad Rai Saraf proposed to export readymade garments to her. She invested $40,000 to open a LC in May 1981, and gave birth to <b>Simonia Fashions, Inc.</b> The first year Simonia generated sales of $300,000, which shot up to $500,000 by the next year. In 1994, the sale figure stood at $15 million and in 1995, it was $18 million. It was a noteworthy achievement considering that every penny was earned through her sweat and hard work.</p>
<p>Shashi brought her daughters to the United States in 1978 through her own endeavors and financial strength. <b>Seema Anand</b>, Shashi's youngest daughter studied at the Baruch College and the Parsons School of Design to be able to assist her mother with the business. Her elder daughter Sonia, got married in 1984 and is now <b>Sonia Kumra</b>. She is doing very well with her husband in import of leather handbags from India and have a successful handbag line under the name <b>Biacci.</b></p>
<p>Seema's forte for designing helped Shashi to explore newer and more artistic designs for her garments. The junior line named <b>Blue Plate</b><a href="http://www.blueplatefashion.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blueplatefashion.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is completely deseigned by Seema and has been featured in many fashion publications as well as being sold in higher end department stores such as Nordstroms, Bloomingdales, Macy's and Dillards.</p>
<p>The Lahore-born punjabi woman has moved from a possible harrowing widow's life to the excellence and splendors of the Corinthiam Building apartments on First Avenue and 38th Street in New York, which is one of the costliest areas. She is the living example of success and potentialities that all human beings possess if only they are willing to unravel it.</p>
<p>A grandmother three times over, she is constantly in motion, attending trade shows, adjusting and marketing her line of clothes and spending time with her family. When asked what advice she would give women embarking on an entrepreneurial career, she said, "Inner strength, honestly, hard work and perserverance go a long way to success."</p>
