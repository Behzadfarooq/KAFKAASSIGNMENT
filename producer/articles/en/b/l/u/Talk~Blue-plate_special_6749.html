<p>I remembered the episode correctly. It aired in 1947. The blue-plate special cost $1.50 and included tomato juice, vegetable soup, roast beef with carrots and peas, and ice cream (choice of chocolate or vanilla).

<p>Usage of the term really seems evenly divided between "blue-plate special" and "blue plate special." I prefer the hyphenated form, so I've used that within the text, and moved the article to "Blue-plate special." Within quotations, I have tried to preserve whatever form was used in the source.

<p>Another piece of evidence for saying it was not limited to diners, besides the historical references from the New York Times, is that Wentworth and Flexner's slang dictionary includes many of the diner and short-order slang expressions and number codes but does not include "blue-plate special."</p>
<p>I'm saying the usage faded after the 1950s, but this needs a reality check. There are many diners still in operation. I probably don't eat in any establishment called a "diner" oftener than once or twice a year. My vague recollection of recent visits is that they do <i>not</i> offer blue-plate specials. What do others know? I'm sure there are some that deliberately offer them as an intentional piece of retro chic.

<dd>I've seen them, so called, on the menus of some older diners in Southern California. Not any of the chains nor, I think, anywhere trying too hard to be retro chic, but simply some of those frozen-in-time kind of places. So the term is hanging on, if by its fingernails. Most places just say 'Specials', though. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">—Morven</a> 16:28, Dec 2, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They do survive. I know of two fairly local places (White River Junction, VT, and Concord, NH) that have "blue plate specials" by that exact name, and have eaten at any number of small family-run restaurants that have them. Some chains, too, seeing that for most of 1993 my entire office would go out every friday to eat at the Oak Ridge, TN Quincy's Steakhouse[1] and get the Blue Plate Special. I've been to quite a few cafeterias that have the same special (sometimes just for kids or seniors, however). In all these cases, a blue plate was used, too.</dd>

<p>I've been doing some miscellaneous searches on eBay. It appears as if collectors call divided plates "grill plates" or "grille plates," and it appears as if the dishes used in restaurants are called "restaurantware" or "restaurant ware." Various searches on "blue plate restaurant ware" and "grill plate restaurantware" etc. turn up quite a lot of divided plates with a blue transfer pattern, like <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=2753&amp;item=3765134365&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW" class="external text" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=2753&amp;item=3765134365&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=2807&amp;item=3765837002&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW" class="external text" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=2807&amp;item=3765837002&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. Blue <i>patterns,</i> particularly variations on blue willow, seem to be very common. I haven't seen a <i>solid</i> blue plate yet.</p>
<p>Of course, blue-pattern plates have been very popular for a long time. The puzzle is why there would be an association between blue plates and <i>inexpensive</i> meals. You'd think that if a restaurant had a supply of blue plates they would use them for everything, not just the daily specials...

<p>Just got another reply to myq uery in rec.food.restaurants. Leaving it here for the moment, will work into the article when I get a Round Tuit.</p>
<hr />
<p>&gt; Secondly, I'd recommend at least looking at Southern Food by John &gt; Egerton before submitting your article. I don't have it in front of &gt; me right now (I'll check it when I get a chance), but I seem to recall &gt; that there is a section regarding the blue-plate special and &gt; especially how it relates to the "meat-and-three" lunches still found &gt; at many eateries throughout the South (the term "meat-and-three" is &gt; still used regularly at several restaurants in the Nashville area). &gt; &gt;&#160;:-Dan</p>
<p>Okay, I found the reference. It's on pages 67 and 68 of Southern Food and pretty much starts out Egerton's section on lunch in the "Eating Out" part of the book (even though this was written in 1983, I find that it is still a great source for eating your way through the South). Anyhow, in case you don't have a copy, I'll go ahead and cite the relevant paragraphs here (without Mr. Egerton's permission and leaving out the first 2, which are mostly biographical about Hap Townes and son who both ran an eatery in Nashville):</p>
<p>"The genesis of plate-lunch dining in America can be traced to such public eateries as Hap's. Back in the days when lunch was dinner and dinner was supper, the midday meal generally was the main repast for people of all classes. The food was hearty and substantial, and for good reason; the time to eat heavily, most people agreed, was not in the evening before bedtime but early in the day, when energy was needed for the hard work at hand. As dinner for working people gradually moved from home kitchens to cafes and restaurants of cities and towns, the pattern of heavy dining at noon was continued."</p>
<p>"The plate lunch, a singularly American invention, became firmly fixed in the restaurant trade early in this [last] century. Before long, there was even a custom-made plate for it: a large, heavy china plate in the popular and familiar blue willow pattern, with compartments to divide the meat or other main dish from the vegetables. The blue-plate special (or lunch, or supper, or dinner) was a quickly understood term for a generously large and inexpensive meal that commonly consisted of a main dish, three or four vegetables, some kind of bread, and a drink."</p>
<p>"Southern cooking, with its emphasis on meats and gravies, vegetables, hot breads, and desserts, was especially well suited to plate-lunch dining. Restaurants featuring blue-plate specials came early to the region, and many of the best of them have survived to this day, withstanding the fast-food revolution and other modern gastronomic upheavals. Hap Townes is [was?] such a place. In history, style, and quality, the little cafe is a good and typical example of the traditions associated with eating out for lunch in the South."</p>
<p>So, there you have it. The concept of the blue-plate special definitely still exists, but I doubt you're going to find too many (if any) that still use the china, and particularly a blue willow pattern.</p>
<pre>
China dishes used in a restaurant setting, especially a casual lunch,
</pre>
<p>are more prone to breakage. Anyhow, I hope you find this useful - best of luck with your article; it looks good.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I don't eat in diners all that often—I like them, but they're rare and I don't seek them out. Now that I'm sensitized to the issue, though, I'm on the lookout for blue-plate specials. Anyway, I'm sorry to report that the Glenmont Diner, 21 Frontage Rd, Glenmont, NY 12077 (near Albany) which looks absolutely 100% authentic--I don't know when it was built but it certainly looks fifties, NOT fifties-STYLE--does not have them. I had a fantastic breakfast there and I certainly recommend the place, but no blue-plate specials. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:33, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC) P.
