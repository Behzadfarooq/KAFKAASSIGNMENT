<p>hi BlueShirts, You share pretty much the same values as I do when talking about the Repbublic of China. Therefore, I hope you will agree and help me in the ongoing dispute about naming the ROC portal, ROC, not "Taiwan." You can see the links on my talk page, which lead to other mediation/talk pages. Please respond. Thank you. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiang_Kai-shek_6186.html" title="User:Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> 00:34, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I think about a portal, I think its usually named by country and it contains information and links to other related articles. How is it geographic? They claim to want to put information about Taiwan exclusively, but that can be done under the name Portal:Republic of China. After all, Taiwan makes up most of the free territory of the ROC. We don't have to include Mongolia, Mainland China, etc. Some brief info can be given about the Chinese Civil War and the ROC/PRC. I think they are promoting a pan-green political agenda with regards to naming, color, etc. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiang_Kai-shek_6186.html" title="User:Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> 00:49, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BlueShirts, I noticed when looking at Chiang Kai-shek's talk page that you were interested in the idea of a ROC portal, but didn't really know a lot about portals.

<p>Hi BlueShirts,</p>
<p>Finally, another person who understands the intension of the portal being about the island of Taiwan as a geographic entry. I used to support <a href="../../../r/e/p/Portal%7ERepublic_of_China_9e3b.html" title="Portal:Republic of China">Portal:Republic of China</a> because the China portal is <a href="../../../r/e/p/Portal%7ERepublic_of_China_9e3b.html" title="Portal:Republic of China">Portal:Republic of China</a> so I thought it should've been a "nation/state" portal as well. But after I read the reason for the portal name (given by <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain0_143e.html" title="User:Captain0">User:Captain0</a>) I understood that it's geographic, so it covers a wide scope of topics concerning Taiwan island. Whereas an ROC portal limits the scope of topics down to ROC on Taiwan (Therefore, cannot mention colonial history by Dutch, Japan, Ming, Qing) or about aborigines because it raises "anti-ROC" or "pro-independence" problems. But the fact is these topics widen our understanding about the history of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Your suggestion about making the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Portal%7ERepublic_of_China_9e3b.html" title="Portal:Republic of China">Portal:Republic of China</a> into a portal about the politics and history of the ROC is a good idea, so long as it doesn't claim to be Taiwan but "China (inc. Taiwan)" since <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> with the map of China (mainland territories shaded; ROC jurisdiction highlighted). That would be more ROC-centric and can mention a wide range of topics such as Chinese Civil War, retrocession of Taiwan to ROC from Japan, military campaigns, etc. Then it can be linked to <a href="../../../t/a/i/Portal%7ETaiwan_4560.html" title="Portal:Taiwan">Portal:Taiwan</a> and the Taiwan portal can be linked to "Republic of China" and "People's Republic of China" as the history. Then I suggest we ask that <a href="../../../c/h/i/Portal%7EChina_b2cb.html" title="Portal:China">Portal:China</a> be ressurected as being about China (geography) which will link to both PRC and ROC portals (politics) that should be the best compromise to the portal name dispute. A Portal China can mention history about the dynasties, the question about Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia, etc because that <b>is</b> the history of China, not the history of PRC. — <a href="../../../n/r/t/User%7ENrtm81_5bc9.html" title="User:Nrtm81">Nrtm81</a> 09:42, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please see the arbitration page for further information on my view. I'm happy to have a Taiwan exclusive portal, but it just can't be under the name "Taiwan" because it is way too confusing and raises way too many eyebrows. I'm not from Mainland China and I am not a Communist Chinese conspirator. I am a supporter of the Republic of China and I love Taiwan as well. Both can be accomplished at the same time. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiang_Kai-shek_6186.html" title="User:Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> 00:50, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I'm actually from Taiwan, and I'm not a waishengren. I'm a benshengren. I'm born in Taiwan and proud of it. But I love both the Republic of China and Taiwan.

<dd>I'm not really sure. I do know that, for almost all maps, redrawing it by hand avoids any sort of copyright issues; but I'm not sure how tracing would affect it. I would assume that, if the tracing was close enough to the original, it would count as "reproduction" and become a derivative work of the original map, copyright-wise; but it's probably a question you should ask on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a> or some similar page if you want a more certain answer. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 05:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey BlueShirts, if you don't mind, can you create a portal theme for the Portal:Free Area of the Republic of China. I have decided that it would be better to have that portal than the Portal:Taiwan. The Free Area is a politically neutral term and it covers all of the territory in the current ROC's jurisdiction. If you could contribute, please do so. Also, we should work on Portal:Republic of China as well. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiang_Kai-shek_6186.html" title="User:Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> 01:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would be nice to have Portal:ROC cover everything about the ROC from Mainland and all the history of Taiwan. However, that would create problems, because people like Nrtm81 don't agree. They want Portal:Taiwan. So then we should use Portal:ROC for all history of ROC from Mainland to Taiwan, but for Taiwan history specifically, we should use Portal:Free Area of the Republic of China. -<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiang_Kai-shek_6186.html" title="User:Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> 02:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently exploring the idea of splitting this template into four different parts. I feel that it is simply too large in its present state. It takes up the entire screen on my computer. I have created four mockups of my idea, which can be viewed by going to <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanaman5_Workshop_6352.html" title="User:Danaman5/Workshop">User:Danaman5/Workshop</a> and clicking on the four "Warlord" links. As someone who has edited this template before, I wanted to get your opinion before moving forward. You can leave a message on my user talk page with any comments.</p>

<p>Apparently this Yankee guy keeps disputing the fact that Chien-ming was born in Tainan City, Taiwan, Republic of China. He keeps insisting that Taiwan by itself is an independent sovereign nation. That is not true. I keep pointing him to reliable sources such as the ROC government websites and several Wikipedia articles. But he just doesn't bother to read it. He keep saying MLB says just Taiwan. Well of course, it would, since the USA doesn't maintain diplomatic relations with the Republic of China. Well, duh, but he just doesn't get it.

<p>We need to reign in these guys..I am looking for a compromise and solution, but these guys are becoming more radical by the second. For example, for Guantian, Tainan, Jerry made Chen Shui-bian "President of Taiwan" instead of "President of the Republic of China." He also called the Presidential Building Taiwan, instead of ROC Presidential Building. And his fellow supporters are adding to this. What should we do? What is your email? -<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalist_3959.html" title="User:Nationalist">Nationalist</a> 02:18, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am still looking for a compromise, but no luck. Jerry is out to delete all instances of Republic of China or ROC and to make sure everything says Taiwan Taiwan and Taiwan. I have no problem having Taiwan, ROC or Taiwan, Republic of China. The Taiwan existing there clarifies everything. But why does he have to delete ROC or Republic of China? Clearly, I think he is pushing a POV. Examples are the above edit to Guantian and several others. Several articles were fine before he started vandalizing it. For example for an article the field said Country: Republic of China. he purposely changed it to Taiwan (ROC). But it was already clear that this was Taiwan since underneath that field said Birthplace: Kaoshuing, Taiwan. I would like to seek mediation and opinions, can you refer anyone here and get in contact with Jiang? -<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalist_3959.html" title="User:Nationalist">Nationalist</a> 00:58, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Basically everyone accused each other of POV and eventually the fights died down, only to be continuously restarted...so there's really no consensus about the naming. However, whenever naming becomes an issue, it's best to appeal to both sides of the political spectrum, such as "Republic of China (Taiwan)" instead of "Republic of China" or "Taiwan". That usually causes the least controversy.<br />
I have a vague memory of coming across an actual naming convention discussion on some official Wikipedia page, but I became active in Wikipedia after it had ended.

<p>Excuse me but I am having great difficulty understanding your edit to World War 2, even more your summary “no”. Perhaps you should clarify how Chiang Kaishek was leader of the Communist forces in China, all 1.3 million, and why, if so, both sides continued to fight each other during the height of the conflict!</p>
<p>I do not see how Mao Zedong cannot be classified as an important leader in World War 2. The article on the 2nd Sino Japanese War list the Chinese Communists as a separate faction, and this is shown in the “commanders” section for Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong and his fellow communists even considered themselves a separate nation during the war as the Soviet (later People’s) republic of China, and the Kuomintang Republic of China, and not one unified country.</p>
<p>Judging by your site you probably know a lot more Chinese history than me, and if there is a good reason why Mao Zedong cannot be called this, please specify this. Matt. P 17:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey dude. I re-edited my edit to your edit. Or something. I deleted the Nanjing baby from the Battle of Shanghai article because, well, it is a Nanjing baby, not a Shanghai baby. Unless you've got information saying otherwise, I think it should stay out. I'm not randomly editing stuff for my amusement or to put forward a specific interpretation. You didn't mention in the comments why you put it back in, though. I've started a conversation on the page about it.</p>

<dd>A bit from column A, and a bit from column B?

<p><i>Chinese Communists allowed the Nationalist forces to do the majority of the fighting against Japan, while conducting guerilla warfare against the Japanese forces. The CCP sought to avoid direct conflicts with the Japanese Army in order to emerge from the war stronger than the Nationalist forces, so in the inevitable struggle for dominance, the CCP would be the victor.</i></p>
<p>As I mentioned in the discussion page of the article itself, the sentences do not sound neutral. It would be more appropriate to say something like "The CCP avoided frontal confrontations with the Japanese Imperial Army while conducting guerilla warfare, in order to spread communist influences and build bases of operations." <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanfresco_7666.html" title="User:Hanfresco">Hanfresco</a> 12:26, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. There's a dispute currently happening on this page. A user added in rank information about two supposed older ranks, the PLA's Marshall and Grand Marshal equivalents. An admin is convinced that the person adding is a sockpuppet and had him banned and reverted. From seeing the edits, and from seeing a source the admin provided, the edits seem legitimate, but I'm not very familiar with the PLA, myself. Since you're in the History wikiproject, you might know a bit more about it and be in a position to comment and hopefully help settle the dispute. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 11:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
