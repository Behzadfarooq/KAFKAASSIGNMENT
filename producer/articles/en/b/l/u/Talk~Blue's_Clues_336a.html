<p>"Also in 2004, Pat Robertson urged a boycott of the show citing satanic messages embedded in episodes of the program." Is there any evidence to back this up? I can't find it on Google.

<p>I've heard from a couple of unreliable sources that he quit because he couldn't bring himself to be as cheerful as that character (i.e. he couldn't take it anymore). I note at the bottom a suggestion that "He left to listen to Death Metal music and eat pineapple and drink wiskey." [sic]. I've corrected the formatting, but it should probably be removed if there is no actual proof (and I can find none). <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerise_55d3.html" title="User:Cerise">cerise</a> 01:11, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I deleted the statement saying that Steve left to become a Nacho Vender, among other things (that you've already stated above). This is absolutely rediculous and absolutely unconfirmed. There are no sources for it and it does not belong in an encyclopedia. If it continues to be vandalized, we should petition for it to be locked.

<dd>I went ahead and deleted the statement "Rumours had it he died of a drug overdose" under Steve in the hosts section. The rumor itself is an urban legend, and was documented on the page for Steve Burns already. I don't think there's any need to have something like that mentioned in the article for a kids television show. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodernaut_6a9b.html" title="User:Codernaut">Codernaut</a> 17:48, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Steve quit because he couldn't take it anymore. It was probably too embarassing and ruining his social life. It also would be hard keeping up a stupid little kid voice all the time.

<p>I really don't think something like Blue's Clues should be compaired to South Park, its a bit of a constrast, isn't it? Could we not think of something more relevent to the people that woudl be looking for this information.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamesspwns_7123.html" title="User:Shamesspwns">Shamess</a> 10:23, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The South Park comparison is particularly unnecessary in that:</p>
<p>1. The South Park animation is rendered on and from computer-created elements. In an extra on one of the BC DVDs the show's creators demonstrated how much of what is seen on screen are actually organic everyday objects that are shot against a felt backboard. Those items are then imported through a Photoshop-like process as individual components that are later part of the animation or worked into a background setting.</p>
<p>2. South Park does not have a real-life character that is integrated into the episodes via green chroma-key backdrop.70.35.232.123 00:11, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think the second point is so crucial--no one's saying that the show's are exactly alike, just that the animation techniques are similar. But you may have a point with your first objection--are the animation techniques really that similar? I don't know enough about the animation of either show to be able to say--South Park looks like actual pieces of paper are photographed and then manipulated, like Blue's Clues, but maybe not. Anyway, whether the comparison is apt or not is to me a technical question, and I'll defer to someone who seems to know what they're talking about. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 03:54, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The main target audience of <i>Blue's Clues</i> are pre-school children--I doubt many of them are going to Wikipedia for further info about Blue and Tickety-Tock. In fact, I suspect that only a small percentage of this audiences knows how to read, even at the <i>Hop on Pop</i> level.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>The secondary audience for <i>Blue's Clues</i> are the parents of pre-school children; they should not be shocked to see a reference to an animated show not aimed at children. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 16:23, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the recent rewrite and expansion, the article is much better now, I saw recently that Steven Burns said one of the reasons that he left was he was going (now is) bald and did not want everyone to see this happen on the show. It was on the recent "Behind the Scenes of Blue's Clues" special. I mention it here because I'm not sure if it's relavant enough. Davidac18643 05:13, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2004-01%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22Blue%27s+Clues%22+%22Valentine%27s+Day%22+%22Love+Day%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2004-01%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22Blue%27s+Clues%22+%22Valentine%27s+Day%22+%22Love+Day%22" rel="nofollow">Google search</a> to see how "widely" <i>Blue's Clues</i> has been criticized for celebrating Love Day rather than Valentine's Day. I came up with one <a href="http://www.thenationaldebate.com/blog/archives/2004/03/viacom_declares.html" class="external text" title="http://www.thenationaldebate.com/blog/archives/2004/03/viacom_declares.html" rel="nofollow">blog</a> and one <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1353581/posts" class="external text" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1353581/posts" rel="nofollow">webpost</a>. Given that Valentine's Day hasn't been a Catholic religious holiday since 1969--before the parents of most <i>Blue's Clues</i> viewers were born--and that it was always a thinly disguised pagan celebraton, I would say that this "controversy" is non-notable. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 22:53, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't mind "Blue's Room" as a seperate spin off, but adding the segment to the show turns a nice 23 min. program into a rushed 18 min program to make room for the last segment. Also, one of the important reinforcing messages, "Now it's Time for So Long" has been discarded for a trite good bye, but I don't know how to add this without making an opinion out of it. I think it's a valid point, but it might be too subjective to be factual.Davidac18643 05:18, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I saw it once. It was freaky. Suddenly Blue can talk and he's three-dimensional! Well, why didn't he ever talk before? Does Joe and Steve know he can talk? Have you ever seen his "room" in the Blue's Clues show? If you do I'd like to hear about it. The_Little_One_Smiles 19:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't find Blue's Clues to be very similar to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Park_326f.html" title="South Park">South Park</a>. Blue's Clues is different because it features an actual live-action person superimposed on animation.

<p>I don't think that Schlau should be translated as "smartly" since this word is almost never used in the English language. I see it translated in German-English Dictionaries more often as "clever" than "smartly" I propose the translation be changed to "clever"</p>

<p>1. If we don't have a date for an episode, can we just leave it blank? Seems like clutter.</p>
<p>2. What does it mean for a first season show to have a date in 2006?</p>
<p>3. The 1/2/2003 format is kind of problematic--since not everyone reads that as Month/Date/Year (or Date/Month/Year, for that matter). Though longer, the January 2, 2003 format would probably be better.</p>
<p>4. Episode titles should have quotes around them, right? <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENareek_2a6e.html" title="User:Nareek">Nareek</a> 02:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I cleared the 0/0/0 entries. It looks like those were probably pasted from tv.com(?) The 2006 dates for early season episodes also appear to have been copied form an external source, there are other lists on the internet that provide identical dates.

<p>There is a reference to Blue and Baby Bear here, but I can't find any info about this "movie" elsewhere on the net - and given that it's got a 2006 date on it, you would think there'd be something to find. Nothing on IMDB.</p>

<p>Is Blue's Clues still in production? I saw a recent programing guide in the local paper that says new episodes of Blue's Room will be coming out in 01/2007, but no mention of Blue's Clues. Also, as noted, it has been dropped from the CBS schedule. If the show is no longer being produced it should be noted. I will try to get information and either add it or post here. Davidac18643 03:39, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Blue's Clues does appear to be over, however the spin off Blue's Room is still in production and has taken the place of Blue's Clues. The format is basically the same as previous Blue's Room episodes made previously, but Joe (Donovan Patton) is featured in each episode. There needs to be either an improved Blue's Room section or a new article for the new show with a link to this one. Most of the supporting and minor characters have yet to appear in the new Blue's Room episodes. The main characters are Blue, Joe, and Sprinkles, and mostly the episodes revolve around trying to educate Sprinkles about a different subject, often involving clues or hints, but no game of Blue's Clues or notebook has yet been involved. Also, the 10th anniversary special should be changed to a Blue's Room episode, not a Blue's Clues episode. Davidac18643 17:05, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sure the effort required to add the information regarding the 14 Volume (disk?) Singapore Video CD collection was nontrivial. I chose to delete the information becuase it was trivial, and (in my opinion) not relevant to readers outside Singapore.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the US (and in most other countries and languages) the content has only been released on <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> and <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> (not <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_CD_c1f0.html" title="Video CD">Video CD</a>).</li>
<li>The number of home titles and contents seems to vary by format and language; Information specific to Singapore released VCDs without similar information in other formats seems POV. (An honor usually reserved for US-centric or British-centric content on the English Wikipedia).</li>
</ol>
<p>If someone feels the need to revert it, I'm sure they will. I do hope they'll take a few minutes to work on the grammer, etc. <a href="../../../s/r/i/User%7ESrice13_e904.html" title="User:Srice13">Srice13</a> 22:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
