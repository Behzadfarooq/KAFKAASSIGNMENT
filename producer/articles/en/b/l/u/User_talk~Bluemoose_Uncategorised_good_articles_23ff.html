<dd>Exactly! These are much easier to work on (because there are links to follow and gather categories from).Also alot of times I can help clean up the article too.

<p>Bluemoose, Is there any rhyme or reason to how the articles are sorted? I have a feeling alphabetization could speed things up by putting similar articles together. Example: <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004%2C_in_Colorado_b674.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004, in Colorado">U.S. presidential election, 2004, in Colorado</a> was in 38 and <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2000%2C_in_Florida_21ad.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2000, in Florida">U.S. presidential election, 2000, in Florida</a> was in 52.- <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> 23:50, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good point, when you scan the datadump it comes out pretty random, I forgot to alphabetise it, I have done it now. I'll remember to do it to start with in the future, that way it will keep the section headers as well. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 00:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be a bunch of boxing categories that aren't linked into the people category tree. I've found the categories Heavyweight and Puerto Rican boxers. Should a Professional boxer category be added to People by occupation? It seems to me that it might be better to add a Professional sports category at this level. There's already a category called Sports occupations but everything in there are occupations related to Sports, such as coaches and refs.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 20:43, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Never mind.

<p>This one got an inconclusive AfD vote so we need to handle it, but I couldn't find any categories this could be placed in. The obvious one is Universities and colleges in South Africa but it doesn't really fit there, not being a college itself. I could create a new catagory for University of Cape Town and put Smuts Hall and the article for University of Cape Town in it, but is it a good idea to create a category for two items? I'm not sure how much it would ever be expanded. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 07:01, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The date articles (August 1, 2005) should probably be excluded from the list. They're already in category Days in 2005 and categorizing each day by what events occur on that day would result in very large category lists, and be very time consuming. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 06:41, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All of these pages are linked to by Lists of environment topics which has the correct categories.

<dd>There will be more, waiting for next datadump though, to avoid picking up ones that have been categorised already. What I'll do is lower the standards of a "good" article each time to get about 500 - 600 new ones, until the standard becomes less than "good".

<dd>I think that includes all the namespaces, I was only looking at the main namespace. It also says there are 1.7 million articles in the mainspace, which means it must include redirects or something. It also says "Categories that are inserted via a template are not detected." which is an innacurate method, as articles with no category and a template are generally categorised by that template (disambig pages being the obvious example). If I use their criteria I get a similar number to them, though I'm still not convinced the way I did it was accurate. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:29, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did a mini survey by clicking Random article 158 times: 151 pages were categorized, 7 were not. I considered stubs to be categorized, but not pages whose only categories were maintenance (eg cleanup, lacking sources, etc). Using the percentage 151/158 = 95.6%, that gives ~44,000 uncategorized articles. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 23:38, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am considering updating <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> where it says "Every page in the article namespace should belong to at least one category" to carve out an exception for sub-lists. These are lists such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_M_A_S_H_episodes_%28Season_1%29_3ee9.html" title="List of M*A*S*H episodes (Season 1)">List of M*A*S*H episodes (Season 1)</a> where a larger list was broken up into multiple pages with the original list page having links to each of the sub-list pages. I don't believe that in many cases it makes sense for these sub-lists to belong to the same categories as their parent list page.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="../../../m/2A/a/Category%7EM_A_S_H_d0e2.html" title="Category:M*A*S*H">Category:M*A*S*H</a> the parent page of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_M_A_S_H_episodes_%28Season_1%29_3ee9.html" title="List of M*A*S*H episodes (Season 1)">List of M*A*S*H episodes (Season 1)</a>.

<p>The question I have for this group is what effect would it have to the effort to categorize un-categorized pages to have some pages that are purposely un-categorized? Is there some way to mark the pages so they don't show up in Bluemoose's list? Does it make sense to create Category:Pages that aren't supposed to have a category?

<dd>It wouldn't be too problematical, as long as a record was kept of articles that shouldn't have categories. That said, I think the current guideline is good, we should always try to add at least one category to every page, in the example you give the mash episodes could have their own sub-category or something. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 16:28, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
