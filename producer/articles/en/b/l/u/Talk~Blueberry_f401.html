<dd>I wish Wikipedia would standardize on using the scientific names of plant species, with redirects from the common names. But it seems that a lot, probaby the majority, use the common names as the main page, so it's a hodgepodge right now.

<dd>The swedish link is on <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blueberry.html" title="Blueberry">blueberry</a>. No, <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccinium.html" title="Vaccinium">Vaccinium</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blueberry.html" title="Blueberry">blueberry</a> are not the same. <i>Vaccinium</i> includes many species which would never be called blueberry (such as the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranberry.html" title="Cranberry">cranberry</a>). Certainly settling on scientific names would be good, although redirects would not solve all the problems either. A combination of redirects and slightly enlarged disambiguation pages would probably do it. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWormRunner_5b32.html" title="User:WormRunner">WormRunner</a> 18:50, 14 Jan 2004 (UTC)

<dd>an anon has again added Scandinavia to the list of places where blueberries are native. In view of the discussion above (in the Growth section) I have deleted this but I don't have authoritative sources. The article seems to have settled down to considering one section of the genus and it should be reasonably clear whether any members of this section are found in Europe - can anyone sort it out? <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 17:51, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Correct that no species of <i>Vaccinium</i> sect. <i>Cyanococcus</i> are native to Europe. The species with 'blueberry' in their English names all (fortuitously!) happen to be classified in this section. The European native species of <i>Vaccinium</i> are in other sections of the genus. The problem lies in that European native <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> (<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilberry.html" title="Bilberry">Bilberry</a> in English; in <i>Vaccinium</i> sect. <i>Myrtillus</i>) happens to have the common name "Blåbär" (translates as 'blueberry') in Swedish, which leads to confusion between the two sections - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 22:01, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The photo on this page labelled <i>Wild blueberries collected in Norway</i> actually depicts bilberries rather than blueberries. If you look at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garibaldi/254885460" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garibaldi/254885460" rel="nofollow">another picture by the same photographer</a>, you can see that these berries were growing singly on a stem rather than clustered like American blueberries. The Norwegian name Blåbær causes the same confusion as the Swedish name.</p>

<dd>Any plant or animal is composed of thousands (or millions) of different chemicals, and we can't possibly give the formula for all of them here. The formula is often not sufficient, either. For exampe fructose (the sugar in blueberries and many other fruits) has the same chemical formula as glucose (C6H12O6), but the atoms are arranged slightly differently. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 14:00, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only confirmed benefit I know of is the anti-oxidants, which prevent the cellular damage associated with aging. As far as other benefits, they may well be by "replacement". That is, you will be less likely to get sick if you eat lots of blueberries instead of chili-cheese fries, not because the blueberries cure disease, but because the chili-cheese fries cause disease. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 13:53, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wanted to know why the link that I placed on this page to Stone Hill Blueberry Farm was removed. This site is an informational site about a Blueberry Farm in New York and has no shopping cart.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed it because it is a page promoting a specific blueberry farm. The whole front page promotes the farm as a business and a lot of the links do too. If a link to this page is allowed then we will end up with links to every blueberry farm with a page or two providing blueberry information. --<a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeirne_2721.html" title="User:Beirne">Beirne</a> 12:07, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thats fair enough I can except that. I have to question why a link to the Michigan Blueberry Growers Association is allowed to stay though. It's home page includes a link in its main navigation to the blueberry store .com which is an online store. Both sites happen to be owned by the same company according to whosis. Seems like that is promoting an online store.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me know why it was pulled off.</p>

<dd>Well, any web site will eventually lead to an ad somewhere.

<dd>Thank you for providing the link to the external linking rules--I had not seen that although I did look at the policies I guess I did not did deep enough. Just want to bring up a couple points.</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. I cringe when I see where I wrote except instead of accept. 2. Although I can certainly see where others would look at the site I posted as "just and ad" I don't look at it that way. This is a site that I have worked on for over 4 years, I have never made a penny on it, and don't plan to in the future. It truly was designed as a favor to the owners. The only way the owners can ever make a penny off this site is if someone sees it and decides to come pick berries. The chances of that happening are pretty slim. Which brings me to.... 3. Now I see how wrong this link was. Links on here need to be something that is of use to anyone who visits, not just people in a certain area. I have learned from my mistake. 4. Finally, I want you to know that I posted in good faith--it was not an attempt to mess up Wikipedia. I thought the site was a good addition to the page--I was wrong. Thank you for your time.</p>

<dd>Yes and no. Species of <i><a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccinium.html" title="Vaccinium">Vaccinium</a></i> are native in Europe (and Asia), but the name 'blueberry' is not used for them in UK English, they are given other names like Bilberry and Whortleberry. A classic example of common names being a complete mess (and at risk of generating difficult POV-disputes). Related names are used in some other European languages, e.g. Scots <i>Blaeberry</i> and Swedish <i>Blåbär</i> both translate directly as blueberry, and are applied to the European species <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>. I think this is going to make any realistic raising of 'Blueberry' to a featured article very difficult if not impossible; the name is too loosely applied, not being a single species, nor being applied consistently in different countries. My own preference would be to deal with most of the botanical and cultivation information (where it applies to all species in the genus) at the genus page <i><a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccinium.html" title="Vaccinium">Vaccinium</a></i>, and any remaining botanical info unique to particular species at individual species pages titled by their scientific names. Then the Blueberry page would be restricted to a page of culinary and social information (traditions, etc). - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 01:44, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Trying to lump common botanical and (especially) cultivation info into <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccinium.html" title="Vaccinium">Vaccinium</a> seems to fall on its face when you consider how different <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranberry.html" title="Cranberry">cranberry</a> harvesting is from most of the other more blueberry-like species. I think we go ahead and include <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> in this article; everyhing I've seen seems to indicate it is similar enough in appearance and use, no? —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The botanical info at <i><a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccinium.html" title="Vaccinium">Vaccinium</a></i> certainly needs a lot of work (which I'll get down to soon), but it can (and should, unless the genus gets split up) all be on that page. Cultivation - that for cranberries is already on that page; for blueberries, that too differs from species to species (e.g. highbush and lowbush species differ in requirements), so that too should perhaps devolve to individual species pages. If <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> were included, it would introduce a US-POV out of keeping with wiki NPOV policy, as it isn't called a blueberry, so that would not work well. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 12:35, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>... and if <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> isn't handled it introduces a US-POV for ignoring Europe's "blueberry". A cunning trap set for us indeed. Perhaps this article could focus more on the culinary properties of those species commonly called "blueberries" and thereby avoid some of the cultivation and botanical issues? I know, I know, then it won't be comprehensive. Hmph. (Postscript: wait, I see that's what you already pretty much suggested, MPF. I guess I'm in agreement.) —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:03, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've got the <i>Vaccinium</i> page sorted a bit from the USDA genetics resources page, tho' haven't been able to find any info on how the different sections are related to each other. But all the species called 'blueberry' do cluster in one section (sect. <i>Cyanococcus</i>, which, BTW, is Greek for guess what!), which does give better options on making 'blueberry' a valid botanical grouping as well as a cultural etc page. It does make the options for getting the page to featured quality a lot better - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 17:53, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're working hard, I see. So will it be impossible to upgrade blueberry to the featured article level? If the task is too difficult, I could move the collaboration to something within a simpler range. (Although I'm a bit skeptical on the fact that blueberry can't become featured.) —Hollow Wilerding 00:04, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read a couple of health magazines (the free ones whose articles are basically advertisements for the products they advertise) that state that the most absorbable form of calcium is the form extracted from blueberries. It is called calcium fructoborate. The magazines showed the monograms that "proved" that calcium fructoborate is more absorbable than all other forms in the supplemnt market. Since they had monograms, there must be a scientific study somewhere behind the monograms (hopefully).

<p>I have read on a website that Vaccinium deliciosum (Cascade Bilberry) is the most delicious of bilberries because it is the only bilberry/blueberry to have ten flavor components. Apperently there is a research paper to back this up (the ten flavor component claim). Are there any objections to mentioning this in the article?</p>
<p>Since I have never ate them, I cannot attest to this claim. Maybe I can write "most flavorful" or "most complex/sophisticated flavor" as opposed to "most delicious".24.83.178.11 12:20, 4 March 2007 (UTC)KnowledgeSeeker</p>

<dd>There is nothing at all wrong with reporting what some reliable source has written. If the research paper can be considered reliable, you can report whatever conclusions it came to. If there's any way to mention the authority of the paper -- if you can say whether or not it was written by someone particularly authoritative in the field or appeared in an authoritative publication, that's even better, but if it looks essentially reliable to you, please contribute the information, and if there's a problem with it, some editor will no doubt bring it up. And you don't have to tone down what that source says, so long as that source appears to be reliable.
