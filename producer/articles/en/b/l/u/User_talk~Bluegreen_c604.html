<p>Thanks for trying to get the use of "<a href="../../../p/r/o/Progesterone.html" title="Progesterone">progesterone</a>" correct in Wikipedia articles. What do you think about the term <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progestogen.html" title="Progestogen">progestogen</a>? --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 5 July 2005 06:25 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thankyou for noticing and commenting. There is more to do. I think the word is fine for when progesterone is meant to be included. But so often there is a distinction that needs to be noticed. Not being given the right progestogen (:-)) had a pretty devastating effect on me, and on several others I know. We have a doctor on here saying it's "common usage" to use progesterone for everything so it's OK, even in medical articles, and reverts corrections. The <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_Health_Initiative_10ab.html" title="Women's Health Initiative">Women's Health Initiative</a> study with Provera keeps being misreported as involving progesterone (but not here). The MS research on potential benefits (because progesterone halts deterioration during pregnancy) is being done with a progestin, but at least it isn't MPA. Even some top cancer researchers don't seem to know, and don't seem to want to know, the difference, which seems like it could hinder their work somewhat, it tending to be regulatory.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>We might have some overlapping interests, from what is on your website. My interest is primarily in aspects of the biological basis of varied identities, and its ramifications in life and society. I hope we find ourselves in agreement frequently.--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluegreen_1573.html" title="User:Bluegreen">Bluegreen</a> 07:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You wrote: <i>Rename railroaded</i> <i>I see, after a rapid pair of discussions, the last [1] extremely superficial, with one lone response, it is now a done deal that this gets renamed Gender Transitioning, despite the fact that it isn't our gender identity (commonly abbreviated to simply Gender) that changes, but instead our sexual phenotype (in the case of transsexualism), or at the least some aspect of Gender Role, in other cases. Did that simply get overlooked, or is this just another little victory for those who think its all just about messing with gender? Bluegreen</i></p>
<p>I happened to cast the only vote on the rename issue for the CfR. Well, I think you can reasonably assume the nominator voted the same. I was disappointed that other editors <b>like yourself</b> did not choose to participate in the CfR request too. I <i>do</i> think the renaming was the best (or at least a quite good) choice, but would certainly rather have been joined by other editors in voting. The notice requesting votes was prominently displayed on the category page for a couple weeks (as well as listed in the regular administrative pages with other CfRs).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Two weeks is too little notice for such a reclassification. The failure of all but yourself to comment in the second instance, compared to the larger number in the first seems likely to indicate that the rapid second CfR was not noticed in time by others too. Surely a RfC of name of a sensitive category should be advertised at all the pages of that category? If it had been then I would have noticed, and participated.--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluegreen_1573.html" title="User:Bluegreen">Bluegreen</a> 16:20, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But the CfR followed an earlier CfR suggesting "-&gt;Transexual transitioning". There was unanimous consensus that the "Topics related..." verbal form is wrong for WP categories. So the fact that it should be renamed to <i>something</i> was obvious. But a number of voters in that first CfR proposed several different options. Several editors there felt that "transexual" was overly narrow in excluding non-op (or even pre-op) transgender folks. "Gender transitioning" was not endorsed by the clear consensus of voters (partially because proposals were made throughout the voting period), but it was the phrase that seemed to have the widest support.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't make it suitable though, as my remarks you copied in above indicate.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's really insulting to complain of "railroading" because you chose not to vote on a very public CfR.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"insulting"? Two people with no obvious connections with, and in one case admitted ignorance of the subjects decide how the category shall be renamed, in the apparent abence of others with better knowledge who thought differently? I would suggest that you, finding yourself the lone participant, should at least have expressed anxiety that perhaps the vote was too limited, perhaps that it should be extended and more widely publicised.--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluegreen_1573.html" title="User:Bluegreen">Bluegreen</a> 16:20, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not clear what you would propose for the category name in the affirmative (rather than just sniping at the name found by working editors). But I generally think that your comments do not represent a full understanding of the facets involved in the concept "gender". Whatever your understanding though, I don't know how you think WP admins and editors are supposed to read your mind about it if you don't bother stating it in the vote. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 16:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a crucial difference between not knowing about a vote and failing/not bothering to participate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Transitioning gender roles</b> would be one more suitable name, because all the pages do deal with that, although several also go further and deal with changing sexual phenotype, and, whether or not people's own experience is that their gender identity had always been that which they bring the rest of their life to match, at some point we, who have had that dysphoria, do transition the gender roles, to a greater or less extent. The distinction is actually a remarkably sensitive one, involving the widely significant issue of whether mental gender is inborn, changeable, or acquired. To plump for <b>Gender Transitioning</b> is to come down, inadvertently or not, on the side that says it is not inborn, and so fails, incidentally, to be NPOV.--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluegreen_1573.html" title="User:Bluegreen">Bluegreen</a> 16:20, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
