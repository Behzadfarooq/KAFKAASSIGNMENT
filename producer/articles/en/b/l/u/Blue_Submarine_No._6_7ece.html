Blue Submarine #6's conning tower is visible as she departs from a flooded city under attack from Zorndyke's forces.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The story begins in the near future, when the Earth's oceans have risen and flooded most of the sea-lying land on Earth. Due to the efforts of the rogue scientist <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zorndyke.html" title="Zorndyke">Zorndyke</a> the flooding killed billions; most of humanity's remaining cities have been destroyed or attacked by Zorndyke's army of Hybrids. The remaining humans begin to wage war against Zorndyke's sea-going creations for simple survival. Humanity's best hope for a resolution to the conflict lies with its <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">submarine</a> forces, among which is the focus of the story, Blue Submarine #6.</p>
<p>It is revealed that <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zorndyke.html" title="Zorndyke">Zorndyke</a> is attempting to decisively end the conflict in the favor of his hybrid children by artificially inducing a <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geomagnetic_reversal.html" title="Geomagnetic reversal">polar switch</a> using <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geothermal_energy.html" title="Geothermal energy">geothermal energy</a> at the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Pole_a6b5.html" title="South Pole">South Pole</a>.</p>

<p>The OVA starts out with patrol planes dropping sonar buoys into the ocean, searching for an enemy vessel, the <i>Ghost Ship</i>, commanded by Verg, a shark-type hybrid. A nearby patrolling submarine named the Shang 9 (an <a href="../../../s/s/g/SSGN_2ce9.html" title="SSGN">SSGN</a> type submarine) received messages citing that a potential threat has been spotted, and goes to battle stations.</p>
<p>In a near-by city, decimated by the rising tides, a young female officer named Mayumi Kino and a fellow sailor Mouse are on a mission to re-recruit Tetsu Hayami, An elite cadet at the Naval Academy; he was involved in the development of the Grampus (smaller, two person crew submarine capable of short and long range combat. The shape of its dorsal-like fins can be manipulated to strike at its target) during his years at the academy. He refused to rejoin Blue Fleet, and Mayami radioed in their non-success. Meanwhile, the creature that was spotted earlier in the episode (later identified as a Musuca) shielded in a large white tube-like shield, prowls the sunken city streets and launched several Umigumo, large crab-like robots that attack with large pincer-claws that holster cannons and many hundred anti-aircraft rounds. While they conduct their attack- starting with the destruction of two <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a>- they broadcast a message from Zorndyke stating that "resistance is futile", similar to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>'s <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borg_%28fictional_aliens%29.html" title="Borg (fictional aliens)">Borg</a>. Kino attempted to get aboard a cutter to return to Blue 6's port, but unfortunately they were blown out of the water. She and her fellow sailor spot an elderly woman who was stranded. Mouse shoulders her, and they become surrounded by Umigumo. Hayami reappears with his own speed boat, and guns down the two Umigumo, rescuing Kino and the other two.</p>
<p>Blue 6 departs her berth, and sets out to sea. Kino, Hayami, Mouse, and the old woman all board the sub, and the fight begins. The Musuca's bubbling white shield is shattered, and the creature is revealed to be a large sentient deformed looking <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whale.html" title="Whale">whale</a>. It released more Umigumo, and Kino and Hayami depart in a Grampus, an underwater robot that converts into a submarine speeder, to fight the Umigumo.</p>
<p>A daring undersea battle commences, with the Blue 6 destroying the Musuca with the help of the Shang, whose <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commanding_Officer_6386.html" title="Commanding Officer">CO</a> is revealed to be a personal friend of Blue 6's captain.</p>
<p>Hayami destroyed all of the Umigumo, with the final emerging from the water and landing on a beach. Hayami pursued it with a small detachable robot, and sprayed it with bullets. He dismounts, and approached the device which opened up to reveal a woman-like creature who emerges, and Hayami returns the creature to the water after arguing with Kino over what to do with it.</p>
<p>The episode concludes with Kino and Hayami discussing what they have witnessed in the past day. Out at sea, Verg, a shark-like young man in command of the <i>Ghost</i> or <i>Phantom Ship</i>- a submersible <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a> mounted on a colossal <a href="../../../w/h/a/Whale_shark.html" title="Whale shark">Whale shark</a>-like entity- shells the city from afar.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Submarine_No._6_7ece.html" title="Edit section: Pilots">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pilots</span></h4>
<p>The <i>Phantom Ship</i> succeeded in destroying the port city, but the Shang and the Blue 6 escaped. The Shang pursues and engages the <i>Phantom</i> with its <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruise_missile.html" title="Cruise missile">cruise missile</a>, but is destroyed by the <i>Phantom</i>s retaliation. During the battle a part of Blue 6 comes in contact with a strange, bubbly, greenish substance that slowly comes off the sub, but no one notices. The <i>Six</i> escaped to the depths of the ocean, a sets sail for the submarine headquarters.</p>
<p>Verg delivers a message to Zorndyke about his military success. Zorndyke tells him to "be safe, come back soon." Feeling like his "papa" didn't like how he won, Verg throws a fit, tries to shove his large blue tongue down one the girls' throats, and then slams the sheath of his sword onto the ground.</p>
<p>Verg then confronts the girl from inside the Umigumo and punishes her for touching a human. We only see him putting his arms around her shoulders, but the camera angles upward and they are out of the picture before we can witness what he does. We hear the girl struggle and scream.</p>
<p>In The Uncut version, we see him holding her shoulders and sucking her right ear.</p>
<p>The <i>Six</i> is headed towards the Blue Dome, an underwater shell-shaped superfortress that serves as Blue Fleet's main berthing facility. Character development ensues during the trip. Hayami, who had seen the plans for Blue Dome, smiles as he sees the entire Blue Fleet for the first time. The Blue Fleet consists of many state-of-the-art submarines, each built by its respective country (#1 is the United States, #2 is United Kingdom, #3 is France, #4 is Germany, #5 is Russia, #6 is Japan, #7 is Australia, #8 is China, and #9 is Singapore).</p>
<p>A conference is called, hosted by a scientist responsible for Blue Fleet's operations. All of the members of the Blue Fleet are in attendance. Atlantic Fleet's commander is giving a speech, when Zorndyke hijacks the teleconference and makes a speech of his own. He appears not as a murderous monster as described, but a calm, collected, even philosophical old man (this side of Zorndyke is shown as he spends some time teaching one of his animal-like followers poems of the <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Man%27y%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB.html" title="Man'yōshū">Man'yōshū</a></i>; she recites the ironically-appropriate poem during his funeral). Hayami leaves, and is waylaid in a corridor by a military escort that is wheeling along a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casket.html" title="Casket">casket</a> filled with water. Hayami learns that a former friend and comrade is inside, suffering a mutation into a hideous monster. Originally Hayami and he attempted to infiltrate Zorndyke's base in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, to try to conduct a peace meeting. Their Grampus was shot down, and Hayami's friend was captured. He is the only one ever to escape from Zorndyke's stronghold.</p>
<p><br />
Meanwhile the Phantom Ship, following the trail of green bubbles that have fallen off of <i>Six</i> during her return to Fleet HQ, managed to locate Blue Dome, and proceeded to attack the facility. With the majority of Blue Fleet's submarine corps still inside a desperate effort is undertaken to get as many of these subs out as is possible. Hayami takes a training Grampus out to attack the Phantom ship in an effort to buy some time, but fails when a human hand hits his windshield, distracting him long enough for a turret to target him. Hayami was shot down, but managed to eject to the surface. In the end, all Blues manage to escape the Dome except for the Shinha, which is knocked out of its berth, but two are heavily damaged and one is moderately damaged; since only three subs are seen in the last episode (#6, 7, and 8), it is assumed these subs are left behind.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Submarine_No._6_7ece.html" title="Edit section: Hearts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hearts</span></h4>
<p>Hayami has a dream about his friend's misfortune, and awakens with Mutio, the aquatic hybrid girl he rescued in episode one, appearing to him with a fish for him to eat. A quick check of the surroundings show the audience that he is now camping out on what had been part of the Blue Dome facility that rose to the surface at the end of Episode 2.</p>
<p>Hundreds of her sisters arrive, and surround the two on the flotsam from Blue Base. They leave as a large Musuca arrives, and Hayami and Mutio leave while being borne upon him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an impatient Verg brings his "Ghost Ship" into the Arctic to reload its weapon cache. Verg has somehow acquired nuclear weapons, which he intends to use against the Blue Fleet to eliminate the entire fleet with one searing blast. Zorndyke's army is stationed in and around the Arctic ice in preparation for the arrival of the Pacific Blue Fleet, while another group prepares for contact with the diversionary Atlantic Blue Fleet.</p>
<p>Blue Six and the Atlantic Fleet rendez-vous, and a Cold War relic, a <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhoon_class_submarine.html" title="Typhoon class submarine"><i>Typhoon</i> class submarine</a> with a full load of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_missiles.html" title="Nuclear missiles">nuclear missiles</a> is readied with AI control. It is designated "Sub Zero". The fleet travels to Antarctica, arriving just in time. They encounter the Musuca bearing Hayami and Mutio, which alerts them to the Army's presence Blue Fleet goes to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_alert.html" title="Red alert">red alert</a>. They rescue Hayami, but Mutio left with the mortally wounded Musuca, who is dying before Hayami ever encountered it. Hayami and Kino ready a Grandpus for the coming battle.</p>
<p><a name="Minasoko" id="Minasoko"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Submarine_No._6_7ece.html" title="Edit section: Minasoko">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Minasoko</span></h4>
<p>A massive undersea battle ensues, with many twists and turns. <i>Six</i>’s captain (apparently the man responsible for the other subs) orders all ships to "...fight to the death" to protect "Sub Zero". Several volleys of torpedo and anti-torpedo weaponry are exchanged as each side seeks to gain the upper hand in the battle. Hayami and Kino take the <i>Six's</i> Grampus out to confront Zorndyke, with Hayami busting his friend, now an aquatic hybrid, out of the storage chamber that was stored on the <i>Six</i> (They used his knowledge to penetrate the Antarctic's passages, and in exchange he keeps Zorndyke's creatures away from the Grampus), and he is freed into the ocean. Hayami sees him off one last time as they sped away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Atlantic Fleet engages Zorndyke’s forces on the other side of the Antarctic in an effort to draw as many enemy forces away from the Pacific Fleet as is possible. This results in the probable annihilation of the Atlantic Fleet, as the overwhelming number of submarines- including the Altantic Fleet’s admiral’s flagship- are destroyed.</p>
<p>After several battles, Sub Zero, with the nuclear missiles, was forced to surface, but <i>Six</i> after a series of battles, managed to destroy Verg's "Ghost Ship", losing the rest of the fleet; except <i>Three,</i> which acted as a decoy. <i>Six's</i> captain and 1st officer prepare to remotely authorize the nuclear barrage into Zorndyke's territory.</p>
<p>Hayami and Kino landed in the Arctic, transformed by Geothermal energy into a small paradise, and meet Zorndyke face to face, who reveals his plans for a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pole_shift_theory.html" title="Pole shift theory">pole shift</a>- the reverse of the Earth's magnetic field, which would eliminate humanity. We learn that he can no longer power the machines to conduct the pole shift, and that if Blue Fleet launches her nuclear weapons, the machines will be super-powered and the pole shift will begin. The machines, interestingly enough, use Zorndyke's own heart as a passcode.</p>
<p>Kino confronts Zorndyke with Hayami's pistol, but after a bit of tense standoff, Kino was not able to kill Zorndyke, and thus, saved the world. Zorndyke then asked Hayami to pass on to the Blue fleet... Leave the Poles and this ocean (?) to his 'children', and there can be co-existence between his 'children' and the humans.</p>
<p>Verg- who survived the sinking of his "Ghost Ship" managed to swim to shore, and attacked Kino and Hayami, but broke down emotionally at the site of Zorndyke's funeral procession, for he loved Zorndyke as a father. He and Mutio, as well as an animal-like band of processioners, carry Zorndyke to rest at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p><i>Six</i> picks up Kino and Hayami, and the series ends as the war ends.</p>
