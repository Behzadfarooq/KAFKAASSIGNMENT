<p>The club, established in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, uses a <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck.html" title="Duck">duck</a> for its badge. But the badge was modified in 2005 by including the mottos into the badge.</p>
<p>Blunsdon United was formed by the merger of two even smaller football teams, Broad Blunsdon FC (established on 13th of August <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, based in the village of Broad Blunsdon) and St Andrew Church of England AFC (established on 7th of October in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> and based in the village of Blunsdon St Andrew by the local parish church).</p>
<p>It is a grass-roots football club held in high regard by the village of Blunsdon, seen by locals as keeping Blunsdon "independent", a bulwark against the anonymity of absorption by the sprawling northern suburbs of <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon.html" title="Swindon">Swindon</a>.</p>

<p>The club will be celebrating its 50th year anniversary on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. For this celebration the club announced a minor change to the Blunsdon United club badge.</p>
<p>A 4 ray sun and a crescent moon will be added to the top left and top right corner of the badge respectively. In addition, the duck is slightly modified to include a gold necklace around the neck of the duck with the number 50 on it.</p>
<p>According to the club statement, the necklace will represent the 50 "golden" years the club have and hopefully enjoy for the next 50 years, and the sun and moon represent the hope that Blunsdon United will last as long as the sun and the moon!</p>
<p>The club motto is "pro bono publico" is displayed at the top of the badge and the motto "Quocunque Jeceris Stabit" appear at the bottom of the duck.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blunsdon_United_F.C._d180.html" title="Edit section: Ground">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ground</span></h2>
<p>Previously the club has no permanent grounds, being required to play in an open field "known as William Garden" owned by a local farmer, who uses it to train horses in the summer months (making the field unavailable to the team).</p>
<p>Other former tempory grounds in the club's history are Penhill Fields, Blunsdon St Andrew Ground, Gloucester Victory Park, Eltham Grove and Stockwell.</p>
<p>On<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">April 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the club moved to Warwick Park, a large field behind the semi-detached houses on Ermin Street. This will be their permanent ground for the next 15 years. The field is behind door numbers 20 to number 32 of the houses in Ermin Street. It is commonly known by the local fans as "Mary's Shed" or "Mary's Backyard".</p>
<p>This ground was purchased by the drug and tobacco company ThuyPN, which is based in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streatham.html" title="Streatham">Streatham</a>, south <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. The ground and the stadium is called Warwick Park and have a capacity for 150 people.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blunsdon_United_F.C._d180.html" title="Edit section: Club">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Club</span></h2>
<p>The club sponsor is Headlands WC the toilet maintenance and repair company, based in Upper Stratton, north east <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon.html" title="Swindon">Swindon</a>. It was the club first ever sponsor, started in 1996.</p>
<p>Originally, most of the players in the team were over 30, but more recently the average age has significantly lowered to around 22.</p>
<p>The current manager is Cath Hay, who is famous in the Swindon League for making strange and outrageous comments. The chairman Lingo Phome also has this reputation.</p>
<p>Local rivals to the club are Penhill Pirates, Penhill United, Headlands Grove, Pinehurst Vale, FC Abbey Meads, and Highworth Town. All the teams are based in northern Swindon and the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> Blunsdon United was named "Unsung Team of the Year 2002" in the <i>Swindon Evening Advertiser</i> and was mentioned in a small article in the national tabloid <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29_f6cd.html" title="The Sun (newspaper)">The Sun</a></i>. The club has been noted for improving social behaviour in Blunsdon: for example, three local teenagers who had exhibited anti-social behaviour in the past had their football skills rewarded with a full-time contract partly funded by local charity, and are said to have since expressed the opinion that their lives have taken a turn for the better.</p>
<p>The club's founder is a woman who doubles as "Ling the Duckling", the club's mascot. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, fans staged a large protest against her proposal to change the name of the club to "Blunsdon Ducks United"; the proposal was subsequently withdrawn. Also on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, local rivals Penhill Pirates approach to take over the team was turn down.</p>
<p>The team has never won a final. Their closest run was a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> defeat in the local final against the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon_Supermarine_c44a.html" title="Swindon Supermarine">Swindon Supermarine</a> in the Victory Challenge Cup.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_27.html" title="December 27">December 27</a> 2004, the club started to hand out awards to players for their contribution to the team for the year for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>Combative, tough tackling, dynamic and ball winning midfielder and captain of the club, Keith Hann was voted Blunsdon United player of the year for 2004 by the fans. He was influential and committed in each game for the club. Extremely good passer of the ball and the club playmaker.</p>
<p>Silky fellow winger, William "Chicken" Fann was voted Blunsdon United young player of the year. Due to his good looks, he is a well known gay icon and enjoys flirting with the female fans. Famous for his step over but also for his controversial dives in all areas of the pitch. A hate figure among jealous rival fans.</p>
<p>Tall, skilful and explosive striker Terry "Thierry Henry" Huaw was Blunsdon United top goalscorer with 16 goals in the 2003 - 2004 season. Quick with a powerful long shot but a temperamental player who has to be treated carefully.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blunsdon_United_F.C._d180.html" title="Edit section: Infamous Moment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Infamous Moment</span></h2>
<p>The club was involved in the infamous "Battle of Penhill" on 11th November 2001 after a highly controversial, highly charged and passionate game at The Valley, home of fierce rivals Penhill Pirates.</p>
<p>The wasn't help by the cheeky bid by Penhill Pirates to try to take over the club on 13th September, only two months before. The days leading up to the game involved mind games by the two manager, especially a statement by Bob Ferguson the Penhill Pirates manager, comparing Blunsdon United with the popular toilet duck (a bleach to clean the toilet, since Blunsdon United was sponsor by a toilet maintenance and repair company and the club nickname is The Ducks). Blunsdon United manager Lingo Phome later replied in the local press, "That's coming from a manager whose club is sponsor by Swindon Tip (a rubbish tip) and he's laughing at us!"</p>
<p>Also at the time, Blunsdon United was top of the Swindon League, with Penhill Pirates only 1 point behind in second place.</p>
<p>From the moment the match started, there was tackles flying in, and tempers spill over after a tackle on Penhill Pirate’s Steven Cook by William "Chicken" Fann for which the Blunsdon United man is booked.</p>
<p>Later William "Chicken" Fann was push into one of the goal post when he was accused of diving for a dubious penalty in the Penhill Pirates box. After an angry confrontation with a defender William "Chicken" Fann was chased round the pitch by five Penhill Pirates players.</p>
<p>Then the Penhill Pirates crowd sung at William "Chicken" Fann. "His is a chicken and he try to learn to fly, he try to fly down the wings, but always end with a dive!”</p>
<p><br />
The game was heading to a 1 - 1 draw in a heavy contested, aggressive and controversial match, when in the 90th minute the referee give a dubious penalty to Penhill Pirates for a dive by one of the Penhill Pirate striker when no Blunsdon United player were within yards of him. This started a fracas inside the penalty spot between the two team which sparked a 24-man melee that spilled into the net. The melee even involved the managers of both side. In this incident, William Fann got his shorts ripped by a Penhill United player trying to rugby tackle him. This brings a round of wolf whistles from numerous female pensioners.</p>
<p>After 2 minutes, the referee managed to separate the two teams and have to send off Terry "Thierry Henry" Huaw and Thuytis Phuone for violent behaviour. Thuytis Phuone walk off with a bleeding nose and Terry Huaw with a few missing teeth. William "Chicken" Fann was hit on the head by a shoe and a sock thrown from the home crowd as he run off the pitch. To add to the embarrassment he would have felt, he slip on a banana (must have been thrown earlier onto the pitch) which made him fly over the advertising hoardings and into the crowd at the stands. Two other Penhill Pirates players were also sent off. The match finished 2 - 1 to Penhill Pirates, and send them briefly to the top of the Swindon League.</p>
<p>When both team left the ground after the final whistle, over 70 angry fans of both side nearly face each other on Penhill ridge, just outside the Valley stadium. But the managers of both teams pleaded with the fans to just go home since "it is only a football game". The fans reluctantly oblige.</p>
<p>This "battle" has ended the two clubs good recent form (they were both undefeated in about 10 games), and they were both defeated in their next 3 matches in the Swindon League. By the end of the year, both clubs finished in mid table of the Swindon League.</p>
<p>Both clubs was fined £19.16 for this incident. Blunsdon United attempts to lowered this fine to £19.10 failed.</p>

<p>Highest recorded attendance of 39. This was set in 29th August 2004 against Dunraven Rovers in the home tie of the semi-final of the North Swindon Cup.</p>
<p>Lowest recorded attendance is 2. Bizarre incident when most of the fans travel to London to see Blunsdon United play Dunraven Rovers away in a cup game. But the game was quickly changed to a home tie at Blunsdon United due to a water-logged pitch at Brixton Palace (home of Dunraven Rovers). So the match was quickly arranged to a home tie at Blunsdon United therefore the fans cannot get to the game in time. Strangely the spectator is one man and his dog.</p>
<p>Biggest Win: 7 - 1 against Eltham FC in the Walworth Trophy in 1999.</p>
<p>Greatest Defeat: 2 - 7 against Warneford Wanderers in the Swindon League in 1985.</p>
<p>Highest goal scoring game: 6 - 4 against Academy of Peckham FC in the Gloucester Primary Trophy.</p>
<p>Most appearances for the club: Tommy and Henry Twins. The two brothers have over 150 appearances each for Blunsdon United from July 2000 onwards.</p>
<p>Highest transfer fee: £49.98 for Namberto "Nam" Guyen, from club Stockwell and Victory FC on 27 December 2000.</p>
<p>Oldest Player Ever: Current goalkeeper Phil Vansan is currently the club oldest ever player. He is now 49 years old but ever reliable.</p>
<p>Youngest Player Ever: Alexander "Kay Kay" Waykay make his debut at age 15 against Blunsdon St Andrew Juniors.</p>

<li>"I am as good as Ronaldinho, Henry and Ronaldo combined, I am simply the best, I will be known simply as the Swindon Superstar" - Thierry "Henry" Huaw</li>

<li>"One beautiful day, a radiant day, Mr Phome phone me and said I should put a shopping list together" - Cath Hay when first appointed as manager of Blunsdon United.</li>
<li>"I think this club will one day be the number 1 club in the world easily" - Manager Cath Hay</li>
<li>"We heard, we came, we saw, we conquered, end of story" - Chairman Lingo Phome</li>
<li>"I can guarantee a nice clean game. Since we are all professional players, it is our duty and honour to hold our proud standard of football high. It would be a joke to suggest any player will be sent off in the match. Remember this is football, not a war!" - Captain Keith Hann hopes for the game (before the controversial match).</li>
<li>"I never make predictions, and I never will, so I will predict that we will beat Penhill Pirates 6 nil." - Keith Hann</li>
<li>"From the M4 to the A419, why does he always want to dive!" - Penhill Pirates manager Bob Ferguson criticise William "Chicken" Fann antics in the controversial match.</li>

<li>"If God had meant us to play football in the sky, God would have put grass up there!" — Cath Hay hit back at Bob Ferguson criticism by laughing at the Long Ball tactics used by Penhill Pirates players.</li>
<li>" Of the seven red cards this season we probably deserved half of them" - Cath Hay on the club discipline.</li>
<li>" It was a game we should have won. We lost it because we thought we were going to win it. But then again, I thought that there was no way we were going to get a result there. It is very easy to understand, isn't it?" - Cath Hay post match reaction to the game.</li>
<li>"I believe I can one day play for either the national team of Somalia or Afghanistan, but I don't think I’m good enough yet to play for Blunsdon United first team" - Ling Dong</li>
<li>"I think Keith Hann plays like a shark. Also Terry Huaw is my new little lion. And I like lions" - Cath Hay on Keith Hann and Terry "Thierry Henry" Huaw</li>
<li>"I once said Keith Hann is like a shark and Terry Huaw is like a lion. Well, William Fann is another natural born predator. In fact, William is like a slug. He spent too much time on the floor in the match" - Cath Hay praises another player and completes the zoo!</li>
<li>"They (Blunsdon United) have got it wrong in their natural born predators. For me, William Fann is actually the world greatest diving cheetah" - Bob Ferguson, adds to the Blunsdon United zoo!</li>

<li>"He’s [William Fann] got a heart as big as his brain, which isn’t big, but his heart’s bigger than that."</li>

<li>"William have got a head, ever since when he is 13" - Cath Hay praises William Fann football ability.</li>
<li>"I have score many lucky goals in my football life because I am always there, trying to shoot. For me the best goals are the ones like this when the ball just crosses the line" Keith Hann on those goals that cross the line.</li>
