<p>Hi Bluap,</p>

<p>Bluap ~ Not sure if you have been following, but please check out the "conversation" at <a href="../../../f/r/u/Talk%7EFruit_8c54.html#Stupid_Fruit_Facts" title="Talk:Fruit">Talk:Fruit#Stupid Fruit Facts</a>. An anon has been persisting in deleting a statement he just does not like (and will not correct it if it is wrong; I think you were invoved in correcting it one time). When I advise him (on anon talk pages) that he cannot just delete facts that were true becuse of a POV, he has attacked me. I did not enter the "offending" fact, and his responses seem increasingly irrational. His ISP is from somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area, so his accusations that I am some kind of typical Eurobashing, "racist" American are a real mystery (since he knows nothing about my sex, race, etc.). I finally blocked him after warnings, but his/her abusive responses to discussing why he cannot do what he wants to seem a little over the wall. To do an RfC more than one editor has to be involved, which is fine with me as I really am only trying to uphold the civility of our rules and really have no stake in EU politics of carrot jam. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 23:44, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bluap,</p>
<p>The moon Charon is pronounced as <i>Sharon</i>. The mythological pronunciation is given as a variant in the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charon_%28moon%29.html" title="Charon (moon)">Charon (moon)</a> article, but is dispreferred. See the talk page for more.</p>

<p>Regarding <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_T._R._3b1f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/T. R.">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/T. R.</a>, I think maybe I should explain my vote. Just so you know, the deletion processes are different for redirects compared with articles. For redirects, you should follow the procedures described at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_Deletion_ec71.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for Deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for Deletion</a>. So all I mean by "invalid nomination" is that you took it to the wrong place - it isn't a criticism of your decision to nominate it or anything.</p>
<p>I will say that it's quite rare for redirects to actually be deleted unless there's a strong consensus that they're actually worse than useless. For example, a redirect from an insulting title will often be deleted, but one that's just from a misspelling or an unusual variant of a name will normally be kept. If you think that T.R. is <i>ambiguous</i>, then the preferred thing to do is often to create a <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">disambiguation page</a> instead, that links to all the possible options that people might expect to find from those initials: you don't need a vote for that, you can just go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>(For completeness, I'll mention that there are also <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_Deletion_c4cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for Deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for Deletion</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_Deletion_a46f.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for Deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for Deletion</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_Deletion_7e31.html" title="Wikipedia:Templates for Deletion">Wikipedia:Templates for Deletion</a>, too; AfD really is just for articles and lists.)</p>

<p>The justification for the <a href="../../../t/x/_/WP%7ETX_1e05.html" title="WP:TX">WP:TX</a> advice is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid pages like <a href="../../../l/a/r/Large_Emerald_acaf.html" title="Large Emerald">Large Emerald</a> where the technical classification overwhelms the article.</li>
<li>Minor ranks are often more unstable than major ranks: for example, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Large_Emerald_acaf.html" title="Large Emerald">Large Emerald</a> uses "Metazoa", but few modern classifications use this term. This kind of technical detail is best presented in the articles for which it is relevant (i.e. <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">Animalia</a>), not in articles like <a href="../../../l/a/r/Large_Emerald_acaf.html" title="Large Emerald">Large Emerald</a> where it is basically irrelevant.</li>

<p>Hi, Would you please tell me why you would move a scientific article from its scientific name to its common name. I do know that we could just redirect the scientific name to the newly created common name but why do it in the first place?? scientific names are universal. My point is that if an article exists with the scientific name dont change it. Ofcourse if it exists with a common name then just redirect the scientific name to it. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 18:39, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You didn't simply rephrase the existing material, you added "facts" that were incorrect, such as (1) calling it a generic name, (2) implying there is a single major subdivision of the group, (3) saying that only the sporangium of a bryophyte is diploid, and (4) unnecessarily introduced mention of the ferns and "fern-allies" which are vascular (whose mention in this article could lead to confusion). --<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncycloPetey_19b4.html" title="User:EncycloPetey">EncycloPetey</a> 13:37, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I've re-examined the original contents of the article you edited, and you were right. The last three items I listed above were, in fact, already in the article. I've now tried my own hand at restructuring the article -- for example using bullet points to mark separate groups -- but I'm still unhappy with it. It really is an obsolete group in terms of systematics, but it appears often enough in textbooks and the literature to make this article a sort of "necessary evil".</li>
<li>I've been giving thought over how to articulate to you why it is I disagreed with your revision of the article, and I think I can better express that now -- you unified the article. Normally, that would be a very good thing to do in editing an article on Wikipedia (or anywhere else), but for this particular article, it isn't. The term "non-vascular plant" is a grab-bag of disparate organisms whose only common feature is that they <i>don't</i> belong to the group of vascular plants. They're the leftovers. As such, the article should emphasize the fragmented nature of the "group", so in my opinion disentangling the separate members is the preferred approach (and I say this as someone whose grad-school work was in the systematics and evolution of bryophytes). Thus, your integration of the article to make it flow better was unfortunately a detriment to this particular article, where it would have helped almost any other article.</li>
<li>I should also make sure you understand why "generic name" is a problem. You see, the terms "generic" and "specific" have different meanings when applied to biological names and groups than they do in casual speech. The term "generic" in biology means "of a genus" instead of the usual "in general". You may not have realized that when you made your edits. As I say though, you did a good job of integrating existing material, so I would encourage you to continue to make such edits. It was merely in this particular article that your skills led to a result that was undesirable from a taxonomic viewpoint. --<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncycloPetey_19b4.html" title="User:EncycloPetey">EncycloPetey</a> 04:11, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi! I usually disagree on merger proposals, but think<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oceanic_climate" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oceanic_climate" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> you're on target on this one. <i>'However, You Should Always' annote</i> the '<u>recieving talk page</u>' with reasons and more importantly to innaugerate and <b>timestamp</b> the debate window. The old merger tags were ambiguous and the talks sometimes ended on different talks, on these, just click the link on your 'just applied' tag, and there is no question where to comment!</p>
<p>I've seen a fair number of these 'in your face' tags go on for a year and many last six to nine months without 'action'... which just makes us look like saps to the 'customers'. I'm also convinced that they would have recieved more discussion (i.e. serious attention) from fellow editors had the proposal stated a thesis.</p>
<p>You left nothing of your reasoning to agree with, so no one's in a position to agree— at least they aren't going to break stride and do extra work like I did, most of the time. Unfortunately, eventually, someone has too, and without a timestamp, it is harder to find who put such a 'in your face' template on (includes cleans and npovs, etc.) if the article gets a lot of edits. So do use the talks when applying such!</p>
<p>In this one, annote your reasons, watch the newbies activity, and if he hasn't come forth in a week or so, I suggest you just merge the content and make the new name into a redirect.</p>

<p>I appreciate your note on abbreviations. The article uses abbreviations for the United States a number of times. For consistency, they should be the same. I am aware of the Wikipedia guidance on style of article — in the case of U.S. and UK, see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28abbreviations%29_47f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (abbreviations)">Wikipedia Manual of Style - Abbreviations</a>. <b>U.S.</b> is the standard Wikipedia abbreviation for the United States, while UK is the standard for the United Kingdom. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 14:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically on point, also see <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Acronyms_and_abbreviations" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS#Acronyms_and_abbreviations</a> — "When abbreviating United States, please use "U.S."; that is the more common style in that country." — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 14:29, 11 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The situation of the abbreviation U.S. is specifically addressed as to standard usage in Wikipedia — in the two places referenced above. And, as I mentioned, consistency should be maintained (also mentioned in the MOS). The UK abbreviation, to-date, seems to be consistent in the article. However, the article has both U.S. and US. As the Wikipedia MOS very specifically addresses the use of U.S., I find that clear direction is given on this point. It is not a case of UK English vs U.S. English. — <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/c/User_talk%7EERcheck_91c5.html" title="User talk:ERcheck">talk</a>) 14:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I appreciate your comments, but, in fact, Wikipedia does not encourage "compromise" versions of English that are, as you admit, correct or preferred in neither the U.S. nor the UK. In most cases, as with <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_Broadcasting_System_6892.html" title="Mutual Broadcasting System">Mutual Broadcasting System</a>, the prevailing national association of the subject matter determines the national style of English that is to be preferred in the article. Please see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a>. For ready reference, I quote: "If an article is predominantly written in one type of English, aim to conform to that type rather than provoke conflict by changing to another" and "Follow the dialect of the first contributor: If all else fails, consider following the spelling style preferred by the first major contributor (that is, not a stub) to the article" and "There are many more productive and enjoyable ways to participate than worrying and fighting about which version of English to use on any particular page."</p>
<p>That said, your comments of a broader, more conceptual nature--e.g., that the referenced "golden age of radio drama" reflected a parochial, U.S. perspective--are well taken and I've begun to adjust accordingly.
