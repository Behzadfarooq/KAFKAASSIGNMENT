<dd>Place: A basement <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffeehouse.html" title="Coffeehouse">café</a> near the intersection of 135th Street and Lennox Avenue in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlem.html" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>.</dd>
<dd>Time: An evening during the <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_Age_c76f.html" title="Jazz Age">Jazz Age</a>, beginning at around 9:30 P.M.</dd>
</dl>
<p>After a brief <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overture.html" title="Overture">overture</a>, the gambler Joe appears in front of the curtain as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prologue.html" title="Prologue">Prologue</a>, in an obvious reference to the character Tonio's opening <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aria.html" title="Aria">aria</a> in <i><a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagliacci.html" title="Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a></i>. Like that number, which explained the serious nature of <a href="../../../r/u/g/Ruggero_Leoncavallo_35cc.html" title="Ruggero Leoncavallo">Leoncavallo's</a> opera as if it were an actual event, Joe tells his audience that just like "the white man's opera", this "colored [Harlem] tragedy enacted in operatic style" focuses on primal human emotions such as <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate.html" title="Hate">hate</a>, passion and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jealousy.html" title="Jealousy">jealousy</a>, and that the moral of the story is that tragic results come from when a women's <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuition_%28knowledge%29.html" title="Intuition (knowledge)">intuition</a> goes wrong (Joe: "Ladies and gentlemen!").</p>
<p>As the curtain rises on a café with a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28establishment%29.html" title="Bar (establishment)">bar</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> room and dance floor, café owner Mike berates his worker Sam for his laziness and commands him to get to work. As Sam sweeps the floor, he relates that he resents "<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_7488.html" title="Blue Monday">Blue Monday</a>" because he always loses at dice gambling and it is the day when people die, and concludes that there is no use working on Mondays (Sam: "Blue Monday Blues"). The <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">pianist</a> Sweetpea arrives and plays for a while until the arrogant singer Tom comes in and knocks her out of the way, claiming that the only reason the café is still in business is his singing. Joe's sweetheart Vi enters, asking if anyone has seen her "lovin' man" Joe, for which she is supposed to meet for a date (Vi: "Has Anyone Seen My Joe?").</p>
<p>When Mike goes to the backroom to ask if anyone has seen Joe, Tom attempts to <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction.html" title="Seduction">seduce</a> and woo Vi. When Tom tells her that he loves her and asks what she sees in the gambler Joe, Vi angrily that retorts that even if he gambles, Joe is a man and unique. Tom continues to try to persuade Vi to leave Joe for him and attempts to kiss her, when Vi threatens him with a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver.html" title="Revolver">revolver</a> that Joe had given her. Mike returns with the news that no one has seen Joe, and Vi leaves. Mike again calls Sam and scolds him for being lazy, and as Sam again sweeps the floor he sings a reprise the song "Blue Monday" (Sam: "Monday's the day that all the earthquakes quiver"). This time Sam more directly foreshadows the event to come, as he states that "Monday's a day full of sad, sad news /... That's when a gal will pull a trigger, / A gal will pull a trigger".</p>
<p>Joe enters the café and Tom hides behind the piano to eavesdrop on his conversation with Mike. After Mike tells Joe that Vi has been looking for him and that he has heard that Joe won a large deal of money in a <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craps.html" title="Craps">crap game</a>, Joe tells him that he is going to use the money to travel to the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">South</a> the next morning to visit his mother, whom he hadn't seen in years and to whom he has recently sent a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegram.html" title="Telegram">telegram</a> (Joe: "I'll tell the world I did"). Joe says that he can not tell Vi that he is going, and when asked why by Mike he says that she gets jealous and angry for irrational reasons. He then relates how he yearns to see his mother and return home (Joe: "I'm Gonna See My Mother").</p>
<p>Joe goes upstairs to meet Vi, and slowly the night's guests and customes arrive. After a dance, Vi tells him that she loves only him and although she is a jealous woman, if he remains true to her than than she will be his (Vi: I love but you, my Joe, my Joe"). When Joe leaves to wait for a telegram from his mother, Tom tells Vi that he overheard Joe's conversation and that the telegram is from another woman. Vi initially refuses to believe him, but when Sweetpea arrives with Joe's telegram, Vi accuses Joe of infidelity and demands to see the telegram. Joe rebukes her by pushing her away, and when he opens the envelope Vi shoots him with the revolver from her handbag.</p>
<p>Vi reads the letter, which says that there is no need for Joe to come because his mother had been dead for three years. When she realizes what she has done, she sinks to the floor and begs Joe for forgiveness, which she receives. As Joe dies, he sings that he is finally going to see his mother in heaven. (Joe: "I'm Gonna See My Mother").</p>

<p>By 1922, the improvisational and melodic talent of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Gershwin_e01d.html" title="George Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>, a former song-plugger for a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_publisher.html" title="Music publisher">music publishing firm</a> on <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin_Pan_Alley_7026.html" title="Tin Pan Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a>, allowed him to write songs for three <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> shows and then write complete scores for four (although because every one of his previous shows was a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revue.html" title="Revue">revue</a>, Gershwin had basically no dramatic experience). Two of Gershwin's most successful works at this time were the scores to the 1920 and 1921 productions of <i><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_White%27s_Scandals_054c.html" title="George White's Scandals">George White's Scandals</a></i>, a popular annual revue. <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Whiteman_4a39.html" title="Paul Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a>, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_director.html" title="Music director">music director</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conducting.html" title="Conducting">conductor</a> of the <i><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_White%27s_Scandals_054c.html" title="George White's Scandals">Scandals of 1922</a></i> (with his Orchestra in the pit), which Gershwin was again hired for, had previously worked with him when the Paul Whiteman Orchestra recorded the latter's song "South Sea Island" in 1921.</p>
<p>Gershwin's lyricist <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_DeSylva_aa4e.html" title="Buddy DeSylva">Buddy DeSylva</a> originally conceived a plan for writing a "jazz opera" set in Harlem and based on the <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian language</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verismo.html" title="Verismo">verismo</a> opera <i><a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagliacci.html" title="Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a></i> with Gershwin in the early 1920s, and Whiteman, who had built much of his reputation on such experimental fusions of different musical and dramatic genres, persuaded <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatrical_producer.html" title="Theatrical producer">producer</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_White_dc59.html" title="George White">George White</a> to include it in the 1922 <i>Scandals</i>. White was initially enthusiastic about an idea of a black "opera" because "A recent Broadway success was <i><a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuffle_Along_0191.html" title="Shuffle Along">Shuffle Along</a></i>, a show with an all-black cast—its words and music by the black creative team of <a href="../../../n/o/b/Noble_Sissle_4ed6.html" title="Noble Sissle">Noble Sissle</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/b/Eubie_Blake_8477.html" title="Eubie Blake">Eubie Blake</a>... White seems to have imagined that a black-oriented segment in the new edition of his revue would capitalize on <i>Shuffle Along's</i> appeal." <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v036/36.4crawford.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v036/36.4crawford.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> However, after considering his decision, White realized that a thirty-minute operatic tragedy, or "one act vaudeville opera", as Gershwin called it, would disrupt the flow of his review, and promptly reconsidered before Gershwin and DeSylva had begun writing. The latter two, however, were still the composer and lyricist of the rest of the revue, as it would include the later-famous song "I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise."</p>
<p>Three weeks before the opening of the show, White found that he was in need of a longer program and reverted to allowing the (unwritten) opera to be included in the show. Gershwin and DeSylva wrote the work in five days and five nights, and soon after completion it was orchestrated by Wil Vodery, a very talented but relatively unknown African-American composer who had befriended Gershwin.</p>
<p>The premiere performance of <i>Blue Monday</i> was at the four <i>Scandal's</i> tryouts in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut_109e.html" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, and it was received there very warmly and enthusiastically. Gershwin later wrote that what he referred to as his "composer's stomach", ailments which he would have for the rest of his life, originated in his nervousness on the opening night of <i>Blue Monday</i>. A few days after, it opened (and closed) on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> at the <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunt-Fontanne_Theatre_c68c.html" title="Lunt-Fontanne Theatre">Globe Theatre</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>. The opera itself did not gain a lot of acceptance because of its tragic ending, and was removed from the Scandals after only one performance.</p>
<p>Some critics saw the work as worse than just inappropriate for the Scandals, as Charles Darnton's review in the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_World_24d6.html" title="New York World">New York World</a></i> called it "the most dismal, stupid, and incredible <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">blackface</a> sketch that has probably ever been perpetrated. In it a dusky soprano finally killed her gambling man. She should have shot all her associates the moment they appeared and then turned the pistol on herself." <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/content/?050110crat_atlarge" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/content/?050110crat_atlarge" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> According to Reed University Professor of Music David Schiff, "With the appearance of black musicals like <i><a href="../../../s/h/u/Shuffle_Along_0191.html" title="Shuffle Along">Shuffle Along</a></i> and the emergence of black stars such as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Robeson_b580.html" title="Paul Robeson">Paul Robeson</a> and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethel_Waters_1f4e.html" title="Ethel Waters">Ethel Waters</a>, the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel_show.html" title="Minstrel show">minstrel</a> convention of <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackface.html" title="Blackface">blackface</a>, which survived in the vastly popular performances of <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jolson_c543.html" title="Al Jolson">Al Jolson</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Cantor_dc6c.html" title="Eddie Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a>, had become an embarrassment - at least to some critics." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Schiff"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28opera%29_2956.html#endnote_Schiff" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28opera%29_2956.html#endnote_Schiff" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>However, "Another critic... said it was a genuine human plot of American life and foreshadowed things to come from Gershwin" <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1997-11/porgy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1997-11/porgy.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and another wrote that "This opera will be imitated in a hundred years." Most importantly, a third critic was relieved that "Here at last, is a genuinely human plot of American life, set to music in the American vein, using jazz only at the right moments, the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues_%28music%29.html" title="Blues (music)">Blues</a>, and above all, a new and free <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragtime.html" title="Ragtime">ragtime</a> time <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recitative.html" title="Recitative">recitative</a>. In it we see the first gleam of a new American musical art." <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Alpert"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28opera%29_2956.html#endnote_Alpert" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/l/u/Blue_Monday_%28opera%29_2956.html#endnote_Alpert" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup></span> Many biogrophers and musicologists would see such an assessment and a prophetic prediction of the accomplishment that Gershwin would make thirteen years later with <i><a href="../../../p/o/r/Porgy_and_Bess_8d07.html" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>Blue Monday</i> was one of Gershwin's premature works and lacks the musical and dramatic sophistication of his later musicals and <i>Porgy and Bess</i>, but <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> conductor <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Whiteman_4a39.html" title="Paul Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a>, who conducted the original performance of the piece in 1922, was so impressed by it that he asked Gershwin to compose a symphonic jazz piece for Whiteman to conduct at a concert Whiteman was planning. The resulting piece, "<a href="../../../r/h/a/Rhapsody_in_Blue_3fde.html" title="Rhapsody in Blue">Rhapsody in Blue</a>," became Gershwin's most famous composition.</p>
<p>Arts consultant Jeffrey James claims that <i>Blue Monday</i> is the "genesis of the Rhapsody", and "the missing link in Gershwin's evolution into the Rhapsody in Blue" as well as a source to his <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Preludes_8033.html" title="Three Preludes">Preludes</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerto_in_F_%28Gershwin%29_d32b.html" title="Concerto in F (Gershwin)">Piano Concerto</a> and <i><a href="../../../p/o/r/Porgy_and_Bess_8d07.html" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a></i>. <a href="http://www.jamesarts.com/AZRHAPNOTE.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jamesarts.com/AZRHAPNOTE.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>After it's disastrous flop on Broadway, <i>Blue Monday</i> was subsequently renamed <b>135th Street</b> when <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferde_Grof%C3%A9_8313.html" title="Ferde Grofé">Ferde Grofé</a> re-orchestrated it in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, with a concert performance at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnegie_Hall_999d.html" title="Carnegie Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_29.html" title="December 29">December 29</a>. Though sparingly, <i>Blue Monday</i> is occasionally revived both inside and outside of the United States, including a 1970 New York revival and recent productions in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide, Australia</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livorno.html" title="Livorno">Livorno, Italy</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington%2C_Virginia_fc7c.html" title="Arlington, Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linz.html" title="Linz">Linz, Switzerland</a>.
