<p><i><b>Blue Skies</b></i> is a <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946_in_film.html" title="1946 in film">1946</a> Hollywood <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_film.html" title="Musical film">musical</a> comedy <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">film</a>, released by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and starring <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Astaire_084a.html" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Caulfield_6d6b.html" title="Joan Caulfield">Joan Caulfield</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/g/Olga_San_Juan_f4aa.html" title="Olga San Juan">Olga San Juan</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_De_Wolfe_510b.html" title="Billy De Wolfe">Billy De Wolfe</a>, with music, lyrics and story by <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irving_Berlin_13c5.html" title="Irving Berlin">Irving Berlin</a>; most of the songs were recycled from earlier works. The film was directed by <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Heisler_e108.html" title="Stuart Heisler">Stuart Heisler</a> and produced by <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sol_C._Siegel_3714.html" title="Sol C. Siegel">Sol C. Siegel</a>.</p>
<p>As in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday_Inn_%28film%29_fe1f.html" title="Holiday Inn (film)">Holiday Inn</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>), the film is designed to showcase the songs of Irving Berlin. The plot, which is presented in a series of flashbacks with Astaire as narrator, follows a similar formula of Crosby beating Astaire for the affections of a leading lady. Comedy is principally provided by Billy De Wolfe.</p>
<p>Joan Caulfield was the protege of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Sandrich_11ae.html" title="Mark Sandrich">Mark Sandrich</a> - who directed many of the Astaire-Rogers musicals - and who was originally slated to direct this film. He died of a heart attack during pre-production and Stuart Heisler was drafted in to replace him. Heisler wanted Caulfield replaced, but Crosby - who was having an affair with Caulfield - protected her.</p>
<p>Tap dancer Paul Draper was the initial choice to partner Bing Crosby, however, during the first week of production Draper's speech impediment and his trenchant criticism of Caulfield's dance ability led Crosby to insist on his replacement by Astaire who, then forty-seven, had already decided that this would be his final film and that he would retire, having spent over forty years performing before the public. The film was billed as "Astaire's last picture" and its very strong performance at the box office pleased him greatly, as he had dearly wanted to go out on a high note.</p>
<p>The reasons for Astaire's (temporary) retirement remain a source of debate: his own view that he was "tired and running out of gas", the sudden collapse in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> of the market for <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_%28genre%29.html" title="Swing (genre)">Swing</a> music which left many of his colleagues in jazz high and dry, a desire to devote time to establishing a chain of dancing schools, and a dissatisfaction with roles, as in this film, where he was relegated to playing second fiddle to the lead. Ironically, it is for his celebrated <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Astaire%27s_Solo_and_Partnered_Dances_cd3a.html" title="Fred Astaire's Solo and Partnered Dances">solo performance</a> of "Puttin' On The Ritz" that this film is most remembered today.</p>

<p>Crosby applies his famous relaxed crooning style to the many songs he delivers here. In contrast, Astaire, assisted by choreographers <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermes_Pan_%28choreographer%29_98b8.html" title="Hermes Pan (choreographer)">Hermes Pan</a> and Dave Robel (for the "Puttin' On The Ritz" routine), delivers a series of dances which explore the theme of confrontation, both with partners and with the audience. As a result, it is one of only a few Astaire films not to feature a romantic partnered dance.</p>
<ul>
<li>"A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody": Berlin's 1919 song is presented as part of a big <a href="../../../z/i/e/Ziegfeld_Follies_8dc7.html" title="Ziegfeld Follies">Ziegfeld Follies</a> production number, an aesthetic which Astaire parodies in this partnered dance with Caulfield and others. In the first of a series of references to films he made earlier in the 1940s, he reprises a tap sequence performed atop a bar counter in the "One For My Baby" number from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sky%27s_the_Limit_9839.html" title="The Sky's the Limit">The Sky's the Limit</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>), this time danced down a stairway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I've Got My Captain Working For Me Now": This song, composed in 1919, is performed by Crosby, backed up by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_De_Wolfe_510b.html" title="Billy De Wolfe">Billy De Wolfe</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"You'd Be Surprised": Another 1919 song, this time performed by <a href="../../../o/l/g/Olga_San_Juan_f4aa.html" title="Olga San Juan">Olga San Juan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"All By Myself": Crosby performs this 1921 song to Caulfield, who harmonizes with him in the closing phrases.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Serenade To An Old-Fashioned Girl": Caulfield sings this number, specially written for the film.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I'll See You In Cuba": A 1920 song performed as a duet by Crosby and San Juan.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"A Couple Of Song And Dance Men": A comic song and dance duet for Astaire and Crosby to a number specially composed for the film. The concept is a reworking of the "I'll Capture Your Heart" number from <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday_Inn_%28film%29_fe1f.html" title="Holiday Inn (film)">Holiday Inn</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>) and the comedy centres around Crosby's legendary reluctance to rehearse.</li>

Fred Astaire and a chorus of Fred Astaires in "Puttin' on the Ritz"</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="../../../p/u/t/Puttin%27_on_the_Ritz_763c.html" title="Puttin' on the Ritz">Puttin' on the Ritz</a>": Although Berlin's 1930 song was originally written for vaudevillian Harry Richman, it has become indelibly associated with Astaire, who also recorded it for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia</a> in 1930. In this <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Astaire%27s_Solo_and_Partnered_Dances_cd3a.html" title="Fred Astaire's Solo and Partnered Dances">tap solo with cane</a>, which was widely billed as "Astaire's last dance", the lyrics are updated, replacing racist references to ritzy Harlemites with wealthy whites strutting their stuff up and down Park Avenue. The routine was produced after the rest of the film had been completed, and according to Astaire, it took "five weeks of back-breaking physical work" to prepare. It is constructed in three sections, beginning in a dull book-lined office with a tired-looking Astaire showing his years and dressed in his trademark top hat, white tie and tails. Here Astaire delivers the song while executing a gentle tap and cane solo in mock slow-motion, in an amusing parody of his impending retirement. The song finished, he returns to normal speed and proceeds to dance around the office while executing an ingenious jumping cane routine which relied on a concealed floor trigger mechanism. Thus rejuvenated, Astaire sweeps aside a pair of drab curtains to reveal a chorus of nine Fred Astaires - achieved by filming two separate versions of Astaire, repeating them four times and interleaving them. The final section is a greatly speeded up repeat of the tune which accompanies a routine of spell-binding virtuosity for Astaire and chorus. In "Top Hat, White Tie and Tails" from <i><a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Hat_7b96.html" title="Top Hat">Top Hat</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>), Astaire proceeded to machine-gun his chorus dancers with his cane. This time, Astaire joins his chorus in adopting a confrontational, at times almost menacing posture towards his audience. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, on the brink of yet another temporary retirement, Astaire wittily refers back to this routine in the self-parodying "The Ritz, Roll And Rock" number from <i><a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk_Stockings_f831.html" title="Silk Stockings">Silk Stockings</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"You Keep Coming Back Like A Song": Crosby performs this specially composed number.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Skies_%28song%29_866c.html" title="Blue Skies (song)">Blue Skies</a>": Crosby sings this 1926 ballad, the film's title song, to Caulfield.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Nightclub Montage": Crosby performs fragments of "The Little Things In Life" (1930), "Not For All The Rice In China" (1933) and "Russian Lullaby" (1927).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Everybody Step": Crosby sings this 1921 number, followed by a brief dance for chorus choreographed by Hermes Pan. Crosby directs the chorus in the opening stages, a concept revived and further developed by Pan for the opening number of <i><a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Evening_with_Fred_Astaire_c1c3.html" title="An Evening with Fred Astaire">An Evening with Fred Astaire</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"How Deep Is The Ocean?": Crosby performs this 1932 song in a musing style, backed by a female quartet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"(Running Around In Circles) Getting Nowhere": Crosby sings this specially composed song to Caulfield.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Heat Wave": The film's major production number features Astaire, Olga San Juan and chorus in a brightly coloured Latin-themed setting. It begins with San Juan's rendition - with the lyric "making her seat wave" toned down to "making her feet wave" - of this 1933 song, while Astaire approaches warily, using dance steps reminiscent of those used in the "Dream Ballet" number from <i><a href="../../../y/o/l/Yolanda_and_the_Thief_20a7.html" title="Yolanda and the Thief">Yolanda and the Thief</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>), followed by a partnered dance for Astaire and San Juan, and then a tap solo section for Astaire who quotes from the "Boogie Barcarolle (Rehearsal Sequence)" number from <i><a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27ll_Never_Get_Rich_e305.html" title="You'll Never Get Rich">You'll Never Get Rich</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>). This solo section was shot in one take and features music specially composed by Astaire, the only time his music was used in a film. In a counterpoint to the film's opening number, this number ends with him ascending a staircase, only to fall dramatically from a precipice, ending his character's dance career.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Wartime Medley": Crosby performs excerpts from "Any Bonds Today" (1941), "This Is The Army Mr. Jones" (1942) and "<a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Christmas_a41f.html" title="White Christmas">White Christmas</a>" (1942) - which he had introduced in his previous film with Astaire: <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday_Inn_%28film%29_fe1f.html" title="Holiday Inn (film)">Holiday Inn</a></i> (1942).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"You Keep Coming Back Like A Song/Blue Skies (reprise)": Performed by Crosby and Caulfield at the film's close.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other Berlin songs which featured only as background music in the film are, in order of use: "Tell Me Little Gypsy" (1920), "Nobody Knows" (1920), "Mandy " (1918), "I Wonder" (1919), "Some Sunny Day" (1922), "When You Walked Out Someone Else Walked In" (1923), "Because I Love You" (1926), "Homesick" (1922), "How Many Times" (1926), "The Song Is Ended" (1927), "Lazy" (1924), "Always" (1925) and "I Can't Remember" (1933).</p>
