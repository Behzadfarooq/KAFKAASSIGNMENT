<p>You've removed link to <a href="http://www.linkbit.com/support-decoder.html" class="external text" title="http://www.linkbit.com/support-decoder.html" rel="nofollow">Linkbit Online Protocol Decoder</a> from several pages. Why&#160;? I consider this free resource extremely useful to community. Wiki is not a link farm and generally links are just ads and should be removed, but this link is exactly the opposite case. Mitra 9 Nov 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--Bluezy 13:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC) Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, it's not a collection of links (as you say). Don't forget that Linkbit is a commercial company - it's still an ad&#160;! It's not because it's free, that it should be included. And I don't agree that it's useful, especially not for the general public. SIP ... maybe. But decoding SIGTRAN, GSM, TCAP, ...&#160;????? The public of developers that might find it useful is extremely limited. They don't need any help in finding this resource.</p>
<p>PS&#160;: I am one of those developers actually, I works for the second biggest telecom supplier.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reply: --Mitra 10 Nov 2006</dd>
<dd>Well, we have to agree to disagree. We see statistic on our server which prove that people coming from wikipedia indeed use our decoder and come back many times over. BTW, SIP is a text based protocol and as such could be read without special tools, as opposed to SIGTRAN, GSM, TCAP etc. There are many developers in the world who still work with these protocols, and there messages couldn't not be easily deciphered without a tool. One example would be ASN.1 based protocols. Linkbit has the only _working_ tool on the web which allows decoding many of these protocols starting from different layers, and this is done freely without even asking for a registration, fully anonymously. Believe it or not, but we have people using our decoder from all major telecom manufacturers every day. And last, but not list. Why do you find our link more objectionable then links to commercial products which are plentiful on the pages in question?</dd>

<p>Hi. You said, that you have some expirience with a real IMS system. I have an interest in IMS, and I want to understand an IMS concepts deeply. So, I have a questions, on what I hope you have an answer. Thanks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of the IMS nodes contains information about the user status. I mean - user location, user availability and other information that can change with a time. Is it HSS?</li>
<li>About AS layer. Can AS application store extended data in the HSS?</li>
<li>About AS layer. Is there any other wrappers over the SIP AS, like a OSA/Parlay and CAMEL (IM SSF)?</li>
<li>What node is responsible for security rights?</li>
<li>Can you advise a good book or other print material, related to this topic?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Reply: --Bluezy 21:37, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>- question 2: the HSS can be used to store data on behalve of the I-CSCF and S-CSCF (thru Cx and Dx interfaces) and also for other application server (using the sh interfaces)</p>
<p>- question 1: user availability, etc ... is stored inside the HSS (a database). But a copy is also present in memory of the SCSCF that is assigned to the user, for fast access. Even if the SCSCF crashes, the data would still be safe. User location is not part of the core IMS, but it can be implemented in an AS. SIP itself doesn't have standardized headers for it (except P-Access-Network-Info). More accurate info can be found in cellular networks (GPS-coordinates), but must be found using other means (f.i. CAMEL). Sometimes, it's the AS that does it, but most often it's done by the HSS directly, for historical reasons. But the AS can retrieve it thru the SH interface.</p>
<p>- question 3: it's not a wrapper over SIP, but yes, application servers can use other API's to do tasks that can't be done in SIP (like location info above). OSA/Parlay and CAMEL are standard, but there are others too.</p>
<p>- question 4: IPSEC is terminated in the P-CSCF, under control of the S-CSCF (authentication is done in HSS)</p>
<p>- question5: a good book is The 3G IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS): Merging the Internet and the Cellular Worlds, by Gonzalo Camarillo, Miguel-Angel García-Martín</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reply: --Alny Thanks for your answer.</dd>
<dd>On your answer you are use a references to the term "interfaces". But I can't find the list of all possible IMS interfaces in the [IP_Multimedia_Subsystem|IMS] article. I think, it may be usefull to put a schema <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Ims_architecture.JPG" class="external free" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Ims_architecture.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Ims_architecture.JPG</a> into this article?</dd>

<p>Hello Bluezy. May I ask you one more question on IMS?. Question is: As I understand, there are 2 SIP's standards: IETF SIP and 3GPP SIP, that based on the IETF SIP. I can't find information, what is a main difference between them. And can I learn the SIP protocol using IETF RFC's or it is a bad way, because 3GPP use it's own extension? So, can you shortly describe this difference?</p>
<p>Reply: --Bluezy 16:45, 19 September 2006 (UTC) 3GPP SIP is the same as IETF SIP, but with a few refinements. Most of them can be found in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3455" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3455">RFC 3455</a> (which adds a few extra headers), some other parts can be found in various parts of the 3GPP documents (mostly mandatory support for a few features). A standard off-the-shelve SIP-phone can't claim IMS compatibility, they'll have a bit of work to do (support for AKA, IPSEC, SIGCOMP, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3455" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3455">RFC 3455</a>, etc ....). In my work the biggest difference that I've seen, is that a normal SIP-phone implements HTTP-Digest authentication (based on a password), while an IMS phone should support AKA-Digest (based on a USIM or ISIM card). The rest are more advanced features&#160;: an IMS phone might support presence and instant messaging, while they are often missing on a normal SIP phone.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBluezy_c49d.html" title="Edit section: And yet another question">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">And yet another question</span></h2>
<p>So, it's me again. And I have another question related to IMS security and IMS authorization. Question is:</p>
<p>Can IMS element, for example IMS Application Server (AS), trust to the FROM URI, from the SIP message header, that comes from a client? In other words - can user, or some client app, modify this URI in a client level, and send wrong SIP request?</p>
<p>And if the answer on a first question is "AS can trust", than another question - Who is responsible for SIP messages authority check? Is it P-CSCF?</p>
<p>Reply: --Bluezy 16:17, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The P-CSCF and the S-SCSCF work together to check for these case. See <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3325" class="external" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3325">RFC 3325</a>&#160;: the P-asserted-identity header will be added by the P-CSCF, and shows the *real* identity of the user. The P-CSCF can be sure that the user is real, since it has an IPSEC connection to the client, or the transmission was running over an encrypted channel (in mobile networks). The S-CSCF and AS trust the P-CSCF in this matter. The S-CSCF can also (optionally) replace the From-header on the fly, if needed. And it can guard against modifications by a rogue AS for instance (it's always present in the path). But in general, the From-header should not be trusted at all.</p>
<p>P-asserted-identity is also used when hiding your identity, in which case the From-header would be "sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid". The header will be passed only to trusted network elements (including server from other networks), so it can it can be for lawful intercept and such (that's how the government can find out your identity, even when dialing without CLID) but will not reach the user on the other end.</p>

<p>Ok, I guess it was a wrong license. Note the the popup to select one is really difficult to use. I reuploaded the image with the promotional tag. Note: I do work for Alcatel (and I'm a developer for the 5020 !), and the image is taken from our stack of images to use in press releases, user documentation, etc... It's also visible on the Inete, for instance <a href="http://www.alcatel.ru/products/fixed/all/phone-networks/a5020/" class="external free" title="http://www.alcatel.ru/products/fixed/all/phone-networks/a5020/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alcatel.ru/products/fixed/all/phone-networks/a5020/</a> --Bluezy 22:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
