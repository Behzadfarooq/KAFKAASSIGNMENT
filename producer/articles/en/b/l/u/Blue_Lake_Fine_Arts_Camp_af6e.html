	    <p><b>Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp</b> is a summer arts camp in <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twin_Lake%2C_Michigan_edd9.html" title="Twin Lake, Michigan">Twin Lake, Michigan</a> and is located in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manistee_National_Forest_9ae9.html" title="Manistee National Forest">Manistee National Forest</a>. In 2006, 7,814 participants were enrolled in Blue Lake's numerous programs. Since its beginning in 1966, over 250,000 students have attended. 2006 marks Blue Lake's 40th anniversary season.</p>
<p>Four of Michigan's Governors have noted Blue Lake as "one of Michigan's great cultural assets." Located in the Manistee National Forest, nature provides the extensive beauty that the camp is known for.</p>
<p>Blue Lake remains a budget-friendly experience for young people. Blue Lake includes the Blue Lake Scholarship Program where representatives travel to schools and award scholarships. Everyone who auditions receives a scholarship, which goes along with Blue Lake's philosophy of letting anyone, regardless of skill, receive the Blue Lake experience.</p>
<p>In addition to the summer camp, BLFAC hosts several music festivals, a family camp, and programs for adults.</p>

<p>BLFAC offers several different "camps within a camp", separated by time (when offered during the year) and age.</p>
<p><a name="Summer_Camp_Sessions" id="Summer_Camp_Sessions"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Summer Camp Sessions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Summer Camp Sessions</span></h3>
<p><a name="Music_Camp" id="Music_Camp"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Music Camp">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Music Camp</span></h4>
<p>BLFAC has four two-week primary <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_camp.html" title="Summer camp">summer camp</a> sessions (identified in most materials as Session I, II, III and IV). Traditionally, the first two sessions were for <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_high.html" title="Junior high">junior high</a> aged students while the second two sessions were for <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> aged students. Recently, they have changed this to junior high during Sessions I and IV, with high school Sessions II and III). The age recommendations are primarily for the comfort of the campers, not only for interpersonal interactions, but also for musical skill level.</p>
<p>Depending on the year, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> Bands are organized at least once per each age level (eg: Session I and III or II and IV), and as of 2006 are offered during all four Sessions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestra.html" title="Orchestra">Orchestras</a> are also organized each summer session, with wind instruments allowed in Sessions II and III.</p>
<p>For all music programs, campers audition upon arrival to be placed into bands or orchestras based on their skill levels. In both Band and Orchestra, "Symphonic" is used to describe the highest placement possible and then there are, depending on the number of campers, additional bands and orchestras named with colors (usually Red, White and Blue). For Sessions that allow wind instruments in orchestra, the top auditioning wind players are seated in the orchestras created for that Session.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Art (and Photography)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Art (and Photography)</span></h4>
<p>As with music campers, art programs are offered during each Summer Session.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">Photography</a> used to be an additionally offered program, but is no longer available.</p>
<p><a name="Piano.2C_Harp.2C_Dance_and_Theatre" id="Piano.2C_Harp.2C_Dance_and_Theatre"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Piano, Harp, Dance and Theatre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Piano, Harp, Dance and Theatre</span></h4>
<p>Campers interested in other music and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performing_arts.html" title="Performing arts">performing arts</a> outlets also have a home at BLFAC. Each program, like band, orchestra and art, have highly-qualified instructors to help students grow and develop their skills.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="Camp_Bernstein" id="Camp_Bernstein"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Camp Bernstein">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camp Bernstein</span></h4>
<p>Recognizing that younger students may also benefit from the BLFAC experience, Camp Bernstein (most recently located in what was formerly known as "East Point Unit"), affords younger campers a virtually identical BLFAC experience, adjusted slightly for their age differences.</p>
<p><a name="Daily_Schedules" id="Daily_Schedules"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Daily Schedules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Daily Schedules</span></h4>
<p>For most campers, their daily schedule is fairly standard. From the BLFAC website "Campers begin their day at approximately 6:45 am by getting up and ready for <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakfast.html" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a>. Mornings are filled with classes and rehearsals. After lunch, students have a break for rest, recreation, an elective course, or individual practice. Afternoon classes and rehearsals end around 4:00 p.m., leaving plenty of time to rest and clean up for <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinner.html" title="Dinner">dinner</a>. Evening activities conclude each day with arts performances or camp fun. Unit Directors call lights out with Taps."</p>
<p><a name="Fall_and_Spring_Sessions" id="Fall_and_Spring_Sessions"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Fall and Spring Sessions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fall and Spring Sessions</span></h3>
<p>During times other than the summer, BLFAC hosts a variety of adult learning programs, as well as marching band camp facilities and a Suzuki camp.</p>
<p><a name="Camp_Facilities" id="Camp_Facilities"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Camp Facilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camp Facilities</span></h3>
<p>Campers are all housed in one room cabins, approximately 11 campers and 1 staff person per cabin. Five cabins are placed close to each other in Units, headed by a Unit Director. Male (and Female) Units are clustered close to each other, with the one gender at each end of the campus.</p>
<p>Male Units: Bandwagon, Broadway, Big Band, Highlights, Canvas (so named as it was once filled with army tents rather than wood cabins)</p>
<p>Female Units include: Promenade, Aria, Billings Point, Sleepy Hollow, West Point, Oakridge, Villanelle, Novella, Siena, Dolce, &amp; Left Bank</p>
<p>Historically, the units had other names, which are mostly lost to time. Bandwagon, however, was Zodiac Unit at one point in the camp's history.</p>
<p>Faculty other than cabin counselors and unit directors stayed in the Faculty Village across the road from the main camp area.</p>
<p>Once relegated to swimming in Little Blue Lake, campers are now able to take advantage of two swimming pools. Campers also have a variety of sports fields (for soccer, frisbee, etc), and myriad other activities.</p>
<p>Dining is most often in Marek Hall, except for certain special "pizza party" evenings once per session. Campers can also purchase small snack/candy/soda items at the Camp Store located in the Main portion of the camp (central to the male and female cabin areas).</p>
<p>Rehearsals for full band and orchestral groups happen in one of two main performance "shells", Stewart Shell and Alumni Shell. Large sheltered practice facilities as well as smaller unsheltered areas are scattered throughout the camp, spaced in a way so as to minimize interruption and disturbance from other groups. Two new piano practice buildings serve as individual practice sites, and Art Barn facilities as well as a full dance and theatre area are designated specifically for those functions.</p>
<p>The Instrument Museum, originally operated by Gilbert Stansell, has a dizzying array of musical instruments, many of which are functional. The instruments range from ancient instruments from Eastern and Western cultures, variants on common instruments, modern synthesizers and everything in between.</p>
<p>BLFAC has an on-site health facility, with certified health care professionals.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Camp Uniform">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Camp Uniform</span></h2>
<p>Blue Lake campers are required to wear a distinct <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform.html" title="Uniform">uniform</a>. All campers must wear a light blue <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo_shirt.html" title="Polo shirt">polo shirt</a> with the Blue Lake logo on the upper left side. One button must always remain buttoned, the shirt must stay tucked in and sleeves are not allowed to be rolled up. Campers wear a badge with their name on it, and the color of their name on the badge represents the number of years they have been a camper (white = 1, yellow = 2, red =3, green = 4, blue =5+, purple =staff). Counselors wear red badges all the time. The polos must always be paired with blue jeans or slacks of a darker shade blue than their polo. For cold weather, campers are permitted to wear a variety of Blue Lake outerwear, including sweaters, hooded sweatshirts, zip-up fleece, or windbreakers. Footwear is expected to be closed toe and closed heel.</p>
<p>Formal events require dark/navy slacks or skirts for girls, and navy pants for boys. Sweaters are also required for formal events. The camp dance is the only time out of unit that a relaxed uniform is used. The bottom button may be unbottoned and the shirts can be untucked.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Lake_Fine_Arts_Camp_af6e.html" title="Edit section: Blue Lake's International Exchange Program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blue Lake's International Exchange Program</span></h2>
<p>Each year, BLFAC sends six touring groups to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> - an orchestra, two bands, jazz band, <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choir</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballet.html" title="Ballet">ballet</a> ensemble. While at camp, students apply to be a part of one of the ensembles. Each year, an average of 350 Blue Lake students are a part of the program. An average of 10 to 15 European and Asian music and dance groups travel to Michigan for a two-week tour and a visit to Blue Lake.</p>
<p>Each BLFAC group tours Europe for 3-4 weeks after an intensive week of rehearsals at Blue Lake. Each group tours 2-4 countries (France and Germany are the most frequent), staying in a total of about 7 cities. The groups stay with European host families for about 3 days each, providing them with a unique first-hand cultural experience. During their stay in each city, the groups give a performance featuring a variety of musical styles. After their tour of Europe, the groups return home for their homecoming tour.</p>
<p>Days in Europe usually consist of a morning rehearsal, then the afternoon free with host families. Families may host one or more students. Some even host up to thirteen. They take you sight seeing, shopping, and socializing with other Blue Lakers, or friends of the family. Some days there is no rehearsal and you have a free day to be with your family. Some stops have large social gatherings for all the students and their host families. The groups are also taken on tours of historic towns, castles, caves or monuments. Concerts are played in concert halls, schools, churches or outside. They can range from one hour to two and a half.</p>
<p>After the intensive week, most groups go on a mini-tour in the Midwest, staying with host families for two days and one night. After the European tour, the groups return and have a homecoming tour 1-4 weeks after returning. The homecoming tour is usually three days. It consists of a concert in a town usually in Michigan, then a concert at Blue Lake for the campers. After the final concert, the students are taken home by their parents.</p>
<p>Many groups plan reunions through emails and online blog groups. Some students even return to Europe just to stay with their favorite host families.</p>

<p>The Summer Arts Festival at Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp features camper, staff, and other talent from all over the world. Located in the scenic Stewart Shell, the Blodgett Recital Hall, and the Howmet Playhouse, the Summer Arts Festival is alive nearly every night. Past performances done by artists not attached to the camp have included the Northshore Concert Band, the Grand Rapids Symphony, the Andiamo String Quartet, the Artesian String Quartet, and the US Army Field Band and Chorus. Many works have been premiered at the festival, most recently "The Last Leaf" done by James Niblock.</p>

<p>Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp serves the West Michigan Community with its Public <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">Radio</a> Stations, WBLV-FM 90.3 in the Muskegon area and WBLU-FM 88.9 in Grand Rapids.

<p><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Carter_%28musician%29_aaaa.html" title="James Carter (musician)">James Carter (musician)</a> attended Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp when he was in the eighth grade. One day, when Gilbert Stansell was showing students his enormous musical instrument collection (now the Blue Lake Museum), he came across a talented young camper. He called his son and said "Fritz, you've got to come over here right now. You won't believe what this 8th grade kid can do with almost any instrument in the museum!" James Carter was picking up and playing instinctively every instrument Gilbert Stansell would let him handle. Gilbert Stansell later stated that he believed James to be "perhaps the most naturally gifted young performer I have ever heard."</p>
