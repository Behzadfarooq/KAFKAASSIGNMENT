<p>Bludgeon had a prominent role in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel</a> <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformers_%28comic%29.html" title="Transformers (comic)">Transformers</a></i> comic. He was initially part of a new incarnation of the <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayhem_Attack_Squad_4510.html" title="Mayhem Attack Squad">Mayhem Attack Squad</a> in the UK comics, and would later appear in smaller group with Stranglehold and Octopunch, tasked by Decepticon commander <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderwing.html" title="Thunderwing">Thunderwing</a> to kill the Autobot Classic Pretenders (<a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_%28Transformers%29_cee6.html" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_%28Transformers%29_de41.html" title="Jazz (Transformers)">Jazz</a>). He battled the Autobots at the centre of Cybertron, being partially responsible for waking <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primus_%28Transformers%29_7a0f.html" title="Primus (Transformers)">Primus</a> and attracting <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>'s attention. After Thunderwing's death, Bludgeon joined up with the Earthbound Decepticons, and quickly became bodyguard to their leader <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorponok.html" title="Scorponok">Scorponok</a>.</p>
<p>Following the battle with Unicron (and Scorponok's death), he found himself in a position of influence and worked his way into becoming a key member of the Autobot-Decepticon alliance. From here, he managed to become Decepticon leader and inspired them to turn away from the alliance and back towards conquest. He left the Autobots to die and invaded the peaceful world of <a href="../../../k/l/o/Klo.html" title="Klo">Klo</a>, causing a bloodbath, and when the Autobots tried to stop him he ambushed and exterminated them. If not for the intervention of <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> and the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Autobot_5061.html" title="Last Autobot">Last Autobot</a>, he'd have won the war in that single battle; instead, he had the Decepticons retreat to regroup.</p>
<p>He originally (and concurrently) appeared in the UK <b>Earthforce</b> stories, but their canonical placement is unknown and assumed by some fans to take place after US #80. Here, he led a new version of the Mayhems in the assassination of renegade Decepticons Catilla and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnivac.html" title="Carnivac">Carnivac</a> for their joining the Autobot Survivors group. He personally killed Catilla and for that, Carnivac had a terrible revenge - getting Bludgeon captured by Autobots instead of killed, a humiliation to his warrior image so bad it was worse, to Bludgeon, than death. Recovering fast, he engaged in psychological warfare against his cell warden <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inferno_%28Transformers%29_fe31.html" title="Inferno (Transformers)">Inferno</a>, staying completely silent and still to increasingly unnerve him to the point where he got sloppy; at that point, Bludgeon telekinetically had his sword escape from an ammo store and viciously wound Inferno, allowing the Mayhems to escape. They would later return trying to kill <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starscream.html" title="Starscream">Starscream</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundwave.html" title="Soundwave">Soundwave</a> for the bounty placed on their heads by <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron.html" title="Megatron">Megatron</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a>.</p>

<p>At the start of the series, the war was considered over and Bludgeon's Decepticons were thought gone. Instead, Bludgeon had used this long absence to regroup and rearm, creating a large planet-like spacecraft known as the <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/Warworld_%28Transformers%29_9e38.html" title="Warworld (Transformers)">Warworld</a></i>, which functioned as a vessel for pirating resources throughout the galaxy. He then made a bid to lure Optimus Prime to <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_%28Transformers%29_e2e3.html" title="Earth (Transformers)">Earth</a> to steal the Autobot <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership_caf8.html" title="Autobot Matrix of Leadership">Creation Matrix</a> so life could be granted to a new generation of Decepticon warriors. The plan involved a full-scale attack on Earth, killing millions, but unfortunately for Bludgeon instead of Optimus he attracted Megatron, who wanted command of the Decepticons for himself once more. The two fought a brief duel and Bludgeon was killed, the skull head of his Pretender shell kept as a trophy aboard the Warworld. Megatron would go on to use Bludgeon's plan and warship, and would later consider aloud that he may have been too hasty to kill such a capable Decepticon.</p>
<p>In the short-lived UK Generation 2 comic, Bludgeon personally led an attack on London and did manage to attract Optimus Prime's attention but was defeated when the two fought. Bludgeon also appeared in the text story "Another Time and Place" (seemingly branching off in another direction from the G2 continuity), where he and his followers retrieved the mangled body of Megatron after the crash of the Ark and attempted to revive it with a new strain of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleon_%28Transformers%29_543c.html" title="Nucleon (Transformers)">Nucleon</a>. His plan was thwarted by Optimus Prime and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a>, and Bludgeon was seemingly destroyed by a rewired construction droid.</p>

<p>Bludgeon appeared in the <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamwave_Productions_d154.html" title="Dreamwave Productions">Dreamwave Productions</a> War Within series. Bludgeon was recruited as a Decepticon under the leadership of Megatron in his war against the Autobots on the planet Cybertron. When <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a> led the Decepticon attack on the Autobot capitol of Iacon Bludgeon was part of the strike force along with <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrotrain.html" title="Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzwing.html" title="Blitzwing">Blitzwing</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Brawl</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Chopshop</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirge_%28Transformers%29_4d50.html" title="Dirge (Transformers)">Dirge</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frenzy_%28Transformers%29_4a91.html" title="Frenzy (Transformers)">Frenzy</a>, <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octane_%28Transformers%29_60e5.html" title="Octane (Transformers)">Octane</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Onslaught</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramjet_%28Transformers%29_de73.html" title="Ramjet (Transformers)">Ramjet</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predacons.html" title="Predacons">Tantrum</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Venom</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combaticons.html" title="Combaticons">Vortex</a>.</p>
<p>When Megatron and Autobot leader Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. Bludgeon became leader of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_Trinity_ef89.html" title="Chaos Trinity">Chaos Trinity</a>, which was comprised of himself, Bugly and Mindwipe. The Chaos Trinity was devoted to expanding its members knowledge of the mystic arts. The Chaos Trinity acted as master manipulators, tricking others into doing their work for them. For instance when Shockwave's faction developed <a href="../../../t/r/y/Trypticon.html" title="Trypticon">Trypticon</a>, the Chaos Trinity tipped off the Autobots under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prowl_%28Transformers%29_34e7.html" title="Prowl (Transformers)">Prowl</a> where it was being tested.</p>

Bludgeon and his Chaos Trinity.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Chaos Trinity came into the service of <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallen_%28Transformers%29_da1c.html" title="Fallen (Transformers)">the Fallen</a>, an ancient Transformer who betrayed Primus and was now an agent of Unicron. The Fallen promised to expand their mystic powers in return for their loyalty, after threatening to kill them if they didn't join him.</p>
<p>Attacking a meeting between <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetfire.html" title="Jetfire">Jetfire</a> and Shockwave, hypnotising the former and incapacitating the latter, they were then beaten by <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a>, who had come because he believed that Jetfire was betaying them. However, this was all part of a bigger set-up by the Fallen, who easily defeated the Dinobot leader. Then battling the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectobot.html" title="Protectobot">Protectobots</a> and kidnapping Hot Spot, the Trinity took him to the Fallen for some arcane ritual. However they were attacked by Shockwave's Decepticons. Bludgeon fled, but was blasted by a teleporting <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skywarp.html" title="Skywarp">Skywarp</a>. He did not appear again in the G1 comics. It is interesting to note that Bludgeon here was not so willing to take orders, questioning the Fallen on several occasions.</p>
<p>Bludgeon would not only appear in the <i>War Within</i> Dreamwave comic but also in its sister comic <a href="../../../a/r/m/Transformers%7E_Armada_2d23.html" title="Transformers: Armada">Transformers: Armada</a>. In this world, the incarnation of Bludgeon (now in his traditional Pretender shell) was one of the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heralds_of_Unicron_8597.html" title="Heralds of Unicron">Heralds of Unicron</a>, from a different <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimension.html" title="Dimension">dimension</a>, sent to cause destruction prior to Unicron's arrival alongside his fellow heralds, <a href="../../../d/i/r/Dirge_%28Transformers%29_4d50.html" title="Dirge (Transformers)">Dirge</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderwing.html" title="Thunderwing">Thunderwing</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scourge_%28Transformers%29_a62e.html" title="Scourge (Transformers)">Scourge</a> and their leader <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvatron.html" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a> (all characters from the G1 universe, though their names are not mentioned and are not the versions from the Generation One Dreamwave comics).</p>
<p>While Galvatron confronted <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron_%28Unicron_Trilogy%29_4642.html" title="Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)">Megatron</a> at the Autobot base, the rest of the Heralds took over the Decepticon base on Cybertron. Scourge, Dirge and Thunderwing, activating all the Space Bridge Portals, left Bludgeon to guard their arrival portal in the Decepticon base and departed for Earth. A team of Autobots led by <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetfire.html" title="Jetfire">Jetfire</a> would then arrive to investigate, with Bludgeon stalking them from the shadows, killing and wounding several. Eventually locating him with searchlights, Jetfire destroyed his shell, although the inner robot escaped. Attacking Jetfire again in tank mode he and the other Decepticons were destroyed when Jetfire detonated a store of explosives, destroying the four heralds.</p>

<p>Bludgeon's first chronological appearance in the new <a href="../../../i/d/w/IDW_Publishing_39c9.html" title="IDW Publishing">IDW Publishing</a> continuity came in the <a href="../../../s/p/o/The_Transformers%7E_Spotlight_108b.html" title="The Transformers: Spotlight">The Transformers: Spotlight</a> issue on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shockwave_%28Transformers%29_2cc4.html" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a>, where he was assigned to investigate the missing Decepticon's lab. He became increasingly obsessed with the Regenesis program, a project Shockwave had initiated to seed worlds with new caches of more powerful <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energon_%28power_source%29.html" title="Energon (power source)">Energon</a>. At some point, he recovered the dormant hulk of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderwing.html" title="Thunderwing">Thunderwing</a> (who had nearly devastated Cybertron years before), and began to realise he could use the Energon Shockwave had seeded to revive him - unaware he was being spied on by <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundwave_%28Transformers%29_9a71.html" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a>. After heading to Earth and using human facsimiles to harvest the Ultra Energon, Soundwave confronted him. When Bludgeon revealed the truth, Soundwave attempted to stop him - but was blasted into stasis lock and left to die as <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_St._Helens_e68f.html" title="Mount St. Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> erupted.</p>
<p>Bludgeon's plan came full circle in <i><a href="../../../s/t/o/The_Transformers%7E_Stormbringer_a5d8.html" title="The Transformers: Stormbringer">The Transformers: Stormbringer</a></i>, as he and his followers kidnapped <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetfire.html" title="Jetfire">Jetfire</a> and the <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technobots.html" title="Technobots">Technobots</a>, hoping to dissect them and use their parts to replicate the same grafting process that created Thunderwing, giving them their own <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretenders_%28Transformers%29_d412.html" title="Pretenders (Transformers)">Pretender Shells</a>. Hacking into the monster's mind Bludgeon implanted a subconscious suggestion for Thunderwing to seek out and destroy entire planets, believing their sacrifice would enable Cybertron to be reborn, before unleashing the monster on <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebulos.html" title="Nebulos">Nebulos</a>. However, their plans were stopped by the <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wreckers_%28Transformers%29_e027.html" title="Wreckers (Transformers)">Wreckers</a>, who took out his cult. In desperation, Bludgeon underwent the grafting process only to find out, far too late, that the shell hadn't been neuro-aligned; the psychic backlash destroyed his mind.</p>
<p>Bludgeon, as well as his whole group, have completely different robot forms to their toys and bear resemblance to the toy's Pretender Shells. His face and helmet bear some similarity to the original Pretender shell, although Bludgeon appears to be missing the lower half of his face and his circuits are exposed. His Pretender shell bears a heavy resemblance to the toy but has been redesigned as if Bludgeon was a Mega-Pretender capable of transforming into a tank, with tank tracks and shoulder turrets clearly visible.</p>

<p>Bludgeon would also appear in the fourth G.I Joe vs the Transformers crossover from <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Due_Publishing_f22e.html" title="Devil's Due Publishing">Devil's Due Publishing</a>. Little is known about this incarnation of Bludgeon, save that, in his pre-Pretender form, he attempted to kill <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> shortly after he had received the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot_Matrix_of_Leadership_caf8.html" title="Autobot Matrix of Leadership">Matrix</a>. Later, in his traditional <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pretenders_%28Transformers%29_d412.html" title="Pretenders (Transformers)">Pretender shell</a>, Bludgeon led a group of Decepticons (the Pretender Monsters) in an alliance with the serpent cult <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra-La_1da2.html" title="Cobra-La">Cobra-La</a>, first stopping Joe Colton's Adventure team and capturing Colton himself.

Prime was saved by Hawk, and the two fled with Flint into the mountains - only to be chased down by Bludgeon and a group of Cobra-La troopers. The story is ongoing. A preview seems to indicate he is killed by Optimus Prime. <a href="http://www.devilsdue.net/5pagers/jvtfIV02/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.devilsdue.net/5pagers/jvtfIV02/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>The name Bludgeon was last used on a yellow repaint of Generation 2's Hero Megatron. Though he may well be a separate character (as he did not appear in any comics or television series and Hasbro did not release any story for him other than he is part of a Destructicon sub-group), he does have yellow and silver (the primary colours of Bludgeon's Pretender shell) and even has red eye paint across his nose to create the illusion of a "visor" like Bludgeon's original robot mode, leading many to believe he is meant to be a homage to the G1 character.</p>
<p>The Robots in Disguise character of Bludgeon is unofficially considered part of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Transformers%7E_Universe_d810.html" title="Transformers: Universe">Transformers: Universe</a> line. He was planned to be made part of the fiction for the Transformers: Universe, like most non-show repaints from the RiD line, by the Transformers: Collectors Club, but they only produced concept art for a biography page before they went under.</p>

<p>Bludgeon would recieve an extremely unusual reference in the Cyber Key info (found on Hasbro's website) for the character <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backstop_%28Transformers%29_1cd9.html" title="Backstop (Transformers)">Backstop</a>. The info indicated that Bludgeon and Banzai-Tron had been the ones to teach Backstop the art of being a martial warrior.</p>
