	    <p>The Blue Danube's genuine blueprints were put into a public library archive a decade ago due to public servant's silly diligence. Everybody could walk in and copy them. You could build the bomb with a CNC lathe in your garage then, guaranteed working. You only had to find some highly refined fissile material to fill it, that is the hard part.</p>
<p>Still, when BBC wrote about this issue last year, the blueprints were removed from public eye and put into secret archive. Weapons experts said nobody is likely to be interest in this design nowadays because it is so heavy at 1300 kilograms. 195.70.32.136 10:42, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was in 2002, and I have to confess it was me who spotted the files and photocopied them, before speaking to a journalist contact and a Member of Parliament. The plans were withdrawn and reclassified 'SECRET' the following day. But I still have the photocopies. Nor can the Ministry of Defence erase my personal memory banks. Probably.</p>
<p>For a sight of the original newspaper report, Google my name, Brian Burnell, and it should pop-up at several sites including the original Daily Telegraph report. The files contained various engineering blueprints, but the two key documents were a sectional, dimensioned drawing on foolscap of Sir William Penney's original sketch (in his own hand) for the fissile core, and a drawing of the Urchin impact initiator. I still have a photocopy of that also.</p>
<p>However, I worked on Blue Danube as a young design engineer in the 1950's, and agreed then to abide by the UK's Official Secrets Act. That's not a disposable committment; its for life. Unless the files are later declassified again ....</p>
<p>While its true to say that no ill-intentioned person would copy this design (for a variety of reasons) there are easier ways for a sub-national group to build a workable if inefficient and crude weapon. But a common misconception is that it cannot or never will be done.</p>
<p>Remember that such a weapon would be built to be used shortly after completion. The elaborate and sophisticated products of weapons-engineering laboratories are very different, and are intended to serve a different purpose. Firstly, they are not designed to be used. They are designed to have a long shelf life, for long-term storage with minimal servicing while remaining ultra-reliable and safe. Their only expected usage is likely to be as a bargaining chip or to wave about a bit in the faces of other states. It is expected that they will never be used. A sub-national terrorist group isn't interested in a weapon of that sophistication. And they have so much experience and skill with conventional explosives they would be stupid to branch out into weapons that they have no experience of; and use of one would invite annihilation.</p>

<p>Those blue prints did reveal the use of a 4 piece levitated pit imploded by a hollow high explosive sphere as I stated. This information is correct and should have not been removed from this article by fast fission. I understand some persons are bound by the british official secrets act in discussing the Blue Danube design but some private persons who know about it can discuss it.</p>
<p>I have seen the actual blueprints of the Blue Danube nuclear weapon , and I know my description of its design is in fact actually correct. tmayes</p>
<p>People like fast fission* et el should realize there are some wickipedians who truly do have accurate , complete , and detailed information about nuclear weapon physics, and nuclear weapon design. Neither I nor them will actually publish anything on wickipedia that is not already in the public realm* because of the sensitive nature of this material. People like fast fission however are wrong to doubt what we do actualy write about nuclear weapons here and question its accuracy however**.I will not claim we are infallible ******* but people like fast fission are surely more fallible then we are when they write about this. tmayes</p>

<p>Actually, Tmayes, whether a private person or not, whether you signed it or not, you would be bound by the Official Secrets Act like it or not, if you are a person of any nationality residing in, or visiting Britain. And any alleged breach would probably be extradictable.</p>
<p>When key workers in the UK are asked to 'sign the OSA' it does not mean that they are bound by it only after they sign it. Its just a procedural device so that afterwards the cops can more easily prove to a court that the alleged offender was compos mentis and aware of the law. All people are bound by it whether they sign or not; just as all people are bound by other laws on homicide, dangerous driving etc. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian.Burnell_53e7.html" title="User:Brian.Burnell">Brian.Burnell</a> 17:00, 8 June 2006 (UTC) Not everyone who knows the design of blue danube lives in or visits britian.</p>

<p>The British Chiefs of Staff had specified a Blue Danube yield of 10-12 kT to maximise the number of weapons that could be produced with the fissile material available. This yield was compared in my origional revision (dated 24 May 2006) to the Hiroshima bomb. Another user later added an inaccurate reference to Fat Man (should have been Little Boy) and then another user corrected the mistaken reference to Fat Man by changing 'Hiroshima bomb' to 'Nagaski bomb' which made the comparison worthless since the Nagasaki bomb was of approx double the yield of Blue Danube, and not what was intended.</p>
<ul>
<li>There were numerous factors embodied in the Chiefs reasons for selecting 10-12 kT.</li>
<li>The available fissile material referred to above.</li>
<li>The results of Air Ministry scientific studies on targetting that concluded that at that time there were few targets that required a greater yield than 10 kT, and that those few could be attacked with more than one bomb.</li>
<li>The pre-detonation issue. Until 1956-57 all Blue Danube bombs used an all-Pu-239 core and the Chiefs were advised by AWRE that by limiting yield to 10 kT the small core size would limit the risk of pre-detonation to an acceptable figure.</li>
<li>When U-235 became available in 1956 it became possible to overcome the predetonation issue by adopting composite cores of concentric shells of U-235 and Pu-239, and larger yields were possible without increasing the risk of pre-detonation. But the Chiefs were content to accept the targetting study recommendations of the Air Ministry scientists that 10 kT was enough.</li>
<li>In accepting that composite cores should also be limited to 10-12 kT the Chiefs were also aware that at that yield, and with the fissile material available, the number of weapons possible would increase considerably, because the amount of Pu-239 required was less than that required for an all-Pu-239 core of similar yield.</li>
<li>The yield specified by the Chiefs was 10 kT until the Director of AWRE, Sir William Penney advised the Chiefs that a composite core was barely possible at 10 kT and that the actual minimum yield that AWRE could produce was likely to be 12 kT. The Chiefs accepted that advice.</li>
<li>Researchers should note that in the British terminology of the period, the term 'mixed core' was used for the American term 'composite core'. Sources are declassified Ministry of Defence documents archived as DEFE 32/3 E13. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian.Burnell_53e7.html" title="User:Brian.Burnell">Brian.Burnell</a> 00:13, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Almost all modern fission devices use a composite core."</p>
