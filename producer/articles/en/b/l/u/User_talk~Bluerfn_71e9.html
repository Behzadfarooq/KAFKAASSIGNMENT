<p>Your "FFXII ULTIMANIA" book has several misprints. If you play the game itself, you will see that Basch's middle name is "von", not "fon". Please play the game if you do not believe me, stop changing the information just because you have bad information.

<dd>You must have an older version of the game, because in my special edition, it clearly does say "von" -- I'll have to play through it again, and take a physical picture for you w/ my camera.

<dd>First you claim of me having a misprinted book, then bad information, now you say I have an older version of the game?

<dd>"fon" is a mispelling in some early editions of the game. I purchased my copy about 2 weeks after the intial shipment, which has the error corrected. <b>von</b> is the proper spelling of the word <b>of</b> in German. <b>fon</b> in German means nothing. If you notice, the letter F is right next to the letter V on the US keyboard. It was a simple mistake which has been corrected in future versions of the game. I'll get that photograph to you as soon as possible. <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahK_3884.html" title="User:NoahK">Noah</a> 22:45, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I mean, you do understand that right? The spelling of "fon" has just been misinformation from the start. The word "fon" means nothing. It is simply common sense, which is why it is spelled correctly in my version of the game. Did you pre-order your game, or did you purchase a copy after the initial shipment of games from the distributor? <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahK_3884.html" title="User:NoahK">Noah</a> 22:47, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. We can just chalk it up to a mis-translation from the Japanese version (which had the spelling correct as <b>von</b>) to the American version (which has an improper spelling of <b>fon</b>). <a href="../../../n/o/a/User%7ENoahK_3884.html" title="User:NoahK">Noah</a> 23:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello Blue. It's me again. The <i>character</i> -- you can try to edit my contention that Ivalice is a region all you want, but I will keep reverting it every 25 hours because the official NA FFXIII Website, created by SquareEnix says that Ivalice is a <b>world</b> (in addition to it possibly being a region). I've been around Wikipedia much longer than you have, and I don't give up easily. Just wanted to give you a heads up. Thanks. Oh, and in regards to the von/fon issue, even IMDB has it listed as <b>von</b> in the official actors profile.

<p>Hi, I'm a new user of Wikipedia so I don't have an account, but my name is Eileen. It would be really cool if you would move the Ultimecia/Rinoa paragraph (On the Talk: List of FFVIII characters page) to Talk:Ultimecia, I've actually done that when I was talking on it to contribute to the discussion and I did reply to it. Anyway, I've heard all the Ultimecia/Rinoa stuff is being moved there (Rinoa Heartilly talk page is included) which is why I deleted it and moved it there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.142.130.18_e487.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.142.130.18">67.142.130.18</a> (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.142.130.18.html" title="User talk:67.142.130.18">talk</a>) 23:49, 28 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I'll concur about the wordiness, and I have no problem with just removing the entire sentance.</p>
<p>My main point of that edit was to counteract the falsehood in the original text that you cannot buy Teleport Stones in the game. You can't at first, but later on the game there are several vendors who begin to stock them.</p>
<p>I've had run-ins with readers/forum people twice now and they cited this article as the reason. Since I'm only an occaisional editor here on Wiki, I didn't feel comfortable just hacking the whole thing out. I appreciate the clarity.</p>

<dt>Story</dt>

<p>The story begins with the introduction of Ashley Riot, a Riskbreaker agent of the VKP, who was sent along with the VKP Inquisitor Callo Merlose, to Duke Bardorba's manor under siege by the cult Müllenkamp. Their missions include discovering the Duke's reason to his involvement in the Müllenkamp cult's activities,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> and to find out why the Cardinal hastily sents the Crimson Blades in search of Sydney without the VKP's authority. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The Crimson Blades, led by Guildenstern who is also in pursuit of Sydney, had managed to enter the Duke's manor. It served as a diversion for Ashley who manages to enter the manor undetected alone. At the doorsteps, Ashley listens as Hardin, Sydney's accomplice give order to the cultists to burn the manor and kill any hostages.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> He manages to stop this from happening, and even manages to encounter Sydney, discovering the cult leader's intentions and powers in the process, though he did not manage to apprehend Sydney.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> In the chaos, Sydney and Hardin escapes with the Duke's son Joshua to Leà Monde, and Ashley continues his pursuit of Sydney into the dark city.</p>
<p>Though his manor was laid siege, Duke Bardorba had actually retreated to his secondary residence nearby. In the morning, the Duke gave orders to a certain character, Rosencrantz, to enter the city of Leà Monde and deal with Sydney and the Crimson Blades.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> He also orders his servants to burn the main manor in the guise of a Crimson Blade to erase the existence of a wyvern,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> despite his family being hold hostage there. He also ensured that the Parliament will not be able to question their actions, proving his strong influence in the kingdom.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> However, the Duke presents his softer side towards his son Joshua, and demands that nothing should happen to the boy.</p>
<p>Ashley and Callo arrives in Leà Monde still in pursuit of Sydney. Ashley enters the city through the underground wine chambers alone, asking Callo to stay and report to the VKP headquarters if anything should happen. While Callo returns to the surface, she encounters Sydney and was made his hostage. Ashley, unknown to the event that had unfold, continues his trek under the city, discovering about Grimoires, objects holding magical powers, and facing off a few Crimson Blades.

<p>Hi, Bluerfn.</p>
<p>When you put that response in my own <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjones23_9435.html" title="User talk:Sjones23">talk page</a>, I admit that I was a bit dissapointed in some of the comments, because some of them "sounded a bit flustered" like you said. I found some sites where they have the Ultimania for FFXII. I can read Japanese like you and understand your Japanese as well. I learned Japanese in a few weeks when I was 15 or so. I am looking forward to working with you. To be honest, I really like FFXII and I am still playing it. I am having some trouble with the game where I have to beat Belias. Can you help me out? We know Ronsenburg is pronounced as Rosenburg in Japan and why they put an "n" to made it Ronsenburg. By the way, Bluerfn, thanks for the comments on my <a href="../../../s/j/o/User_talk%7ESjones23_9435.html" title="User talk:Sjones23">talk page</a>.

<p>Hi, once again, Bluerfn. When your comment on the FFXII story section was shown on AxemTitanium's article that you want to rewrite the story, I was intrigued by the idea. We <i>are</i> editors who help each other out after all. I edited some parts of the FFXII article as well. We can do it, Bluerfn, together. It is an honor to talk to you again.

<p>Hey, sorry for the late reply, I'm still technically on wikibreak. I took a quick glance at it and it looks good, although I can't say for certain because I've never actually played Vagrant Story before. At any rate, it looks well referenced (were the 40 references your work?). I would suggest spinning the OST off into its own article and expanding the music section to be more general. The gameplay section could also use some citations (usually from reviews that talk about gameplay). Also, it would be nice if we could have a little more insight on the development. On the whole, the article looks like it's in good shape. As for the FFXII story section, it looks <i>much</i> better than it did last I saw it. Good work! <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 20:12, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never played Vagrant Story, but I think the synopsis might be too long. Try to trim any details that can be left out without taking away from a general understanding of the plot. Otherwise, it looks like a great effort.

<p>Hello- I'm not sure I understand what the problem was with my edits. The knights in VS wear and cross themselves with the Rood symbol that appears also as the symbol of Kilitas. Glabados is shown to be a branch of Kiltia by this extract of XII- "Several years after Kiltia's founding, Saint Ajora began a new teaching, claiming that Faram alone was the one true god, the popularity of this new sect further lessening the power of the Light." --77.99.28.91 14:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I never said the knights were Kilitas, just that they used the same Rood symbol <i>as</i> the Kiltia of T and XII. I didn't even go so far as to say they were connected, I just mentioned the shared symbol. Which is fact, rather than speculation. Also, the XII Ultimania links the Ajora mentioned in XII with the one from FFT (although the game does that fairly obviously by itself). Considering both mentioned Ajoras being founder of Glabados is pretty much the entire crux of the timeline section, I thought it might be okay mention it in passing elsewhere...Could I, at least, restore my edit while omitting the "itself a branch of Kilita" bit? That's the only part that could be construed as speculation. --77.99.28.91 11:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not to clog up your history, but I just wanted to make sure my original points were not being lost here:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Pointed out that Kiltia of XII and T (named as such in both) and the unnamed St. Iocus religion of VS use the same symbol, the rood. I drew no connection between the two beyond that.</li>
<li>Observed that, where Kiltia is polytheistic, the unnamed religion is monotheistic, like T's Glabados. I felt it relevent to point out that Glabados is also a Kildean sect, but apparently that's speculation, so I'll not add that back if it's causing a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>--77.99.28.91 12:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I didn't mean XII and T, I meant XII and VS. And the XII Kiltias cross themselves with the Kiltia symbol as the devouts of St. Iocus do (the outfits of the Judge Magisters also use a modified version, but that's a bit more speculative), and I <i>believe</i> the XII Kiltias wear it around their necks (I'd have to check that). My intention with all this isn't to push some agenda, It's just exploring the elements of VS that link it to Ivalice at large; which is what the entire VS section aims to do. That the Kiltias of both games and the St. Iocus followers of VS all wear/make use of the Rood isn't speculative and is, indeed, one of the most obvious links between the two games.</li>
</ul>
<p>And what do you have in mind for the article, out of interest?--77.99.28.91 11:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't realise it was a controversial issue to mention that a few religions of Ivalice used the same symbol&#160;:P Matsuno's already said they're set in the same world.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're already thinking of sorting out the trivia, then perhaps model the Ivalice article on the main Spira article? That allows one to explore Ivalice's religion, races, politics, geography etc. without it being fancruft (it being integral to a 'world' that's appeared several times now), and then have a seperate Locations in Final Fantasy XII/T/TA articles dealing with the more listy elements from the respective games. I suppose a seperate heading in the Ivalice article could address the fictitious nature of TA's Ivalice. --77.99.28.91 13:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Aren't you kinda blowing this out of proportion? Surely you could've just added a citation needed tag or something. Anyway, <a href="http://barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/vsodd.html" class="external text" title="http://barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/vsodd.html" rel="nofollow">here's a source</a> that makes a note of several instances of the Rood symbol in VS (both Kiltia and St. Iocus. I don't have the capacity to take screenshots of XII, though). It just seemed a worthwhile point to make since it concerns A) Ivalice and B) Vagrant Story. What <i>is</i> supposed to go in the VS section of an Ivalice article if not things like that? It's hardly fanon when it's right there in both games. --77.99.28.91 18:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't trying to antagonize you, I was just trying to understand. Sorry for my mistake. It just looked to me like if that shouldn't have been there, then the entire VS section is similarly void. Anyway, delete this off your talk page if you like. Again, I'm sorry for my mistake. I'll stay away from editing stuff like that. --77.99.28.91 18:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
