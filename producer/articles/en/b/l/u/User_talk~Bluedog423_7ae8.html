<p>On 24 December 2006, I put up the UW-Madison article for Featured Article. It failed miserably, due in part to the fact that I had almost no idea what the criteria were for FA.

<p>Dear Bluedog423,</p>
<p>How is it going? You have been less active on WP these days. I just wanted to let you know that the article has gone through a major copyedit and unless I get major objections from WP editors, I am considering nominating it as a FAC. As you mentioned, comments will come up and hopefully, they should be fairly minor and fixable in the nomination process. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaSaltarella_7b57.html" title="User:LaSaltarella">LaSaltarella</a> 21:36, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice you participated in a prior discussion on the Template talk page for Methodist Colleges. Other than the religious affiliation concerns, which is discussed below, I thought you also might have objections to the size of the template box which I wholeheartedly understated, I think we can shave down the size of the box or set it to autocollapse. I just posted this on the talk page and hope that you could <a href="../../../m/e/t/Template_talk%7EMethodistColleges_4bc0.html" title="Template talk:MethodistColleges">return</a>.</p>
<p><br />
I discovered two sources listing Methodist colleges and universities the first is the International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities (IAMSCU) founded in 1991 which describes its members as <i>Methodist-related schools, colleges, and universities and those with a Methodist tradition from throughout the world.</i> the other is the directory of untied methodist related colleges, from The Untied Methodist Church in the US. Both are from the General Board of Higher Education websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://public.gbhem.org/iamscu/search_results.asp?act=search_sch_loc&amp;school_loc=emory&amp;state=GA&amp;submit2=GO" class="external text" title="http://public.gbhem.org/iamscu/search_results.asp?act=search_sch_loc&amp;school_loc=emory&amp;state=GA&amp;submit2=GO" rel="nofollow">IAMCU website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gbhem.org/gbhem/colleges.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gbhem.org/gbhem/colleges.html" rel="nofollow">USA Methodist directory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From these sources this template seems pretty accurate, however it is missing several universities</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both the University of Puget Sound and Duke University are listed and the last elections for board of Directors are January 25, 2007 see <a href="http://www.gbhem.org/iamscu/directors.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gbhem.org/iamscu/directors.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> so this list seems pretty up to date, any objections to adding them back to the template? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstuishin_8fb0.html" title="User:Astuishin">- thank you Astuishin</a> 18:08, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First off, the logo on sportslogos.net appears royal blue. The page (Duke page) says Royal Blue is their shade of blue. And the reason I added black is because on the basketball uniforms there are heavy elements on black. Heck, they have black alternate uniforms. That's why I added black. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazy_Canadian_3452.html" title="User:Crazy Canadian">Crazy Canadian</a> 13:09, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now, on the University page, I'm not adding black. However, on the Sports teams page, I am since they use black in sports. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazy_Canadian_3452.html" title="User:Crazy Canadian">Crazy Canadian</a> 12:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great job adding all of those previous rankings to the UNC-Duke article. I helped create the initial table so I know how hard adding all that stuff can be. Where were you able to find all the previous rankings? <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemember_d145.html" title="User:Remember">Remember</a> 13:47, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey - I tried to organize the discussion of the photo a bit, to make the (long) debate easier to read. It involved moving both our comments (completely intact) into a different section; if you have any problem with the reorganization at all (they are your comments, after all), just move them back and I'll leave them there.

<dd>I apparently suffered from the delusion that, after I organized it, people would post to the proper section. Ha ha. Sorry for the mess. Last time I try something like that. Guanxi 13:29, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate your level-headedness and I agree there are two valid sides -- I think the evidence argument is a credible one (though I don't agree). My honest feeling is, I have no idea what happened that night, but I think it should be decided by a judge and jury, and not by the media and public, and that's what's happening. Trials before the media and public depend on who has access to the media, status, and power (i.e., the kids' parents). If that happens, a prostitute and local DA are way outgunned by people with connections on the highest levels. As a result, women like her who really are victims have no recourse, and can be attacked with impunity by people with status and power. Who's going to believe the prostitute? But, to emphasize, I have no idea what happened -- rape, assault, threats, or just racist slurs (which are wrong, but don't merit a Wikipedia page).</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are willing to act as the level-headed one: If you're familiar with the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policies, might you consider explaining gently them to Johntex? I think it's a neutral issue, but the fact that I'm saying it is creating communication problems. The current photo is from a blog, which is not a 'reliable source' AFAIK.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the photo is being posted as evidence of her condition at a certain time, I think we need a reliable source (who says this photo is from that point in time? Maybe it was before, or much later). If there's a reliable source for it, I certainly won't object to posting it on these grounds.</li>
<li>If it's just posted to show a picture of her, then, if it's as widespread as people say, we're probably safe, but then I think there's less support for posting it in that circumstance.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just don't want to get involved, I understand completely! Thanks. Guanxi 01:28, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
