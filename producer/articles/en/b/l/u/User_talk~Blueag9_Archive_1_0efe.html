<p>I would like to see a picture of the Academic Building. A&amp;M is continually criticized for "ugly buildings" and yet, I think the Academic Building is beautiful. Also, A&amp;M has built the Jack K. Williams building on University Dr. Further, because A&amp;M is also criticized for lacking fine arts, photographs that are artistically creative I think, would be better.

<p>Thanks! With this break I've been able to get some work done on the wikipedia articles, but with the semester shortly to begin my time is limited again. My focus is still on traditions and ensuring thier uniformity. Also, I've been working on expanding the Student Life section and attempting to make the main article follow the University Project guidlines with the future goal of making the article a Featured Article. Only the University of Michigan has made it there as far as I know. -- <a href="../../../h/u/t/User%7EHut101_1d68.html" title="User:Hut101">Hut101</a> 01:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll attempt to find time to help with the football article, though I'm unsure when that would be. Also, have you added your pictures to the Wikicommons A&amp;M section so that they can be used throughout the A&amp;M related articles? -- <a href="../../../h/u/t/User%7EHut101_1d68.html" title="User:Hut101">Hut101</a> 01:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To use Wikicommons you will need a seperate account for that site. Also, you will have to upload all your images to Wikicommons. When you do, look for a category called something like Texas A&amp;M University, that Johntex created about a month ago. Once you've uploaded your photos to Wikicommons you can use them on any and all Wiki websites, and under any language which is a big advantage since then we can make all A&amp;M language articles identical. As for the Wikiproject, if someone wants to start one, go for it. I'll look into it in about a week for two. -- <a href="../../../h/u/t/User%7EHut101_1d68.html" title="User:Hut101">Hut101</a> 06:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The user box is pretty nice, and I might at it at some point. However, there already is the other userbox which I currently have and I believe there needs to be some sort of uniformity between current and former students of A&amp;M. Also, are you going to place your pictures up on Wikicommons anytime soon or are you going to simply upload them to Wikipedia for now? At some point we should upload as many pictures as possible to Wikicommons and add a See Also link under ‚ÄúCampus shots‚Äù. If possible I would like to attempt more editing on A&amp;M articles. I‚Äôve been busy with school and work at AggieSat Labs, which if you‚Äôre an engineer you should look into. Is it possible to coordinate our efforts and attempt to reduce the To-do Lists. -- <a href="../../../h/u/t/User%7EHut101_1d68.html" title="User:Hut101">Hut101</a> 07:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a slight problem with the removal of Notable People from the Galveston and Qatar campus articles. Though they might seem as simply seperate campuses with the same name, both have Vice-Presidents who answer directly to Eddie Davis. The only difference between those campuses and the "Main" campus is distance. Any information that pretains to College Station campus should include and effect A&amp;M Galveston's article. If there is any other clarification needed, please ask. -- <a href="../../../h/u/t/User%7EHut101_1d68.html" title="User:Hut101">Hut101</a> 21:03, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No problem. There is a chance people might look at the Notable People and think that "273,000" students graduated from A&amp;M Galveston. Might need a rewrite. Otherwise, Galveston and Qatar by all practical purposes are part of the main campus. Thats a problem when looking at student enrollment since some number actually include all branch campuses. -- <a href="../../../h/u/t/User%7EHut101_1d68.html" title="User:Hut101">Hut101</a> 16:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>thank you for all the information. How much have you put into the UTEP pages? I'm glad to be here and I will be adding as much information as possible. I am having a problem with people wanting to say that UTEP's alma mater is 'the eyes of texas' which is nowhere to be found on UTEP's website. Besides that, it's the only issue I'm having.

<p>I'm a recent UTEP alum, and I can't wait to make UTEP's pages beter. Actually I have heard before that UTEP came up with 'the eyes of texas' and that utaustin got it from UTEP. I don't know, maybe something will be uncovered now. ElpasoHead 22:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Blueag, I see you have changed one of the headings to "Post season". I originally considered that heading and went with a different one. I have explained my reasoning on the article Talk page.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006_Texas_Longhorn_football_team#Post-season_vs_After_the_season" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:2006_Texas_Longhorn_football_team#Post-season_vs_After_the_season" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Please stop by and see what you think of my reasoning. I put it there so other people can chime in if they want to. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 08:51, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, that does look pretty nice! Thanks for taking the time to experiment with that. I sometimes give thought to over-hauling my user page, but as you can see, I never quite get around to it. One of the things that has held me back somewhat is I didn't have a good idea how to interspese the landscape-format awards with the portrait-format awards. Your solution bypasses that nicely by just sorting them into two groups. I think I will try it out for a while and see how it feels.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I have been experimenting in my sandbox with a way to list information about pages I have helped with: <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_Sandbox2_9639.html" title="User:Johntex/Sandbox2">User:Johntex/Sandbox2</a> It is very much a work in progres, but I would welcome feedback from you on how you think it looks and if you think it is valuable. Naturally you can steal the code if you like it.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the idea. Best, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:21, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
