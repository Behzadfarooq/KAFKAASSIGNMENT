Title: Sex and the liberated man / Albert Ellis.<br />
Edition: 1st ed.<br />
Publisher: L. Stuart,<br />
Date: c1976.<br />
Description: 347 p.&#160;; 24 cm.<br />
Notes: <b>Published in 1963 under title: Sex and the single man.</b><br />
Notes: Includes index.<br />
Notes: Bibliography: p. 309-336.<br />
Subject: Single men.<br />

Subject: Rational-emotive psychotherapy.</p>
<p>The author, an MD (his specialization is psychiatry), specifically discusses the condition in the 1963 edition (emphasis added above) from a medical point of view (and as a rational reason for intercourse!); presumably the 1976 one will also suffice.<br />

<p>I feel that this page needs a section on the social implications of blue balls. However, 1) I don't feel entirely qualified to write about it and 2) I've already been accused of being overly <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">politically correct</a> this week on the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_Pump_1a2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">pump</a> so I'm not being bold, and I figured I'd discuss it first. Something about blue balls being a common tactic (at one time, less so now) for adolescent men to pressure young women into sex, or as an excuse for <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_assault.html" title="Sexual assault">sexual assault</a>.

<p><a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorland%27s_Illustrated_Medical_Dictionary_c581.html" title="Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary">Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary</a> conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is "a painful spasmodic muscular contraction", and the groin does have muscles. But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most). <a href="#Material_moved_from_Talk:Blue_Ball" title="">Ellis</a> emphasizes "congestion", which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the "pain and tenderness" of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priapism.html" title="Priapism">priapism</a>. (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viagra.html" title="Viagra">Viagra</a> and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.) --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)</p>

The real issue is indeed plain "release", or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that <a href="../../../e/d/_/ED_4e67.html" title="ED">ED</a>-medications work by affecting). --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)</p>

<p>I moved it back. Prostatic congestion (<a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostatosis.html" title="Prostatosis">Prostatosis</a>) is not the same as this condition, it is just one symptom of blue balls. Case in point: There are other causes for prostatic congestion, such as cancer, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, birth defects, smoking, sitting for extended periods, prostatitis, cysts, and age-realted enlargement of the prostate.

<dd>The most general term I've seen, which applies to either gender, is <b>pelvic congestion</b>, so I added a sentence about it and created a redirect page from that term. We could also work it the other way around by making the article more general, renaming it "pelvic congestion," and making "blue balls" redirect to it. I have no strong feelings about either option--<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficiallyover_61b0.html" title="User:Officiallyover">Officiallyover</a> 10:02, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like "pelvic congestion" more as the actual article name with "blue balls" going here as it covers both genders better. That would require some article work than a simple name change though to generalize it a bit more. I think it would come across as more professional though compared to documenting a slang term, albeit widely used. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthgrove_5a5c.html" title="User:Northgrove">Northgrove</a> 12:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed the word "disrupted" because it sounded like it meant something abnormal was happening. I changed the language about lymphatic fluid because I can't regard lymph as flowing <i>to</i> the end tissues. There could be increased <i>production</i> or pooling of lymph <i>at</i> the tissues due to a greater perfusion pressure, so that's what I described. Finally, cold water does not stimulate blood flow "throughout the body," and it does not sound like it would stimulate blood flow to the scrotum. Cold generally decreases blood flow to the skin, hence your skin turns paler in the cold and you lose less heat through it. Experiments have shown this decreased blood flow directly. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16015124&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16015124&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9509827&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9509827&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> If it worked the other way around, your skin would radiate heat even faster as it got colder. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis_size.html#Flaccid_Length" title="Penis size">Penis_size#Flaccid_Length</a> says that "one general physiological response to cold is decreased circulation of blood to the appendages. As the size of the penis very much relies on blood supply, this results in a decreased flaccid size." Finally, pseudoephedrine causes constriction of peripheral arterioles too, so if it does treat blue balls, this fits with the idea that cold causes the same constriction. I kept both possible mechanisms of action of the cold shower for now, however, and I wrote this long-winded justification because if I had changed the explanation to merely "decreased blood flow" then one of our references—which looks otherwise very well written—would contradict our article. --<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficiallyover_61b0.html" title="User:Officiallyover">Officiallyover</a> 11:15, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The medical tone of this article is preposterous. "Blue balls" is of course a slang term, but there is no corresponding legitimate medical equivalent term because there is no such medical condition. It's just a slang way to say you haven't come in a while. I would delete the bulk of this article but I know someone will just revert it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Did you even read the fucking article? It clearly defines the medical causes of this condition.</dd>
<dd>PS: "pelvic congestion"</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Two things I don't like about the "blue balls excuse" part:</p>
<p>1.) Telling the person who's turning you on that you have blueballs doesn't necessarily mean you are pressuring them to have sex or get you off (though I'm sure that does happen sometimes, unfortunately). Often, it's merely to explain why you are groaning and limping after an intense make-out session. there's nothing shameful about being honest with your partner.</p>
<p>2.) Who says blueballs can only be used to pressure WOMEN into having sex? I'm sure gay men might use blueballs as an excuse to pressure their partners into having sex, especially if their partners can sympathize with the condition. that doesn't make coersion right, but I'm sure it's not limited to just guys tricking girls</p>
<dl>
<dd>AFAIK, one of the issues is historically at least it wasn't something that women (or girls more likely) knew much about or could find out much about. There is this perception at least that girls/women were led to believe that blue balls was something that could only be 'cured' by sex when in fact it will go away by itself and masturbation would work just as well. On the other hand, we can expect most gay guys would be less likely to be taken in by these claims. And as I've stated, the perception is this is primarily an excused used by teens, not e.g. by 30 year olds. And even today (and especially in the yesteryears) it's probably fair to say that many gay teens are still struggling with their sexuality and so are less likely to be having sex with guys or at least less likely to be dating guys. Of course, I'm sure blue balls can and has been attempted on men as well I'm just pointing out the fact the current gay population is only by most estimates 20% at most and the fact that it seems most likely to be a less useful excuse on other gays and the fact as I've said it's more likely to be something used by younger people all adds up to mean it probably was and is significantly less commonly used by gay men/boys. Of course, we should still be neutral and talk about partners rather then women. P.S. I am a guy. And also quite tired so forgive me for rambling. P.P.S. I forgot to mention that gay men tend to be more promiscious or less restrictive with sex also means there is probably less need for the excuse <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 23:27, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><del><b>Support</b>, though I'd prefer separating the articles, as I think "blue balls" is used more informally. I doubt that even 50% of the time that "blue balls" is used, there's actually vascocongestion. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 03:38, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</del> Changing my vote to <b>oppose</b> the move and instead have the vasocongestion article focus on the medical aspects and leaving the blue balls article to concentrate on the popular usage. The current version of the article suggests that blue balls and vasocongestion are the same, which does not seem to be accurate. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 08:58, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>, the logic behind this move is flawed. Vasocongestion includes such things as red eyes from <a href="../../../h/a/y/Hay_fever.html" title="Hay fever">hay fever</a>. It makes no sense, especially since "blue balls" is the more common and accurate term. It seems the most likely reason for the move is that some poeple are uncomfortable or offended by the article's name.

I don't know whether "Vasocongestion" is more broad than "blue balls", but if it is it shouldn't simply be a redirect here. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 07:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. As has already been pointed out, vascocongestation is not blue balls. Accusation of censorship is however ridiculous. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoom91_0629.html" title="User:Loom91">Loom91</a> 07:59, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Even if a proper medical term is proposed I still support Blue balls because it is vastly more common than whatever the medical term is. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicarious_613d.html" title="User:Vicarious">Vicarious</a> 07:24, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> I know what blue balls is, I don't know what vasocongestation is. Furthermore, far more people are going to look for 'blue balls' than vasocongestation. ManicParroT 20:57, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Such a move would be less medically accurate. <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasocongestion.html" title="Vasocongestion">Vasocongestion</a> deserves to be is own article.

<li>Well, okay then, why not use Pelvic Congestion, which is (now I found) the clinically accurate word. As of yesterday, Vasocongestion was redirecting here, which was not right. But I strongly believe we should use Pelvic congestion, not Blue Balls. --<b><a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeenoe_98e3.html" title="User:Deenoe"><font color="#006633">Deenoe</font></a></b> 10:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>And by the way, I'm not trying to censor. But Blue balls isnt a medical term. --<b><a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeenoe_98e3.html" title="User:Deenoe"><font color="#006633">Deenoe</font></a></b> 20:54, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>We are a general-purpose encyclopaedia, not a medical encyclopaedia. Per <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>, articles should be at the most common unambiguous name. There are execptions to this, but none apply to this case as there are no specific guidelines for medicine-related articles and there are no issues with any of national varieties of english, abbreviations, diacritics or technical limitations. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:11, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The words "<a href="../../../c/u/n/Cunt.html" title="Cunt">cunt</a>" and "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>" aren't medical terms (i.e. <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vagina</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>), either - but both slang words words are common, storied, and distinct enough to warrant encyclopedic articles. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 00:28, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>there are some informations noone wants to know, fix it if you can, now (5) minutes later they just disappeared, i`m fearful of a new sort of wiki vandalism, better check that, sometimes the site has some info on someones penis on it, and no, i´m not on drugs <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.47.191.232 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.47.191.232_394f.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.47.191.232">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The history shows that this page has been vandalised a few times today, all of which was <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html" title="Help:Reverting">reverted</a> very quickly

<dd>However, there were no edits to the article at all around the time you posted here (21:08 and 21:12). The most probable cause is that you saw a <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cache.html" title="Cache">cached</a> version of the page that contained vandalism, and after you clicked back from thsi talk page to the article your cache updated to the version where the vandalism had already been removed. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 22:24, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to say that this is a terrible page and there should be serious consideration for its removal. The "source" from an MD that was sites is a TERRIBLE study. This is an isolated case with large study conducted. It is speculation of one person based on no facts and should NOT be considered a credible source.</p>

<p>I have never had anything close to this condition, sounds like poor circulation.

<dd>At the risk of venturing into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, have you been in the situation that would produce <i>this condition</i>? My experience is that it takes most of 24 hours of fairly constant stimulation to produce it in me, which hasn't happened all that often (thankfully). I'm sure it varies from man to man, so maybe you just take longer than most. In this liberated age, I'd guess it would be rare (but obviously not unknown) for men to be in a situation where they developed this condition... hence comments such as yours and others who don't believe it exists. My suspicion is that most men could suffer from it given the right circumstances.</dd>
