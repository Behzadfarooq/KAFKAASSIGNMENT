Hey Blue,</p>
<p>I just wanted to talk to you about your recent edit of the Bob Casey Jr. page.</p>
<p>In your edit, you mention that Casey is the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate "in his own right" since Joe Clark.</p>
<p>However, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harris_Wofford_5ee9.html" title="Harris Wofford">Harris Wofford</a> won a special election to the United States Senate, defeating former PA Governor <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Thornburgh_e701.html" title="Dick Thornburgh">Dick Thornburgh</a>, in Nov. 1991. Wofford won that race as an incumbent, after being appointed to the seat by Bob Casey Sr. in May of 91.</p>
<p>Given that Wofford did score a surprise upset in the 1991 special election, couldn't he technically be considered as having won the seat "in his own right," even though he was initially appointed to it?</p>
<p>I also raised this matter on the discussion page for Bob Casey Jr. I'd like to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

You are clearly editing the Ten. Titans page from your Tennessee perspective. As a former Houston resident who was there during the whole Oilers move fiasco, it was more than Mayor Lanier that balked at Bud Adams conniving moves. The entire city decried what he did, and to just pin it on Mayor Lanier is completely and utterly incorrect.</p>

<p>Hey Blue, I was just wondering if you could provide a source for your edits to the <a href="../../../5/t/h/5th_Congressional_District_of_Tennessee_3264.html" title="5th Congressional District of Tennessee">5th Congressional District of Tennessee</a>. For some reason the list of Reps doesn't match up with the one <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Congressional_Delegations_from_Tennessee_cb8a.html" title="U.S. Congressional Delegations from Tennessee">here</a>. Also, I'm a bit confused about the renumbering thing. Are you saying that at one point Nashville fell into the 6th District instead of the 5th? I don't think it makes sense to say that the 5th District was once the 6th District. But maybe there's something I'm not understanding here. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 29 June 2005 17:35 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Kaldari, I found them by tracing it back on the Political Graveyard. According to this page, Nashville was in the 6th District until the 1930 redistricting, when it became the 5th District. It became the 6th District again in the 1940s redistricting, and then back to the 5th since the 1950s redistricting. It's hard to trace, I know ... am going to do my own set of congressional district pages soon showing how congressmen's district numbers changed with redistricting. See for yourself: <a href="http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/TN/ofc/usrep.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/TN/ofc/usrep.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboy96_de0a.html" title="User:Blueboy96">Blueboy96</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, I think I see what you mean. However, I don't think it's helpful to say that the 5th District "became" the 6th District. Rather it should be stated that from a certain date to a certain date the 5th District included the regions foo, bar, and etc, but from another date to another date it included the regions bar, etc, and goo. I.e. the district moves, but its number remains the same. Otherwise it becomes far too confusing and is not consistent with the title of the article. You would be correct if the article were about "Nashville's Congressional District", but in keeping with precedents established for other states, the Wikipedia articles are organized by district number rather than location. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 29 June 2005 21:03 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm quite upset that you have chosen to continue perpetuating the idea that the 5th congressional district of Tennessee is synonymous with Nashville's congressional district. This is factually incorrect, unverifiable, and misleading. I have put in a lot of hard work on the 5th congressional district's article. This includes painstakingly verifying all of the congressional terms (and correcting a couple of errors from the political graveyard site), and looking up the congressional boundaries in the Tennessee blue books from 1940-2000. I don't know where you get your information from, but unless you are willing to cite your sources I would appreciate it if you would quit wasting my time by forcing me to go back and continually correct your misinformation. If you continue adding misleading, unreferenced information to this article I will be force to file an RfC against you. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 03:20, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's still one detail I'm not entirely clear on, but perhaps you would be able to solve: In several articles it is mentioned that a certain district has not been carried by Republicans since Reconstruction, but I haven't figured out yet if this refers to Nashville's congressional district or the 5th congressional district, or both (since they have not always been the same thing). Any chance you know the answer to this one? If you could provide a good source, that would be especially helpful. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 3 July 2005 20:06 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nashville itself hasn't been represented by a Republican since Reconstruction--a good source is the <a href="http://www.politicalgraveyard.com" class="external text" title="http://www.politicalgraveyard.com" rel="nofollow">Political Graveyard</a> <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboy96_de0a.html" title="User:Blueboy96">Blueboy96</a></p>
<p>I'm starting to think my initial idea is gonna work best--there are several instances where congressmen's district numbers changed even though their district boundaries didn't. For instance, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Conyers_bd70.html" title="John Conyers">John Conyers</a>' Detroit-based district was the 1st District from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, when it was renumbered the 14th District. And <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Gordon_383d.html" title="Bart Gordon">Bart Gordon</a>'s 6th District was numbered the 4th for many years until it became the 6th for <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>'s last term there (before Gordon took over). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboy96_de0a.html" title="User:Blueboy96">Blueboy96</a></p>
<p>I think your idea is unfeasible and problematic. Thanks to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesberry_v._Sanders_968a.html" title="Wesberry v. Sanders">Wesberry v. Sanders</a> all district boundaries are redrawn every 10 years. Districts may remain largely the same but they never remain exactly the same. Furthermore, saying that a particular district acted as a different district for a period of time is confusing and unhelpful. For example, the 2nd district of Texas IS the 2nd district of Texas, regardless of whether it covered a different area than it has historically during the period from 1967-2005. If you want to talk about Beaumont's congressional district than make that its own article. Would it be possible for you to change your Texas/Tennessee articles to conform with the standards that have been developed for other congressional districts - as in the 1st congressional district refers to the 1st congressional district and not a particular fixed area? Your histories of the districts are beautiful and I'd rather not have to get rid of most of them just because of a technicality. <a href="../../../b/j/o/User%7EBjoel5785_0ed0.html" title="User:Bjoel5785">Bjoel5785</a> 21 May 2006 23:10 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had to get you again for these reasons:<br />
1. John Kluge did not buy the Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. lock, stock, and barrel in 1958. Kluge purchased controlling interest in the stock and became the company's chairman.</p>
<p>2. Of the three New York independent stations, only WOR-TV was a national superstation. WPIX was not, but it is safe to say that both WPIX and WNEW-TV's reach were greatly expanded in the 1970s and '80s. The sentence you re-worded concerning this did not have to be changed.</p>
<p>3. News Corp. did purchase <i>all</i> of Metromedia's TV group in '86. As a condition to the sale, <a href="../../../w/c/v/WCVB-TV_177d.html" title="WCVB-TV">WCVB-TV</a> in Boston was spun-off to the Hearst Corporation (see the WCVB and <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Television_Stations_22d8.html" title="Fox Television Stations">Fox Television Stations</a> articles).</p>
<p>4. The sentence with the Clarke Ingram reference is a good one, except it doesn't belong here, but rather in the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox Broadcasting Company</a> article. In fact, its presence here makes it redundant.</p>
<p>5. Changes made to the Yankees baseball paragraph and the purchase of WWOR-TV and Chris-Craft did not have to be changed, either. And, it's just <b>WPIX</b>, with no <i>-TV</i> suffix.</p>

<dd>It later emerged that Peters had decided all along to join forces with his former National colleagues and had used his negotiations with Labour simply to win more concessions from Bolger.</dd>

<p>See the main article on <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_First_de0c.html" title="New Zealand First">New Zealand First</a>. Here's the exact quote:</p>
<p>New Zealand First entered into a period several weeks of negotiations with both major parties. Before the election, most people (including many New Zealand First voters) had expected Peters to enter into coalition with Labour. In fact, he appeared to promise not to align with National. It came as something of a surprise when he chose to join a coalition with National. The most common explanation for this decision involved National's willingness to accept New Zealand First's demands (and/or Labour's refusal to do so). However, Michael Laws (a former MP who served as a New Zealand First campaign manager) claims that Peters had secretly decided to go with National significantly before this time, and that he merely used negotiations with Labour to encourage more incentives from National.</p>

<p>Although I'll leave it in, I'm not entirely sure WWTV's cable carriage in Sudbury is <i>really</i> significant enough to be mentioned in the article (while it's by far the largest city that can actually view the station, it's still a fairly minor media market), but Sudbury absolutely doesn't have any connection to the other two stations. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 22:57, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please do not change the ABC/CBS affiliations again, as you have incorrectly placed them twice. The ABC affiliation left in 1953 to go to WSIX-TV 8, which is now WKRN 2, and is still the ABC affiliate. They dumped CBS in 1954, when WLAC-TV 5, now WTVF 5, signed on...and it is still the CBS affiliate. Also, there is NO SUCH THING as a "-AM" extension when referring to an AM radio station. AM is the default. Please do not keep adding the -AM to WSM. Your edits are incorrect. --<a href="../../../z/p/b/User%7EZpb52_d9a3.html" title="User:Zpb52">Zpb52</a> 16:16, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, according to WKRN's history page, it was the CBS affiliate with a secondary ABC affiliationfor a year after its sign-on as WSIX in 1953 before WLAC signed on in 1954. It's been a full ABC affiliate since then. <a href="http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=692140&amp;nav=menu5_15" class="external text" title="http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=692140&amp;nav=menu5_15" rel="nofollow">See for yourself.</a> <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboy96_de0a.html" title="User:Blueboy96">Blueboy96</a></li>

The number of members of the Social Credit caucus coming from English Canada was declining. Thompson refused to cede the leadership of the party to Caouette. This caused the party to split: most of the Quebec Members of Parliament(MPs) followed Caouette into his new Ralliement créditiste party in 1963." It doesn't say that Caouette on the leadership vote since, I think, the leader was elected by party members and not by the parlimanetary caucus. The Social Credit articlle says: "The party's Quebec wing, led by Réal Caouette, nevertheless had a major breakthrough in that province in the 1962 election, returning 26 Members of Parliament (MPs) from the province. Social Credit won only four seats from English Canada. Although Thompson made Caouette the party's deputy leader, the linguistic imbalance caused severe tensions in the Social Credit caucus. On September 9, 1963, the party split into English Canadian wing and a separate Quebec party led by Caouette - the Ralliement des créditistes." Neither article suggests that there was a fixed vote. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 14:53, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Stop reverting the Virgil Goode page unless you have some source tying Goode to Harry Byrd. The evidence you have cited is that Goode is 1) from the Southside 2) was "very conservative" (actually Goode's record as a Democrat, according to National Journal Rankings, was not all that conservative) 3) represents the Fifth District which had been represented by Byrd Democrats in the past.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:The cw.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>No, it does not link to a diambig page, BUT we should avoid redirects anyway. I mean, you should have at least done this: ((Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta)). However, why should you assume that Atlanta should be referred to without its state anyway? I mean, I think it is a bit arrogant to assume that everyone knows where Atlanta is. It is an encylopedia and should therefore be objective and should not make assumptions about one's base knowledge. --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch26_4a1c.html" title="User:Arch26">Arch26</a> 06:43, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hi, as long as I'm here, I'll resply to Arch26. It is Associated Press style, which is used in nearly all mainstream media, to use big city names without state names attached. That style rule applies to cities like Boston, Houston, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. On the other hand, if one wants to say Springfield, it is best to identify the state. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkywriter_749b.html" title="User:Skywriter">skywriter</a> 21:21, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, This pertains to your most recent edit of the John Lewis page. I do not understand this sentence and am hoping you can and will shed light. At the moment, it states: "His first run for elective office was in a 1977 special election for the 5th District, which resulted when Andrew Young was appointed as ambassador to the United Nations."</p>
<p>If Bond held that seat and left for the UN, then this sentence can not be true: "Lewis became the first African- American to represent Georgia in either house of Congress since Reconstruction."</p>
<p>Is there a missing beat?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Hello BlueBoy96, It is not clear why you reverted the John Lewis page to writing that is not easy to understand. The editing I did to the page yesterday removed the confusing language and passive voice, established chronology and used active voice. Please do not ignore this message or the message on the John Lewis Talk Page. The revision also removed the error that previously stated John Lewis was the first Afircan-American to represent Georgia. Please explain why you hve reverted this page to language that is difficult to understand. And Please explain why you deleted John Lewis's name from his autobiography. It violates Wiki ethos to revert a page without discussing it on the Talk page, in the editing summary, or reply to messages left on your Talk page. Thank you. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkywriter_749b.html" title="User:Skywriter">skywriter</a> 17:52, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. We were very surprised to see your edits to the WJCT entry, as they reinstate incorrect information without comment or citation.</p>
<p>The most significant is your reinstatement of language inappropriately promoting Gainesville’s station in the WJCT entry. Even though this language is part of the original entry, it has never been accurate. Further, your deduction that WJCT “recently” added new programming sources is incorrect. WJCT-TV has always broadcast programs from sources outside PBS, a fact which we can document with newspaper articles, programs guides and other print materials dating back to 1958.</p>
<p>We’re following the Wikipedia dispute resolution procedures, and getting in touch with you directly. What’s going on?</p>
<p>Hope to have a response soon. Wjctnews 20:42, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"This is bad form"? I looked at your last edit and it was full of run-on sentences and other stylistic errors. Not to mention a lot of information that was added on by you, in an effort to "make it easier to read" was stuff that really didn't belong. Some of the RKO General stuff you added can be found within the RKO General entry, so it shouldn't be included in WWOR-TV.</p>
<p>BTW, as I learned quite some time ago, being a New York station doesn't immediately ensure "flagship" status for a television network, especially if the station and the network aren't co-owned. So, on that basis alone, WWOR <b>was a flagship station</b> of UPN when Chris-Craft owned half of the network (1995-2000). For the <b>last six years</b> the <b>real flagship station</b> of UPN has been <b>WPSG in Philadelphia</b>, and WWOR has been an affiliate. The same will be said of WPIX when it joins CW in the fall.</p>
<p>I don't know wbout you, but I have several writing style guides at my disposal, and my revisions are both professional as well as Wikipedia-friendly.

<p>The recent rewrite of the WXYZ entry has been a researched and collaborative effort with current and former WXYZ employees and authored by a former WXYZer to give the station the credible entry it deserves. Certain elements including the station’s legal identity, Channel 7 of Detroit Inc, were included for searching criteria on the web. Your recent rewrites have given a certain misinterpretation to the events that have already been detailed by those who lived through them at the station. So it was disheartening to say the least that before this could be submitted for appreciation that a North Carolina user is editing a history that’s already been recorded in two recent books. There’s also been no explanation other than “clean-up” as to why elements and key figures in the basic history of the station have been deleted or re-worded. The timing is odd to say the least that its now drawn this attention. The references and text links were meant to focus on a heavily historied entity from the last 57 plus years. Listing coverage area was meant to present the coverage under certain grades of signal strength. The ABC divestiture and the hand over to Scripps have also been reinterpreted by too many users and the actual events as they relate to WXYZ have been assembled. The rewrite has also led to creating at least four other articles culled from pieces of personal, recorded and Wikipedia information using Wxyzdan. The article’s final wording was to be edited today until it kept getting injured (in poor form).</p>
<p>So please, for the future until the article is appreciated focus on your other endeavors.Wxyzdan 04:13, 20 March 2006 (UTC)WxyzdanWxyzdan 04:13, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look. I’m now trying to get the originator of this article to help edit it. Thanks for your overzealousness in contributing. But you are merely taking someone else’s work and changing them into your own phrasing and using extraneous details from other Wikipedia articles. That’s bold considering the time spent on phone calls, e-mails, over coffee and then actually culling through different books and mourged articles to assemble information for a credible reference for this station. You’ve taken our work and writing and transformed it into your own. It’s now (or was) actually harder to read with cluttered details, passive and phony tense phrasing and now incorrect details, dates and conceptions. You’ve tripled the number of sentences starting with “However” in one paragraph. Why is this article getting this attention (or vandalism) that it didn’t have before. A few photgos and editors didn’t know they weren’t working in the news department because it was only “six-man.” 40 years ago. That historical embellishment adds a misconception for a reference article. Bonds, who recently was hospitalized, started in ’64. He was at ‘Keener in 1963. The references and links are in there for readers to go to those articles. Adding extraneous stations from other Wikipedia information is cluttering the article. Now this is at least the third time that your ‘edits’ have lead to incorrect details-facts. As in WXYZ radio was not 1370. You also completely deleted the entire WXYZ radio article before it could be edited. That station maybe even more legendary then the TV station for all the successful nation programs it launched. We’d figure a true buff would have relished the inside details rather then… steal the work. Do you see Wxyzdan editing the English in your articles??? All this is going to an administrator.

Even when a district has voted for Democrats every election throughout its history, stating that the district will vote for the Democrat in the next election (when the candidates haven't even been named) doesn't adhere to Wikipedia policy. I'm all for describing a district as "heavily democratic" or the like, but predicting the outcome of an election goes too far. FYI, I'm a Democrat supporter like you, but my political persuasion (usually) takes a backseat <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and similar policies when editing here.

<li>You're right, there are districts where it appears safe that Democrats will continue to be elected. However, what if the Democrats nominate a candidate who is revealed to be a convicted pedophile the day before the election and a Republican wins? The entire South used to be an extremely safe area for Democrats . . . but that started to change 30-40 years ago and now essentially the opposite is true. My point is that no election's outcome is pre-determined, <i>especially</i> when the candidates haven't even been picked. Again, I think it's appropriate to say that a district has leaned Democratic for years, but predicting that it will remain so in an uncoming election violates Wikipedia policy. I encourage you to continue noting that certain districts lean one way or another, but without the predictive language. Happy editing. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 19:04, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Blueboy, I recently ran across an incorrect fact that you inserted into a couple of Wikipedia articles which unfortunately went uncorrected for an entire year. Seeing as how Wikipedia is often treated as an authoritative reference and even cited in newspaper articles and other sources that themselves become references, I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to abide by the Wikipedia policies concerning <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Just because you know something to be true does not meant that you can add it to a Wikipedia article. As the verifiability policy states: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. This means that we only publish material that is verifiable with reference to reliable, published sources" and "editors should cite reliable sources so that their edits may be verified by readers and other editors." Please read over both of these policies to make sure that your edits are not in violation. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 16:14, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The incorrect fact was the assertion that part of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentwood%2C_Tennessee_6359.html" title="Brentwood, Tennessee">Brentwood</a> lies in Davidson County. It looks like this was even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brentwood%2C_Tennessee&amp;diff=26548373&amp;oldid=22783517" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brentwood%2C_Tennessee&amp;diff=26548373&amp;oldid=22783517" rel="nofollow">corrected back in October</a>, but then you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brentwood%2C_Tennessee&amp;diff=42444228&amp;oldid=42280402" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brentwood%2C_Tennessee&amp;diff=42444228&amp;oldid=42280402" rel="nofollow">reinserted it</a> last month. It was also added to the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davidson_County%2C_Tennessee_16ce.html" title="Davidson County, Tennessee">Davidson County</a> article, which has been corrected. Obviously, this is not a very significant error, but without citing your sources, it's likely that a more significant error will happen in the future. Since many of the articles you edit are political topics, this is especially important to consider. Compare for example, the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Bredesen_394a.html" title="Phil Bredesen">Phil Bredesen</a> artice with the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Tornado_of_1998_a4a6.html" title="Nashville Tornado of 1998">Nashville Tornado of 1998</a> article. Nothing in the Phil Bredesen article is cited, so there's no way to know if any of it is true or not. In the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Tornado_of_1998_a4a6.html" title="Nashville Tornado of 1998">Nashville Tornado of 1998</a> article, however, almost every single word is cited, so it's easy to verify and to find out how reliable its sources are. As the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">John Seigenthaler incident</a> demonstrated, one bogus sentence can undermine the credibility of the entire encyclopedia.

<p>I bust your chops for your sometimes sloppy and unverifiable edits, but I'll give you an reply to your query: I've forgotten who replaced Jim Jensen on WCBS-TV (you've got to add that <i>-TV</i> suffix when discussing channel two in New York).

<p>Your recent edits border between helpful and sloppy. You keep forgetting that, when referring to WCBS Television, you've got to add the <i>-TV</i> suffix as many times as possible, because there is ALREADY a New York station using the WCBS calls -- on 880 AM. Also, please don't change "channel two" back to "WCBS" or "WCBS-TV", because the reader will know what "channel two" is referring to through reading the whole article. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollosmokes_a776.html" title="User:Rollosmokes">Rollosmokes</a> 06:16, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Blueboy, just writing to clarify a few things and clear up any lingering bad feeling. Did you interpret my comments as a personal attack? I am sincerely confused by what happened between me and the mediator, as I didn't intend a personal attack at all, and I seem to have been treated like a troll. For what it's worth, my sole intent was to bring the Wiki policy on original research to light on the discussion, and I was quite upfront that they were only tentative comments based on a first reading of the material. I found it quite ironic that it would be interpreted as a personal attack, since I am myself an ex-charismatic and naturally suspicious of charismatic groups like Every Nation.

<p>Just because, as you claim, "most newspapers--or at least my hometown one, the Charlotte Observer--refer to TV channels by number rather than spelling them out", that does not mean that the practice is correct STYLISTICALLY. Most style guides will tell you that <b>single-digit numbers should be written in WORD FORM, not numerically.</b> Of course, newspapers do what they want because of space limitations. And, last time I checked, Wikipedia is **not** a newspaper.</p>
<p>BTW, WTNH <i><b>has</b></i> ID'd themselves as <b>WTNH-TV</b> in the past. That's what the call letters were officially changed to back in 1971.

<li>OK, what Bjoel is saying makes sense to a degree, but I don't think it prevents you from adding the histories. Yes, district boundaries change (and districts are eliminated) constantly. However, I disagree with him/her that the history section of district articles must only discuss the history of the numerical district (even if it has moved from one side of the state to the other). To the contrary, it should discuss the history of the numerical district (its location, boundaries, etc.) but also the political history of the locale in which it is currently located (i.e. party patterns, past representatives for the same area, etc.), perhaps drawing a distinction between the two histories through separate subsection headings. Bjoel's approach is far too narrow for a resource like Wikipedia that can update its articles instantly when districts are redrawn, it really only makes sense for a paper encyclopedia. Anyway, perhaps I'll message Bjoel and I'll see where these standards for district articles he/she refers to are, if they're actually written anywhere. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 18:30, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>It doesn't prevent him from adding the histories. My problem was with Blueboy96 presenting the history of Memphis' district as the only history of the 9th district so I edited it to reflect the actual history of the 9th district. The addition of the history of a Memphis seat is fine but couldn't be done for every geographical area in the country and is therefore limited. For example, what about Fayette and Tipton counties? I would guess that sometimes they've been a part of Memphis' congressional district and other times they haven't. Is someone going to write their congressional histories? Of course not. The numerical approach is the only approach that succesfully covers all geographical areas throughout an entire state's history. This doesn't preclude a secondary history of a particular geographical area in addition to the history of the numerical district. - <a href="../../../b/j/o/User%7EBjoel5785_0ed0.html" title="User:Bjoel5785">Bjoel5785</a> 12:17, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you want to document the histories of various city's congressional representatives, do it in articles such as Politics of Memphis and Politics of Nashville, not in the numerical congressional district articles. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 23:41, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would work for a big city like Memphis, Nashville or Charlotte--but for all 435 districts? That just isn't realistic. My original compromise--putting the seat histories in the current occupants' articles--probably works best. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboy96_de0a.html" title="User:Blueboy96">Blueboy96</a> 21:51, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Those 435 districts are temporary. They do not have historical geographic boundaries that are consistant. Your ideas are rather baffling to me. What is the purpose that you are trying to accomplish? If you're wanting to give historical context to current elections, then create an article like 2004 Tennessee 3th Congressional District election and put in a paragraph about how Southeastern Tennessee (or whatever) has traditionally been respresented by Republicans. If you just want to document who has represented a certain county or city or square mile of rural countryside, create a Politics of Wherever article. If we did actually attempt to create 435 lists of who has historically represented the current political boundaries of 435 different districts (which is arguably impossible and in many cases would include 2 or more people at the same time), we would have to scrap all the lists and start over every 10 years. Is that really what you want to do? What's wrong with creating a Politics of Blah County article for every county? Wouldn't that theoretically be comprehensive? And you could actually build on each list indefinitely instead of having to move or recreate them every ten years. Really, all of the information you have been adding about the history of congressional districts should be put in Politics of Wherever articles. Congressional districts only exist for 10 years at a time. They do not have "histories", at least not histories with reliable continuity. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 20:28, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm reverting the date the station began identifying itself back to 2005. While I don't doubt that you may have heard the station refer to itself as CBS5, for those of us from the SF Area who watch regularly, there was no real effort by the station to rebrand itself until after it dropped the "Everywhere" tagline (2004), edited the news open (2005), shut down the PIX Page (2005), and launched cbs5.com (2005). Before cbs5.com was launched, pretty much all on air station promotion referred to the station as KPIX-TV Channel 5. If you can find something more concrete, please feel free to comment and change it back.

<p>This is not meant to be a harsh criticism of your work, which is great for the most part. But, as I have mentioned to you before, you're edits and additions are inconsistent in quality. Sometimes you make changes in style and tone when words are changed and other grammatical errors are overlooked. You also tend to add some information that sounds repetitive and redundant, and sometimes just doesn't belong in a particular article. Some examples:</p>
<p>On WCAU-TV:<br />
<i>"CBS decided to affiliate with channel 3 and sell channel 10, ending a 47-year relationship (and three-and-a-half decades of ownership). This decision appeared to make little sense on paper. WCAU was a solid runner-up to longtime ratings leader WPVI-TV, while KYW had been a very distant third for more than a decade."</i></p>
<p>I changed that back because: 1) like I've told you before, <u>single-digit numbers should be written in <b>WORD FORM</b>, not numerical form</u> (geez, I sound like a broken record), a fact that you will find in almost all style guides; and 2) the mention of the deal making "little sense on paper" sounds like it is non-NPOV.</p>
<p><i>"NBC's motivation was obvious -- it saw a chance to get an owned-and-operated in Philadelphia, which it had sought since the 1950s. New World had recently partnered with Fox and planned on turning WCAU into a Fox affiliate, as it was with almost all of its stations. New World found the chance to win its new partner a VHF station in the nation's 4th-largest market too much to resist...Fox planned to move all of its programming to WCAU, while New World planned to keep Fox Kids on WTXF..."</i></p>
<p>Reasons for my reverting this paragraph: 1) Your revision <i>implies</i> that NBC had sought to get a Philadelphia TV station of its own for more than 40 years, when they already had one previously -- NBC owned channel three from 1956-65, as it is mentioned later in this article (and also in <a href="../../../k/y/w/KYW_%28AM%29_4e58.html" title="KYW (AM)">KYW (AM)</a>, <a href="../../../k/y/w/KYW-TV_1e2b.html" title="KYW-TV">KYW-TV</a>, <a href="../../../w/k/y/WKYC-TV_e2cf.html" title="WKYC-TV">WKYC-TV</a> and <a href="../../../w/t/a/WTAM_%28AM%29_1be9.html" title="WTAM (AM)">WTAM</a>); 2) the "New World found the chance to win its new partner a VHF station in the nation's 4th-largest market too much to resist" line was already used in <a href="../../../w/p/s/WPSG_426c.html" title="WPSG">WPSG</a>, and it should stay in one article or the other, but not both; and 3) the mention of Fox children's programming moving to WCAU is pretty much useless at this point.</p>
<p>I had similar problems with your WPSG revisions, but I see you have redone some of them, and they read better than the previous ones. Even when I reverted, I've kept kept some of your additions. So, unlike our friend CoolKatt number 99999, don't get offended if I revert or modify you. As I see it, it's all professional, and I don't get offended when someone does it to me. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollosmokes_a776.html" title="User:Rollosmokes">Rollosmokes</a> 18:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently added more information on <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_W_583c.html" title="Group W">Group W</a> regarding the history of its radio and TV station operations. However, I feel the need to clarify my reasoning for reverting your recent edits:</p>
<p>1. Irrelevant information in regards to this article include: a) WEWS and WXYZ-TV being Scripps-Howard's largest stations; b) WEWS being the original CBS station in Cleveland; and c) WJZ-TV being the third station to affiliate with ABC. This line belongs within the WJZ-TV article itself.</p>
<p>2. The line <i>"Under the terms of the deal, CBS bought a minority share of Group W's television stations while Group W bought a minority share of CBS' owned-and-operated television stations"</i>, is incorrect. The original agreement created a new station division which would be MAJORITY-OWNED (55 percent, IIRC) by Westinghouse, with CBS as minority owner (45 percent). This is the division under which KCNC-TV, KUTV, and WFOR-TV were placed following the NBC-CBS/Group W/WCAU-TV trade. KYW-TV was also part of this division, as CBS purchased a minority share in that station. It wasn't until the 1996 acquisition of CBS by Westinghouse that ALL of the two companies' stations became one.</p>
<p>3. As far as the Miami portion of the swap, WCIX/WFOR-TV was a <b>NEW PURCHASE</b> for Group W, even though they only owned 55 percent of the station initially.</p>
<p>As always, you have reworded sentences unnecessarily, along with adding too much information. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollosmokes_a776.html" title="User:Rollosmokes">Rollosmokes</a> 14:41, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had to remove the mention of WMAQ and WBBM being sister stations as a result of the merger.

<dd>I also changed the line <i>"Except for KYW-TV, the five stations that comprised the core of Group W's television unit for most of its existence were strong performers in their respective markets, usually ranking first or second in the ratings."</i> I took out the KYW-TV reference, because they were a top-ranked station during the 1970s, mostly because of <i>Eyewitness News</i>.

<p>I understand that you're not from the New York area, so trust me when I tell you these things:</p>
<p>1) The correct spelling is DIANNE Doctor (and <a href="http://wcbstv.com/press/local_story_025165612.html" class="external text" title="http://wcbstv.com/press/local_story_025165612.html" rel="nofollow">here's proof</a>). The accompianing article was also corrected to emphasize this fact.</p>
<p>2) Also, I had to eliminate the paragraph <i>"Many of WCBS-TV's personalities during this time were New York television legends in their own right..."</i>, mostly because to tag the label "legends" on them, with the exception of Frank Field and perhaps Rolland Smith and Warner Wolf, is a pretty strong pronouncement. Carol Martin and Michelle Marsh may come close, but they're not as revered as Sue Simmons (certainly not in terms of longevity). Dave Marash's time in New York was a blip. And Tony Guida has worked at other places before and after WCBS-TV. Because they're well-known local personalities, that doesn't make them automatic "legends".</p>

<p>Not that your changes weren't relevant, but they were all redundant and did not need to be expanded further. Most of what you revised -- especially that CBS/ABC thing you put in there -- can be considered speculation. In reality, there was no way either of those two networks were going to switch from a powerful VHF station to a low-rated UHF. I seriously doubt that any discussions between Thomas Television (the original owners of WATR-TV) and CBS or ABC even took place.</p>
<p>One thing I've learned is that you shouldn't overwrite sometimes, as you can veer off the main focus of your story, or in this case, write something that reeks of manufactured speculation. NBC had its reasons for staying with channel 30 all of those years, and the Thomas family had their reasons for selling channel 20 after losing NBC. Now, unless you've done some research into what those reasons **were**, then let's add it. Otherwise, keep it short and simple. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollosmokes_a776.html" title="User:Rollosmokes">Rollosmokes</a> 06:05, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, this article has enough problems right now with the "tug-o'-war" between myself, CFIF, and CoolKatt (who has filed a token RfC against CFIF upon returning from his 24-hour block).</p>
<p>I had to revert again because you are still over-expanding in areas that don't need to be expanded further (i.e. the Fox/Chris-Craft merger and the ramifications of the UPN-WB merger on the Fox-owned UPN stations), writing redundant information (no need for <i>"Its transmitter, for instance, remained at the World Trade Center along with the other major New York stations"</i>), and adding inaccurate information (for the actual timeline of General Tire's expansion into broadcasting, <a href="http://www.bossradioforever.com/html/rko.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bossradioforever.com/html/rko.html" rel="nofollow">see this page</a>).

<p>First, I won't doubt the actual date of commencing operations. Secondly, the mention of the rebranding to <i>KYW-3</i> was already mentioned in the news operation section (redundancy). And, thirdly, no matter which way you say it -- whether it's Westinghouse who moved or KYW-TV that moved from Cleveland to Philly, it's still the same thing.</p>
<p>Nitpicking...you keep changing single-digit numbers written as a word to a number. This is incorrect from a stylistic point, as I've said to you before.

<p>You deleted the following from the NC Constitution article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 2, sections 3 &amp; 5, sub-section two states that <i>No county shall be divided in the formation of a representative district.</i> This provision is known as the "Whole County Provision." However, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Justice_619c.html" title="United States Department of Justice">federal Justice Department</a> ruled that this provision was inconsistent with the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Voting_Rights_Act_e309.html" title="Voting Rights Act">Voting Rights Act</a>. The state thus ignored the Whole County Provision until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. That year, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_Supreme_Court_a886.html" title="North Carolina Supreme Court">North Carolina Supreme Court</a> ruled that the state constitution's equal protection clause presumed single-member districts and was thus a limitation on the Whole County Provision. It can also be argued that the "one person, one vote" rule from <i><a href="../../../r/e/y/Reynolds_v._Sims_c07f.html" title="Reynolds v. Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a></i> also limits this provision.</li>

<p>No nitpicking this time...</p>
<p>...Geez, I had no idea that old man Bahakel has passed on. So one would assume the possible break-up of Bahakel Broadcasting is a conditional, posthumous occurance? And, are there any other parties interested in WCCB?</p>
<p>Now, to your original request: it's gonna take a lot more than a petition for the current FCC to even consider pulling Sinclair/Cunningham/Glencarin's licenses. As long as the present climate prevails, I think we'll see the Fairness Doctrine return in some form before Sinclair loses any television station license.

<p>I revised your recent changes for these reasons:</p>
<p>1) There was no need to change the wording describing the grandfathered protection situation between channel six and Cincinnati's WKRC-TV under Taft ownership. There was no need to expand the addendum on WLWC/WCMH-TV being in similar circumstances under Crosley/Avco ownership, as that can be explained in the <a href="../../../w/c/m/WCMH-TV_72f0.html" title="WCMH-TV">WCMH-TV</a> entry.</p>
<p>2) Also, though most of us familiar with the inner workings of television and radio know what a "Grade B" signal contour is, let's assume that the majority of Wikipedia readers DO NOT KNOW what it implies. Using the term "overlapping signals" or something similar, while it means essentially the same thing, is better for the broadcasting novice who may come across these articles.</p>
<p>3) As far as the duopoly situation goes, I corrected the number of full-power stations from eight to six -- noncommercial stations don't count. So I resimplified that sentence again to reflect this. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollosmokes_a776.html" title="User:Rollosmokes">Rollosmokes</a> 14:36, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>BB,</p>
<p>The purchase of the Yankee Network didn't give General a 25% stake in MBS--that's a big-time mistake. The best available evidence indicates 6%. I've never seen any evidence that the purchase of Bamberger gave General a 75% share of MBS--the most reliable available sourcing indicates that it was probably 56%. See Thomas Porter Robinson, <i>Radio Networks and the Federal Government</i> (New York: Arno Press, 1979 [1943]), 28–29. As the relevant note explains in detail, Kuhlmann did not "recommend" General's licenses be stripped, he ruled that they be stripped. And so forth. You're either using Wikipedia articles as sources (you should know that's a no-no) or simply regurgitating mistaken online info without doing a scratch of real research. I'd really like to assume good faith, but (a) I've had to correct your errors for a fourth time now, (b) you never provide a single source for any changes you make, and (c) you completely disdain the edit summary.

<p>I concur with JeffPW's concerns about your edit of the Tillie Fowler article. I admit that I'm not totally objective, having served as her Chief of Staff. But that is why I haven't objected to other edits from "objective" contributors. I'm not so sure all of your edits lead me to believe they were made without a political agenda or motivation. I also don't understand why you minimized her service as Chairman of the Defense Policy Board. It's one of the most influential positions in the Pentagon, and she was the first woman ever to serve as Chairman. Finally, it is not correct to say that Tillie was the first Republican woman elected to the House "in her own right." While Ileana did fill out the remainder of Claude Pepper's term when he died, she did so after winning a special election. She was "elected in her own right" to the seat - it just wasn't in November. You can't really even say Tillie was the first Republican woman to be elected to a full term in the U.S. House since Ileana was also elected to a full term in the 1992 regular general election.

<p>If you could read the entry you were editing, you would see that it is not discussing the Toronto Hockey Club, better known today as the NHA's Toronto Blue Shirts, but rather the NHL team that used the Blue Shirts players and were also called the Blue Shirts for one season before becoming the Toronto Arenas. This is the team that went on to become the Leafs. I know your edits are made in good faith, but you often replace verifiable information with content that is inaccurate or ahistorical. Maybe you could try raising questions on discussion pages. --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalor_a501.html" title="User:Walor">Walor</a> 21:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
