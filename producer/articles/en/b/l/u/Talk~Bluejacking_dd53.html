    No it shouldn't.

    Because that's not true.

<p>"<b>Some people think that the term bluejacking comes from Bluetooth and hijacking. While that certainly sounds logical, a bluejacker doesn't hijack anything</b>: he or she merely uses a feature on the sender and the recipient's device. Both parties remain in absolute control over their devices, and a bluejacker will not be able to take over your phone or steal your personal information. It should be noted that "jack" on many college campuses means "to pull a prank"- to jack a dorm would be to pull a trick or prank them. This too may be the origins of bluejacking."</p>
<p>There are many definitions of 'hijack'. This section of the article sounds like it's trying to avoid and rationalize-away some of the negative connotations associated with 'hijacking' (that much more negative after 2001 and the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moussaoui.html" title="Moussaoui">Moussaoui</a> headlines). Besides, who's to say that bluejacking isn't, by extension, a portmanteau with 'hijacking' if 'jack' (as it's <i>supposedly</i> used on college campuses) is derived from 'hijacking'? The section offers suggestions which is good, but no sources and appears biased and defensive. -<a href="../../../s/n/p/User%7ESnpoj_2b04.html" title="User:Snpoj">Snpoj</a> 21:39, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But as Blue (BlueTooth) jacking (high jacking) is where someone else access a remote bluetooth device and can either steel delete or currupt data it is indeed hijacking information this valadates the term "BlueJacking"</p>

<p>"But as Blue (BlueTooth) jacking (high jacking) is where someone else access a remote bluetooth device and can either steel delete or currupt data it is indeed hijacking information this valadates the term "BlueJacking""</p>
<p>but that is wrong. Bluejacking is not about stealing or even accessing information on somebodys phone but rather is involved with sending fun anonymous messages. The act of stealing information is called bluesnarfing and is something else altogether. Visit www.bluejackq.com/phpbb2 for more information.</p>

<p>The Bluejacking community might recognise a difference between the two, in a similar way to the hacker community's differentiation between hacker (good) and cracker (bad), but the public see just hacker (bad), and in a similar vein, they see bluejacking (bad). Certainly, the British media have latched onto BlueJacking as bad, not surprisingly, given that the reported incidents here are quite disturbing in their nature (akin to stalking).</p>
<p>The article is terribly pro-bluejacking, with an almost denial of any negative connotations, and needs changing. IRSWalker 14:29, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The public and media have only recently started to view bluejacking as bad. A couple of years ago when the craze started the media was full of it and saw it as a harmless bit of fun. It is only now, that more and more people are learning about bluetooth and using it that the media is picking up on the negatiove side of things. But these people who send violent or upsetting images are not bluejackers in the known sense of the word. Bluejackers want nothing more than to have a bit of fun and online bluejackers actually have a code of conduct that they try and follow.</p>
<p>Other people who know nothing of what bluejacking is, are indeed bullying and harassing people but the rest of the bluejacking community should not be tarred with the same brush. (History shows this was posted by anonymous user User:81.155.154.7)</p>
<p>While hijacking implies taking over control forcibly, this is more like a mobile version of unwanted spam. (unsigned)</p>
<p><br />
I think there are various misunderstandings here - "bluejacking" itself is neither good nor bad, it's just something you can do with a bluetooth phone. It's not harmful to the phone itself, and doesn't have to be harmful (and often isn't harmful) to the owners of those phones either. Yes you could "stalk" someone via bluejacking, but equally you could do the same thing via text message - and I'd be surprised to find an article on SMS messaging reflecting the dangerous undertones of the medium.</p>
<p>As an aside, the term "bluejacking" is often assumed to be derived from hijacking, but it's at least equally derived from "Ajack", which just happened to be the username of the poster on the Esato forum that discovered the concept and perpretated the first successful (and entirely lighthearted) bluejack. The name (bluejack) was coined on that very forum, by another poster, partly in Ajack's honour. 194.130.108.105 17:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)Boinng</p>

<p>I trimmed out references to "the best" and "the first" since there's no support provided for these very partisan phrases. I'll leave other POV issues to those who know more about the subject. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldlover_1934.html" title="User:Arnoldlover">Arnoldlover</a> 18:44, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
