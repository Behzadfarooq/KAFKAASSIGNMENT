<p>The Blue Network can, in one sense, date itself to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>, when the <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">Radio Corporation of America</a> acquired <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC_%28AM%29_ed3a.html" title="WABC (AM)">WJZ</a>, Newark from <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westinghouse.html" title="Westinghouse">Westinghouse</a> (which had created the station in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>) and moved it to New York City in May of that year. When RCA commenced operations of <a href="../../../w/r/c/WRC-TV_2d13.html" title="WRC-TV">WRC</a>, Washington on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, 1923, the root of a network was born, though it did not operate under the name by which it would later become known. Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod states that it would not be until <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a> that the "Radio Group" formally began network operations. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The core stations of the "Radio Group" were RCA's stations WJZ and WRC, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westinghouse_Electric_%281886%29_f240.html" title="Westinghouse Electric (1886)">Westinghouse</a> station <a href="../../../w/b/z/WBZ-TV_314a.html" title="WBZ-TV">WBZ</a>, then in <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield%2C_Massachusetts_5ba1.html" title="Springfield, Massachusetts">Springfield</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="../../../w/g/y/WGY_eb29.html" title="WGY">WGY</a>, the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> station in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schenectady%2C_New_York_d0a0.html" title="Schenectady, New York">Schenectady</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>RCA's principal rival prior to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a> was the radio broadcasting department of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Telephone_%26_Telegraph_Company_5c76.html" title="American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company">American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company</a>. AT&amp;T, starting in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, had been using this department as a test-bed for equipment being designed and manufactured by its <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Electric_c798.html" title="Western Electric">Western Electric</a> subsidiary.</p>
<p>The RCA stations operated at a significant disadvantage to its rival chain; AT&amp;T used its own high-quality transmission lines, and declined to lease them out to competing entities, forcing RCA to use the telegraph lines of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Union_7e9b.html" title="Western Union">Western Union</a>, which were not as well calibrated to voice transmission as the AT&amp;T lines. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the WJZ network sought to compete toe-to-toe with the AT&amp;T network, which was built around WEAF (today's <a href="../../../w/f/a/WFAN_d25c.html" title="WFAN">WFAN</a>). For example, both stations sent announcer teams to cover the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924_Democratic_National_Convention_1e34.html" title="1924 Democratic National Convention">1924 Democratic National Convention</a>, which was held in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Promotional material produced in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> claimed certain "firsts" in broadcasting by WJZ, such as the first educational music program in April <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, the first <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> broadcasts in 1922, and the first complete opera broadcast, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flying_Dutchman_%28opera%29_27a3.html" title="The Flying Dutchman (opera)">The Flying Dutchman</a></i>, from the Manhattan Opera House. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a> (as well as its consortium partners <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">General Electric</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westinghouse_Electric_%281886%29_f240.html" title="Westinghouse Electric (1886)">Westinghouse</a> <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>) were to receive a break in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, when <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Telephone_%26_Telegraph_Company_5c76.html" title="American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company">AT&amp;T</a> made a corporate decision to exit the broadcasting business and focus on its telecommunications business.</p>
<p>The first step by AT&amp;T was to create the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting_Company_of_America_8c6e.html" title="Broadcasting Company of America">Broadcasting Company of America</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, 1926, to hold its broadcasting assets. As reported in the press, this move was due to the growth in the radio broadcasting activities of AT&amp;T and the special issues related thereto,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> though it would appear that subsequent activities in disposing of the assets of BCA may have also played a role in the decision. AT&amp;T did in fact subsequently sell <a href="../../../w/f/a/WFAN_d25c.html" title="WFAN">WEAF</a> to RCA for $1 million in July 1926,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> a price that newspaper reports indicated was a substantial premium over what other stations were commanding in the marketplace,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> and represented a recognition of the status of WEAF in broadcasting, as well as its access to AT&amp;T's lines. Indeed, the negotiations for the sale may have taken place very shortly after the creation of BCA, as Folder 129 in the NBC History Files at the Library of Congress contains a contract of sale for WEAF dated July 1, 1926. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oakland_Tribune_235c.html" title="The Oakland Tribune">The Oakland Tribune</a></i> stated that 4/5ths of the purchase price of WEAF could be attributed to good-will and the line access. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> On July 28, 1926, the Washington Post reported in a front-page story that RCA had acquired <a href="../../../w/c/a/WCAP_%28BCA%29_44fd.html" title="WCAP (BCA)">WCAP</a>. <i>The Oakland Tribune</i> reported the same day <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> that WCAP had departed the field, and <a href="../../../w/r/c/WRC-TV_2d13.html" title="WRC-TV">WRC</a> would be operating on the frequency that they had shared, which was 640 AM.</p>
<p>As part of the reorganization of the broadcasting assets in the wake of the acquisitions, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, 1926, the formation of the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a> was announced via newspaper advertisements, and on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">November 15</a>, 1926 NBC's first broadcast was made. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> This first broadcast on November 15, 1926 marked the de facto formation by NBC of the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html#Red_.26_Blue_Networks" title="NBC">Red Network</a> from the WEAF network assets, using WEAF as the "key station"; this network in eventual popular image tended to broadcast the most popular entertainment programming. RCA merged its former radio operations into NBC, and on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC_%28AM%29_ed3a.html" title="WABC (AM)">WJZ</a> became the "key station" of the Blue Network when its network switch operations began <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>; this network, again in eventual popular image, tended to place its focus more on news and public affairs programming, as well as the "sustaining," or non-sponsored shows.</p>
<p>The <i>Decatur Review</i> (<a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>) for Sunday, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_12.html" title="December 12">December 12</a>, 1926 reported the following in an article describing a broadcast to be sponsored by the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Talking_Machine_Company_0eba.html" title="Victor Talking Machine Company">Victor Talking Machine Company</a> and aired the following New Year's Day, January 1, 1927, which is a description of this first Blue Network broadcast -- note that it makes it clear that January 1, 1927 marked the debut of the Blue Network:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"TWO BIG NETWORKS: The network to be used for the first concert will consist of a combination of chains of stations affiliated with <a href="../../../w/f/a/WFAN_d25c.html" title="WFAN">WEAF</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC_%28AM%29_ed3a.html" title="WABC (AM)">WJZ</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a>. It is also announced that this opening Victor program inaugurates a new chain system to be operated by the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a>, with WJZ as the "key" station. This new chain, which will be known as the "blue" network, will allow simultaneous broadcasting from WJZ through <a href="../../../w/b/z/WBZ-TV_314a.html" title="WBZ-TV">WBZ</a>, Springfield and Boston, <a href="../../../k/d/k/KDKA_%28AM%29_a701.html" title="KDKA (AM)">KDKA</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>, and <a href="../../../k/y/w/KYW_%28AM%29_4e58.html" title="KYW (AM)">KYW</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. For broadcasting of the first program, therefore, the "blue" network will be joined with the "red" network, as the WEAF chain is designated, as well as other stations in various cities. Following the New Year's night program, the concerts will be given bi-monthly, through the "blue" nework (...)"<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allegedly, the colour designations came from the way the networks were represented on maps, with red lines (or pushpins) denoting the WEAF network circuits, and blue the WJZ circuits. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Red and Blue Networks shared from a common pool of engineers and facilities <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup>, and would, on occasion, broadcast the same events. There are two early examples, from the biggest news events of 1927. On June 20, 1927, both of the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> networks covered the return of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> to America from his trans-Atlantic flight, star announcer <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_McNamee_d21c.html" title="Graham McNamee">Graham McNamee</a> doing the honors. Three months later, a combined hookup of 67 stations on the two networks presented the second <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Dempsey_2f5f.html" title="Jack Dempsey">Dempsey</a>-<a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Tunney_60bc.html" title="Gene Tunney">Tunney</a> fight, broadcast by McNamee and NBC colleague Phillips Carlin.

<p>A slightly later example of cooperation came on the evening of Sunday, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, when the famed "Laird of the Music Halls," <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Harry_Lauder_5e7f.html" title="Sir Harry Lauder">Sir Harry Lauder</a>, appeared on a coast-to-coast hookup that originated from <a href="../../../k/f/i/KFI_3b7e.html" title="KFI">KFI</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> (later an NBC Red station, but at this time part of NBC's West Coast "Orange Network"), but was distributed by <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC_%28AM%29_ed3a.html" title="WABC (AM)">WJZ</a>, which, as noted, was the key station of the Blue Network; advertisements suggest that certain NBC Red stations, as well as stations in the Orange Network, supplemented the network. A description of this broadcast is contained in a <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a> pamphlet put out by the Enna Jettick Shoe Company <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup>; Enna Jettick sponsored the first of Lauder's performances that night on its "Enna Jettick Melodies" show, which was followed later by another performance during the time ordinarily used by the "Collier's Radio Hour". <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>At least as late as January of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, in spite of the fact that by this time NBC was seeking to differentiate the images of its NBC Red and NBC Blue networks (see below), it would still arrange for special, joint broadcasts, such as a special two-hour presentation of the "Magic Key of RCA" musical program (normally an NBC Blue program, sponsored by RCA's Victor records division) entitled "Salute to 1939." <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ironically, even though the Blue Network generally was not given the more popular programs, it was the network that broadcast <i><a href="../../../a/m/o/Amos_%27n_Andy_0427.html" title="Amos 'n Andy">Amos 'n Andy</a></i> at the height of its popularity in the early <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, when on average over half of the nation's radio audience would tune into the show. <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> During the 1932-1933 season, Standard Oil of New Jersey (<a href="../../../e/s/s/Esso.html" title="Esso">Esso</a>) sponsored an unusual program, the Five-Star Theatre, which each weeknight presented a show in a different format. The marquee show in this cycle was <i><a href="../../../f/l/y/Flywheel%2C_Shyster_and_Flywheel_8d29.html" title="Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel">Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel</a></i>, which starred <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groucho_Marx_8301.html" title="Groucho Marx">Groucho Marx</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chico_Marx_ad81.html" title="Chico Marx">Chico Marx</a>. Considering the show's relatively early (7.30 p.m. ET) time slot, it did rather well in the ratings <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup>, but it could not compete with the much stronger ratings produced by Esso's arch-rival <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texaco.html" title="Texaco">Texaco</a>, which sponsored <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Wynn_c487.html" title="Ed Wynn">Ed Wynn</a> on NBC Red, and the show ended after one year. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>More commonly, the Blue Network would operate as a quasi-"farm team" for the Red Network, in terms of entertainment programs. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hope_c9fc.html" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> (in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> and again in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>), <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Benny_3ec2.html" title="Jack Benny">Jack Benny</a> (in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>), <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibber_McGee_and_Molly_9569.html" title="Fibber McGee and Molly">Fibber McGee and Molly</a> (in 1935), and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information%2C_Please%21_b557.html" title="Information, Please!">Information, Please!</a> (in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>) are all examples of shows that debuted on the Blue Network before eventually transitioning over to larger audiences on the Red Network. <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>On occasion, shows would make brief stops at NBC Blue before moving elsewhere, such as the <a href="../../../l/u/x/Lux_Radio_Theatre_062a.html" title="Lux Radio Theatre">Lux Radio Theatre</a> (1934-5) and Will Rogers' program (1933), both of which would move to CBS.</p>

<p>At some level, the Blue Network was known in the late 1920s and early 1930s for its children's programming. There are at least two volumes extant, from a Akron-based publishing house <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup>, which are collections of stories which purport to have been part of Blue Network programs. A copy of one, in the collection of E.O. Costello, shows a cover with two children listening to a late <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>-style radio, from which shimmering images of fairy-tale characters are emerging. Other than the title (and the radio on the cover), the precise nature of the ties to the Blue Network is not known; the book does not even make direct reference to the National Broadcasting Company. It can also be said that this is an indication that the Blue Network had a well-established identity of its own by <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>. <sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>The descriptions of the material contained in the NBC History Files at the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> appear to indicate that at some level, there was discontent with the way <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> was managing the Blue Network vis a vis the Red Network. For example, one folder in the NBC History Files <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> contains a three-page letter dated <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> from station <a href="../../../w/s/y/WSYR_%28AM%29_9f1f.html" title="WSYR (AM)">WSYR</a> in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_New_York_b662.html" title="Syracuse, New York">Syracuse</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, which complains of the neglect of the Blue Network in favor of the Red Network. This point can said to be reinforced firstly by a memorandum dated <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup>, in which the Blue complained about its lack of access to broadcasts of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>, and secondly by a letter dated shortly after that, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, 1935 <sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup>, which is a communication from Hearst Radio complaining that <i><a href="../../../a/m/o/Amos_%27n_Andy_0427.html" title="Amos 'n Andy">Amos 'n Andy</a></i> and the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Pearce_b06a.html" title="Al Pearce">Al Pearce</a> programs had been moved from the Blue Network to the Red Network, and complaining in general about the weakness of the Blue's programming. Indeed, the NBC History Files contain <sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[33]</a></sup> a February <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> in-house memorandum so caustic of the performance of the Blue Network that the author's name was redacted from the document.</p>
<p>A significant issue with the NBC Blue Network may have been its size. It started, in January of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, with 7 stations, had grown to 17 by the end of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, but still had only 33 stations by <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>. <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[34]</a></sup> This would have made it significantly smaller than its rivals. In 1938, Mutual had 107 affiliates, and CBS had 114; the Blue Network, by contrast, was not able to blanket the United States when NBC Red sold out its time, with the result that during 1937-1938, the Blue Nework's revenues were generally falling, while NBC Red's increased. <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup> Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod has noted that as of 1938, NBC had 23 stations in its core "Basic Red" group, and 24 in its "Basic Blue" group, with 107 stations that could be Red or Blue depending on the needs of a sponsor <sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup>; the relative ratings (and thus revenues) for NBC Red programs versus NBC Blue counterparts suggests that sponsors chose to use Red more often than Blue.</p>

<p>Perhaps more in line with the common perception of the Blue Network as a smaller, but more high-brow and public affairs-centered network <sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup>, was the fact that it was the original home of the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_Symphony_Orchestra_3c9e.html" title="NBC Symphony Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> broadcasts, led by Maestro <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arturo_Toscanini_150d.html" title="Arturo Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup>. In a similar vein, one of the Blue Network's longest running programs was <i>America's Town Meeting of the Air</i>, a current-affairs discussion program. <sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> Both <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowell_Thomas_ee22.html" title="Lowell Thomas">Lowell Thomas</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Winchell_cbeb.html" title="Walter Winchell">Walter Winchell</a>'s news programs were also broadcast over the Blue Network.

</div>
<p>Along with the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_Symphony_Orchestra_3c9e.html" title="NBC Symphony Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> broadcasts, the broadcasts of the performances of the Metropolitan Opera Company were part of the "crown jewels" of NBC Blue. A sober, dignified pamphlet issued by the network in 1937 <sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> stated that the broadcasts were under <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a> sponsorship, and "[t]hrough the medium of nationwide NBC Network broadcasting, Grand Opera has been given to the entire nation. No longer is it reserved for the privileged few -- now even the most isolated listeners throughout the United States are able to enjoy the world's finest music at their own firesides. The National Broadcasting Company (...) is proud to be the means of bringing the Metropolitan Opera to American radio listeners." The pamphlet notes that 78 stations broadcast these opera performances in 1937, and that reception for the program was "nationwide," something moderately unusual for an NBC Blue broadcast.</p>
<p>Radio historian Elizabeth McLeod has suggested, aside from a brief period where NBC Red and NBC Blue had different chime-sequences in the late <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> and early 1930s, the two networks were *not* differentiated for many years, which would certainly be consistent with the roster of shows described above. She points out, with some justice, that NBC Red also broadcast a number of high-brow programs such as the <i>Voice of Firestone</i>, <i>The Atwater Kent Hour</i>, and the <i>Cities Service Concert</i>. Furthermore, she points out that until the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> period, the "back office" support for the networks was the same<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup>, and often stations would shift from one network to another, depending on sponsor needs <sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup>. It was only when the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> began investigating network practices, McLeod believes, that efforts were made by <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a> to differentiate the two networks, and to fully position NBC Blue as a high-brow/public affairs network. (In the same light, it has been suggested that the congressional pressure was the real reason the NBC Symphony Orchestra was created.) <sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The NBC History Files at the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> lend support to the notion that <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> was gradually groping for a way to differentiate the Red Network from the Blue Network. For example, they contain a confidential memorandum, dated <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, which sets forth a network policy against mixing the Red and Blue network stations.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup> (Compare and contrast this with the way the Harry Lauder broadcast of 1929 was handled, above.) There also exists an October <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> sales force memorandum, which contains talking points on how to differentiate the Blue Network from the Red Network and <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup> Even as far back as December <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, NBC had set forth a policy banning specific references not only to CBS, but even to the Red Network <sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Of note is the fact that NBC began to step up efforts to expand the network; while it had 33 stations in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, this total had nearly tripled by January <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, when the network had 92 stations coast to coast. <sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the months leading up to the January <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> spinoff of the Blue Network, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> undertook vigorous steps to create separate brand images for the Red and Blue Networks. To a certain extent, this had been going on since at least the summer of 1939, when Time magazine indicated that NBC was undertaking an extensive build-up of NBC Blue. <sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup> In both the fall of 1937, and the fall of 1941, NBC would specifically identify a program as being broadcast on the "Red Network of the National Broadcasting Company," and at least in the fall of 1941, would have a similar tag for the Blue Network. <sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup> An example of this buildup comes in "Alice in Sponsor-Land," a publication put out by <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a> some time in mid-1941 <sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup> to market that network's shows. <sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup> This book focuses squarely on the Red Network, describing its entertainment programming, without any reference to the Blue Network. <sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup> Above the lineup of stations <sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup> in the back of the volume is the tag-line: "This is the Red Network of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Broadcasting_Company_8a11.html" title="National Broadcasting Company">National Broadcasting Company</a>." In addition, throughout the book are slogans such as "Any time is Good Time on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> Red!" This book, in part, demonstrates exactly how <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> differentiated the Red Network from the Blue Network in the fall of 1941, when, as noted, the Blue Network was still a part of <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>.</p>

<p>What follows are some examples of the programming on NBC Blue that illustrate the gradual shift in tone.</p>
<p>The official website for <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Hayes_0f4c.html" title="Helen Hayes">Helen Hayes</a> <sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup> shows a number of programs that she did for NBC Blue during this time, including a <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_O%27Neill_7874.html" title="Eugene O'Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a> play cycle in August <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, two different dramatic series of her own in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> (one sponsored by <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Foods_1d15.html" title="General Foods">General Foods</a>), and an appearance on a Blue series in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, one which brought famous people who would explain why a particular book has been their favorite.</p>

Saturday, November 26 shows that the Blue carried both the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army-Navy_game_e959.html" title="Army-Navy game">Army-Navy football game</a> and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i> on Thursday night carried a debate among economists as to whether an economic plan for world peace was possible.</p>

<p>For one season in the early <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, a high-profile sponsored program on the Blue was <i>The <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalcade_of_America_8626.html" title="Cavalcade of America">Cavalcade of America</a></i>, a show dramatizing historical events which was sponsored by <a href="../../../d/u/p/DuPont_9a74.html" title="DuPont">DuPont</a>. The show, which debuted in 1935 on CBS and moved to the Blue in January 1940 <sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup>, was created at a time when the firm was under attack for being, in effect, a "merchant of death," and this show, which focused on American historical figures, was one way DuPont tried to burnish its image <sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup>. Certainly, the show had high production values, as can be witnessed by its use of <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Massey_68f1.html" title="Raymond Massey">Raymond Massey</a> for a show in February 1940 on <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, as described in the <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">February 26</a>, 1940 issue of <i>Time</i> <sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup>. It was also known for the use of university professors to vet the historical accuracy of the stories, as well as scripts by future Pulitzer Prize-winner <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Miller_289a.html" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a> <sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[63]</a></sup>. (This show would eventually stay with NBC Red and NBC, starting in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, and the network would continue to broadcast the show even into the age of television <sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[64]</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>A poignant example of the Blue Network's counterprogramming comes on the night of Sunday, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>, 1941. The network carried an address by exiled <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuanian</a> president <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antanas_Smetona_3e85.html" title="Antanas Smetona">Antanas Smetona</a> at 7.45 p.m., where he was addressing a mass rally in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Given that NBC Red was, at the same time, broadcasting the popular <i>Fitch Bandwagon</i> radio program (on right after <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Benny_3ec2.html" title="Jack Benny">Jack Benny</a>), one wonders how many people tuned in to hear this statesman speak of the tragic fate of his nation. <sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>An interesting perspective can be seen on one of the most dramatic days in the history of network radio. On the morning/afternoon of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> attack on <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_865a.html" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_7.html" title="December 7">December 7</a>, 1941, while the first attack wave was over <a href="../../../o/a/h/Oahu.html" title="Oahu">Oahu</a>, NBC Blue was broadcasting <i>The Inspector General</i>, as part of its Great Plays program, while NBC Red was broadcasting a program with popular bandleader <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Kaye_ca06.html" title="Sammy Kaye">Sammy Kaye</a>. At 4 p.m., ET, the Blue's broadcasts of the National Vespers was interrupted by various news reports. Later on in the evening, at 6.30 p.m. and 6.45 p.m., <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Pearson_5e40.html" title="Drew Pearson">Drew Pearson</a>'s and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Roosevelt_a44d.html" title="Eleanor Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>'s regular broadcasts are heard, followed at 7 p.m. by a news roundup show that competed with Jack Benny, and later on <i>Bible Week</i> opposite the <i>Chase and Sanborn Hour</i> with <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Bergen_e825.html" title="Edgar Bergen">Edgar Bergen</a>. (The Blue did have the popular <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Sanctum_5ea1.html" title="Inner Sanctum">Inner Sanctum</a> mystery anthology series later that night at 8.30, followed in turn by its number one show with <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Winchell_cbeb.html" title="Walter Winchell">Walter Winchell</a>.) Lastly, of interest to those who may recall the satiric references in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> cartoons of the era, at 10 p.m., the Blue carried <i>The Goodwill Hour</i> with John J. Anthony, dispensing advice to those who sought it, and who presumably were not tuned into Phil Spitalny's orchestra on the Red network. <sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>

<p>In light of subsequent events, it is most interesting that <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> seriously considered, during the late <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, disposing of the Blue Network on its own initative. There are substantial materials contained in the NBC History Files at the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> <sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup> on this point. The fact that <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sarnoff_9d51.html" title="David Sarnoff">David Sarnoff</a>, the head of <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a>, was involved in these discussions indicates the high level at which this proposal was given consideration. A plain reading of the finding guide at the Library of Congress on the NBC History Files does not disclose the precise nature of these discussions, though the fact that these discussions existed is of interest. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, after the Blue Network had been spun off (but before its eventual sale), a promotional publication noted that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As far back as <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, a group of executives of the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a> conceived the idea that The Blue Network could progress faster and serve its stations, its advertisers and the listening public much better if, instead of being a part of NBC it were to become an independent network." <sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, accusations were leveled at both <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> and <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>, in part by its rival <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_Broadcasting_System_6892.html" title="Mutual Broadcasting System">Mutual</a>, that the two senior network systems engaged in a series of anticompetitive activities, by locking up talent through in-house talent bureaus, and tightly tying together the system of affiliated stations through onerous contracts.</p>
<p>In June of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, after some years of study, the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (which had had oversight over radio broadcasting since <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>) issued a scathing report (the "Report on Chain Broadcasting") attacking the affiliation policies of NBC and CBS, as well as the talent booking agency practices. The report proposed limiting each network to one affiliated station per city, which would have had a direct impact on NBC's dual-network ownership <sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[69]</a></sup>. In May of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, the FCC went a step further and issued formal rules to break up what it perceived to be monopolies in radio; one of these rules specifically barred a network from operating more than one hookup, which would have been aimed directly at NBC's ownership of its two networks, in a manner even more explicit than the June 1940 report <sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[70]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This account by <i>Time</i> <sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[72]</a></sup> describes at least one of the accusations leveled against NBC by Mutual, from an affidavit by Mutual's general manger.

<p>One of the significant issues surrounding the sale of the Blue Network involved the network's practices regarding "controversial" topics and proponents. The network, citing the code of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_of_Broadcasters_7061.html" title="National Association of Broadcasters">National Association of Broadcasters</a>, declined to sell time to labor organizations, cooperatives, and other organizations advocating "controversial topics," but did give them free air time, provided there was an opportunity for the other side to be heard. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_27.html" title="August 27">August 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations_8d33.html" title="Congress of Industrial Organizations">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> filed a brief in a petition to intervene in the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> proceedings on the network sale. <sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[86]</a></sup> The CIO complained that the NAB code regarding "controversial" broadcasts inhibited its ability to buy airtime. While the FCC denied the CIO's petition to intervene, it did invite the CIO to give testimony in the hearings. <sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the hearings held on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_10.html" title="September 10">September 10</a>, 1943, FCC Chairman James L. Fly roundly denounced the policy of the Blue Network in refusing to sell airtime, but granting air time for free, to proponents of controversial broadcasts. He colorfully described the policy as chasing would-be purchasers from the front of the shop, but "directing them to the back door for a handout." Mark Woods, the head of the Blue Network, defended the policy, stating that it was in compliance with the NAB code. <sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[88]</a></sup> When Edward J. Noble testified at the hearings held on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, 1943, he was questioned closely by Chairman Fly as to the policies regarding the refusal to sell air time to labor organizations, cooperatives and other special interest groups. <sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[89]</a></sup> Noble was directed by Chairman Fly at this hearing to submit a statement as to what the policy would be of the Blue Network in terms of "the expansion of the mechanisms of free speech." <sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[90]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_3.html" title="October 3">October 3</a>, 1943, Noble released a letter to the FCC in which it was stated that the Blue Network would meet "with an open mind" all requests for broadcasting time, "considering each on the merits," and excluding none on the basis of ideas or personality. <sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[91]</a></sup> Certainly, not all were pleased by Chairman Fly's stance. Columnist David Lawrence, in his <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">October 7</a>, 1943 column, thought that the FCC had overstepped its authority in attempting to force the Blue Network to change its policies regarding the sale of airtime. <sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>Noble's written response seems to have been sufficient.

<p>Of obvious import were steps taken to preserve the best programming the network had, and make improvements; these were happening in the period immediately prior to, and following, the sale of the network. While the Blue Network did lose a few programs to <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>, such as <i><a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiz_Kids_0bcb.html" title="Quiz Kids">Quiz Kids</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../d/u/f/Duffy%27s_Tavern_44c7.html" title="Duffy's Tavern">Duffy's Tavern</a></i> (more shows that debuted or had a previous run on the Blue; see Lackmann, op. cit.) and the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_Symphony_Orchestra_3c9e.html" title="NBC Symphony Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> (Lackmann, op. cit.), it did retain one highly-rated show, the <i>Jergen's Journal</i> with <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Winchell_cbeb.html" title="Walter Winchell">Walter Winchell</a>, which managed to compete successfully with NBC's powerhouse Sunday night lineup (it was the 11th-ranked program for all of 1943-1944, and Blue's only program in the top 20 <sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[103]</a></sup>). The Blue Network also retained the rights to broadcast the performances of the New York <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Opera_386b.html" title="Metropolitan Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>; <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Cross_80f7.html" title="Milton Cross">Milton Cross</a> would be the host for NBC, Blue, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>, <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>, and the opera's own broadcasts from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> through <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. This was in spite of the fact that NBC did not want to assign the rights to either the <i>Town Meeting of the Air</i> or the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts to the Blue Network. <sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an interview with <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> published on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_11.html" title="January 11">January 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, Woods noted that the Blue Network was seeking to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS by the aggressive use of transcriptions, contrary to the practice of the larger networks.<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[105]</a></sup> This would have its full fruition when <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> started transcribing his prime-time shows later in the decade.</p>
<p>In certain respects, the Blue made attempts to grab the spotlight with unusual broadcasts.

The hiring, in 1943, of noted bandleader <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Whiteman_4a39.html" title="Paul Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a> as Director of Music was an attempt by the network, in its own words, to strengthen the entire musical schedule, as well as obtain a prominent figure. <sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[107]</a></sup> The "Metropolitan Auditions of the Air," discussed above, had moved to the Blue Network by 1943 as well, joining the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. <sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[108]</a></sup></p>
<p>News continued to be a priority for the network; indeed, Raymond Swing would win a <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peabody_Award_5e52.html" title="Peabody Award">Peabody Award</a> for the network in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> for his news commentary <sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[109]</a></sup>.

<p>While space limitations prevent a detailed overview of all of the programming on the Blue Network during its 1943-1945 period, there are a few examples of programming that can be cited to show how the Blue was striving to reach beyond its previous reputation, and compete head-on with CBS and NBC as a stand-alone network.</p>
<p>One ambitious broadcast, copies of which are generally available to collectors of old-time radio broadcasts, was a special two-hour program broadcast on Christmas Day, 1944. Entitled "Christmas on the Blue," the show was emceed by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracie_Fields_5128.html" title="Gracie Fields">Gracie Fields</a>, and featured, among other stars, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_E._Brown_0092.html" title="Joe E. Brown">Joe E. Brown</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Andrews_Sisters_0510.html" title="The Andrews Sisters">The Andrews Sisters</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Wynn_c487.html" title="Ed Wynn">Ed Wynn</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Whiteman_4a39.html" title="Paul Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a> and others. The show also featured broadcasts of overseas servicemen talking to their loved ones at home, something slightly unusual for the era.</p>
<p>One of the pairings on this special program involved <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendell_Niles_0e58.html" title="Wendell Niles">Wendell Niles</a>, a long-time announcer on many radio shows, including Bob Hope's. The Blue Network gave him and partner Don Prindle a comedy series, "Niles and Prindle," which is referenced in the special as being scheduled for a debut the following month. Little can be found regarding this show, other than it involved two friends "who argued about everything," and had a brief life in 1945. <sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[114]</a></sup> It was certainly most unusual for the Blue to attempt to convert a long-time announcer into a featured comedy star, and in this sense, "Niles and Prindle," if not unique (given that <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graham_McNamee_d21c.html" title="Graham McNamee">Graham McNamee</a> was the "Perfect Foil" to <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Wynn_c487.html" title="Ed Wynn">Ed Wynn</a>), it must be said to be at least quite singular.</p>

<p>Strengthening the affiliate station group was a third matter of importance to the network. While the network had 116 stations in January <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a> and 155 stations as of June <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, this still meant that it could only offer to advertisers coverage of approximately 76% of the radio homes in the United States. <sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[116]</a></sup> In this sense, the moves by the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> to loosen the provisions of the contracts binding affiliated stations to networks helped the Blue. This allowed the Blue Network to pick up a few additional stations in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, including (ironically) a few from <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_Broadcasting_System_6892.html" title="Mutual Broadcasting System">Mutual</a> <sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[117]</a></sup> This was one of its priorities, as in general the Blue Network had inherited smaller and less powerful stations than the group of stations that had made up its former twin sister network.</p>

<p>Finally, a major priority of the Blue Network was to form a new identity, one that would mark a break with the past. On June 15, 1945, the Blue Network formally changed its name to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> <sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[119]</a></sup>, having initially sought permission from the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> for this action in October of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> <sup id="_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#_note-119" title="">[120]</a></sup>; prior to this time, some broadcasts would refer to the network as being "The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company." <sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[121]</a></sup> They were not alone in desiring this catchy acronym. <sup id="_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#_note-121" title="">[122]</a></sup> Two prior claimants were bought out prior to June, 1945 <sup id="_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#_note-122" title="">[123]</a></sup>, and in negotiations with the Associated Broadcasting Corp. in December 1945, it acquired the rights to the name "ABC" from yet a third party <sup id="_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#_note-123" title="">[124]</a></sup>. From June of 1945 forward, the entity has been known generally as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">American Broadcasting Company</a>, and reference should be made to that Wikipedia entry for its subsequent history,</p>
<p>Of course, things are never all that simple. Even into <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, in some markets, ABC would promote its shows with the tag-line "It's a Blue Network Program!" <sup id="_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#_note-124" title="">[125]</a></sup></p>

<p>As of June, 1945, commercial television in the United States had been frozen, owing to the lower level of priorities given to it as compared to war work. Furthermore, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> was generally slow to move into television broadcasting. It did not acquire a television station until 1948, forcing it to lease time from the stations owned by the <a href="../../../d/u/m/DuMont_Television_Network_a40a.html" title="DuMont Television Network">DuMont</a> network, including <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABD_8215.html" title="WABD">WABD</a>, DuMont's flagship station. <sup id="_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#_note-125" title="">[126]</a></sup> It might be supposed that the Blue Network never existed in television, but as noted above, the Blue Network did make at least one known foray into television, prior to the June, 1945 change in name.</p>
<p>The script for a February 25, 1945 broadcast of "Ladies Be Seated," which was a relatively popular audience-participation/stunt game show on Blue Network radio, still exists, and is reprinted in full in Ritche. <sup id="_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#_note-126" title="">[127]</a></sup>; it is, in fact, the script for the first broadcast <sup id="_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#_note-127" title="">[128]</a></sup>. It was hosted by Johnny Olson, who would later become the long-running announcer on CBS' "The Price is Right." Technically, this was not a network broadcast, as it was broadcast locally on <a href="../../../w/r/g/WRGB_4e7a.html" title="WRGB">WRGB</a>, the General Electric television station in Schenectady, New York. However, the opening title card, according to the script, was for "The Blue Network of the American Broadcasting Company." No video copy of this broadcast is known to exist.</p>

<p>As noted above, during the 1930s and 1940s, the <strong class="selflink">Blue Network</strong> was divided into groups of stations. The core group of stations was known as "Basic Blue," and covered the Northeast and portions of the Upper Midwest. The Southern Blue Network covered the Deep South, the Mountain Blue Group the Mountain states, the Pacific Coast Blue Network the Pacific Coast states, and the Southwestern Blue Group the Oklahoma-Texas region.</p>
<p>A pamphlet published by the American Rolling Mill Co. in connection with a radio talk on "The Miracle of Steel" given on the Blue Network on April 9, 1939 has a listing of the Blue Network stations participating in this broadcast. <sup id="_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#_note-128" title="">[129]</a></sup> They are as follows:</p>
