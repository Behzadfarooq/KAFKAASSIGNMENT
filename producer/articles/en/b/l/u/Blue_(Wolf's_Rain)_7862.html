<p>Throughout the beginning of the anime series, Blue is black with blue eyes, greatly resembling a wolf in physical body structure. Eventually, when she is able to take on a human appearance, she is shown wearing a red scarf and a black overcoat. She retains her black hair and blue eye color.</p>

<p>All her life, Blue had known herself as a dog, specifically <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quent_Yaiden_63b8.html" title="Quent Yaiden">Quent's</a> dog. Her loyalty and dependence on him is evident from the start, as she accompanies him everywhere, and hardly leaves his side. She is also valient protective of children, once attacking some soldiers to defend and rescue a young boy they had apprehended.</p>
<p>Upon her first meeting with Cheza, the wolf blood within her was awakened, initially causing confusion and shock, so much so that she forgot to warn Quent of the wolves' presence, and instead cried out when they fled. The revelation caused a rise in several emotions, mostly fear, as she knew how much Quent hated wolves. When she was attacked and injured by the soldiers she rescued the boy from, she watched as Quent chose to pursue Kiba and his pack over staying with her. Deciding that he would be unable to accept her as a wolf, she left his side.</p>
<p>After she departed from Quent's side, while she shows herself to be street-wise and capable of self-defense, she remains dependent on company, her first initiative to find work among the humans. After running into the wolf pack again, she quickly warmed up to Hige (the first wolf to treat her with friendliness), forming a bond with him. Her personality still dog-like, she started to depend on Hige like she did with Quent. This had led to widely-popular pairings of Hige and Blue in fan fiction (although some fan fiction pairs Blue with Kiba).</p>
<p>Until the end, Blue remains more dog than wolf, allowing her to befriend humans more easily, at one point allying herself with Cher Degre to enter Jaguara's city to seek out their lost companions. Despite the knowledge of how much bad blood there is between Quent and wolves, she continues to love him like a father, calling him "Oyaji-san" ("Pops" in the English Version).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...that's how I have been living up to now. Because until now I was with Oyaji-san, thinking that I have to be somehow useful to him, all the while. From your guys' point of view, this might be stupid...but I was happy." (<b>Blue, episode 12</b>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%28Wolf%27s_Rain%29_7862.html" title="Edit section: Past">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Past</span></h3>
<p>Blue's past is lightly touched on, first references being Quent retelling it to her, as well as her own recollection, later in the series, as she tells it to Hige.</p>
<p>As a puppy, Blue was adopted by Quent's son Ruesse, and grew up alongside the family. One day, Jagara's troops pursued wolves into the area and consequently set it ablaze, burning down their home and killing Quent's family. As the only survivors, Quent and Blue saw wolves among the burning wreckage, and Quent blamed them for the tragedy, starting his hatred for wolves and his quest to hunt them down.</p>
<p>Staying by Quent's side, Blue aided him, his quest becoming her quest. Despite her involvement in the hunts, she had nothing personal against the wolves, and even spoke with them in a friendly manner when they met up again.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Blue's Fate</b></p>
<p>In the last episode of Wolf's Rain, Blue learned that Darcia (now transformed into a gigantic dark-purple or black-purple wolf) had killed Quent and Toboe. As Darcia descends down the mountainside to retrieve Cheza and/or attack the wolves, Blue attacks him on his side, catching him by surprise and throwing them both off balance. Blue crashes to the ground on her back, spitting out blood and seemingly stunned by the fall. The injured Hige rushes to save her, but Darcia swiftly and easily rams into him, sending Hige flying.</p>
<p>Darcia then advances on Blue. He steps on her, and savagely attacks her while she's down. Hige, helpless because of his wounds, cries out in fury but can do nothing to save Blue. Kiba chases Darcia away from her, but it's too late, as she was already bleeding from her mortal injuries. After several more events, Hige slowly limped over to where Blue lay. They both lie by the side of the icy mountain, Hige weakly patting Blue's head. Her last lines were, "...so...warm..."</p>
<p><a name="The_Wolf-Dog" id="The_Wolf-Dog"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%28Wolf%27s_Rain%29_7862.html" title="Edit section: The Wolf-Dog">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Wolf-Dog</span></h2>
<p>Although she was part wolf, Blue had not known any other life apart from being a dog. Even after her wolf blood was awakened, she continued to possess dog-like traits, especially those of friendliness, loyalty, and a dependency on companionship.</p>
<p>While it is obvious that she cares for Hige, it comes into question whether she sees him as a mate (romantically), or merely as a second <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quent_Yaiden_63b8.html" title="Quent Yaiden">Quent Yaiden</a> who loved her and took care of her. It is possible that she saw him as an alternative to a human companion, and thus imprinted on him as a dog instead of as a fellow wolf.</p>
<p>In the run of the series, she appears adaptable to the idea that she is part wolf, but still continues to seek companionship - her first instinct had been to find work with the humans. She rescued the wolves from an old man, who was unaffected by the mind trick, by simply returning to being a dog, sitting at his feet in a submissive, friendly manner, and later befriending him, continuing to sit by his side as he pet her fondly. She had also mentioned to Hige a longing for her life before, when she didn't know she was part wolf.</p>
