<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blooper.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The term "blooper" was coined by TV producer <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kermit_Schaefer_6a90.html" title="Kermit Schaefer">Kermit Schaefer</a>. Schafer produced many <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_albums.html" title="Record albums">record albums</a> in the 1950s and 1960s, most of them titled <i>Pardon My Blooper</i> or variations of the title, published by Jubilee (also Quality, K-Tel, Brookville, Kapp, MCA, King, and Radiola), and manufactured and distributed by Jay-Gee Record Co. Inc. of New York. The <i>Pardon My Blooper</i> albums were promoted as featuring recordings of bloopers and outtakes from radio, film and television. Virtually all of Schafer's albums, however, are actually reenactments using hired actors - a fact that was not publicized at the time, even though some of the albums were clearly performances in front of a live audience. Such reenactments were usually necessary because the errors were often never recorded.</p>
<p>Besides "out-takes" or "outtakes", alternative terms used to describe this phenomenon include goof, fluff, flub, and the somewhat obsolete term, boner. Also, in Britain, they are often called a 'cock-up' or a 'bloomer'. In Britain, the term 'blooper' is often used only to describe mistakes that happen on live television. By the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> it was common practice among British videotape editors to compile a <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tape.html" title="Christmas tape">Christmas tape</a></i> of specially recorded inside jokes and outtakes which were shown to staff across the company; the various <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> regional franchises also shared their tapes with the others and had a contest for whichever was the funniest.</p>
<p>Comedian <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Emery_270f.html" title="Dick Emery">Dick Emery</a> showcased his own out-takes as an epilog entitled <i>A Comedy of Errors</i> to his BBC shows in the mid 1970s. The later British show <i>It'll Be Alright On The Night</i>, which has been running on <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> since 1977, and hosted by <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Norden_a458.html" title="Denis Norden">Denis Norden</a> showed out-takes from film and TV. The <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s answer to the show, <i>Auntie's Bloomers</i>, presented by <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Wogan_2fd8.html" title="Terry Wogan">Terry Wogan</a> (and it's spin-off sporting-mistakes show, Auntie's Sporting Bloomers, also presented by Wogan), ran until approximately <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, and was replaced by the less imaginitively titled <i>Out-Take TV</i>, which began as 2 half-hour specials in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, hosted by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_O%27Grady_e5ef.html" title="Paul O'Grady">Paul O'Grady</a>. A series was commissioned and subsequently broadcast on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_One_5f6f.html" title="BBC One">BBC One</a> during the summer of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, but this time hosted by <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Robinson_d8f3.html" title="Anne Robinson">Anne Robinson</a>. The main difference between <i>Out-Take TV</i> and <i>Auntie's Bloomers</i> is that whilst out-takes on the latter were confined to the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> archive, the former shows clips from across all five major British TV channels. <i>Out-Take TV</i> now appears in occasional one-off specials, much in the same way as <i>It'll Be Alright on the Night</i>. Special <i><a href="../../../w/e/a/Weakest_Link_356e.html" title="Weakest Link">Weakest Link</a></i> themed editions are a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>ITV has also produced two other shows, <i>TV Nightmares</i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/v/27/TV%27s_Naughtiest_Blunders_d974.html" title="TV's Naughtiest Blunders">TV's Naughtiest Blunders</a></i>. Both were presented by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Penk_51b3.html" title="Steve Penk">Steve Penk</a> at one stage, before the latter was changed to show wall-to-wall clips with voiceover by <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Morrissey_ab18.html" title="Neil Morrissey">Neil Morrissey</a>. The former also singled out certain TV personalities as they related some of their most hair-raising moments, whether live, out-take, or otherwise, whilst the latter was set aside for more risqué mistakes. The latter has also been criticised for being used as a simple schedule filler, often with ridiculously titled editions (e.g. "All New TV's Naughtiest Blunders 18").</p>
<p>During the 1982-83 season, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_producer.html" title="Television producer">TV producer</a> <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Clark_%28entertainer%29_9e7b.html" title="Dick Clark (entertainer)">Dick Clark</a> revived the bloopers concept in America for a series of specials on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>. This led to <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Bloopers_%26_Practical_Jokes_308b.html" title="TV Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes">a weekly series</a> which ran from 1984 through 1992 and was followed by more specials that appeared on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> irregularly until as recently as 2004, still hosted by Clark (there have been no further Bloopers specials produced since Clark suffered a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">stroke</a> that year). The success of both Clark's and Norden's efforts led to imitators on virtually all American and Australian TV networks, as well as scores of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_video.html" title="Home video">home video</a> releases; many American productions are aired to fill gaps in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_time.html" title="Prime time">prime time</a> schedules. With the coming of <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> in the 1990s, it is now common for major film releases to include a "blooper reel" (also known as a "gag reel" or simply "outtakes") among the bonus material on the disc.</p>
<p><a name="Causes_of_bloopers" id="Causes_of_bloopers"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blooper.html" title="Edit section: Causes of bloopers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Causes of bloopers</span></h2>
<p>Bloopers are generally caused through human error. Where actors need to memorize large numbers of lines or perform a series of actions in quick succession, out-takes can be expected. Similarly, <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_presenter.html" title="News presenter">newsreaders</a> have only a short time to deliver a large amount of information - often from foreign countries - and are prone to mispronounce place names and people's names, or switch a name or word without realizing it, as in a slip-of-the-tongue or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freudian_slip.html" title="Freudian slip">Freudian slip</a>.</p>
<p>Some common examples include: uncontrollable laughter <i>(called in television circles, corpsing)</i>, unanticipated incidents (i.e. a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatrical_property.html" title="Theatrical property">prop</a> falling or breaking), forgotten lines, or deliberate sabotage of an actor's performance by a fellow actor (to evoke laughter).</p>
<p>The famous adage of show business "Never work with children or <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal.html" title="Animal">animals</a>" demonstrates two other causes of out-takes. <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child.html" title="Child">Children</a>, especially children who have no acting experience, often miss cues, deliver the wrong lines or make comments - often to political leaders - which are particularly embarrassing. Similarly, animals are very likely to do things not in the script.</p>
<p>A third type of blooper is caused by failure of inanimate objects. This can be as simple as a sound effect being mis-timed or a microphone not working, but frequently involves doorknobs (and doors) not working or breaking, props and sets being improperly prepared, as well as props working in ways they should not work.</p>
<p>In recent years, <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_phone.html" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a> have been a new source of bloopers with them frequently going off. Many of them belong to actors, presenters and contestants who may have forgotten to turn them off or put on silence.</p>
<p>The reaction to bloopers is often intensified in the stressful environment of a movie or television filming set, with some actors expressing extreme annoyance while others enjoy the stress relief brought on by the unexpected event.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blooper.html" title="Edit section: Examples of bloopers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Examples of bloopers</span></h2>
<p>One of the earliest known bloopers is attributed to 1930s broadcaster <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Von_Zell_6b9c.html" title="Harry Von Zell">Harry Von Zell</a>, who accidentally referred to then-US President <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Hoover_33d7.html" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> as "Hoobert Heever" during an introduction. Reportedly it was upon hearing of this mistake that Kermit Schafer was inspired to begin collecting bloopers. See also <a href="http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/radio/vonzell.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/radio/vonzell.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/radio/vonzell.asp</a></p>
<p>One famous out-take from <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> television is from the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gameshow.html" title="Gameshow">gameshow</a> <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Dares_Wins_%28game_show%29_2bbd.html" title="Who Dares Wins (game show)">Who Dares Wins</a></i>, hosted by former <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricketer</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Whitney_c766.html" title="Mike Whitney">Mike Whitney</a>. The scene involved Whitney introducing a challenge by throwing a <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_balloon.html" title="Water balloon">water balloon</a> from hand to hand and delivering the line, "Remember when we were young, when we were kids, and we'd play with water balloons? You'd throw them all over the place and they'd burst and water would go everywhere". The out-takes of this scene, aired after the credits of the show, feature Whitney delivering the line in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember when we were young, when we were kids, when we were young, when we were kids, when we were young...</li>
<li>Remember when we were young, when we were kids, and we'd play with water balloons? You'd throw them all over the place and they'd burst and water would go all over the place. [Pause] That's two all over the places.</li>
<li>Remember when we were young, when we were kids, and we'd play with water balloons? You'd throw them all over the place and they'd burst and water would go everywhere everywhere. [Laughter]</li>
</ul>
<p>During a comedy show hosted by <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Skelton_713f.html" title="Red Skelton">Red Skelton</a> in the 1950s, a skit incorporating Red's "country bumpkin" character, "Clem Kadiddlehopper", had him leading a cow onto the stage. Several seconds into the skit, the cow defecated on-stage during the live broadcast. The audience laughed uncontrollably, and Skelton resorted to the use of the <a href="../../../a/d/-/Ad-lib.html" title="Ad-lib">ad-lib</a>, saying "Boy, she's a great cow! Not only does she give milk, {pause} she gives Pet-Ritz Pies!" He followed with, "Why didn't you think of that earlier?", "You know, your breath stinks, too!" and finally, "Well, it's just like the psychiatrists say, {long pause} Get it out of your system!" Red then finally broke into laughter, and the network cut to a commercial.</p>
<p>A much-bootlegged recording of <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bing_Crosby_1db0.html" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> has him singing to a recording of a band playing "Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams", when he realizes that the master tape had not been fully rewound, and ad-libbed vocals to the truncated music. He begins, <i>"Castles may tumble, that's fate after all/ Life's really funny that way."</i> Realizing the shortened music, he ad-libs, <i>"Sang the wrong melody, we'll play it back/ See what it sounds like, Hey Hey!/ They cut out eight bars, the dirty bastards/ I didn't know which eight bars he was gonna cut/ Why doesn't somebody tell me things around here?/ Holy Christ, I'm goin' off my nut!"</i></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresh_Prince_of_Bel_Air_0b2a.html" title="Fresh Prince of Bel Air">Fresh Prince of Bel Air</a></i> had a tradition of airing out-takes over the credit sequence. Many of these involved <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropisms</a> on the part of the cast, often lampooned by <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Smith_8633.html" title="Will Smith">Will Smith</a>. Additionally, Smith would reference black culture in setting up mistakes made by the rest of the cast. An example of this is when Uncle Phil (<a href="../../../j/a/m/James_L._Avery%2C_Sr._e7ea.html" title="James L. Avery, Sr.">James L. Avery, Sr.</a>) comments, "Well, it's not here. It must been stolen", before realising the line was "It must <i>have</i> been stolen" and correcting himself. Smith appears in the shot and, in an exaggerated <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accent_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Accent (linguistics)">accent</a>, responds, "It must bin stolen. Y'all hear dat?"</p>
<p>Another sitcom, <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Improvement_0a18.html" title="Home Improvement">Home Improvement</a></i>, also showcased out-takes over its closing credits.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Original_Series_61be.html" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></i> produced many famous out-takes, which were shown to the delight of fans at gatherings over the years and have been extensively bootlegged. One famous example shows actor <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Nimoy_52bd.html" title="Leonard Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>, who plays the supposedly emotionless <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Spock_c32f.html" title="Mr. Spock">Mr. Spock</a>, breaking into laughter when, instead of saying the line "The plants act as a <i>repository</i>," instead says "The plants act as a <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Suppository.html" title="Suppository">suppository</a></i>". In another out-take, lead actor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shatner_9433.html" title="William Shatner">William Shatner</a> breaks character during a scene and starts complaining about the food served in the studio commissary. A third example begins with a guest actress reciting the line, "We've come to the end of an eventful trip," to which Shatner replies, "I don't know what you've been taking..." -- a reference to the then-topical issue of <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">drug-induced hallucinations</a> or "trips". People bumping into supposedly automatic doors when the backstage personnel mistimed opening them was a common accident depicted. Similarly there were also mishaps while filming in exterior, with aircraft flying over supposedly alien planets.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../l/i/z/Lizzie_McGuire_a111.html" title="Lizzie McGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27s_So_Raven_8a2e.html" title="That's So Raven">That's So Raven</a></i> and other <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_Channel_faad.html" title="Disney Channel">Disney Channel</a> shows are also characterized for showing their bloopers after the shows have ended.</p>
<p>Many theatrical motion pictures feature bloopers during the end credits. For example, many <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Chan_8b3e.html" title="Jackie Chan">Jackie Chan</a> movies end with footage of failed stunts, blown dialogue, and other mishaps; Chan was inspired to do this by <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burt_Reynolds_1d5d.html" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a> films of the early 1980s (in particular <i><a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokey_and_the_Bandit_II_2639.html" title="Smokey and the Bandit II">Smokey and the Bandit II</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cannonball_Run_294a.html" title="The Cannonball Run">The Cannonball Run</a></i>) that also featured end-credits bloopers. As an homage to its inspiration, the closing-credits blooper reel for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Anchorman%7E_The_Legend_of_Ron_Burgundy_b85f.html" title="Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy">Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</a></i> actually featured one outtake from <i>Smokey and the Bandit II</i>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/i/x/Pixar.html" title="Pixar">Pixar</a> also has a tradition of including blooper-like material during the end credits of such films as <i><a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Story_2_3a0a.html" title="Toy Story 2">Toy Story 2</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Bug%27s_Life_d454.html" title="A Bug's Life">A Bug's Life</a></i>; <i>A Bug's Life</i>, in particular, was at one point reissued to theatres with a major selling feature being the addition of extra "bloopers". Since Pixar's films are computer-animated, however, these scenes are re-enacted with faked bloopers. The makers of another computer animated film, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Final_Fantasy%7E_The_Spirits_Within_893c.html" title="Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</a></i>, likewise also created a faux blooper reel showing the characters playing practical jokes and, in one case, bursting into laughter when one "sneezes" during a dramatic sequence.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing_television_series.html" title="Fishing television series">fishing television series</a> <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Dance_Outdoors_043e.html" title="Bill Dance Outdoors">Bill Dance Outdoors</a></i> has produced three videos (two <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> and one <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a>) focusing entirely on bloopers during production of the show and associated commercials, often showing various mishaps such as missed lines (which sometimes take several takes to finally deliver correctly), accidents during filming (including falling into the water, being impaled with a <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing_hook.html" title="Fishing hook">fishing hook</a>, or equipment malfunctions), as well as practical jokes played on the host by his guests and film crew (and vice versa). Some of the outtakes shown on these videos would sometimes be shown during the end credits of the show.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_Channel_ee82.html" title="Discovery Channel">Discovery Channel</a> series <i><a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythbusters.html" title="Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></i> will often keep some bloopers included in the actual episodes, usually various mishaps that occur on the show, such as minor injuries suffered by the cast, or various other accidents and malfunctions, which are usually quite spectacular and/or embarrassing when they do occur.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blooper.html" title="Edit section: Acceptance of out-takes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Acceptance of out-takes</span></h2>
<p>The proliferation of out-takes/gag reels/blooper reels, especially on recent DVD releases, has received mixed response by actors and directors. While many don't mind the extra publicity offered by such material being shown to the public and others simply enjoy seeing the mistakes, other actors complain that out-takes are demeaning to themselves and/or the craft and refuse to allow them to be made public. Among his other issues with <i>Star Trek'</i>s <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_producer.html" title="Television producer">producer</a> <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Roddenberry_868c.html" title="Gene Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Nimoy_52bd.html" title="Leonard Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> was not happy that Roddenberry showed the show's blooper reels to fans at conventions in the early 1970s. He felt actors needed to be free to make mistakes without expecting that they would be shown to the public, and wrote a letter to Roddenberry asking him to stop. Roddenberry's answer was to send Nimoy a blooper reel of his own should he have wished to show it at conventions.</p>
<p>This may have been why the concerns of one unidentified cast member have led to only a few out-takes from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i>, mostly its first season, being officially released to the public. <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> reportedly had a policy of destroying out-takes from the various <i>Star Trek</i> series for a time, although bloopers from <i><a href="../../../d/e/e/Star_Trek%7E_Deep_Space_Nine_9345.html" title="Star Trek: Deep Space Nine">Deep Space Nine</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../v/o/y/Star_Trek%7E_Voyager_e7d2.html" title="Star Trek: Voyager">Voyager</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Enterprise</a></i> have been broadcast in recent years and the current producers seem to be more accepting towards out-takes. The 2005 DVD release of the first season of <i>Enterprise</i> included nine minutes of out-takes, flubs, and on-screen practical jokes, and was the first officially sanctioned <i>Star Trek</i> blooper reel ever released commercially by Paramount. The subsequent DVD releases of the second, third and final seasons of <i>Enterprise</i> also included blooper reels of varying lengths.</p>
<p>The only occasion to date on which <i>Next Generation</i> bloopers were broadcast (in a Paramount-authorized fashion) occurred in a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> installment of the children's series, <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_Rainbow_89cf.html" title="Reading Rainbow">Reading Rainbow</a></i>, which took place behind the scenes of TNG (since <i>Rainbow</i> was hosted by TNG co-star <a href="../../../l/e/v/LeVar_Burton_fc9e.html" title="LeVar Burton">LeVar Burton</a>); the episode ended with a selection of mild bloopers from an early episode (specifically "<i><a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbiosis_%28TNG_episode%29_1bae.html" title="Symbiosis (TNG episode)">Symbiosis</a></i>".). Some additional bloopers and gag footage from TNG has survived and has been circulated on the Internet.</p>

<p>The term "blooper" is often applied to describe continuity errors and other mistakes that have escaped the notice of film editors and directors and have made it into a final, televised or released product, where these errors are subsequently identified by viewers. For example, in a film taking place in the Old West, a viewer might spot a twentieth century vehicle driving in the distance of one shot, or in a film taking place in ancient Greece, an actor may have forgotten to remove his wristwatch and it was caught on film. Or it might be a piece of clothing, such as shoes, that change for one shot then change back with no explanation. Strictly speaking, however, these are film errors, and not "bloopers" since they did not occur in outtake footage or a live broadcast.</p>
