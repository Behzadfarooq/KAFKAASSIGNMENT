<p>"German Shepherd Dog" is correct. "German Shepherd" is not. The German is deutscheschaferhund.</p>

<li>Well, in the german Wikipedia we agreed on <a href="../../../../de/b/l/o/Blondie_%28Hund%29_c7af.html" class="extiw" title="de:Blondie_(Hund)">de:Blondie (Hund)</a>. The deletion-request is for other reasons ("Adolfs doggie isn´t important") and won´t be executed because most people think that it is important. There are some dogs called "Blondi" in Germany, but most sources (especially historicans) call the dog "Blondi<b>e</b>" and Blondie is much more common. Blondie means as much as "blond haired (small) person". It is used for dogs with a lighter fur-color. It´s "Blondie", trust me I´m german... ca. 16.500 against 5.500 search results in Google. (try www.google.de with "Seiten auf Deutsch" instead of www.google.com!) Dickbauch 14:07, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Youre welcome, and sorry for my horrible English. I only created the account on the en: to prevent some people from destroying things using my german nick.

<dd>How do we know that Hitler killed Blondie because he believed the Russians would torture her? I've heard other accounts suggesting he wanted to make sure the cyanide would work. Can someone give a source?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Hmm, article used to say that but someone changed it. I don't have a source; don't know how anyone would know since didn't everyone there die? But I readded it as alternate theory. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 05:34, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>NOTE: As of Sept 2, 2005, the german article appears to have been renamed to Blondi (hund). I don't read german so I can't decipher how that whole thing went down; I'll just move this page back to where it was originally. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 22:44, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps the word dog should be added to the end of the opening sentence? As for name I've only ever known it as "Blondi" rather than "Blondie", rather than rely on what internet searches say are there no contemporary sources? -additional comment; Traudl Junge in her autobiograhy refers to "Blondi" and being Hitler's secretary she's likely to have known the correct spelling , plus at <a href="http://www.majorplm.com/catalogue/Cat-G-Personalities/Troost%20Gerdy-AH-Harras%20&amp;%20Blondi-19nov03/Troost%20Gerdy-AH-Harras%20&amp;%20Blondi.html" class="external free" title="http://www.majorplm.com/catalogue/Cat-G-Personalities/Troost%20Gerdy-AH-Harras%20&amp;%20Blondi-19nov03/Troost%20Gerdy-AH-Harras%20&amp;%20Blondi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.majorplm.com/catalogue/Cat-G-Personalities/Troost%20Gerdy-AH-Harras%20&amp;%20Blondi-19nov03/Troost%20Gerdy-AH-Harras%20&amp;%20Blondi.html</a></dd>

<dd>I neither don't think that he wanted to test the poison but rather take her with him, apparently even in that situation he cared for that - would it be caring to leave the dog in the bunker? Or as by Hitler's word "captured and killed by jewish pigs" when they'd reach the bunker?</dd>

<dd>A man who prefers dogs to pigs is a dangerous man indeed. If he'd been the sort who owned a pig and referred to his enemies as "dogs" then history would have been so much different. Multivitamin 08:02, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He was verey stupid to have a dog. I wondered who killed his dog. HITLER HIMSELF? I do not verey know much but ys I agree!!!!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why was he "verey stupid" (sic) to have a dog? He may have been a murderous dictator who was responsible for the deaths of approximately 50 million people, but I don't agree with your assertion that it was stupid of him to have a dog. I do, however, agree with you when you say that you "do not verey know much" (sic). By the way, before you post anything on Wikipedia, please run it through a spell check first. 172.129.164.101 15:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I agree with the first editor. After all, presumably the reason Blondi is considered notable enough to have an entry on Wikipedia is that Hitler's ownership of this beast sheds light upon Hitler himself. In particular, owning a large dog is entirely consistent with Hitler's decision to attack the Soviet Union, surely one of the stupidest decisions ever made. --<a href="../../../q/4/_/User%7EQ4_0a25.html" title="User:Q4">Q4</a> 11:00, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
