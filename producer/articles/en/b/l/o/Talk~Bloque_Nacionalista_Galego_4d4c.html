<p>This article needs editing:</p>
<p>The BNG is neither a political 'party' nor an 'alliance' as variously stated in this article. It defines itself as a patriotic front, ie. an organisation made up of individual members who may choose to futher join any of the other organisations offically recognised by the BNG or not. In fact, the vast majority of its members are so-called 'independents', ie. are not members of any of the organisations within the BNG. The realtionship between the BNG and the groups it contains are indirect and complex, but the BNG is an autonomous body and an assembly-based organisation where individual members vote regardless of their (possible) inside party/group affiliations.</p>
<p>The officially recognised terms to refer to the diferent territorial components of the Spanish State is not 'regions' as such, but 'autonomous communities'. Further, Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galiza are recognised as having the special status of 'historical nationalities' (sic.) with languages of their own.</p>
<p>It would be better to describe figures cited by using their official titles, ie. Anxo Quintana, National Spokesperson Xos√© Manuel Beiras, President of the National Council</p>
<p>Although Francisco Rodriquez is considered by some a leading figure in the BNG as an MP in the Spansih --193.144.79.188 20:53, 11 January 2006 (UTC)Parliament and owing to his role in the Galizan People's Union (he was recently reelected as General Secretary of the UPG), he is not an official representative (ie. spokesperson) for the BNG.</p>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that the BNG is the second most imortant group in the Galizan Parliament with seventeen seats, slightly ahead of the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE).</p>
<p>I do not think that it is fair to include this organisation within the section entitled 'secessioinist organisations' as that is not one of its self-declared political aims. Unlike other, self-styled 'independentist' organisations whoich also do exist in Galiza, the BNG officially defend the right to self-determination.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Bloque Nacionalista Galego has links with Basque separatism, and Catalan separatism, as well as with other local and regional organizations on the edge of terrorism (such as AMI). Its ideology is national-socialism, as it's the mixture of Nationalism and Radical Socialism / Marxism-Leninism. It's a deeply undemocratic party.</p>
<hr />
<p>These are very severa claims, and you should provide arguments and facts for them.</p>
<p>For a start, the links that the BNG has with the separatist, nationalist and independentist movements of Euskadi and Catalunya are perfectly democratic and legal, since they are links to legal organizations.</p>
<p>Second, AMI has no official links with the BNG, who has its own youth movement (Galiza Nova). In any case, accusing either of these organizations of being terrorist must be done with proofs -- I must remind you that the recent raids of the spanish police on AMI social centres have found nothing, and that all the people arrested has been set free without charges.</p>
<p>Third, you show a lack of knowledge when you speak about national-socialism, because you should know that national-socialism is not born out of joining marxism with nationalism, but rather as opposed to the former. National-socialists used to prosecute communists and anarchists, and the leading classes of Germany are largely responsible of the ascension of Hitler because (just like the french burgoisy did by allowing the german invassion) they thought that he would rid them of the communists. National-socialism is a misleading term (which is why it should be called Nazism), since its real roots are closer to fascism than to socialism -- and you surely know that fascism sought to eliminate the left-right dicotomy, and offered national unity among classes as opposed to the marxist concept of class struggle.</p>
<p>The ideology of the BNG is defined in its statutes and in its electoral programmes. It has, indeed, elements of nationalism and socialism (it is mainly a marixst front), but that does not make it national-socialist. The nationalist elements in the ideology of the BNG are aimed towards adquiring the right of self-determination; a right which has been recognized by the United Nations. In that sense, galizan nationalism seeks independence, not national supremacy -- this approach is very similar to the socialist movements of, for example, Latin America, where socialism is closely linked to the economic and cultural independence of each country from the USA, and has been a constant element in all the socialist movements of the XX century. As a matter of fact, the Third Internationale (the Cominterm) recognized Galiza as an opressed nation, and encouraged its right to self-determinate.</p>
<p>These facts all lead towards one important conclussion (and mind you, that I have separated one from the other): nationalism in Galiza is one-of-a-kind, compared to the rest of spanish nationalisms. For in Galiza, virtually all nationalism is linked closely to the left, and virtually all the left is linked to nationalism. While in other parts 'nationalist' will be seen as synonym to reactionary, in Galiza the nationalists are actually the progressive, hard left. --193.144.79.188 20:53, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
