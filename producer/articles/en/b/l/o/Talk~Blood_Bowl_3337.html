<p>I don't understand the line "akin to a very violent version of American football". Blood Bowl has little to do with American Football and is much closer to rugby. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic.gnome</a> 21:34, 15 June 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Blood bowl is very similar to American Football, (which is of course, not all that different from rugby in the greater scope of things) but some specific differences are in the nomenclature of the game, the turns being dubbed 'downs' and the scoring arena 'endzones'. Also note the role of forward passing. I do agree however the flow of play is much more akin to rugby, but the game is styled after American Football. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigmacd24_0a2c.html" title="User:Bigmacd24">Bigmacd24</a> (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigmacd24_38b5.html" title="User talk:Bigmacd24">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigmacd24_0453.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigmacd24">contribs</a>) 03:33, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>I have substantively re-written the Blood Bowl page on a slow day at work and it is now closer to being a wikipedia article than previously. Wikipedia is not for specialists/insiders only. My version addresses Artic.gnome's issue - Neo, your answer doesn't resolve that query. Also, I've removed all the leagues that were spammed here (I took advice on that and it was a large number of links for such a small page). I would be happy to discuss any part of this edit. The purpose of it was to have an article that looked more like a wikipedia one and less like a fanboy/insider article. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 15:00, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can understand why you might want to put up the links to leagues but wikipedia isn't really the place for that. There are plenty of available spaces around the internet for league advertising including the BB forums, TBB, the many fansites, the webring.

<dd>The NAF site, while requiring paid membership, is the official players society for Blood Bowl and was suggested by Jervis Johnson and created from the ground up by myself (John Lewis,BBRC) to facilitate the growth of the game. It's as close to an official site as you can get without being an official site. The fact that it requires a membership fee doesn't invalidate it's authoritative tournament ranking of all the major tournaments, nor it's close ties to GW.

<dd>Good job on the rewrite. I would like to see a removal/rewording of the FLUFF section as that's an RPG/Warhammer buzz-word with some pejorative connotation. Why not just call it 'background' instead as it makes more sense to the non-gamer.

<dd>Tournaments are not necessarily new, but I believe the suggestions pertaining to tournament specific rules are new in the rulebook, since tourny play is now different to league play. I haven't read the new rules yet though to be sure.--Herbjunkie 21:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without advertising specific leagues, a section mentioning the web based communities and ways of playing the board game might be worth including.In particular the Pbem (play-by-e-mail) client developed by Galak and Skijunkie's (at the time of writing outdated) java-client have helped keeping the community of addictet fans grow.[from heinz] <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 83.72.240.7 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.72.240.7_b9a1.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.72.240.7">contribs</a>) 15:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Reverted to a previous edit, as a user had changed the setting to the Warhammer universe, whereas it's been commented by Jervis Johnson (the games creator) that the direction that it took closer to Warhammer Fantasy Battle with the release of 3rd edition was a mistake, one they're now changing. He also confirmed, on more than one occasion, that Bloodbowl is now set in a world similar to, but not Warhammer. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkson_9263.html" title="User:Darkson">Darkson</a> 23:46, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the tone of this piece is pretty solid overall. What elements need to be redone to remove the tone note? ZargonDDG 10:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article should mention online play. 6 years ago I saw an active community called OLBBL playing with a client over IRC, and today I see <a href="http://fumbbl.com/help:Overview" class="external free" title="http://fumbbl.com/help:Overview" rel="nofollow">http://fumbbl.com/help:Overview</a> doing the same. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathiastck_aeb4.html" title="User:Mathiastck">Mathiastck</a> 23:37, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've added this in the external links section, as it is a very active league (100+ players available most of the time), though not limited to league play and open to all for free.</dd>
<dd>If people still object, I would suggest we at least give a link to the client used, as it is certainly a useful resource for the average person who wants to find out about Blood Bowl... <a href="../../../o/d/d/User%7EOdd_bloke_d79a.html" title="User:Odd bloke">Odd bloke</a> 20:02, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking through the history, I've changed the link to point to the client myself. I still think a link to an online league would be valuable. <a href="../../../o/d/d/User%7EOdd_bloke_d79a.html" title="User:Odd bloke">Odd bloke</a> 21:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
