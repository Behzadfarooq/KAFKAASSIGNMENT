<p>You are correct. I cannot have it both ways. I removed the NOTES section of the article in addition to any mention of credit because of it's discussion concerning my research regarding the inability to discover existing rules pertaing to pieces mentioned in the original rules.</p>
<p>An example of a game that has not been published but has an article is *Star. This game is currently awaiting copyright and has not been manufactured. The difference between *Star and Irides is that the designer of *Star (Ea Ea) is a well respected game designer and the rules of the game are listed on his website.</p>

<p>Sorry, it looks like I was a bit rash in my rollback on that article. I've reverted to the original version. I stand by believing that it is POV, but it seems to deserve some mention. Since you are obviously much more knowledgable about this than I am, please rephrase it to show that it is somebody's opinion. For example, rather than "Her novels are characterised by turgid language and unsubtle alliteration. They were initially published privately", you should say something along the lines of "Critics such as A, B, and C have commented that...". I'm terribly sorry for simply reverting your changes, but I still believe they did not abide by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s policy on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">writing at a neutral point of view</a>.

<p>Blotwell, I stand corrected. I actually am a native speaker/writer of Canadian English, and the -our endings are generally used. I confess that I had overlooked that the U was dropped in that form of the word, although I was aware that it is the common practice elsewhere.

<p>Hi! I like the animated pyramid you've made. However, the image size is quite large. Most animated gifs can be reduced in file size without signifcant reduction (sometimes improvement) in quality. This is best done with the raw full-color images but some reduction can be done with existing gifs. As a test (proof of concept) I ran your larger version through Jasc Animation Shop, first resizing with smart resize, and then using optomized-median-cut palette generation and nearest-color color reduction, resulting in a file less than half of the 160x120 you have <a href="http://www.goldrush.com/~herd/pics/Pyramid_of_35_spheres_animation3.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goldrush.com/~herd/pics/Pyramid_of_35_spheres_animation3.gif" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This is because dithering is murder for animated gif sizes, as each frame is usually dithered separately, resulting in unneeded color shifts being stored/animated (most of the background of your image has no need to change, for example). If you still have full-color lossless images (BMP, PNG, TIF, etc) the filesize could possibly be reduced quite a bit more (factor of 2x to 4x at a guess). I offer my services if you wish, if ImageMagick won't do this.</p>
<p>Also, it is a good idea to put in some delay (50ms, or at least 10ms) between frames (yours are set to 0ms, which can have inconsistent and jittery results depending on system/browser load). Hope you're ok constructive criticism.</p>

<dd>Hmm, if you can upload the 16 bit PNG frames (of both images, the 24 and 40 frame) to a web or ftp server temporarily (I think they'd be too big for my gmail, unless they were in chunks less than 5 megs each (splarka@gmail.com)) that'd be great. I can then compress several versions for you. 320x240 would be fine but if you want a bigger version of the 35-stack feel free (480x360, or maybe 640x480 (yikes, might take a while)). Just make sure they are lossless and undithered! <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplarka_6b4f.html" title="User:Splarka">Splarka</a> 06:22, 5 August 2005 (UTC) (PS, you can reply here, I add talk pages to my watch list for a few months that I contribute to)
<dl>
<dd>Whew, sorry for delay. Took me a while to get around to it. I don't know how you've got them distributed among commons. and en. and such, so I put them <a href="http://goldrush.com/~herd/pics/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://goldrush.com/~herd/pics/wiki/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for you temporarily (if you want to upload them). I notice you've already uploaded smaller versions, but using Jasc I was able to make them: <s>640x480 1.2 megs, 320x200 400k, and 160x120 140k</s> (<b>Update</b>, I reduced them a bit more by locking most of the background: 640x480 1.06 megs, 320x200 380k, and 160x120 135k). They are named 35_160.gif, 35_320.gif and 35_640.gif, utilize as you wish! <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplarka_6b4f.html" title="User:Splarka">Splarka</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplarka_33cd.html" title="User talk:Splarka">rant</a>) 23:30, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Blotwell,</p>
<p>Noticed you decided to remove the Carta Mundi external link. At the same time, you did not go through the bother to remove Fournier and United States Playing Cards.</p>
<p>I've taken the liberty to add the link back in. Please be thorough in your revision.</p>
<p>Fyi, Carta Mundi plays a very important role in the history of playing cards in Europe, and all over the world. Do check the site, and see that it does add value to this wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Thx mate!</p>

<p>I rolled back your last edit, but thought I should explain why. In 20 years of birdwatching, I have never heard or read of any auk species, let alone the whole family, referred to as N Hemisphere penguins, even informally, so if correct this sentence needs to be sourced.</p>
<p>The French bit I removed on the standard principle that Wikipedia is not a language dictionary. There is an understandable tendency for people to add the name of a bird etc in a language they know, but you end up with a polylingual dictionary article.</p>
<p>I appreciate that your changes were well-intentioned, which is why I thought you deserved an explanation for the rollback.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 05:53, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there! I'm intrigued by your image request for the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solenoid.html" title="Solenoid">solenoid</a> page, but not sure exactly how the to torii are suppose to intersect.

<dd>Sorry about my presumption. I did these same searches, and my results seemed to favour "on" instead of "in". The BBC uses "on" (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4540262.stm|example" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4540262.stm|example" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), so I presume that is the standard British English convention.

<p>Dear Blotwell. I see you are re-categorizing a number of articles from <a href="../../../b/o/a/Category%7EBoard_games_eda0.html" title="Category:Board games">category:Board games</a> to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_board_games_189f.html" title="Category:History of board games">category:History of board games</a>. For board games that are exclusively of historical interest, this makes sense. But for other games (and other game-related articles), I'm not so sure. Any comments? (Drop me a line on my <a href="../../../n/o/e/User_talk%7ENoe_c01c.html" title="User talk:Noe">talk page</a>; I may not notice if you only answer here.) Yours sincerely, --<a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoe_b8ad.html" title="User:Noe">Niels Ø</a> 15:06, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your message was so polite I didn't discover from it what your own opinions are. I've recategorized: three ancient board games whose rules are unknown, three nineteenth-century race games which are playable, but gosh, they're boring (comparable to <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snakes_and_ladders.html" title="Snakes and ladders">snakes and ladders</a>), and two others: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Landlord%27s_Game_cf7a.html" title="The Landlord's Game">The Landlord's Game</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_and_Circle_game_1667.html" title="Cross and Circle game">Cross and Circle game</a>, both of which are also cross-categorized in other subcats of <a href="../../../b/o/a/Category%7EBoard_games_eda0.html" title="Category:Board games">Category:Board games</a>. Is there any particular one of these which you objected to?</p>
<p>My general object is to clear out <a href="../../../b/o/a/Category%7EBoard_games_eda0.html" title="Category:Board games">Category:Board games</a> into subcats since it was getting <i>way</i> too big. (Ultimately I'd like to have something like the German Wikipedia's <a href="../../../../de/s/p/i/Kategorie%7ESpielkategorie_a540.html" class="extiw" title="de:Kategorie:Spielkategorie">de:Kategorie:Spielkategorie</a>, where each game is multiply categorized.) For this reason I was being WP:BOLD with my changes on the assumption that a few things would be really too optimistic and get reverted. —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 15:22, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer. I understand your reasoning, and though I'm not familiar with the German categorizations, it sounds quite reasonable. I was mildly surprised by your re-categorizations of <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_of_the_Goose_1718.html" title="Game of the Goose">Game of the Goose</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_and_circle_game.html" title="Cross and circle game">Cross and circle game</a>, but in both cases, I can see <i>some</i> merit in your re-categorization. If it's work in progress, I'll check back later to see what I think of the completed work.--<a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoe_b8ad.html" title="User:Noe">Niels Ø</a> 15:38, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. It looks like you're doing a lot to categorize big game categories like Puzzles and Board games. That's cool.

<p>Hi, you removed some links I had added to articles and left a message about it in my User Talk section.</p>
<p>I have read the guidelines that you refer to, but for the following three cases I don't see why my links were not fit for the articles.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the article about mnemonic, I added a link (<a href="http://mc.bigparadox.com/" class="external free" title="http://mc.bigparadox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mc.bigparadox.com/</a>) to a site I made which teaches a technique and lets you practice it for memorizing a deck of cards, with the help of mnemonics. There are other links there of similar nature, like "Use mnemonics to learn English", etc. So what is wrong with my link?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For the article about recreational mathematics, I added a link (<a href="http://mathematics.bigparadox.com/" class="external free" title="http://mathematics.bigparadox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mathematics.bigparadox.com/</a>) to a site I made with recreational mathematics, similar to the link to "Nick's Mathematical Puzzles". What is wrong with my link?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For the article about Mastermind (board game), I added a link (<a href="http://mathematics.bigparadox.com/?url=mastermind.asp" class="external free" title="http://mathematics.bigparadox.com/?url=mastermind.asp" rel="nofollow">http://mathematics.bigparadox.com/?url=mastermind.asp</a>) to an online mastermind game where you play against the computer <i>and where the computer plays against you</i>. The feature that the computer plays against you is very uncommon among the sites that have mastermind. It is quite unique. What is wrong with my link? It is similar to the site already linked to "Mastermind flash", but my one has that extra uncommon feature that the computer plays against you too.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were reading these articles and looked at those external links I would think them relevant and valuable for me.</p>
<p>I will add these three links again if I do not hear from you.</p>

<p>Yes. Private email from Trevor Truran, also see the forum posts relating to this: <a href="http://forum.thudgame.com/viewtopic.php?t=51&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" class="external free" title="http://forum.thudgame.com/viewtopic.php?t=51&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" rel="nofollow">http://forum.thudgame.com/viewtopic.php?t=51&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15</a></p>
<p>In the main rules it states: "Capturing is not compulsory. [...] A troll can only be shoved to make a capture."</p>
<p>What that means is that a troll, when moving one square, may capture zero or more dwarfs. When shoving, it may capture one or more, but not zero. It nowhere says that all ajacent dwarfs involved must be captured.</p>
<p>I really, really would prefer this were not the case. However, it is, and I need to amend my thudgame.com code to cope with it, along with adding an ugly GUI modification to allow people to choose not to take all the dwarfs, and yet prevent them from selecting none of them if they were shoved.</p>
<p>Not that I, or anyone else, can see any situation where this would ever be a desirable course of action. But people have to be allowed to if they want, because the rules don't say that they can't.</p>
