<p>Rather than a photo of a jumpshot being taken, how about a shot of a rejection actually taking place? I'm not wikiful enough yet to put a photo up myself, but that picture is just about as arbitrary as someone dribbling, or blocking a shot in hockey or volleyball - not quite the gist of the article. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseRafe_93c8.html" title="User:JesseRafe">JesseRafe</a> 05:16, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone keeps adding Yao Ming to the list of great shot blockers. This is ridiculous. He has only been in the NBA for four seasons and has never averaged more than 2 blocks per game. Maybe add him later, let him collect a few more rejections before we include this respectable player into blocking stardom.</p>

<p>I took down the picture. The photo I deleted does not depict a shot actually being blocked; IMO, that image would be better suited for a hypothetical "jumpshot" article. I'm pretty new and don't really understand Wikipedia's copyright policies pertaining to pictures, but it seems like you guys are pretty strict about that stuff. Is there any way we can find a good picture of a shot being blocked without running into copyright problems?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 09:50, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the same picture again today. I firmly believe we can do better than the not-even-close-to-a-block depicted in the photo.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 12:15, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Arr, how hurtful it is to be said "virtually irrelevant". I said <b>unsuccessfully attempts</b> to <b>block</b>, and you know it is an unsuccessful attempt to <b>block (basketball)</b>. Oh by the way, I did post Tayshaun Prince's famous block on Reggie Miller once, but it was removed because of copyright. Don't say I didn't try a better picture. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAree_d14b.html" title="User:Aree">Aree</a> 13:42, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, what is the copyright status of the non-block picture you keep posted? If you let me know where you got it, maybe we can work to find a good picture with similar copyright status?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 13:47, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, it's not personal. I don't know you, and I certainly don't know David Robinson or Karl Malone. I just don't think the picture belongs in this article. Too bad the Tayshaun Prince pic got taken down. Of the ones you posted, the Elden Campbell pic seems close to a block.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 02:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>somebody keeps deleting Bradley of the list of great shotblockers, his career block per game average (2.55) is even better than ben wallace's (2.29) , so whoever is deleting him, stop it</p>

<dd>Lmao.shawn bradley eh.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>if he was so good then why didnt he become more renown..</dd>
<dd>i bet only 10% of viewers would actually know who he was..</dd>
<dd>and if he was a good shotblocker more would know him.</dd>
<dd>so if he really is such a good shotblocker why is his status the same as an African-American tennis player..haha answer that</dd>

<p>his status has nothing to do with his ability to block shots, you cromagnon</p>

<p>Shawn Bradley blocked a decent amount of shots for a guy who's 8 feet tall, but he doesn't belong on a list of great anything. As a pro, his height was the extent of his talent. Compare his blocks per 40 minutes to other extremely tall guys--even Manute Bol (who was similarly uncoordinated) absolutely destroys him in this category. Or compare him to Mark Eaton, who was a devensive ace--Eaton's blocks per 40 minutes were significantly higher.</p>
<p>I also think you should look at how many seasons a player was the "best" shotblocker. Mourning, Eaton, Olajuwon, Mutumbo--even Bol--led the league in BPGmultiple times. When Bradley played, there were always shorter guys blocking just as many shots as him. He was good shotblocker, but not one of the greats.</p>
<p>Shorter, more recent, players like Wallace and Kirilenko are going to have lower numbers than Bradley and, like Bradley, did not have multiple seasons where they led in BPG--so feel free to remove them. But IMO they belong on this list because the play an intimidating, shot-altering game without the benefit of freakish height. Hope that explains my rationale.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 02:33, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bradley is by no measure an intimidating presence, but those are real BPG numbers. Don't discredit it because he's tall. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAree_d14b.html" title="User:Aree">Aree</a> 13:38, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey guys, I had a question about the rules of blocking shots pertaining to the backboard. The article currently states that it is a goaltend if the shot is blocked after the ball touches the backboard. However, I was pretty sure that I heard that in one level of basketball (either NCAA and below, or maybe it was NBA), the block is legal <b>as long as the ball is touched before it begins heading downward</b>. For example, a guard drives the lane and puts up the ball with a lot of spin. Once it hits the backboard, it is still live until it begins going down. Can anyone help me out on this one? Thanks. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedskull619_551f.html" title="User:Redskull619">RedSkull619</a> 21:36, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the NBA, you want to consult the goal-tending rules: <a href="http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_11.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. They're quite specific. <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyasuda_0ddc.html" title="User:Myasuda">Myasuda</a> 22:24, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>NCAA/NFHS rules state that the ball must be traveling downward for the block to be a goaltend. I found that in their official rulebook: <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2007/2007_m_w_basketball_rules.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2007/2007_m_w_basketball_rules.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Rule 4, Section 32 (page 91). It is a .pdf file. The NBA rule was correct though, thank you for the link.</p>
