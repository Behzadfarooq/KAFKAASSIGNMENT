Thirteen people, six of whom were minors, died immediately, while the death of another person 4½ months later has been attributed to the injuries he received on the day.

<p>Many details of the day's events are in dispute, with no agreement even on the number of marchers present that day. The organisers, "Insight", claimed that there were 30,000 marchers; <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Widgery%2C_Baron_Widgery_a6ee.html" title="John Widgery, Baron Widgery">Lord Widgery</a>, in his tribunal, said that there were only 3,000 to 5,000. In <i>The Road To Bloody Sunday</i>, local <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_practitioner.html" title="General practitioner">GP</a> Dr. Raymond McClean estimated the crowd as 15,000, which is the figure used by <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernadette_Devlin_McAliskey_bc26.html" title="Bernadette Devlin McAliskey">Bernadette Devlin McAliskey</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>A wealth of material has been produced relating to the day, including numerous books and articles, as well as documentary films made on the subject.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The march's planned route had taken it to the Guildhall, but because of army barricades it was redirected to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Derry_16c2.html" title="Free Derry">Free Derry</a> Corner. A small group of teenagers broke off from the main march and persisted in pushing the barricade and marching on the Guildhall. They attacked the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_army.html" title="British army">British army</a> <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barricade.html" title="Barricade">barricade</a> with stones and shouted insults at the troops. At this point, a water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets were used to disperse the rioters. Such confrontations between soldiers and youths were common, though observers reported that the rioting was not intense.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Two people were shot and wounded by soldiers on William Street.</p>
<p>At a certain point, reports of an IRA sniper operating in the area were allegedly given to the Army command centre. The order to fire live rounds was given, and one young man was shot and killed when he ran down Chamberlain Street away from the advancing troops. This first fatality, Jackie Duddy, was among a crowd who were running away. He was running alongside a priest, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Edward_Daly_65d1.html" title="Bishop Edward Daly">Father Edward Daly</a>, when he was shot in the back. The aggression against the British troops escalated, and eventually the order was given to mobilise the troops in an arrest operation, chasing the tail of the main group of marchers to the edge of the field by Free Derry Corner.</p>
<p>Despite a cease-fire order from the army HQ, over a hundred rounds were fired directly into the fleeing crowds by troops under the command of Major Ted Loden. Twelve more were killed <a href="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/bs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/bs.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, many of them as they attempted to aid the fallen.

<ul>
<li>John (Jackie) Duddy (17). Shot in the chest in the car park of Rossville flats. Four witnesses stated Duddy was unarmed and running away from the paratroopers when he was killed. Three of them saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran. Uncle of Irish boxer <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Duddy_26bb.html" title="John Duddy">John Duddy</a>.</li>
<li>Patrick Joseph Doherty (31). Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety in the forecourt of Rossville flats. Doherty was the subject of a series of photographs, taken before and after he died by <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> journalist <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilles_Peress_fbc0.html" title="Gilles Peress">Gilles Peress</a>. Despite the evidence of "Soldier F" that he fired at a man holding and firing a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs showed Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.</li>
<li>Bernard McGuigan (41). Shot in the back of the head when he went to help Patrick Doherty. He had been waving a white handkerchief at the soldiers to indicate his peaceful intentions. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></li>
<li>Hugh Pious Gilmore (17).

<li>Kevin McElhinney (17). Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety at the front entrance of the Rossville Flats. Two witnesses stated McElhinney was unarmed.</li>
<li>Michael G. Kelly (17). Shot in the stomach while standing near the rubble barricade in front of Rossville Flats. Widgery accepted that Kelly was unarmed.</li>
<li>John Pius Young (17). Shot in the head while standing at the rubble barricade. Two witnesses stated Young was unarmed.</li>
<li>William Noel Nash (19). Shot in the chest near the barricade. Witnesses stated Nash was unarmed and going to the aid of another when killed.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Widgery considered it likely that Nash was shot by a civilian firing at soldiers.</li>
<li>Michael M. McDaid (20). Shot in the face at the barricade as he was walking away from the paratroopers. The trajectory of the bullet indicated he was killed by soldiers positioned on the Derry Walls.</li>
<li>James Joseph Wray (22). Wounded then shot again at close range while lying on the ground. Witnesses who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal stated that Wray was calling out to say that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Donaghy_204d.html" title="Gerald Donaghy">Gerald Donaghy</a> (17). Shot in the stomach while attempting to run to safety between Glenfada Park and Abbey Park. Donaghy was brought to a nearby house by bystanders where he was examined by a doctor. His pockets were turned out in an effort to identify him. A later <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary_fcdf.html" title="Royal Ulster Constabulary">police</a> photograph of Donaghy's corpse showed <a href="../../../n/a/i/Nail_bomb.html" title="Nail bomb">nail bombs</a> in his pockets. Neither those who searched his pockets in the house nor the British army medical officer (Soldier 138) who pronounced his death shortly afterwards say they saw any bombs. Donaghy had been a member of <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_%C3%89ireann_69e1.html" title="Fianna Éireann">Fianna Éireann</a>, an IRA-linked Republican youth movement. Paddy Ward, who gave evidence at the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saville_Inquiry_b4a5.html" title="Saville Inquiry">Saville Inquiry</a>, claimed that he had given two nail bombs to Donaghy several hours before he was shot dead <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=628&amp;id=1161662003" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=628&amp;id=1161662003" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</li>
<li>Gerald (James) McKinney (34). Shot just after Gerald Donaghy. Witnesses stated that McKinney had been running behind Donaghy, and he stopped and held up his arms, shouting "Please don't shoot!", when he saw Donaghy fall. He was then shot in the chest.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></li>
<li>William A. McKinney (27). Shot from behind as he attempted to aid Gerald McKinney (no relation).

<p>Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another man later dying of his wounds. The official army position, backed by the British <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Secretary_407d.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a> the next day in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, was that the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute_Regiment_51c4.html" title="Parachute Regiment">Paratroopers</a> had reacted to the threat of gunmen and nail-bombs from suspected IRA members. However, all eye-witnesses (apart from the soldiers), including marchers, local residents, and British and Irish journalists present, maintain that soldiers fired into an unarmed crowd, or were aiming at fleeing people and those tending the wounded, whereas the soldiers themselves were not fired upon. No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or reported any injuries, nor were any bullets or nail-bombs recovered to back up their claims. In the rage that followed, irate crowds burned down the British embassy in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. Anglo-Irish relations hit one of their lowest ebbs, with <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_32fd.html" title="Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs">Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Hillery_3d20.html" title="Patrick Hillery">Patrick Hillery</a>, going specially to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in New York to demand UN involvement in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> "Troubles".</p>

Many of the Paratroopers who gave evidence at the Tribunal testified that they were told by their officers to expect a gunfight and had been encouraged to "get some kills". In the event, one man was witnessed by <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Edward_Daly_65d1.html" title="Bishop Edward Daly">Father Edward Daly</a> and others haphazardly firing a revolver in the direction of the paratroopers. Later identified as a member of the Official IRA, this man was also photographed in the act of drawing his weapon, but was apparently not seen or targeted by the soldiers. Various other claims have been made to the Saville Inquiry about gunmen on the day <a href="http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/transcripts/Archive/Ts008.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/transcripts/Archive/Ts008.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">It strikes me that the Army ran amok that day and shot without thinking what they were doing. They were shooting innocent people. These people may have been taking part in a march that was banned but that does not justify the troops coming in and firing live rounds indiscriminately. I would say without hesitation that it was sheer, unadulterated <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder_in_English_law_fc7c.html" title="Murder in English law">murder</a>.</td>

<p>Two days after Bloody Sunday, Parliament adopted a resolution for a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribunal.html" title="Tribunal">tribunal</a> into the events of the day, resulting in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Heath_fd9a.html" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a> commissioning the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales_a4ff.html" title="Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales">Lord Chief Justice</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Widgery%2C_Baron_Widgery_a6ee.html" title="John Widgery, Baron Widgery">Lord Widgery</a> to undertake it. Many witnesses intended to <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott.html" title="Boycott">boycott</a> the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly-produced report — completed within ten weeks (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">April 10</a>) and published within eleven (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">April 19</a>) — supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. Most Irish people and witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a whitewash. It is now widely accepted that the nail bombs photographed on Gerard Donaghy were planted there after his death, and firearms residue on some deceased came from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Nash) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation involved the use of lead-based <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solder.html" title="Solder">solder</a>.

A second commission of inquiry, chaired by <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Saville_5c95.html" title="Lord Saville">Lord Saville</a>, was established in January <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> to re-examine 'Bloody Sunday'.

The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report is currently being written. The Saville Inquiry is a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. The evidence so far has undermined to some extent the credibility of the original Widgery Tribunal report. Allegations were made that some bodies were placed next to guns and explosives, and other substances (including playing cards) have been found to cause <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_I_and_type_II_errors_c67e.html" title="Type I and type II errors">false positives</a> in tests for explosives. Some of the scientists responsible for the original reports to the Widgery Tribunal now dismiss the interpretations that were put on their findings by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Defence_%28United_Kingdom%29_f84c.html" title="Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)">Ministry of Defence</a>. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Saville_5c95.html" title="Lord Saville">Lord Saville</a> has declined to comment on the Widgery report and has made the point that the Saville Inquiry is a judicial inquiry into 'Bloody Sunday', not the Widgery Tribunal.</p>
<p>Evidence given by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_McGuiness_cbcc.html" title="Martin McGuiness">Martin McGuiness</a>, the deputy leader of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_F%C3%A9in_5dd5.html" title="Sinn Féin">Sinn Féin</a>, to the inquiry stated that he was second-in-command of the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry.html" title="Derry">Derry</a> branch of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_04d7.html" title="Provisional IRA">Provisional IRA</a> and was present at the march. He did not answer questions about where he had been staying because he said it would compromise the safety of the individuals involved.</p>
<p>A claim was made at the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saville_Inquiry_b4a5.html" title="Saville Inquiry">Saville Inquiry</a> that McGuinness was responsible for supplying detonators for nail bombs on Bloody Sunday. Paddy Ward claimed he was the leader of the <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_%C3%89ireann_69e1.html" title="Fianna Éireann">Fianna Éireann</a>, the youth wing of the IRA in January 1972. He claimed McGuinness, the second-in-command of the IRA in the city at the time, and another anonymous Provo gave him bomb parts on the morning of 30 January, the date planned for the civil rights march. He said his organisation intended to attack city-centre premises in Derry on the day when civilians were shot dead by British soldiers. In response McGuinness rejected the claims as "fantasy", while Gerry O’Hara, a Sinn Féin councillor in Derry stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

Over 1,000 army photographs and original army helicopter video footage were never made available. Additionally, guns used on the day by the soldiers that could have been evidence in the inquiry were lost<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> by the MoD.<sup id="_ref-Q.26A_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q.26A" title="">[17]</a></sup> The MoD claimed that all the guns had been destroyed, but some were subsequently recovered in various locations (such as <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_8171.html" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut.html" title="Beirut">Beirut</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock_68e9.html" title="Little Rock">Little Rock</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>) despite the obstruction.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the time the inquiry had retired to write up its findings, it had interviewed over 900 witnesses, over seven years, at a total cost of £155m,<sup id="_ref-Q.26A_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q.26A" title="">[17]</a></sup> making it the biggest investigation in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_the_United_Kingdom_4e13.html" title="Law of the United Kingdom">British legal</a> history. The cost of this process has drawn criticism. In June 2003, the cost incurred so far in pursuit of the inquiry was given as £113.2 million.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup> One year later in June 2004 the cost was given as £130 million.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup> The total cost is expected to be around £150 million.
