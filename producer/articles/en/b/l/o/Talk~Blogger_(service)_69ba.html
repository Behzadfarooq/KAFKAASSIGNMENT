<p>"<i>Direct posting to a Blogger site from Microsoft Word 2007.</i>"</p>
<p>Microsoft just seems to use the Blogger API, so I don't think this is a major Blogger feature. There are 100s of other tools that do the same, but they haven't been included have they&#160;? Also wasn't it supposed to be a "Other Features" (of Blogger) section. So removing it.--<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilki_5d6d.html" title="User:Milki">Milki</a> 00:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anybody know about the etymology of <i>blogger</i>? Is it indeed "a coined word created by Pyra Labs"? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherlin_8676.html" title="User:Christopherlin">Christopherlin</a> 07:30, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm pretty sure Ev coined the name for the Pyra service. For a while Pyra was all about "Pyra the app" and Blogger was just a little proof of concept thing they threw together. But the word "blogger" was probably in existence--I was around then but don't remember the chronology. "(We)blog" was a recent coinage; I don't remember if anyone extended it to "blogger" before Blogger but I suspect so. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 03:22, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think blog is a short form of weblog. And from there derived “blogger”.</p>
<p>I believe the primary understanding of the word blogger is someone who maintains a blog, the service provided by Pyra Labs is not that important. In my opinion this should be reflected in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But this article is about blogger.com the web publishing service founded by Pyra labs. If you want to start an article about "the concept of blogger" you could do that--but I suspect it will end up merged with <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a>. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b></dd>

<p>Am I mistaken in thinking that blogger is not a blog hosting service, but blogspot is? Blogger is the publishing software, and it doesn't care where the hosting service is. I think these should be un-conflated, but I'm not sure exactly how to characterize blogger itself, as opposed to blogspot. --<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 22:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, so blogspot doesn't (yet) have its own article, just a redirect. Blogspot is the hosting service affiliated with blogger.com, so I'm thinking something along the lines of a mention of blogspot in the lead. It's kind of not like how Wordpress.com has a separate article from WordPress, and TypePad from Movable Type. Should blogspot have a separate article, then? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherlin_8676.html" title="User:Christopherlin">Christopherlin</a> 03:03, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blogspot.com is a way for Blogger to distinguish againsts its own sub-domains, such as help.blogger.com etc. --&gt; it's instead of having it like blogger.com/blogspot/username. So, Blogger is web logging system - publishing and hosting. --joec89</dd>

<dd>Three points: (1) I am not sure we have anything encyclopedic (i.e., more than a dicdef) to say about "one who blogs," so I don't see that being a main article. Am I wrong? What would the content of Blogger-the-person be like? (2) Not all Blogger blogs are hosted on Blogspot. (3) I think it should be Blogger (web application) or Blogger (company). Some Blogger users never actually visit the website after they sign up--it's the service that is important, not the site.

<li><b>Oppose</b>, As said, Blogger could define a person who blogs. --<b><a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYongblood_97e9.html" title="User:Yongblood"><font color="#006633">yongblood</font></a></b> 17:12, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Further Comment</b>: Then, I see, there is an overall consensus for changing the name of the article to <b>Blogger (insert something here)</b>. I think maybe Blogger (service) is the best - it could then refer to the web service that allows one to make and publish blogs, or the service then the allows people to host their blogs on Blogspot. The problem is actually, I hear much more people say "go to my <i>Blogger</i>" than go to my <i>Blogspot</i>. We should address both of them in one article, -putting them in two seperate ones would be confusing. Also, as another side note, I believe Pyra Labs coined the term "Blogger" before the term came into widespread usage among speakers of the English language - correct me if I'm wrong. Pyra Labs was founded in 1999, and the term "blogger" began to be used widely starting from approximately 2003-2004.–- <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKungming2_bd1a.html" title="User:Kungming2"><b><font color="#0000FF">kungming·2</font></b></a> | <a href="../../../k/u/n/User_talk%7EKungming2_b479.html" title="User talk:Kungming2"><font color="#999999"><sup>(Talk</sup></font></a>·<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Kungming2_0eb5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Kungming2"><font color="#999999">Contact)</font></a></sup> 17:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'd say it should be moved to Blogger (website) because it does not have .com in its name and as mentioned above, 'blogger' is a general term for someone who blogs. Perhaps redirect 'blogger' to 'blog' with a 'Blogger redirects here...' top disambiguation on top of blog. In any case, this is a tough one. -<a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewkai_5a1b.html" title="User:Newkai">newkai</a> | <a href="../../../n/e/w/User_talk%7ENewkai_0287.html" title="User talk:Newkai">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Newkai_916c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Newkai">contribs</a> 19:59, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps a better redirect for <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogger.html" title="Blogger">blogger</a> would simply be to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a> (rather than a stub "one who blogs").

<dd>That's true, and it's a good idea - but here we're trying to determine the moving of the Blogger.com site itself, though the term "blogger" is now of importance as well. Blogging has received so much attention in recent times that any changes made will certainly be really big.

<dd>I think a dab page is the way to go instead of a redirect. Most people entering that search term will be looking for Blogger the app, I think, and be surprised when they go to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>. How about this as a dab page:
<ul>
<li>A <i>blogger</i> is someone who maintains a <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">weblog</a>.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogger_%28service%29.html" title="Blogger (service)">Blogger</a></i> is a weblog publishing service owned by Google.</li>
</ul>

<p>BPV786 06:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I concur. The "Problems" section does ring a little biased. The writing sounds puerile to my ears. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"But soon enough, Blogger is working properly and bloggers can resume their blogging activities."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is great for informal conversation, but writing like this has no business being here. It sounds like an excerpt from a 6th grade composition. I myself am a blogger, and have never heard "bloggered" applied to Blogger. Nor have I heard of stability problems beyond what is normal for a large website. It would be nice to have some kind of citation. At least a human being to say "Yeah, I've experienced this problem and think it's noteworthy."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Can someone please confirm this? If we can't get confirmation of "Problems", I move that the entire section be deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>sliver Mon Jan 22 03:54:10 UTC 2007</dd>
</dl>
<p>The "Problems" section is certainly amateurish. However, the use of the "bloggered" expression is easily confirmed by an internet search. A current problem is the "previous posts bug": users who migrate to the new version of Blogger find that the "previous posts" function on an item page lists the most recent ten posts, not the ten posts before the item in question. This can be worked around by changing to hierarchical archives, but only at the cost of losing one's template customizations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I actually added the point of the new "problems" with Blogger, specifically with the change-over to Blogger Beta, which means that certain features that worked with Old Blogger don't quite work the same, especially when it comes to template editing, but got ditched alongside all the other problems (although it was probably my fault for not citing).
