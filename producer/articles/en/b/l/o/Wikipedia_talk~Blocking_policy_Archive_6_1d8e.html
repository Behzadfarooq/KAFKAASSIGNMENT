<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bothering good editors</span></h2>
<p>This probably won't fly on wp-en, but on wp-de apparently it's acceptable to block someone if they're disturbing good editors and keeping them from contributing at their normal rate. Since we are writing an encyclopedia, not creating a community, this makes sense.... if some account appears, contributes no content, and just goes around antagonizing well-meaning editors, right now it is difficult to block them if they know 'the rules' and are careful not to make actual personal attacks, violate 3RR, do anything that fits under disruption, etc.</p>
<p>Why not allow blocking of people who contribute nothing or essentially nothing to articles, but contribute a great deal of argumentative comments? --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 13:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be wary of doing this due to the potential for abuse. I think the existing ability to block for disruption or community ban for general stupidity covers these problems. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 03:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> on this. It would be very hard to define any clear rules, and users would probably waste more time dealing with arguments than simply reverting bad editors in the existing way.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMaggs_3ae0.html" title="User:MichaelMaggs">MichaelMaggs</a> 18:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Google Web Accelerator</span></h2>
<p>I was recently getting messages saying I was blocked because somebody was using my IP address for vandalism; I found this wholly unlikely because my IP is static. If I clicked "Edit this page" several times, I'd be allowed to do so. Moreover, the IP address listed was not my own; I used some DNS tools and the IP is used by Google. I found that by disabling Google Web Accelerator, I haven't run into any problems, though it could just be a coincidence. Perhaps this is worth noting somewhere... more official so that other users can benefit from this. If its already been mentioned, then I guess I just didn't look hard enough. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Whitaker_a3ac.html" title="User:Douglas Whitaker">Douglas Whitaker</a> 04:37, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the correct solution is to use "Don't Accelerate These Sites" feature within GWA and add WP to the list of unaccelerated sites. Obviously GWA will pick up blocked IPs over time so this step will be needed for all WP users who elect to use GWA (until Google figures it out and automatically removes WP from its acceleration list). <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 12:45, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd have to agree wholeheartedly on this. I was thinking about what the implications were, and allowing GWA didn't seem all that good of an idea. If it is indeed the cases of using GWA, I think this should be made much more public so other users can find out about this. --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglas_Whitaker_a3ac.html" title="User:Douglas Whitaker">Douglas Whitaker</a> 22:51, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Google Web Accelerator sets the <a href="../../../x/f/f/XFF_ca3f.html" title="XFF">X-Forwarded-For</a>: HTTP header, which indicates the user's original IP address. Is the MediaWiki code not making use of that fact? Obviously you don't always want to trust X-Forwarded-For, since a hooligan could set their own on non-proxied connections. But you <i>do</i> want to trust it for known proxies. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>GWA doesn't proxy POST requests, so it can't be used for vandalism. The problem comes when a blocked user requests an edit page with GET, then the autoblocker will block the proxy. Subsequent requests for edit pages from the same proxy will show a block message. A POST request would work just fine if the user was able to download the form to post. Indeed we do use the XFF header for known proxies, see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/XFF_project" class="extiw" title="m:XFF_project">m:XFF project</a>, but at the moment, we don't have a list of GWA proxies. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> 07:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">policy on the "community ban"</span></h2>
<p>As the policy is <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Users_who_exhaust_the_community.27s_patience" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">currently written</a>, a community ban comes about by:</p>
<ol>
<li>an editor is blocked ("a user....finds themselves blocked")</li>
<li>there is supposed to be a way of showing that there is "widespread community support for the block" and notice of the block is given at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a></li>
<li>If there is community support for the block then the user is considered banned and is listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_banned_users_3583.html#Banned_by_the_Wikipedia_community" title="Wikipedia:List of banned users">Wikipedia:List of banned users#Banned by the Wikipedia community</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, community bans do not always follow the written policy. Practice now seems to include this path to a community ban:</p>
<ol>
<li>someone suggests at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a> that a ban be imposed on a Wikipedia editor.</li>
<li>If there is consensus at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a> for such a ban, then the newly banned editor is listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_banned_users_3583.html#Banned_by_the_Wikipedia_community" title="Wikipedia:List of banned users">Wikipedia:List of banned users#Banned by the Wikipedia community</a></li>
<li>The banned editor is blocked</li>
</ol>
<p>This second path to a community ban seems very different than what is in the written policy. I think an effort needs to be made to put it into written policy.</p>
<p>I think an effort should also be made to have a simple way to trace the history of each community ban back through what should be a totally transparent process of establishing community consensus. As things stand, it is difficult to trace back through to the origin of some community bans. For example, <a href="../../../p/o/o/User_talk%7EPoolGuy_c60c.html" title="User talk:PoolGuy">User talk:PoolGuy</a> seems to provide an example a decision to ban an editor that was made while the editor was not blocked. In this case, I can find no discussion or notice of the ban/block at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a>. Part of the problem in making sense of past community bans is that many banned users edit from multiple accounts.</p>
<p>Another way that practice seems to have diverged from the original intent of the written policy is in terms of judging community consensus. A specific recent example of a community ban is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=65635749#Hardvice_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29_and_FurryiamIAM_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;oldid=65635749#Hardvice_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29_and_FurryiamIAM_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In that case, the community ban was suggested at 18:21, 24 July 2006. The community ban was put into effect at about 21:54, 24 July 2006 after one other Wikipedian agreed to the "community" ban. If establishing "widespread community support" for community bans is no longer relevant, then the written policy should state this explicitly. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 18:33, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your point is well taken. Community bans should meet the standard of broad community support. I found the posting for the PoolGuy ban on AN at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive46#User:PoolGuy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive46#User:PoolGuy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It appears that one Admin proposed a ban at 05:56, 25 June 2006 (UTC). Only one other Admin stated support just eleven hours later at 14:56, 25 June 2006 (UTC). After that the first Admin imposed the permanent ban within 1 hour and 20 minutes at 16:16, 25 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are correct that <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a> was not blocked at the time and was editing with one account as ArbCom had suggested. PoolGuy was asking for attention to an issue that ArbCom had not addressed. The banning resulted in PoolGuy's issue not being addressed, and as a result of his persistence in seeing the issue addressed he continues to post the issue in numerous places to seek Admin attention with no end in sight.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It appears that this turned into an example of <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>. By banning PoolGuy the Admins created the situation they were trying to avoid. Addressing the issue brought up would have resolved it, without the need for taxing Admin time managing a banned user, when the banning was rushed without adequate discourse to determine if that was the best option of dealing with the user. This is another great example of users and Admins who do not follow written policy actually creating more issues than they resolve. <a href="../../../l/i/k/User%7ELikeNow_634b.html" title="User:LikeNow">LikeNow</a> 01:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ahh yes, the PoolGuy example. If I recall, he's vandalized ANI, he has about 100 sockpuppets, spammed dozens of userpages, and harassed those that had to deal with him. I've watched him bug pschemp constantly. I'm not surprised that he's yet to find an admin who really wants to unblock any of his accounts. He was under sanctions by the arbitration commitee, and under probation against disruptive editing of articles. His sockpuppet, GoldToeMarionetee picked up where poolguy left off (rather than peaceful editing) by spamming a couple dozen user talk pages with requests to vote stack. 3 administrators were in favor of a ban, along with the bunches of other ones who've had to block his floods of sockpuppets that probably agree by enforcing said community. There's no reasoning with poolguy, as he's yet to accept the block of a his alternate account who exhibited the same behavior as before with disruptive editing. He got his chance when the arbitration committee gave him a free pass to create a new account and peacefully edit, and blew it with attempt at votestacking immediately with the new account. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 20:35, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As it is certainly not the most common type of block given out, I've bumped the section down from the top of the list where it previously resided. In addition, I've changed the name from 'General blocking principle', which I think implies it is more all-encompassing than it is in actuality, to 'Legal protection', which seems to more accurately describe its origins (the privacy policy).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Cool down" blocks</span></h2>
<p>I have seen this type of block, generally a 1 or 2 hour block with an summary such as "time to cool down", more and more lately. I can't help but think that this is used as a tool to silence civil discussion. The policy already clearly states: "Blocks for disruption should only be placed when a user is in some way making it difficult for others to contribute to Wikipedia." A civil discussion in an appropriate venue will never make it difficult for others to contribute. If a person's argument descends into personal attacks or incivility, thats already covered under policy, but to block someone because they continue to argue a point, or are in the minority, doesn't make sense. What's more it almost certainly will never accomplish its stated goal. I think the policy needs to clearly state that "Cool down" blocks are <b>never</b> acceptable. What does the community think? —<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey">Nate Scheffey</a> 22:02, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that, in cases where the user is making personal attacks, ranting or something like that, a "cool down" block does make sense, however a lot of blocks I've seen don't reflect this. If anything, it often serves to inflame the issue even more by agitating the blocked user, and it could easily lead to accusations of admin power abuse if the blocked user is a regular editor, or at the very least the perception in the editor that they'll be blocked again if they continue to argue their point. That's never a good thing and leads to editors who distrust admins. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatbag_b817.html" title="User:Catbag">Catbag</a> 22:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I completely agree with all of your points. What I am proposing would not affect personal attacks in any way, as that is clearly covered by policy.

<dd>I agree. Feedback is important to WP. If it is silenced by blocks for no reason at all, surely a) important feedback will not get through and b) people are entitled to their opinions (and have a right to express them); how can a person be blocked simply because his/her opinion differs with the rest?</dd>
<dd>I think cool-down blocks are quite useful, and are preferable to simply declaring "disruption" and letting the chips fall where they may. If they're abused, then the abuser can and will be challenged for their actions. As far as "distrusting admins" is concerned, who cares? As long as we allow anyone to edit -- and I'm not suggesting here that we stop -- then we'll have plenty of people with authority issues who are going distrust admins no matter what we do.

<dd>Good examples, and those are the kinds of situations where blocking is a really bad idea and is inflammatory. Most of the time, the difference between incivility and tenacity are quite clear. Honestly, 1-3 hour blocks seem rather silly to me; clearly notify the user that they're being incivil and if they continue, block for a longer time. I don't like the idea that blocks should be substitutions for warnings, and I <b>really</b> don't like the idea of admins inadvertently breeding mistrust in users. Thus, I wholeheartedly support putting in this clarification. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatbag_b817.html" title="User:Catbag">Catbag</a> 02:15, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. I see no reason to codify this. It is not a good to limit admins ability to calm down heated arguments. Someone going on and on about an issue is being disruptive and should be blocked. Putting something like this in place would just give the blocked person a chance to go "Look, it says here I shouldn't be blocked for arguing my point civilly over and over again".

<dd>We have policies on when to block users, and most of them are fairly unambiguous. Dragging on a discussion is not one of them. If this is in any doubt on <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> we should codify it very clearly. And while not technically a block, I find Nandesuka's protection of Jeff's talk page an almost desysoppable abuse of admin powers. Editors have the right to write 1000kB essays on their user pages venting against policies, as long as they don't breach any of the other conduct rules in the process. it's absolutely not any admin's business to stop them or prevent them from "hurting themselves". ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:15, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I cannot come out against "cool down" blocks <i>when properly applied</i>. However, too often it's just code for "I don't like what you're saying, so I'm taking away your ability to say it". And yeah, that does far more harm than good. If someone is actually being <i>disruptive</i>, go ahead and block for disruption. The above examples were bad blocks. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 23:51, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a tricky issue. For the most part I detest blocks in general for anyone who isn't clearly <i>trying</i> to damage the encyclopedia (vandalism, copyright violation, active attempts to disrupt with no good intent, et cetera). Generally if a user is arguing for what they honestly think to be right I would prefer <b>not</b> to block them... but sometimes there is no choice (mass edit warring, personal attacks which are getting <i>other</i> users worked up, wholesale disruption, et cetera). Short of that I think gentle warnings, calm discussion and just <i>being helpful when there is little to no reason NOT to</i> produce vastly better results. That said, I must admit to having seen cool down blocks 'work' in the past... but only in the sense of the person going away and actually cooling down <b>despite</b> the block - which they invariably find an unjustified form of censorship (even if it actually isn't).</dd>
<dd>So on this 'no cool down blocks' idea... add a caveat. If the discussion is <i>really</i> getting so heated that a cool down period is required... block 'em all.&#160;:] Probably not a viable option, but it exposes the problem with these blocks. They are almost invariably made by admins against users they disagree with. Which will often <i>be</i> inequitable, and <b>always</b> look that way. I'd like to see the 'do not block those you are in an edit war with' be expanded to 'do not block those you are in a disagreement (of any kind) with'. You suggest saying 'cool down blocks are never acceptable', but '3RR blocks' and some temporary 'vandalism blocks' could be described as 'cool down' blocks. I think what you are going for is that 'blocks of users who have argued something strongly, but not engaged in widespread incivility or personal attacks are never acceptable'... and I think that's implied already, but obviously others read different 'implications'. I think the 'grey area' is when there has been a consensus (though that's subject to interpretation too) and someone continues to argue against it... at some point that <i>does</i> become 'disruption' regardless of the validity of the decision. Overall I think a clarification of 'disruption' is what is needed. If people are able to walk away from the discussion and the user doesn't 'follow' them to restart it elsewhere then it isn't 'disruption'... or it's disruption by both sides. It takes two to argue. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 02:23, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're confusing cause and effect. Getting the editor(s) to cool down is one of the desired effects of a block, but it should never be an acceptable cause. For this we have 3RR, NPA, vandalism, etc., and as long as the arguing editors don't step out of the bounds created by our conduct policies it's not the admins' business to curb the discussion. Our policies mention repeatedly that discussion is the first level of dispute resolution, so any block for contrarian but civil discussion, no matter how long it drags out, goes directly against the text and intent of our policies. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 04:20, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand your concern, but I do think there is a point at which it becomes untrue. The blocking policy, rightly, includes the fact that it may be required to block someone for 'disrupting the normal operation of Wikipedia'. If there is a discussion on any page which is used for regular business (AN/I, AfD, VP, et cetera) and someone refuses to let it go after a clear consensus has been achieved... clogs up the page so that it is difficult to get other work done... starts inserting the dispute into other discussions... et cetera, then that <i>is</i> disruption and the user ought to be warned to stop and blocked if they don't. Note, of course, that if users 'on the other side' are still arguing the point too then they are every bit as responsible for the actual disruption and ought to be treated in kind - as I said, it takes two to argue. On the other hand, if the dispute is on a user talk page, a separate discussion page set up for that dispute only, or some other such locale that isn't needed for 'regular business' then I agree that it can't be causing any disruption and users should be able to say their peace until they are done with it... so long as they don't start 'exporting' the dispute to other locales. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:42, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it's clogging up the works, why not move it to a subpage or into user talk or an RfC? If the person persists in moving the discussion back to the originating page, block him/her for edit warring. Otherwise, maybe that person will get the hint. I just really think that there are alternatives that represent a tiny investment of extra effort by the community, which could have substantial benefits. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 14:10, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>it may be required to block someone for 'disrupting the normal operation of Wikipedia'</i>. I think that's a very sweeping interpretation of that clause, and the reason why we're discussing a less ambiguous statement about "cool-down" blocks. In my interpretation "disrupting normal operation" means removing AfD tags, blanking or vandalizing an article under AfD, changing other editors' votes, sockpuppeteering, reverting AfD decisions, etc. Excessive discussion can be dealt with in other ways, e.g. by moving it from the main to the talk page, as <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> said. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:58, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>These concerns are why I clearly stated in the original proposal "a civil discussion in an appropriate venue". I think trialsanderrors and Capt gave good examples of how to deal with situations where a user is disrupting a public area. Also, in the blocks I noted, it was never suggested that the discussion be moved somewhere else.

<p>(undented) To throw my two cents in at this late time, I don't think the "cool-down" blocks are a good idea; they are at best punitive and will almost never solve a problem. If a user is disrupting or edit-warring, fine, these are already explictly blockable offenses. However, there is this phenomenon I have seen a few times where one editor is acting <i>a little</i> rambunctiously, then gets hit with a curt reply of "cool down", "NPA" or "AGF", and this (understandably) angers the other user and typically escalates the conflict. I see potential for abuse here, and I am particularly reminded of that scene in <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anger_Management_1973.html" title="Anger Management">Anger Management</a> where Sandler is making reasonable requests of the flight attendants, and they essentially go all "AGF" on him, which ends up with his being tasered... I have seen the scenario erupt several times that one user is acting in good faith but is being overly brusque, at which time said user is hit on seventeen sides by "AGF"s and the like, the whole scene gets escalated, and someone gets blocked. <i>Much</i> better is, if someone has worded a reasonable statement a bit harshly, to deal with the content of the statement. In any case, it should <i>never</i> be a blockable offense for someone to carry on a impassioned debate as long as they are not disrupting, using personal attacks, etc., even when (or perhaps especially when) a majority which happens to contain an admin disagrees. Discussions can always be archived. -- <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 19:06, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where an editor is politely asked by an administrator to tone down serious personal attacks and responds with more of the same, especially where the response is completely inappropriate to the request, I think "cool down" blocks are a good idea because here we see clear evidence that the editor isn't thinking clearly and, if he goes for an uninvolved administrator, he's not likely to stop being disruptive.</p>
<p>Where an editor is making very seriously disruptive attacks or accusations, a cool down block may also be merited.</p>
<p>Both of these cases should be treated with care. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 04:38, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If a person is violating <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, block him for that. Otherwise, move the discussion to the Village Pump or an RfC, or to a relevant talk page.

<dd>In that case, wouldn't it be appropriate to block that editor for disruption, directly?

</dl>
<p>I've been watching the discussion on "cool down" blocks both here and on AN/ANI. I think "cool down" is being used as a reason because the policy page has grown too large, and restrictive. If blocking someone for "disruption", it's difficult for a block to stand unless the admin cites chapter and verse to support themselves. I've created a sub page at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_Simplified_85ba.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Simplified">Wikipedia:Blocking_policy/Simplified</a>, with how I think this policy could be drastically simplified. I don't want to waste a lot of Wikipedia space with this sort of this, so I've already prod'd it myself.

<dd>I like it. Working on it as a simplified guideline to the 'why' as opposed to the 'what' - reasons why are a lot more memorable, especially if put in a sentence, and if the 'why' is clear then the 'what' is just details that can be looked up. Such pages are (a) much more likely to actually be read by people (b) much less susceptible to wikilawyering. I submit that the blocking policy page will be <i>particularly</i> susceptible to this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the 'why' is kept separate from the 'what', it should be reasonably easy to refactor the present blocking policy page into this format without losing any important detail.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One thing to keep in mind here: changing this page won't automatically change how people behave. Expecting this will lead to disappointment, and probably the sort of reversion that has 'wtf' as the edit summary - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 10:47, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think this was about throughtcrime at all (it was removed for that reason), but maybe clarification is in order.

<dd>Yes, I think so. A block of this nature has great potential for igniting a wheel war. And has potential to generate negative publicity itself.

<dd>I strongly object to this. First, in various places in the world, things like oral sex and homosexuality are criminalized sexual practices. What Fred Bauder means here is "pedophilia". Second, he added this for a reason: see <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERookiee_acb7.html" title="User:Rookiee">User:Rookiee</a>. Looking at that situation, <i>in effect</i> this addition means that people attracted to children can be blocked if they admit to it or if they say that they support its legalisation. With this clause, an editor can be blocked for nothing more than stating their biases on a userpage, provided that certain hysterical websites think that those biases reflect badly on Wikipedia (see <a href="http://www.perverted-justice.com/opinions/?article=14" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.perverted-justice.com/opinions/?article=14" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>).

<dd>I would support blocking people who admit that they have molested children, are currently molesting children, are thinking about molesting children in real life or if they advocate pedophilia. Wikipedia is not completely neutral and should not be. Otherwise we would have to talk about murder, child abuse, pedophilia and genocide as if they are legitimate, neutral actions. It is wrong to have sex with children and that's it. It is not comparable to being gay. I do not think that a hundred years from now that people will accept pedophilia and think that we were intolerant of pedophiles. That is not to say that it is okay to mistreat pedophiles, just that what they do is wrong.</dd>
<dd>As for admitting that they are a pedophile without acting upon it, I am not sure. I would strongly suggest that they keep it to themselves and their therapists, if they have one, as long as they are able to control themselves. However, I am leaning towards banning them if they admit it because of the public relations damage. Giving pedophiles the right to be "out" and to edit Wikipedia is not worth the risk to the project, and it is not Wikipedia's place to counter the hysteria surrounding pedophilia. Perhaps a warning for people to not reveal their pedophile status or joke about being a pedophile because they risk being banned would be appropriate. I suggest that bestiality be treated in the same manner, as it is almost as universally condemned as pedophilia and is also wrong because of the harm to the animals, physically and/or emotionally. I think that it would be better if people did not reveal other sexual information either, such as being straight, bisexual, gay, transsexual or into sadomasochism, bondage or cross-dressing, but I doubt that that would happen. That information is not helpful in the building of the encyclopedia. If the person just says that they have knowledge (not just personal) about these topics, that would be somewhat useful. It is bizarre to me that people to discuss their sexuality on their user page, and I think Wikipedia would be classier and taken more seriously without that information. You would never find it on the profiles of other encyclopedias' writers or editors or any other respectable publication I can think of. Wikipedia user pages should not be treated as a blog or social networking site. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 18:42, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're getting too broad here - would you ban <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Singer_cbda.html" title="Peter Singer">Peter Singer</a> from contributing? I can accept that people shouldn't use their userpages for relating illegal acts they have done or are planning on doing.

<dd>I want to take this away from pedophilia for a second to give some context. Would Wikipedia start banning users who admit to smoking marijuana on their userpage? How about advocate for the legalization of it? While gay marriage is not "illegal" (is it?), could someone then be banned for advocating that since its counter to the law (law says they can't)? While I agree that Wikipedia and user pages are not places to advocate for your person opinions as they are not "homepages", you are almost removing what alot of people are in support of from being talked about as anyone can take a comment like "legalize pot" and state the person is breaknig the rules by advocating it. I have no opinion on that user in aprticular, but the idea should not be placed into apolicy and should instead be handled case by case to prevent abuse and censorship. Yes I know this is not a free speech forum, but why drive away people when in reality its not hurting the encyclopedia in most cases. Sorry for the book. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 12:55, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Singer is a lot different than someone who says that they have sex with animals. He says that it is unnatural, but that there is nothing wrong with it as long as the animal is not harmed. I do not think that it is possible to shield the animal from all harm, especially with certainty, as most animals are unable to tell us what they are feeling (some apes can communicate with humans). Small animals are often killed during intercourse and large animals may not be compatible with humans sexually and may also be mentally harmed.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, my main reason for banning non-practicing pedophiles is the public relations problem of them contributing to the encyclopedia and even being a person of authority, such as an admin, bureaucrat or steward (someone could keep it a secret until they are promoted). If they are practicing pedophiles, there is also the problem of using Wikipedia to molest or harass children. As I mentioned before, I would include zoophiles, but let's ignore that for now. The vast majority of people are not ready to accept pedophilia as right or normal, so whether it is wrong or not is not the only factor. If it could damage the encyclopedia by revealing it, it should not be revealed. For other paraphilias, like transsexualism, sadomasochism, necrophilia, bondage or cross-dressing, and orientations, like heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality, I think it is best to not mention it because it has nothing to do with building an encyclopedia. For example, being heterosexual does not make you an authority on heterosexuality. More importantly, admitting that you practice a sexual activity that is highly controversial can be disruptive to Wikipedia's goal of building an encyclopedia, depending on people's opinions and in some cases biases. In fairness and because it also does not help in building an encyclopedia, I do not think sexual practices considered normal should be mentioned, either. However, mentioning these things would <b>not</b> lead to banning. They would just be a breach of etiquette. Disruptive advocacy, whether "normal" or not, like putting inappropriate things in articles or talk pages might lead to banning however.</dd>
<dd>As for banning pot users/advocates, that is very different. People do not have the same outrage for pot smoking as they do about pedophilia and it does not intrinsically involve child abuse ("intrinsically" because children can be harmed by women smoking when pregnant or being around pot smokers, and they can harm children by spending needed funds on pot, neglecting their children because of the fatigue and apathy that it causes and setting a bad example). We would not ban people for advocating something that is illegal in at least one country in the world. We would ban them for advocating something when it is disruptive to building an encyclopedia by its nature, like pedophilia, or by the method of advocacy. We probably do not need a specific rule for this. Something like, "Users may be banned if they cause disruption through the advocacy of any position, belief or activity when the disruption is foreseeable to any reasonable person or when the user has been asked to stop. Advocacy may be disruptive by the nature of the thing being advocated and by the method of advocacy." I might be able to come up with something better later. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 14:10, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we are agreeing here in principle, that the act is wrong, however make a general policy/rule that supporting or advocating an illegal act is grounds for punishment/blocking/banning etc. Since you too see the problem with it extending to things such as "pot smokers" etc. This would also actually extend to graffiti artists and anyone advocating or supporting software piracy further. So a case by case situation seems best compared to a general rule. The one you made up seems very porous, if I see pot smoking as offensive then anyone advocating it can be banned, it basically leaves the door wide open and the claimant simply has to say "I'm offended" --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">NuclearUmpf</a> 14:57, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think if we follow logical reasoning it is the person who wants something removed from an article who has to make the new, separate entry on Wikipedia as other editors are most likely not going to be watching that article 24/7 and as time goes by many other edits to the article might have been done, making it more difficult to discover what has been removed from the article.</p>

<dd>Overall I like this much better than the current page. One discordant element is that 'disruption' is treated as a class of blockable offenses including vandalism, usernames, bots, et cetera in section 1.2... but listed separately from those issues in section 5.2. Obviously there are many other forms of disruption so maybe that's intentional, but it doesn't 'line up' neatly. I should note that this doesn't include 'incivility' or 'personal attacks' amongst the specifically listed types of disruption... I tend to think those are heavily over-used (when there is no real impairment of anyone's ability to contribute), but they are the most frequently cited reasons for 'disruption' and 'cooling off' blocks so it is going to be an issue if people keep getting blocked for them on a daily basis and there is nothing specific in the policy on it. I might also move 'biographies of living persons' from the 'disruption' section up to 'protection' because the goal there is more to protect Wikipedia than stop something which is preventing users from contributing. Anyway, minor issues. Thumbs up from me regardless of these. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 11:28, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think my views on incivility blocks are well outside the mainstream (I'd say that except in <i>extreme</i> cases, BigDaddy777 comes to mind, they often do more harm than good) so I'd probably not be the best choice for putting in the phrasing on that issue. Just wanted to note that it needed <i>something</i>. Your idea of wording about them possibly being controversial, due to differing views on when such behaviour becomes significantly disruptive, seems fine. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 13:47, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think a big question is, how do we deal with it? I think the short term blocks (under 12 hrs) are more contested simply because they criteria for them is so low...what one admin sees as a 15 min offense another might not see an offense at all. Whereas when an admin levies a 24 hour block, the offense is usually much more serious and more self-explanitory. So, do we suggest that under 12 hr blocks be discouraged as they're more likely to be contraversial? Or do we suggest that blocks under 12 hrs <i>not</i> be overturned except in extreme circumstances, as <i>that</i> is likely to result in contraversy? --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 14:27, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocking talk pages</span></h2>
<p><i>Nandesuka</i> has taken it upon himself to ban further discussion on the publicgirluk discussion page, moreover he jumped at absolutely civil comments I had made elsewhere on the issue within seconds calling them trolling, threatening to ban me, and removing questions I left on the talk pages of other admins of his own accord. I see above that this is not the first time he has blocked a usertalk page, and he seems to be trying to censor discussion where he pleases. Checking the admin histories I found that he has dished out more indefinite bans than almost any admin on WP. My question is <b>does admin have the right to block usertalks simply at a point where he is disinclined to the existence of further discussion</b>? Secondly, <b>does admin have the right to delete questions left on third-party usertalks</b>? Thirdly, <b>is there no system of monitoring the frequency of indefinite blocks admins give to ward against the trigger happy</b>?

<dd>How about "Editors who repeatedly insert material critical of a living person anywhere on Wikipedia may be blocked [under the disruption provision of this policy|for violating BLP] if..."?

<dd>I think it is best to keep it in the context of BLP. Critical material is not barred <i>per se</i>. The need for context, proportion, sensitivity, balance and fidelity to substantial sources is paramount. When these are violated, it becomes problematic. "Unsourced negative material" could be amended to include an inappropriate use of a source to disaparage the subject, but I can't think of a neat wording right now. The case which instigated this involved an interpretion of the source, which went further than what was literally stated by the source. This was where the problem arose. Also the use of such material in isolation and out of the context of a balanced article is to be discouraged. One has to imagine the effect on an individual discovering such material through a google search, for example. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 16:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the case Tyrenius mentions, I was surprised to see BLP applied to a user talk page. Since per Jimbo's email to Tyrenius this is correct, I think this should be addressed somehow. The whole paragraph I recommend is:
<dl>
<dd>Editors who repeatedly insert material critical of a living person anywhere on Wikipedia may be blocked [reason here, either "under the disruption provision of this policy" or "for violating BLP"] if, in the opinion of the blocking admin, the material is unsourced, or incorrectly sourced, and may constitute defamation. Blocks made for this reason are designed to keep the material off the page until it is written and sourced in accordance with the content policies, including WP:BLP, and should therefore be kept short in the first instance. Repeated infractions should attract longer blocks. Warning and block templates may be placed on the user's talk page: {{blp1}}, {{blp2}}, and {{blp3}}. See [either "the section on disruption above" or "BLP"].</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>We may also need to clarify whether this applies to all living individuals, or only those who have articles in the encyclopedia, or all living individuals except active editors, or something. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 16:47, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's fine with me, but it does seem to imply immediate removal of at least some personal attacks, and blocking for at least some personal attacks.

<ul>
<li>Ah, no, not entirely what I meant - the principle is the same but the effect differs. For real-world famous people, negative info is ok only if sourced, and personal info is ok if sourced. Both are to be removed otherwise, and replacing that is often grounds for blocking. For editors, negative info is never really ok, and personal info is never really ok either unless the editor doesn't mind - for reasons of cyberstalking etc. The former is grounds for troutwhacking, the latter can be grounds for an immediate ban for harassment. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 17:59, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because BLP deals with the encyclopedia and NPA deals with the community and never the twain shall meet. I'm all for removing personal attacks, but citing BLP as the reason weakens BLP and confuses the issue. If I think another editor is a semi-literate POV pushing crank, thats quite possibly defamtory, but it could easily be true. Getting to the heart of such matters is difficult and opaque. Citing a reliable source about a notable living person should be clear and unequivocal. Pretending they are the same thing is a bad precedent. —<a href="../../../n/s/c/User%7ENscheffey_0fe4.html" title="User:Nscheffey">Nate Scheffey</a> 01:03, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Automated, incremental banning system</span></h2>
<p>Sorry if this is a naive question, but can the block durations not be automated and incremental? For example the admin’s job would only be to hit the “block” button, and a first-offence block would then be for 15 minutes, then 1 hour for a second, then 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year. This would keep admins from handing out indefinite blocks where they may not be justified, and at the same time they would be policemen rather than judges handing out sentences - a task they can hardly all be wise enough to do judiciously. People would not be written off of the wikipedia project altogether for attracting the wrath of an admin, for finding themselves in a once-off vandalistic mood or getting otherwise carried away. 2) The user would have a sign on their userpage notifying them of the number of times they have been banned and the duration of the next ban, as well as any reference to the fact that they are currently protesting a previous ban. Is this possible? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendel%27s_mother_f243.html" title="User:Grendel's mother">grendelsmother</a> 16:42, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the repeat factor, and delay between repeated offenses, is only one of many factors that could influence a block length. While some could be easily automated, others (e.g. that depend on the type of offense) are more discretionary and require 'judgment' that we hope the admin would be able to wisely employ. The bottom line is that blocks are usually much more discretionary than automatic. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:05, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had no intention of the <i>block</i> being automated, but the <i>duration</i> of the block being automated. It would still be up to the admin to block, but for a first offence, say, an unreasonably long, or indefinite block would be impossible. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendel%27s_mother_f243.html" title="User:Grendel's mother">grendelsmother</a> 20:00, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It goes without saying "Mary I know you live at xxx and I'm coming to kill you if you revert me", or other cases of truly sinister malintent unarguably receive the year-block; being WP what it is however, I think 1) there are very few cases fit for indef. block, and 2) everyone should be allowed several chances. There are people who "play" with (i.e vandalise) WP now and again for years before seeing the real merit of it and "switching over", and it should be easy for them to do so. In the case of 1), Admins are human too, get pissed off and start dishing out unfair blocks, this creates a risky heirarchical system (which, if healthy today, could be heinous tomorrow) and an atmosphere of intimidation that is certainly not what one expects when they start editing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendel%27s_mother_f243.html" title="User:Grendel's mother">Grendel's mother</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrendel%27s_mother_f763.html" title="User talk:Grendel's mother">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grendel%27s_mother_fb2f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grendel's mother">contribs</a>) 20:33, 28 September, 2006.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that if admins started 'dishing out unfair blocks' on a routine basis it would be unhealthy. This is why we have a fairly tight system for screening admin candidates by the community, and why we allow each block to be reviewed by other admins. This way, even if someone lost his/her cool the offended party would have redress. In my own experience a totally improper block is extremely rare, but if it ever happens it should be easy to correct. I doubt very much that an automaton meting out blocks or even suggesting block durations would help in any way. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:31, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah. Remember that the strong discouragement of undoing another admin's blocks without checking with them was a band-aid on the problem of some admins just not taking other admins seriously, this creating a playground for trolls. 3RR has an explicit "sorry I did wrong I'll be good please unblock" thing where a blocked person can ask any admin handy, but I'm not sure how to mention it here in a way that doesn't look bolted on the side. 'Cos bits bolted on the side, and special cases, and odd exceptions and so forth, weaken a strong guideline.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self-blocking to enforce Wikiholidays</span></h2>
<p>I decided to revive this old discussion from archive, because I noticed one fact - anybody is able to self-block itself to enforce wikiholidays, even without being sysop.</p>
<p>It is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an inappropriate username, something like "I want to destroy wikipedia", "I am king of vandals" or something similarly stupid</li>
<li>Wait for admin to indefinitely block it. It probably won't take very long.</li>
<li>Remember the password. Now every time you want to enforce one day of holidays, log in as that blocked user and try to make an edit somewhere</li>
<li>You're autoblocked for 24 hours</li>
<li>No chance for editing -&gt; you have holidays&#160;:)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, is everybody able technically to do this to enforce wikiholidays, or have I omitted something?</p>

<dd>Thanks Newyorkbrad for your helpful response. One thing is clear I think in this User:Homeontherange discussion is that if one is implementing a community ban then wording needs to reflect that in the block log.

<dd>Let me add my thanks, Brad. Let me also say, in re Tommstein, that the principle enumerated there <i>includes</i> the idea that Admin unanimity = community ban, it does not <i>preclude</i> the idea, as in St. Christopher, that the community may ban "when there is consensus in favor of the block."

<dd>I am not going near the Homeontherange situation (too much back-story predating my time here), but as an abstract matter I can see arguments on both sides of this issue. A "community ban" certainly should need to be supported by a <i>very strong</i> consensus - it's obviously not a relatively routine step analogous to deleting an article or not or promoting an admin candidate or not. Whether a strong consensus should mean literally not a single dissenting voice from the corps of 1000 admins is a harder question. I'd welcome the arbitrators' thoughts on this as they are the ones who are going to have the strong-but-not-unanimous-consensus-to-ban situations to deal with. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 00:42, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I also think, regardless of the HoTR situation, that it makes no sense to require unanimity for a community ban. The policy, as some are interpreting it, now means that if no admin is willing to unblock, then a user remains blocked. That's just tautology, not policy. A community ban would be when the community (admins and respected editors alike) agree, per consensus, that a user should remain indef blocked. I think we can say the Arbcom has been a bit incoherent on this. If those august members can tolerate a little ribbing, I'll just point out that in the Saladin1970 case, they warn that violators “may be <b>bummed</b> indefinitely.” (I have no doubt they will be&#160;;)) <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 00:57, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I strongly object. We saw today how absurd that would be. An editor is banned after strong community consensus to do so (25 admins/editors in support). Then one person who always supports that editor's edits and who knows him in real life unbans.

<dd>Sorry CJCurrie, while I agree with you about not imposing a community ban in HotR's case this argument you're making is a strawman.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocking anonymous edits from London Grid for Learning</span></h2>
<p>Looking at <a href="../../../i/p/_/Template%7EIP_LGFL_dcef.html" title="Template:IP LGFL">Template:IP LGFL</a>, a significant percentage of the anon edits are vandalism. See for example the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:82.198.250.2" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&amp;page=User:82.198.250.2" rel="nofollow">block log of the first IP listed</a>. This seems to be a typical example of young unorganized vandals. IMO many of them would not vandalize if they were required to create an account first. The IP addresses are obviously shared between different persons, probably through some kind of public terminals.</p>
<p>While I appreciate the value of encouraging new young contributors, I strongly feel that Wikipedia should not have to deal with that level of vandalism. It wastes our time, and detracts from the goal of being a reliable encyclopedia.</p>
<p>So I would like to block anonymous contributions only from those IP addresses, more or less permanently (for example for 1-2 years at a time). Since this will affect a lot of users, I would like your opinion. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 13:20, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Maybe it is enough to block the IP for 6 months?

<dd>Policy is descriptive, not prescriptive, and common practice isn't against policy in this case. It would serve you well to read the actual discussion.

<p>I didn't say that: I said that policy should expressly forbid it and not allow for blackmarking people at the caprice of sysops without due process. I also said that the discussion should be made here and not at ANI or wherever.</p>
<p>And I totally disagree that practice should mark policy: policy by definition must be what defines practice. If policy is ambiguous, we should make it more precise. Else, it's like saying that <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a> is meaningless because a lot of wikipedians just don't source their (otherwise possibly correct) edits. No: we have WP:VER and we should try to follow it (or, modify it) but we can't just pretend that common practice just makes policy, when it's the other way around: policy should guide common practice and discussion should make policy.</p>
<p>It's just plainly logical. Of course common practice and common sense will surely influence policy-making discussion but that's not the key point.</p>

<dd>Not at all. First of all, you're comparing two widely different policies. Blocking policy relates only to the actions of administrators taken in support (one hopes) of the project. It has limited application. In this case, it is more process than policy which is being amended, and in such cases policy <i>should</i> reflect what actions the majority of administrators are willing to carry out. That this change enjoys wide support is suggestive. WP:V also enjoys wide support, and describes what contributors do, or at the very least what they expect. Articles which cannot be verified are recognized to be candidates for cleanup if not outright deletion. That people add unverified content is vexing, but such actions are running against the grain. That we don't take stronger action against people undermining the credibility of the encyclopaedia is a testament both to the size of the job and local fascination with rogue administrators (numbering a mere 1000, they're easier to watch). <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 12:27, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

If the block log is not used as a basis for such decisions then apologies in it are "courtesy only" and could easily go on a talk page. if however a significant number of admins look at the block log to decide on block lengths or handling of cases that newly come to their attention, then a note if a block was admitted to be wrongly applied would seem to have a degree of strong relevance, since without it others would see the block but not see the separate apology (which may have been snowed under or archived since.)</dd>

<p>It says under the <i>Disruption</i> section "<i>Blocks for gross incivility are controversial</i>", since when? People are blocked for gross incivility all the time and is not contreversial.

<dd>While I second this modification, I would like to remind you that before blocking I would suggest to issue a warning and give a person a chance to apologize. While wikipedia is not a kindergarten to teach people to behave, people are not robots either.

<dd>That would depend on the level of malice involved in the gross incivility. I personally block people who make racist or homophobic attacks for a time and tell them that the temporary block is their warning. If it is an account that has never contributed in good faith then I will block indef.</dd>
<dd>I wholeheartedly agree though that in the vast majority of cases a stern warning is enough, and in the case of an established editor going way beyond the line I would still open a discussion at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 19:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
