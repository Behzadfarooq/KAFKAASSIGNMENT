The game falls in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-person_shooter.html" title="First-person shooter">first-person shooter</a> category and, with its arsenal of curious weapons, numerous enemies and liberal amounts of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_violence.html" title="Graphic violence">gore</a>, truly does justice to its name.</p>

<p>As a first-person shooter, the gameplay of <i>Blood</i> is witnessed through the eyes of the player controlled character and consists of fighting with all the means available, firearms or magical weapons, the different enemies which populate the levels of the game. In <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_player.html" title="Single player">single player</a> mode, the objective of the player is to lead the main character in his quest of revenge against his former master: this is achieved by navigating the levels of each separate episode, looking for an exit, until the "<a href="../../../b/o/s/Boss_%28video_games%29.html" title="Boss (video games)">boss</a>" level is reached and a showdown against a large opponent takes place. Each episode can be played separately, in no particular order, albeit these are organized to follow the game's storyline.</p>
<p><a name="Gameplay" id="Gameplay"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h3>
<p><i>Blood</i>'s gameplay is similar to other classic FPS games like <i><a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a></i>, in that the player is required to activate switches and/or seek keys to proceed through the levels; on larger maps, finding up to six different keys may be required. Action is generally fast paced as in <i>Doom</i>, with hordes of enemies to wade through on each level. This abundance of enemies is likely a result of the limited load on computers required by the presence of <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29.html" title="Sprite (computer graphics)">sprites</a> compared to modern <a href="../../../3/-/d/3-D_computer_graphics_ffaf.html" title="3-D computer graphics">3D</a>, fully-textured models. Also, the limited <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> controlling the sprites requires large numbers of hostiles to pose a significant threat to the player, in contrast to later games in which advanced AI enhances the danger of single enemies. A classic FPS feature which is rarely employed in <i>Blood</i> is the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleportation.html" title="Teleportation">teleporter</a>. The player's progress is further complicated by different types of traps, including the classic crushing blocks, explosive barrels or lava pits, some "jumping puzzles" and "combo lock" doors.</p>
<p><i>Blood</i> was also the first FPS (besides the Macintosh classic, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathon_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Marathon (computer game)">Marathon</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Forces_fa6d.html" title="Dark Forces">Dark Forces</a>) to feature dual or alternate attack modes for the weapons; most weapons in <i>Blood</i> have two completely different methods of dealing damage, in contrast to previous games in which each weapon had only a single type of attack. Another concept added in <i>Blood</i> are the "super secrets", very hard to find and hard to reach areas which merit large rewards.</p>

<p>A central feature of <i>Blood</i> is an abundance of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_violence.html" title="Graphic violence">graphic violence</a>, from which the game derives its name. Enemies can be blown to pieces, and the pieces often rain down on the player. Zombies' heads can be shot off and then kicked around, spewing fountains of blood. Disturbing for the time, enemies would scream as they were set on fire or otherwise injured, thus making sound an integral part of the violent atmosphere of <i>Blood</i>. The levels themselves are designed with the same spirit, as corpses, torture victims, and several grotesque situations are witnessed in the game. Collectively, these features have caused public concern about <i>Blood</i>, leading to the release of a censored version. It should be noted however, that the sprite-based graphics used by <i>Blood</i> limited the realism of the violence, sometimes even leading to grotesque or plainly comic effects.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Multiplayer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Multiplayer</span></h3>
<p><i>Blood</i> is essentially a single player game, but features <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiplayer.html" title="Multiplayer">multiplayer</a> options. When it was released, Internet play was not well established, therefore <i>Blood</i> relied upon the standard <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modem.html" title="Modem">modem</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_1d59.html" title="LAN">LAN</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_cable.html" title="Serial cable">serial cable</a> connections for multiplayer. Modem and serial cable connections only allow two player games, while an <a href="../../../i/p/x/IPX_7c3f.html" title="IPX">IPX</a> network connection can support up to 8 players. The multiplayer modes consist of the classic <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deathmatch_%28gaming%29.html" title="Deathmatch (gaming)">deathmatch</a>, which is known in <i>Blood</i> as "Bloodbath", and cooperative play, a mode often neglected in later first-person shooters.</p>
<p>Bloodbath matches can be played on specifically designed multiplayer maps or on the levels of the various episodes; the "<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frag_%28video_gaming%29.html" title="Frag (video gaming)">frag</a> limit" or "time limit" options are available to end matches, as well as the possibility to control respawn mode for weapons and powerups. A feature of Bloodbath is "The Voice", an audio comment heard upon each frag, that punctuates the death of an opponent often in gory and irreverent terms. "The Voice" is that of Jason Hall, who was <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_executive_officer.html" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> of Monolith Productions at the time.</p>
<p>Cooperative gameplay follows the lines of the single player campaign, allowing several players to work together against the computer controlled opponents on the levels of the different episodes.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Main article <a href="../../../b/u/i/Build_engine.html" title="Build engine">Build engine</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Blood</i> is powered by a modified version of the <a href="../../../b/u/i/Build_engine.html" title="Build engine">Build engine</a> created by <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Silverman_207b.html" title="Ken Silverman">Ken Silverman</a> for <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_Realms_3b49.html" title="3D Realms">3D Realms</a>. The Build engine renders its world on a <a href="../../../2/d/_/2D_computer_graphics_3c75.html" title="2D computer graphics">two-dimensional</a> grid using closed 2D shapes called "sectors" and simple flat objects called "sprites" to populate the world geometry with objects. It is generally considered to be a <a href="../../../2/2E/5/2.5D_202a.html" title="2.5D">2.5D</a> engine, since the basic world geometry is two-dimensional with an added height component, as each sector may have a different ceiling and floor height, and the ceiling and floor may be angled along one line of the sector. However the final result is that the world looks three-dimensional due to the way the engine renders it. The version of the Build engine used in <i>Blood</i> also makes use of the <a href="../../../v/o/x/Voxel.html" title="Voxel">voxel</a> technology for weapon/ammo pickups, powerups and occasionally decorations, such as the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone.html" title="Tombstone">tombstones</a> in the first level of episode one, "Cradle to Grave". After the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_code.html" title="Source code">source code</a> of many game engines had been released by their respective owners, an intense <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_%28aficionado%29.html" title="Fan (aficionado)">fan</a> campaign called for the release of <i>Blood</i>'s source code.</p>

<p>The game's <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero.html" title="Hero">hero</a> (or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html" title="Anti-hero">anti-hero</a>) is a man named <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caleb_%28computer_game_character%29.html" title="Caleb (computer game character)">Caleb</a> (voiced by Stephan Weyte), once the supreme commander of a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> called "The Cabal", worshippers of the forgotten god <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_creatures_340f.html#Tchernobog" title="List of Blood creatures">Tchernobog</a> (voiced by Monolith CEO Jason Hall, who was credited simply as "The Voice"). Although the backstory was not delineated within the game itself, the Monolith website and a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Readme.html" title="Readme">readme</a> text document presented the few facts known about Caleb's early career.</p>
<p>Already known as a merciless <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunfighter.html" title="Gunfighter">gunfighter</a> in the late 19th Century <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_West_9e02.html" title="Old West">American West</a>, Caleb joined the Cabal in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a> after meeting Ophelia Price, a woman who may have murdered her husband and children before joining the Cabal; it is implied that she later became Caleb's lover. Together they rose to the highest circle of the dark cult, "The Chosen", until all four members of The Chosen were betrayed and killed by Tchernobog for unspecified failures in the god's name. An unspecified number of years later, declaring, "I live...AGAIN!," (a reference to the film <i><a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Darkness_2eda.html" title="Army of Darkness">Army of Darkness</a></i>) Caleb mysteriously rises from his grave seeking vengeance and answers, in no particular order. Blood will flow as he treks across the world through various Cabal strongholds and back to the "Hall of the Epiphany", a temple where the dark god is found.</p>
<p>Garbed in a black <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenchcoat.html" title="Trenchcoat">trenchcoat</a> and broad-brimmed hat, his <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye.html" title="Eye">eyes</a> glowing red, Caleb immediately begins his quest of ridding the world of the minions of Tchernobog. Caleb is a cynical, sarcastic man with a bent towards sadism, taking pleasure in killing almost anything that may impede his quest. Though his "pleasure in pain" obviously removes consideration of Caleb as a true hero, he does have a slight attitude change between <i>Blood</i> and its sequel <i>Blood II</i> where he begins to show more tolerance for innocent bystanders.</p>

<p><i>Blood</i> is organized in four episodes filled with atmosphere, dark humour and periodic, occasionally parodic, references (see below). Each episode consists of a total of 8-9 different maps which are broken down as 6-7 regular levels, one "boss" level and a secret level. Level design is varied, as the settings depicted by <i>Blood</i> are quite different from each other. Some locations are drawn to resemble present day cities, with civil buildings, museums, pubs, shopping centers and so on; a few levels are centered upon a particular location, like a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortuary.html" title="Mortuary">mortuary</a>, a train station, a <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circus.html" title="Circus">carnival</a>, a <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewer.html" title="Sewer">sewer</a>, a <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> or a <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumber_mill.html" title="Lumber mill">lumber mill</a>, and each is designed to include elements typical of these places (e.g. a <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crematorium.html" title="Crematorium">crematorium</a> in the mortuary, attractions at the carnival and so on). Maps built around moving vehicles are present as well; the third level in the first episode which is set aboard a train, for example. Several other levels have a typical <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_architecture.html" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwardian.html" title="Edwardian">Edwardian</a> architectural style and this is used especially in some atmospheric "<a href="../../../h/a/u/Haunted_house.html" title="Haunted house">haunted house</a>" levels. Levels with a more "fantastic" setting abound in the last episode of <i>Blood</i> which takes place in several evil temples and even in a fully organic setting, whose walls, ceiling and floor are all comprised of flesh and blood. The episodes are structured as follows:</p>

Cutting through swarms of Cabal loyalists and other creatures, Caleb gains entrance to the "Great Temple", a place protected by numerous underwater tunnels as well as several napalm traps and Cabal minions. A teleporter found in the Temple leads the protagonist to Cheogh's altar, where Caleb will fight the gargoyle to the death, finally slaying the creature. He then proceeds to light Ophelia's funeral pyre, after he has found her body sacrificed upon Cheogh's altar.</p>

<p>Looking for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_creatures_340f.html#Shial.2FMother_spiders" title="List of Blood creatures">Shial</a>, the second minion of Tchernobog, Caleb moves to the north on a small boat, uttering a famous quote from the movie <i><a href="../../../j/a/w/Jaws_%28film%29.html" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i>. The player character boards a larger, icebound wooden sailing ship in the Arctic north (a reference to the novel, <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></i>) and uses it as a gateway to a nearby lumber mill the Cabal has transformed into a crude human remains processing area. Then a snow covered maze of hedges awaits Caleb, as he needs to find his way to the "Overlooked Hotel", a haunted building with several nods to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shining_%28film%29_8f9f.html" title="The Shining (film)">The Shining</a></i>, including a frozen <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Torrance_aec4.html" title="Jack Torrance">Jack Torrance</a> in the garden maze. Recovering a set of mysterious tomes, Caleb may also find time to visit a snow covered mountainous area (the episode's secret level), filled with Cabalists and other even less reassuring creatures, before proceeding to another haunted building, a large two-story mansion with many rooms, a kitchen, gardens, a library, a cellar and even an indoor pool. Blowing a hole in the pool itself, Caleb follows an underwater passage leading to a facility that probably served as a support station for the operations of a nearby <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mining.html" title="Mining">mine</a>. The mine is the protagonist's true objective, since Shial's lair is hidden below the frozen surface, under the bowels of the earth; navigating the Cabal infested tunnels, Caleb finally finds a large spider decorated door leading to the hideout of Shial, a dark stony cavern where the spiders feast upon the rotting corpses of their victims. In a climactic battle, the player character defeats Shial, destroying her, then proceeds to rip out and drink the heart from the nearly-dead, cocooned corpse of Gabriel, another of the betrayed Chosen, thus gaining the power of his fallen comrade.</p>

<p>Back in a civilized area, Caleb has a new objective: Cerberus, now Tchernobog's second in command, must be eliminated. The first section of the episode consists of a town that has fallen under heavy airborne bombing; few still live in the place, aside from the Cabal and its minions. Leaving behind the meat processing plant and the city hall, Caleb enters the sewers to reach the other side of the war battered city. Emerging to the surface, the entrance of a hospital lies ahead: the interior contains patient rooms, a chapel, a morgue, an "assisted suicide" room and a baby carriage with a demonic hand sticking out of it as a tribute to <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_Alive_%28film%29_93b8.html" title="It's Alive (film)">It's Alive!</a></i>. From the chapel, access to the catacombs (secret level) can also be gained. Once out of the hospital, the protagonist moves across an industrial facility, entering a nearby <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dam.html" title="Dam">dam</a> control installation located close to Cerberus' cavern. Caleb struggles his way through a difficult "combo lock" puzzle, then blows up the dam with explosives. The resulting flooding makes it easier to access the demon's fiery hideout. Several seals, guarded by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_creatures_340f.html#Hellhounds" title="List of Blood creatures">Hellhounds</a>, must be unlocked before Cerberus makes his furious appearance from behind the stone walls. The two-headed beast does not prove a match for Caleb who then fills the creature's abdomen with many remote controlled bundles of <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitrotoluene.html" title="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a> and blows up the corpse.</p>

<p>Once Tchernobog's lieutenants have been dealt with, Caleb heads for the "Hall of the Epiphany" where the dark god is waiting. The first step is to cross a strange land with a mad-scientist laboratory and Frankenstein-esque theme to it, subsequently diving into an aquatic breeding laboratory, presumably one of the main locations where the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_creatures_340f.html#Gill_beasts" title="List of Blood creatures">gill beasts</a> are grown by the Cabal. Later, bursting out of a water cistern, Caleb finds a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charnel_house.html" title="Charnel house">charnel house</a> serving as a disposal site for dead creatures. The place has a nearby passage leading to a forest-rimmed lake with wood cabins arrayed around "Crystal Lake". This section draws largely on references to the <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_the_13th_%28film%29.html" title="Friday the 13th (film)">Friday the 13th</a></i> series of films. As Caleb roams the area, he may even hear the infamous sounds of <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Voorhees_afd6.html" title="Jason Voorhees">Jason Voorhees</a> himself, or perhaps even discover his mask and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machete.html" title="Machete">machete</a> hanging on one of the walls. The exit from the area is reached through a toilet: here the player character can move immediately to a Cabal temple located well above the surface of a lava filled area or take a visit to the "Mall of the Dead", a shopping center acting as a homage to the film <i><a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn_of_the_Dead_bbbc.html" title="Dawn of the Dead">Dawn of the Dead</a></i>, with similar looping "elevator music" and zombies. Caleb then gains access to the inner temples defended by Stone Gargoyles and Mother Spiders (similar to the Cheogh and Shial bosses), until he finally uncovers an organic looking entryway to reach his former master; this passage leads to the level "In The Flesh", in which the walls, ceiling and floor are all comprised of living flesh. Caleb's stray bullets pound this wretched structure, causing the very walls themselves to bleed. Once out of this strange place, the protagonist reaches the "Hall of the Epiphany", an outworldly place where he must face the previous bosses, Cheogh, Shial and Cerberus. There, before facing the terrifying Tchernobog, Caleb finally learns why "The Chosen" were cast down: the dark god knew Caleb would return to him, killing anyone he ran into to take his revenge and thus gaining immense power, something Tchernobog wants for himself. Caleb, disgusted by the appalling waste of lives, proceeds to destroy the dark god, ending his reign and temporarily stopping the Cabal.</p>

<p>Weapons, strange artifacts and bonus items abound in <i>Blood</i>. The weapons in <i>Blood</i> were fairly revolutionary upon the game's release, most having a secondary attack mode which was not a common feature in first-person shooters at the time.

<p>The game features a large number of creatures throughout its levels and most of them are absolutely hostile to Caleb, being either human members of the Cabal or creatures fighting for the dark god Tchernobog: these include regular enemies, as well as the end-level "bosses". A lesser class of enemies, often referred to as "nuisance enemies", lists some creatures who are not considered real threats, but will try nonetheless to harm Caleb. Finally, there is also a small number of neutral creatures who will not pose a danger for the protagonist.</p>

<p>Gore is not the only constant feature of <i>Blood</i>. As already mentioned, throughout the game there are a large number of references to <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literary</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">film</a> works. Caleb is the main source for these homages, as he will often speak lines from movies or literature upon stumbling into specific situations; the remaining references appear in the form of objects, characters or situations scattered across the levels.</p>
<p>Players will notice references to the works of H.P. Lovecraft in title of Episode Two, "Even Death May Die", as well as in "Miskatonic Station" in E1M2, referring to Lovecraft's <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miskatonic_University_e43a.html" title="Miskatonic University">Miskatonic University</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macbeth.html" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i> is tapped when Caleb, using a bloody sink in E1M1, speaks out loud, "Out, out, damned spot!" <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> was not forgotten by Monolith, in fact upon discovering the empty grave of Eric Draven from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crow_%28film%29_98e1.html" title="The Crow (film)">The Crow</a></i>, Caleb says, "Nevermore," from Poe's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Raven_543a.html" title="The Raven">The Raven</a></i>. There are also many allusions to the works of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a>.</p>
<p><i>Blood</i> drew even more inspiration from cinema. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddy_Krueger_1557.html" title="Freddy Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>'s signature striped shirt and hat and Richard Kimble's orange jumpsuit from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fugitive_%281993_film%29_2405.html" title="The Fugitive (1993 film)">The Fugitive</a></i> are encountered, while the frozen Jack Torrance from <i>The Shining</i> is seen in E2M4, hunched on his knees and holding an axe, causing Caleb to quote the movie, "Here's Johnny!" In the carnival, when Caleb goes through the "freak show", the film <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freaks.html" title="Freaks">Freaks</a></i> is remembered with them quoting "One of us!". A <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_passage.html" title="Secret passage">secret passage</a> in an apartment complex leads to a room which is based on the movie, <i><a href="../../../s/e/7/Se7en.html" title="Se7en">Se7en</a></i>. The room contains a bed where lies a horribly mangled body with the word "sloth" written above. As in the movie, small paper <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a> <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_freshener.html" title="Air freshener">air fresheners</a> dangle from the ceiling as well. Caleb also refers to other horror and action films, including <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Evil_Dead_77ff.html" title="The Evil Dead">The Evil Dead</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail_3131.html" title="Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Darkness_2eda.html" title="Army of Darkness">Army of Darkness</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone_%28film%29.html" title="Tombstone (film)">Tombstone</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../r/e/t/Return_of_the_Living_Dead_6764.html" title="Return of the Living Dead">Return of the Living Dead</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Trouble_in_Little_China_c264.html" title="Big Trouble in Little China">Big Trouble in Little China</a></i>, and also the films of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_0cee.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>.</p>
<p>Another popular media product referred to by <i>Blood</i> is <i><a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_3D_196b.html" title="Duke Nukem 3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></i>; much like <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_%28character%29_1ea3.html" title="Duke Nukem (character)">Duke Nukem</a> mocking the <i>Doom</i> space marine, Caleb comments: "<i>I have no time to play with you...</i>" as he finds Duke's body hanging upside down from a chain, badly maimed and dripping blood. This line is similar to one that Duke Nukem says when he finds a "Duke Nukem II" arcade machine. <i>Blood</i>'s protagonist further makes fun of the hero from the 3D Realms franchise, since the player can make Caleb swing Duke's corpse from side to side and utter in a cynical, sarcastic way: "Uhh, shake it, baby", directly referencing Duke Nukem's requests to the strippers of <i>Duke Nukem 3D</i>. Interestingly enough, the original version of Blood was made by Duke Nukem 3D's creators, 3D Realms.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also worth mentioning that Caleb, when idle, will occasionally sing bits of classic songs, including <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Way_%28song%29_a4af.html" title="My Way (song)">My Way</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Strangers_in_the_night.html" title="Strangers in the night">Strangers in the night</a></i> , <i><a href="../../../p/u/t/Puttin%27_on_the_Ritz_763c.html" title="Puttin' on the Ritz">Puttin' on the Ritz</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Somewhere_Over_the_Rainbow_2b90.html" title="Somewhere Over the Rainbow">Somewhere Over the Rainbow</a></i>.</p>

The full retail version of <i>Blood</i> on CD-ROM features all the 4 original episodes and contains all the elements that were missing in the demo. As already mentioned, the extremely violent contents of the game prompted the release of a censored version of <i>Blood</i> where graphic violence is toned down. Two different expansions for the game have been released: <i>Cryptic Passage</i> was produced by a third-party and features a new 10 level episode; Monolith's official add-on for <i>Blood</i> is titled <i>Plasma Pak</i> and contains new levels, new creatures and weapons modes. The special edition <i>One Unit Whole Blood</i> was later distributed including <i>Blood</i>, <i>Plasma Pak</i> and <i>Cryptic Passage</i> in a single package.

Additions to the weapons arsenal are missing, however several innovations are introduced, since the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_equipment_a3ea.html#Tesla_cannon" title="List of Blood equipment">Tesla cannon</a> can now be wielded <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akimbo_%28gaming%29.html" title="Akimbo (gaming)">akimbo</a> (provided the appropriate power-up is collected), while the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_equipment_a3ea.html#Napalm_cannon" title="List of Blood equipment">napalm cannon</a> and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_equipment_a3ea.html#Life_leech" title="List of Blood equipment">life leech</a> are capable of new secondary attacks. <i>Plasma Pak</i> also integrated a large number of bug fixes which had been previously addressed by several patches.</p>

<p>After Caleb has learned the Cabal is training replacements for the fallen "Chosen", he sets out to stop the cult's plans. The player character starts his new adventure beside a department store overtaken by several Cabal members; clearing a way through his enemies, Caleb enters another shopping center which is connected to a processing facility of sorts and keeps investigating in his own fashion the recent Cabal uprisings. Next, the protagonist is lured to an ambush in a warehouse fully under the control of the Cabal, however, using the aeration conduits, he is able to outflank his enemies and proceed to the aqueducts of the city. A Cabal ship is docked nearby, but Caleb does not waste time and sinks the vessel; he also has the chance to visit some forgotten Catacombs while at the aqueducts. Later, he moves into Cabal territory, wreaking havoc in a temple complex, then ruining the cult's plans once more by storming the inner temple, where the Cabalists are preparing some kind of unearthly ceremony to worship their dark god. Satisfied the temples have been dealt with, Caleb enters the dungeon, a dark, creepy structure built to stop anyone trying to reach the training ground for "The Chosen". A set of locked doors blocks the exit and Caleb is forced to wander across different areas to gather all the required keys, but in the end he reaches the grounds where the final threat awaits. In order to rest, Caleb must destroy each of the Chosen in training and the Beasts within them.</p>

<p>Having heard news of an ancient scroll, Caleb sets out to retrieve it for his own dark needs. He arrives on the Boat Docks, which later open onto a large cave, a cabin and a lighthouse, structures overrun by the Cabal. Ahead, a large opera house is found, built in the tradition of the late 1920s-early 1930s, where apparently <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_cdd3.html" title="The Phantom of the Opera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></i> (called "The Phantasm of the Opera" in the game) is being shown. Without losing any time with the opera, Caleb moves to the Gothic Library, located in the midst of surrounding forests: there he barely escapes the minions of the Cabal after recovering all the keys required to leave the place. However Caleb does not have time to rest, since strange rituals are taking place in and around the monastery: the protagonist must end them in the most violent and chaotic manner he can muster. A steamboat serves as an escape from the monastery, but it does not prove to be a gentle ride as the Cabal owns the ship. Finally reaching a quieter zone, Caleb finds himself at a graveyard whose relatively empty surface hides the crowded underground catacombs and tunnels. A passage may be taken by Caleb to reach a gloomy swamp (the secret level "Boggy Creek"), riding along the river on a boat where the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grim_Reaper_0bed.html" title="Grim Reaper">Grim Reaper</a> is the captain. Back on his path, the adventure takes the player character to the mountains this time, where both gorges and ghosts must be survived. The Cultists hide behind every stone as Caleb makes his way across the cliffs to the mine, a dark place infested with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_creatures_340f.html#Phantasms" title="List of Blood creatures">phantasms</a> which is the only access to the castle where the scroll is hidden. When Caleb climbs the stairs into the castle, he is greeted by "The Lord of All Nightmares", who proves to be nothing less than two guardian <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blood_creatures_340f.html#Cerberus" title="List of Blood creatures">Cerberi</a>. Between Caleb and the coveted scroll now lies a final battle between Beast and Man.</p>

<p>After the release of <i>Blood</i>'s not very successful sequel <i>Blood II: The Chosen</i>, Monolith did not develop any further game in the series, in part due to copyright issues, since the "<i>Blood</i>" name was owned by GT Interactive. While the source code to the game was not released, in spite of the interest of fans, several ports have still been developed around the <i>Blood</i> story.</p>
<p><a name="Transfusion" id="Transfusion"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Transfusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transfusion</span></h3>
<p><i>Blood</i> was ported to the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake_engine.html" title="Quake engine">Quake engine</a> with a project known as "Transfusion". Formerly known as "qBlood", the project was renamed to "BloodBath" when the game switched to the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quake_2_engine.html" title="Quake 2 engine">Quake 2 engine</a> in December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, before one last name change to the current "Transfusion". The latter name change was caused to avoid possible copyright issues with the <i>Blood</i> trademark owned by Infogrames/Atari. Transfusion is currently still under development, but the multiplayer portion is complete, including bots, and, owing to the new game engine, the possibility to play across the internet. There are also plans to eventually get all the single player game's functionality working, including all the four original episodes, as well as those contained in the <i>Plasma Pak</i> and <i>Cryptic Passage</i> expansions.</p>
