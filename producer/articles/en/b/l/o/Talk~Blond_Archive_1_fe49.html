<h2><span class="mw-headline">World Book Definition</span></h2>
<p>Blond or Blonde is: 1. light in color 2. having yellow or light-brown hair, light eyes, and fair skin.</p>
<p>So according to WB, light brown hair is considered blond(e). Blond seems more of a category than a color, and under that category fall many different colors, including lighter shades of brown hair.</p>
<p>And yes, it does seem to be misconcieved as being only "yellow" in colour.</p>

<p>Hey you guys. That woman in that pic at the bgottom of the page is totally hot....well it looks like she would be an absolute 12! Who is she? Can we see a picture of her face? Just so you guys know, 5% of all America is blond. 1 in 20 people. I would guess that of the white population, about 15%. Just so you guys know also,</p>
<p>74% of all natural blondes have what is described as dirty/honey/caramel/butternut/ash/sandy/sandy ash/auburn bronze/golden brown/buttery/ blond. Basically deeper shades of blond with more eumelanin.</p>
<p>About 10% have what is described as platinum/champagne/sand dune/silver/white/pale sunny/golden/Nordic/flaxen/ blond. Shades of blond with very little or no eumelanin and little phaemelanin.</p>
<p>About 15% have yellow/straw/ blond. With a 90/10 split of phaemelanin and eumelanin, respectively.</p>
<p>About 1% have strawberry blond hair a reddish shade of blond, usually attained from having one red headed parent and one blond parent, similar to auburn hair.</p>

<p>This article conveys the common misconception that blond hair is bright yellow. Actually the lighter hair can be colored naturally is "red," called strawberry blond in this article. Complete lack of pigmentation gives pale yellow, but that albinism, not blond.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not correct, in my opinion.</dd>
<dd>Red hair = red hair, there is a special topic in wikipedia about what causes red hair. Blond hair is not red by itself (only when mixed with the "red hair" feature is it more or less "reddish").Blond hair is yellowish or whitish and not red.</dd>

<dd>I am not going to deny this phenomenon. However, I have two objections. 1) Your sample image is of very low quality, and the light hair colour could just as well be caused by the effect of the sunlight on the photograph. 2) These are children, and as we all know (or should be aware of) many children and younger people have light(er) hair (this is also true for Eastern Asia); hair colour (even in Scandinavia) often darkens considerably when adolescents and young adults get older, before or interwoven with an opposite effect of hair turning "grey" - so on one hand hair gets darker while at the same time (or somewhat later or even earlier) part of one's hair gets lighter (turns "grey"). This is nothing unusual and can be observed with almost every blond person, I suppose, some only get a darker shade of blond, others get completely dark brown or nearly black hair. It would be interesting to see better images of Aborigines and especially of older (adult) Aborigines.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">'Blondus' vs '<small>BLONDVS</small>'</span></h2>
<p>Is there a 'standard' for writing Latin in Wikipedia? I doubt it.</p>
<p>In English, Anglicised Latin words are of course written in the modern manner, as are Latin quotations (very often mediaeval rather than classical or ancient) used in English. However, etymological studies within Romance languages are a quite different affair. I was referring to the ancient language known as Latin, so I wrote in the ancient language known as Latin. And, in that language, lower-case letters did not exist. If people want to use lower-case letters when discussing such etymologies, that is acceptable, but no changes need be made to the texts of those of us who are a little more pedantic on these matters.</p>
<p>If a Wikipedia policy contradicts this, it is wrong and I'll have to change it. However, I don't believe there is such a policy. B<small>LVNDVS</small> stays. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"></a><font color="green">—&#160;Chameleon</font> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon">My page</a>/<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChameleon_f82a.html" title="User talk:Chameleon">My talk</a> 02:07, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm of the opinion it looks ugly, myself. That could originate from years of having studied Cicero and Virgil in lowercase, mind. However, I note that it is general Wikipedia practice to provide the (ahem) romanized forms of words in other languages, when quoted in etymological discussion. Logically this would result in something like
<ul>
<li>'<small>BLONDVS</small>' <i>blondus</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>but that looks like it came out of the Department of Redundancy Department. Really, we should be writing to the casual user. To paraphrase the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_for_Japan-related_articles_dcca.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style for Japan-related articles">Wikipedia Japanese MoS</a>, anyone who knows enough to understand '<small>BLONDVS</small>' can take care of themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, and equally importantly, I have never seen (in dictionaries or in linguistics texts, treatises, or discussions) the style '<small>BLONDVS</small>' used in discussions of etymological studies. Typically the romanized forms -- to be precise, the <i>anglicized</i> forms -- are used, even for the Greek from which the Latin originally came.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, if I recall correctly, nine times out of ten they didn't bother writing the '<small>-VS</small>'. And that would be no help at all. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EAponar_Kestrel_f91e.html" title="User:Aponar Kestrel">Aponar Kestrel</a> <a href="../../../a/p/o/User_talk%7EAponar_Kestrel_5a6f.html" title="User talk:Aponar Kestrel">(talk)</a> 02:08, 2004 Aug 31 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you go to Reelclassics.com they have a gallery of Marilyn Monroe pics and a in a few from her pre-stardom days her hair is brunette while in others it appears more auburn. My sister is a huge Marilyn fan and has many pics of her and I would say she's got enough red in her hair in some pics to say she was a redhead. She also has a book in which she talks about her mother and there's a quote along the lines of "my mother had a fiery temper to match her red hair" so redheads ran in her family. Where I'm from, the slighest amount of red in a person's hair doesn't make them a fiery redhead but a redhead nonetheless. Could also be the colour tinting of old photos that make it appear more red but either way, she wasn't a natural blonde. 154.20.12.109 07:27, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The etymology section is misleading on the subject of gender: the predominant French system of gender simply doesn't exist in English, even among 'careful writers'. We wouldn't say a finger is 'long' but a hand is 'longue', for example, because neither word has any concept of gender attached to it. What is meant by gender in English is a semantic notion of gender, ie it's based on the meanings of nouns rather than the nouns themselves.</p>
<p>There are some people who use 'blond' to describe a man's hair, and 'blonde' to describe a woman's hair, and indeed this convention is currently used in the article. But it makes no sense at all to call this a careful emulation of French. In French, the phrase 'Ses cheveux sont blonds' could mean 'his hair is blond(e)' or 'her hair is blond(e)' - the adjective is inflected according to the noun it describes, which is 'hair', not the person who owns the hair. AFAIK this curious form of inflection doesn't exist at all in standard French, and by the looks of it it's an example of 'confusion' which arose when the word passed into English usage.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not so much confusion but adaptation to the English gender system, which is a natural one. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 09:08, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I helped in the dissapearing blonde theory section, AND cited my sources. I suggest somebody started a list of natural blondes, please. (excuse my English, I don't think I phrased that last sentence correctly; English is not my first language as you can see).

<p>I removed the unsorced section "Blondes all over the World". If a source can be found then it can be put back. I rewrote the "Theory of the Disappearing Blonds" section and moved the external links into it. The spelling in the article was a mixture of UK and US but now seems to be UK only.

<p>This article needs some work. The "disappearing blonds" theory is not explained adequately and seems to have been written by someone who doesn't understand basic genetics (e.g. the meaning of "dominance" applied to genes).</p>
<p>Further, the origins of blondness needs serious improvement. Sources need to be cited, and other theories explained. In particular, AFAIK the currently accepted explanation for blondness -- and low melanin concentrations in human populations generally -- is the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_skin_color.html" title="Human skin color">Vitamin D hypothesis</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 18:00, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that they meant platinum or pale blonde, in which case it is possible due to the fact that blondes such as the one above have a type of albinism which is becoming rarer.

<p>I'm curious why all the image captions were changed from "blonde hair" to "fair hair". Since the article is called "blond", should we be shy about pointing out what blond means?

<p>I've always thought that "fair hair" was a somewhat more inclusive term that covers off the lightest shades of brown / 'dirty blond'. --Pondle 14:49, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might be a subjective/regional term what "fair hair" means. <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a> has no specific definition for "fair hair". Under "fair" they have: "Of complexion and hair: Light as opposed to dark." .. which is open to interpretation. I think since the article is called blond we are better off sticking with that term. The women in the pictures are clearly blond. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 23:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Stbalbach - I originally provided this information: the numbers come from a variety of sources cited in Carleton Coon's "Races of Europe". The book itself is online at a number of sites on the net - I included the link. While Coon's racial thesis is discredited, the studies themselves were just anthroposcopic surveys of hair colour, although they didn't all use the same definitions or methodology, as noted in the text.--Pondle 18:38, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, the problem is other wikipedians were editing the numbers - probably based on (uncited) sources (a good faith assumption). With something as non-scientific as this (what scientifically constitutes "blond"?), we might be better to cite external sources, but not actually list any percentage numbers directly. No two sources will ever agree. The best source would be a census, that reports what people say about themselves ie. "%50 of Germans call themselves blond according to xyz [extlink]". -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 05:29, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes I'm all for putting the link to Gene Expression back in, this was an excellent article, with maps, that also challenges the origin of 'blondness' thesis expressed in this entry. BTW this whole entry is very poor - why on earth are we using pictures of non-natural blond(e)s like Brad Pitt and Ellen Roche? I'll try to do a big rewrite if I get the time this week.--Pondle 14:12, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
