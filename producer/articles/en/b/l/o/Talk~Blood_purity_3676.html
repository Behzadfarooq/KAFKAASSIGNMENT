<p>In the article List of wizarding terms in translations of Harry Potter there is a phrase "Dirty-blood". Where does this phrase turn up in the books? What does it mean? Are there any people mentioned as examples with this feature? (Is it an actually existing category at all?) I suppose it should either be deleted from the other article, or it should be treated here, if it really exists.</p>

<p>I've removed Merope from the list of known Squibs. Marvolo refers to her as such in HBP, but it's almost definitely just an insult referring to her (apparently) woeful magic. Merope displays definite magical abilities which are just stunted, as Dumbledore explains, by the oppressive personalities of her father and brother.</p>

<dd>Some unobservant person (to put it nicely) who is, and I quote, "too lazy to sign in", added her as a Squib again. (Grinds teeth) Needless to say, I fixed it. Noneofyourbusiness 17:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, well squibs can see dementors and enchanted buildings. Merope made a love potion, but it is unclear from the texts whether squibs can or cannot do this. It's not apparent if potion making requires any magical ability as Snape has said, "There will be no silly wand waving in this class." Dumbledore said that her magical ability <i>may</i> have been suppressed by abuse. Has it ever been verified by JKR that squibs cannot make potions? -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 20:39, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She also performed a cleaning spell with her wand. And understood Parseltongue. Squibs cannot see Dementors, as Rowling has confirmed (see the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabella_Figg_2562.html" title="Arabella Figg">Arabella Figg</a> page}.</dd>

<p>Didn't she also provoke her father's wrath by (mis)summoning a cauldron?

<dl>
<dd>Correct. Squibs are the same as Muggles, they can't even do spells badly. It's definitely a lack of confidence. Neville is bad at spells for the same reason. An untalented wizard is an untalented wizard, not a Squib.Noneofyourbusiness 14:24, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, Rowling does make it clear that magical ability has nothing to do with blood purity than it does by the qualities a person has, confidence, bravery, intelligence, conscience. It explains a lot, like how Neville has untapped ability and Harry is powerful but has trouble with unforgiveable curses. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalber_d5cd.html" title="User:Malber">Malber</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalber_7564.html" title="User talk:Malber">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Malber_b734.html" title="Special:Contributions/Malber">contribs</a>) 14:40, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't listing pure-bloods by family is a good idea. Some members of the family are indeed not pure-bloods. <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Tonks_570b.html" title="Ted Tonks">Ted Tonks</a> and <a href="../../../n/y/m/Nymphadora_Tonks_248d.html" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>, for example, are included under the Black family.

<dl>
<dd>I've added a couple of notes to the Black family's entry to clarify that Ted and Nymphadora aren't considered pure-blood even though they're (arguably) part of a pure-blood family. I think this is a better approach than removing the listings-by-family. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 05:54, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your biological theory has a big flaw. When a wizard and a muggle have a child, the child is usually magic. Under your theory this would only happen in the offside chance that the muggle parent had a recessive gene. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic.gnome</a> 09:20, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I took out the part about eye colour. My criticism of the recessive gene theory is that two DIFFERENT parents (wizard and muggle) will produce the so-called recessive gened child in nearly EVERY case. Unless all these wizards are marrying muggles with the recessive gene, the theory is flawed. It has nothing to with the occasional oddity of blue-eyed parents having brown-eyed children, half-bloods becoming wizards are the norm, not freak cases. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic.gnome</a> 04:25, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A more plausible biological explanation for both Muggleborns and Squibs is by mutation. You see this in dwarfism. Dwarfism is one of the disorders most likely to be newly-arisen in families where no one has the trait. Once the mutation occurs, dwarfism is a dominant inheritable trait; however, a fair number of the children of dwarves get a reverse mutation and are of normal stature.</p>

<p>The article says that the idea of blood purity and superiority to muggles is in decline. What is the basis for this? I have seen it reported that pure-blood families are in decline (the characters discuss this somewhere, something about difficulty of pure bloods finding other pure bloods to marry?), but where does it say that bias in general is in decline? Many wizards (even the ones on the good side) seem to have strong views on who/what is superior to what else. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 23:56, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know about ghosts, sorry. And you're right, maybe Filch can't see Hogwarts from the outside. I figure that either squibs aren't affected by spells intentionally cast to make things look different to muggles, or there's a special spell to make specific squibs immune to specific spells like that. Either that, or they have to Obliviate every daring Muggle teenager who decides to brave the "dangerous abandoned building" on a dare!--<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 04:58, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hermione doesn't count as a muggle; she's a witch. Muggles are people who can't use magic at all, and there are none at Hogwarts (other than the Squib caretaker). Hermione's parents are muggles, but all that does to her is make her a "mud-blood", which is just an racist word with no relation to her ability to see or use magic.</dd>

<dd>Well the way it was written there it's wrong. It said that you need at least one muggle grandparent to be half-blood. But having one muggle <i>parent</i> makes you half-blood as well. (And probably also having muggle great-grandparents, according to the people who care about blood status). I know JKR talked about that purebloods will even consider a 25% muggle to be a half-blood etc., but the describtion that "at least 25% muggle blood is needed for you to be a half-blood" is kinda faulty. Well I changed the word from "at least one grandparent" to "at least one ancestor", but the 25%-thing is still there. Should it be removed? --Mithcoriel 17:50, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This '25%' thing sounds like an extremely ridiculous term to use, as well as the comparison to Nazi principles too. Did Jews of the Reich have to have 'at least 25%' Israelite heritage to 'qualify'? Since when was Nazism a coherent ideology anyway? I thought Mein Kampf was a rambling manifesto that had multiple contradictions and little consistency. Anyway, sorry, this isn't about Nazis. 'Pure-blood' means exactly that, your blood is magically pure. Anything else is a Mudblood. Isn't it that simple? You shouldn't have to resort to Maths, for crying out loud. If you did then you would be defending the underlying prejudices as based on some sort of logic. Is there a single human alive today that can claim that they are descended from a single race? Perhaps all wizards have a certain amount of Muggle blood and just don't know it, rendering the entire 'pure-blood' argument redundant? --84.68.200.235 03:55, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To the user who posted above me: I disagree with you on some issues. First of all, I don't think it's ridiculous to compare this to the Nazis, as even the author herself made that comparison. And Hitler wasn't an Arian, and Voldemort isn't a pureblood, there's another parallel. Next: You don't need to tell us that Nazi ideology and/or Voldemort's ideology are stupid, that no human alive can claim being the descendant of only one race etc., we know that.&#160;:) And just because there's some (simple!) maths in it, that certainly doesn't mean we're justifying anything! That would be like saying "I killed two people and then another two, that makes four. See, I can think logic about it, so it's okay." Anyway, next: You said: " 'Pure-blood' means exactly that, your blood is magically pure. Anything else is a Mudblood " sorry, this isn't quite correct: There's <i>pureblood</i>, which is what you said, then there's <i>half-blood</i>, which is a person whose ancestors are partly wizards, partly muggles, then there's <i>Muggle-born/Mudblood</i> where the ancestors are only Muggles.</dd>
<dd>And yes, I agree with you, it is very well possible that most wizards who act pure really have some muggle blood in them. But this doesn't render this argument redundant, because we're talking about a book in which characters make these distinctions in blood purity, and we're trying to explain what they're talking about. As for the 25%-thing: Basically that was brought into the discussion because: Harry hasn't got 50% muggle blood, but he's still called a halfblood, and not a "three quarter blood" or who knows what. There has to be a part of the article that explains that 25% muggle blood is already enough for you to be considered halfblood in the wizard world. Just a closer explanation of the term. Okay, hope my babbling made sense.&#160;:) --Mithcoriel 22:32, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Harry has got 50% Muggle ancestry, so to speak, as one side of his family is entirely Muggle except for his mother.

<dd>Ok, true, so Harry is a bad example. I'm just saying: halfblood doesn't mean 50%. 25% Muggleblood is also still called Halfblood. --Mithcoriel 19:46, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't we make more explicit that the term half-breed isn't exactly a flattering one, and is only used as an insult? As it is, listing Flitwick and Hagrid on a list of "half-breeds" is rather odd.

<p>I put up an accuracy flag on the categories section because I think it's wrong to suggest that there are three separate categories of blood type. From the perspective of the pure-blood, there really are just two: <b>pure-blood</b> and <b>muggle-born</b>. We have Harry Potter down as a half-blood, and he might literally be half-muggle, half-wizard. Yet, JK says on her website that Harry is muggle-born<a href="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=101" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=101" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It might, as a matter of academic interest, be important to figure out precisely how much blood of each type is in a person, but as a racial epithet from a pure-blood to a muggle-born, the only thing that really matters is the casual use. And, in this sense, it's a fairly binary thing: you are either pure-blood, or you aren't.</p>
<dl>
<dd>JKR says Harry is a Muggle-born? I think this is a misinterpretation of the reference you've cited. The statement in question goes: <i>"Even Muggle-borns like Harry attract a certain amount of unwelcome attention at Muggle schools by re-growing their hair overnight and so on."</i> This could probably have been punctuated and/or worded better. I'd put it as "Even Muggle-borns would attract a certain amount of unwelcome attention at Muggle schools if, like Harry, they re-grew their hair overnight and so on." The comparison to Harry is not about being a Muggle-born, but rather about attracting attention at Muggle school by uncontrolled magical displays.</dd>
<dd>Rowling clearly defines a Muggle-born wizard as the child of non-magic (Muggle) parents. (The last word is plural, meaning both parents have to be Muggles/non-magical.) However one categorizes Lily, James is definitely not a Muggle, so Harry does not accurately qualify as a Muggle-born. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercury_McKinnon_04c9.html" title="User:Mercury McKinnon">Mercurio</a> 00:31, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The section is woefully lacking in citation so nothing's particularly "clear"--other than the citation which I'm providing here. Yet, instead of just taking it as is, you seem to be saying that Rowling, a very careful writer, in a written response over which she had full control, got it wrong. The sentence, as she phrased it, can't really be misinterpreted to mean anything other than that Harry is a muggle-born.
<dl>
<dd>I acknowledge that the sentence can be interpreted the way you say it, but it can also be interpreted in the way I've already explained. (I am choosing to read it this way because Rowling has defined "Muggle-born" and "half-blood" in several places elsewhere, and the interpretation that Harry is a Muggle-born contradicts these previous statements. It would be the first and only place I've heard Harry referred to as a Muggle-born, so it should be challenged.) In the sentence you interpret as JKR saying that Harry is a a Muggle-born, I offer that the phrase "like Harry" could (should?) have been set off by commas. I would read it like this: "Birds, like bats, can fly." Bats aren't being offered as an example of birds, instead it's the succeeding thought ("can fly") that is being pointed out as similar between the two. Muggle-borns can attract attention at Muggle schools if they regrew their hair overnight, like Harry. (I'm not explaining it well, probably.)</dd>
<dd>Rowling is a careful writer, yes. And some of the time she can mis-speak (mis-write) or otherwise not come off clearly, just like anyone. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercury_McKinnon_04c9.html" title="User:Mercury McKinnon">Mercurio</a> 06:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I replied without having fully absorbed what you were saying in the whole paragraph above. As the sentence currently appears, I don't think there's a way in which the sentence can be read in any other way but that Harry is a muggle-born. Taking a ridiculous analogy, "Even Martians like Fred . . ." can <b>only</b> mean that Fred is a Martian. In other words, though you suggest that she's not coming off clearly, I think her meaning is <b>entirely</b> clear.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's not to say that it may not appear contradictory with other statements, which is what you're really saying. We thus come rather immediately to the question of whether JK made some sort of mistake here. I guess I just don't accept that JK would have made such a basic error as you suggest. And, even with commas, the meaning of the sentence is not necessarily altered. Because of the plurality of <b>muggle-borns</b> and the singularity of <b>Harry</b>, commas would still most likely make the sentence imply that Harry is a specific example of the general category. In the phrase, "Even trees, like the oak, need water," the commas are optional and have little impact on the meaning of the sentence. They merely change an adjectival phrase into an appositive one--which is really a question of stylistic choice. It's only in sentences where there's numerical agreement between the subject of the sentence, and the clause, where you can possibly entertain the thought that the one isn't a subset of the other, as in, "Even the best presidents, like the worst criminals, are under constant scrutiny." If JK has wanted to clearly differentiate the two, there were much, much easier ways to do it, such as, "Like muggle-borns, Harry . . ." Instead though, she chose to make the sentence read as an unambiguous (if apparently contradictory) statement that the Harry is muggle-born</dd>
<dd>Again, I think the real trick with this section is to look at it from Malfoy's perspective. Is there evidence to suggest that he would, in his own world view, be wrong to call Harry a mudblood? Does he actually distinguish between the two groups, affording some better treatment to Harry which he would not to Hermione? I don't see that level of distinction in the books or films, and indeed I think the implicit point is that anyone but a pure-blood is <b>equally</b> inferior.<a href="../../../c/z/e/User%7ECzechOut_cd28.html" title="User:CzechOut">CzechOut</a> 08:51, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know that there are other sites which claim this same three-tiered system but I don't see it in what she says here, nor do I think it's really her intent to have her racist characters really distinguish between the two. It's all or nothing with Malfoy, and it's his perspective which really matters, here. Is there really any evidence of a special status which attaches to the "mixed" parentage wizard in the books or films? I think there might be, especially as we talk about prophecy fulfillment, but it doesn't seem to me that it's all that important when talking about genetic classification.<a href="../../../c/z/e/User%7ECzechOut_cd28.html" title="User:CzechOut">CzechOut</a> 03:10, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps we might consider pulling the half-blood discussion to a place under the muggle-born heading as a subcategory, but I really think it would take a rewrite to do it. Unless you happen to have a quote handy which backs up the 25% claim, and the fact that it actually IS an intentional reference to the Nazi perspective on the Jews, as opposed to coincidence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm one of those opposed to the inclusion of the following sentence in the article, which I think you're referring to. <i>"That is, if a person has 25% or greater Muggle heritage, then they are disqualified from being a pure-blood, a reference to the Nazi point of view about Jews."</i> I think it's a jump to say that a number (like "25%") has been clearly pinned down in canon, as being the threshold between "half-blood" and "pure-blood". Also, Rowling's FAQ seems to me to clearly say that the similarity to Nazi thought was unintentional <a href="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>By the way, in the same FAQ, Rowling twice distinguishes between 3, rather than just 2, categories of "blood purity". So I'm for not treating "half-blood" as a subset of "Muggle-born". --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMercury_McKinnon_04c9.html" title="User:Mercury McKinnon">Mercurio</a> 00:52, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Could you please provide a link to these? I've seen points at which she calls Harry "half-blood", but that doesn't in itself mean that "half-blood" isn't a subset of "muggle-born".

<dl>
<dd>Nope, didn't miss it. But it doesn't prove that "half blood" and "muggle-born" are wholly separate categories. If anything, it, combined with the other quote from the same place, seem to me to strongly suggest that there is no distinction, in the minds of a Malfoy, between someone like Hermione and someone like Potter. The real question we need to find an answer to, as I see it, is whether having any wizard's blood in you makes any difference to the way you'll be treated by a person like Malfoy. I don't see any particular evidence of that, and so am prepared to rectify Rowling's statements in this FAQ answer, with her ones in the FAQ I cited, by saying that, really, most everyone is muggle-born to some degree. The likelihood of you being called a mudblood depends less on what your actual blood composition is and more on what the perception of your blood composition is by the person hurling the epithet. <a href="../../../c/z/e/User%7ECzechOut_cd28.html" title="User:CzechOut">CzechOut</a> 17:10, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, one good reason to think half-bloods aren't a subset of Muggle-borns is that, in many ways, the distinction between muggle-borns and the other two categories is much greater than that between pure-bloods and the other-two. Specifically, except in odd cases of half-breeds like Harry or Dean Thomas or Tom Riddle, both pure-bloods and half-breeds grow up before going to Hogwarts at least partially in the magical world. On the other hand, muggle-borns, by definition, would live their first 10 (11?) years not knowing anything about magic. This might suggest, though, that the most important distinction is not blood at all, but whether you grow up in the magical world or the muggle world. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 06:56, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um I don't think that really explains what went on with Hermione. She's got no wizard blood at all, and is clearly shown to live in the muggle world, but yet she has more knowledge of "things wizard", even on her first day of classes, than either Ron or Harry. Each person's different—which is, rather, the thematic point.<a href="../../../c/z/e/User%7ECzechOut_cd28.html" title="User:CzechOut">CzechOut</a> 17:10, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I also think the section needs to stress that these categories are more important to racist pure-bloods than they are to other characters in the books. Put another way, it's not shown in the books that the distinctions are generally that important. Yes, Harry and the rest of the Trio have a number of encounters, notably with Malfoy, in which the issue comes up—and parentage in general is quite important to the orphaned Potter—but in the main "blood strength" isn't shown to be a burning social issue. Hogwarts (at least under Dumbledore) is at its core a meritocracy, and the Ministry doesn't seem to be enforcing laws based upon blood strength. <a href="../../../c/z/e/User%7ECzechOut_cd28.html" title="User:CzechOut">CzechOut</a> 21:29, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't see what all the fuss is about. Harry is a half blood. Voldemort is a half-blood. Harry says flat out in Chamber of Secrets (in his second meeting with Dobby) that he isn't Muggle-born, and Voldemort obviously would never call himself Muggle-born. Snape is also half-blood, and indeed makes great play of the fact by naming himself the "half-blood prince", yet he waged a war against Muggle-borns. Since the only people these classifications matter to are the blood purrity fanatics, it's safe to go by their classification. Hence, half blood and muggle born are different things.<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerendipodous_1fa9.html" title="User:Serendipodous">Serendipodous</a> 17:10, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, I have to ask, what is this "info we have" and whether the section(s) wouldn't be made stronger by citing it? Even if we lay aside what I see as JK's direct attribution of "muggle-born" to Harry, how are half-bloods seen as "different" from the "zero percenters"? I mean Harry's dad was as much a target of Voldemort's rage as his (seemingly) zero-percent mother?

Not to mention the fact that Draco Malfoy has never called Harry a Mudblood, although he has referred to Hermione and to Harry's mother as such.

At worst, the sentence is a an ambiguous construction or mistranscription.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, the above illustrate that half-bloods are not (a subset of) Muggle-borns. Instead the two are distinguished by definition and depiction. As previously touched on by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerendipodous_1fa9.html" title="User:Serendipodous">Serendipodous</a>, it is telling that the half-bloods seem more akin to pure-bloods than they are like Muggle-borns.</p>
<p>As outlined in the author's notes, pure-bloods and half-bloods are distinguished (both by star symbols) from Muggle-borns (which are notated with squares). In the novels later on, Death Eaters are shown to accept half-bloods, but to be vehemently anti-Muggle-born. So it seems clear to me that half-bloods are a third and middle ground between the poles of pure-bloods and Muggle-borns.</p>

<p>Surely, if you're being REALLY technical, EVERYONE in the Harry Potter Universe is a (non-literal) half-blood: because, as Rowling has said, all 'Pure-bloods' in reality have muggle ancestry somewhere; and, since magic appears to be genetically hereditary, muggle-born magicians must have magical ancestry somewhere.

<p>You know, since the non-magic genes are recessive, and inbreeding increases the chances of recessive genes having an effect, it's probably the inbred "pure" families that have the highest chance of producing Squibs. There's irony for you. Noneofyourbusiness 04:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes... were it not simply impossible by our standards for the non-magical genes to be recessive (dominants are common, recessives are rare) - the fact that there are so very many more non-magicians than magicians is a clear indication that magic is the recessive gene, rather than the dominant; as is the emergence of magicians in non-magical families (with Squibs as very, very rare examples of 'defaults': where the recessive genes reset to the dominant form - e.g. blue-eyed genes resetting to the brown-eyed default - without necessarily making the effect hereditary, so Squibs can still pass on magical genes). Everything in the canon supports this (maybe Squibs are so rare that there's only one or two per generation - which would explain why it is so VERY humiliating, and why the Longbottoms were prepared to drown Neville to prevent him from being a different sort of 'chosen one'). Wizards, judging by Hogwarts school and what we have seen of the wider wizarding world, are rare. The only problem, the only obstacle to simply writing this off as a mind-bogglingly obvious solution are two bizarre, possibly unconsidered statements from the author: that the magical gene is 'dominant and resilient', and that in a marriage between a magician and a muggle, most of the children will be magical. The first is pretty much impossible: dominant genes, by their very nature, can not be resilient, because if they are not passed on then they are GONE. Recessive genes are resilient, because they can stick around for hundreds, thousands of generations, waiting to resurface. Dominant genes don't do that: either you have them and are wearing them, or you never got them. The second statement, meanwhile, has little real canon support. True, we've seen literal half-bloods - Seamus Finnegan, Dean Thomas, come to think of it is there anyone ELSE? - but of these, Seamus has never mentioned any siblings, and Dean only has siblings by his muggle mother and his muggle stepfather. We have no canon evidence of most half and half children being magical. Indeed, if we consider the muggle-borns, we note that the Creeveys are the only muggle-born magical siblings: Petunia is not a witch, and Rowling intended Hermione to have a muggle sister. Furthermore, given the seclusion, it is entirely possible that genuine muggle-magician marriages are very rare. And we have not heard from all the offspring of these marriages who weren't magical, only from those who were. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 14:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but the author's statements in this matter must be taken as absolute fact. Also, it is <i>not</i> true that dominant genes are always the most common. If the mutation that produced these genes only produced very few of them, then regardless of their dominance they will not necessarily have become very widespread. Many genetic diseases are dominant, but still most people don't have a genetic disease. Obviously it is the Muggleborns who are a case of the recessive gene resetting to the dominant form. Noneofyourbusiness 18:08, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even though reemergence of recessive genes is far more common than the very rare reset function? Not to mention, by that logic, that muggle-born magicians would be extremely likely to produce non-magical children, making them just as dangerous as the elitists believe them to be - which the author is clearly arguing against. As for the point about genetic diseases: they are rare because many carriers of those diseases certainly used to have a high chance of dying before being able to breed, and others would deliberately choose to not risk passing on the disease (whether it could be passed on or not: epileptics were at times discouraged from marriage because it was thought hereditary, which was an issue in the case of Ferdinand V of Austria (The Cretin)), and others would not be able to get married because their disease made them unappealing or unattractive to the opposite sex. Very few sufferers from such hereditary diseases, prior to the last century, managed to pass their genes on. We may well see a rise, given that people are less superficial or fearful these days. But magic, in the Potterverse, was not a hereditary disease. There is nothing to suggest that wizards and witches are somehow less capable of breeding. More to the point, if magic were dominant, the more rational magicians would have noticed that muggle-magical unions produced mostly magical children. They would have taken steps to breed-out muggles: Britain, as an island, would within a thousand years, probably have been entirely magical. And given that the Seclusion was only imposed in the 1600s, there is no reason to think that magicians and muggles did not freely intermarry. And the most paranoid magicians looked at these marriages, and said 'Most of their kids aren't our sort!' THAT is what had the elitists running scared all these years - a careless observation. They saw that most maggle-muggle kids weren't wizards, and didn't see that all-magical marriages produced entirely magical offspring (with two or so Squibs per generation), regardless of blood purity. That is far easier to accept than a scientifically impossible statement from the author. And it is easier to accept the obvious - muggle-borns are the distant descendants of wizards, whose recessive genes have bubbled up - than to imagine that a very rare phenomenon provides Hogwarts with 25% of its annual intake. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 17:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Hello. This is magic we're talking about." So does that mean that it doesn't conform to the rules the author has tried to claim it functions by? Either this is a fairy-tale, where anyone can simply say 'open sesame' and operate the magic, or dance naked, or be a seventh child of a seventh child, or pray to the gods; or it conforms to real rules. Could magic, as we have seen it in the Harry Potter Universe, make the sun set in the south, or allow a person to create ships from rainwater without taking a breath? It functions according to rules. Rowlings conception of magic is not one in which people simply 'are' magic; it is one which requires exacts a cost from the user, and which is passed down genetically. And magic cannot rewrite biological laws. If magic is inherent according to one's ancestry, then it has to do so in a way that makes sense. One cannot duck the issue with a cry of, "well, it's magic, why should it make sense?". <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 23:48, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>????Does that make an ounce of sense? What do you mean by, 'the gene switches between dominant and recessive every so often.' Are you referring to the reset function, that can make a person with two recessive genes display the dominant characteristics (e.g. genes for blue eyes but displaying brown eyes)? Or are you saying that magic can be carried on both dominant and recessive genes (which would mean that everyone was magical). What all this boils down to is thus: either magic is just magic, with no explanation needed for how you get it (Discworld witches - you simply are one) - in which case there is no point even debating any sort of genetic explanation for inheritance of magic - that would be like trying to hear yellow; or it does operate under a logical, coherent, rational set of rules, including those of genetics - in whch case it has to obey them.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 09:29, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Well, I was thinking that it's usually dominant (thus most half-blood children are magical) but sometimes changes to recessive and resurfaces later (thus the existence of Muggleborns). Alternatively, the reset function (resulting in Muggleborns) could be more common for this gene than for any other. Either way, it does follow genetic rules but not the <i>same</i> rules as normal genes, which is perfectly believable. If magic can interfere with the usual laws of nature, then there's no reason it can't make genes do strange, but physically possible, things. Noneofyourbusiness 15:40, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What, then, would happen when a child received the recessive gene for magic AND the dominant gene for magic? And there is still the inescapable fact that if magic were a dominant gene, there would be millions of magicians in the world. There aren't. Roughly, the wizarding world's population would fit into Chester with little difficulty (i.e. not a lot of them). Magicians are a statistically irrelevant percentage of the total human population in Rowlings Universe. That simply wouldn't be possible if magic were the dominant gene: the basic human drive to procreate would mean that the world's magical population would be noticable, be totally in control due to a simple outnumbering of the mundane population. That hasn't happened; instead, the wizards are cowering in their little enclaves, whilst the rest of the world swarms with muggles. There is no way to explain how that could possibly have happened if one argues that magic is the dominant gene. Furthermore (and correct me if I am wrong) but we are supposed to believe that the Elitists are totally wrong, and talking utter nonsense. Unless we have in store for us a moment of disillusionment in the seventh book, whereby we realise that there is often truth amidst the lies (which seems unlikely given that Rowling claims to be writing a moral tale), we are not going to be suddenly told that actually, muggle-borns are 'tainted', because only they are magical, and have no capability of passing the ability on. Hermione, remember, is meant to be as good as Harry and Ron: whereas, under the 'magic is dominant' theory, the child of herself and another muggle-born would probably have the magical capacity of a gnat, because it had only inherited the recessive genes of its grandparents. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 19:50, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"What, then, would happen when a child received the recessive gene for magic AND the dominant gene for magic?" They'd be magical. "That simply wouldn't be possible if magic were the dominant gene: the basic human drive to procreate would mean that the world's magical population would be noticable, be totally in control due to a simple outnumbering of the mundane population." A) Inbreeding isn't very good for population size, B) Dominant genes are not always the most common. "whereas, under the 'magic is dominant' theory, the child of herself and another muggle-born would probably have the magical capacity of a gnat, because it had only inherited the recessive genes of its grandparents." That's pure nonsense. A Muggleborn's magic genes would be as dominant as those of any other witch or wizard, so even if both Hermione and her husband had only one copy of the magic gene there would be only a one-in-four chance of their child being a Squib.

<p>You only get dominant genes if your parents had dominant genes. How could a muggle-born have a magical gene if it was dominant? Their parents would both have had recessives. As for the inbreeding, we know that not all magicians inbreed (James, Mr Thomas, Mrs Finnegan, etc). And prior to Going into Hiding, there would have been a lot more magical-muggle marriages. With all the associated effects: either plenty of magical children, if magic is a dominant gene, or a seeding of the mundane population with the potential to produce magical children on their own, if magic is a recessive gene. As for 'dominant genes not always being the most common': that only happens if there is, or was, some obstacle to procreation. What obstacle would there have been in the case of magicians? Furthermore, if magic were dominant, the chances are that the Ministry would have insisted on breeding with muggles, to build up the wizarding population, to make wizards the superior force; to force muggles to accept wizards. Whereas what we see with the inbreeding is the result of hundreds of years worth of panic, which has left one solid impression: only the children of two magicians can be 'certain' of being magical; a magical-muggle marriage is simply too risky for anyone wishing to ensure a magical continuance in their family. And to clarify about the 'reset function': although it gives the person the appearance of a dominant, they have the genetic information of a recessive. So, I think that if a muggle-born were the result of a 'defaulter', whilst they would have magic, they could not pass the capacity on themself. Which is yet another reason why magic as a dominant gene would make no sense. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 01:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To what extent is Voldemort actually trying to bring about a wizarding society based on Blood Purity, and how far is he solely pursuing 'ethnic cleansing' (which seems arather inappropriate term, since DE discrimination seems based not on ethnicity but magical heritage)? Voldemort seems to be as contemptuous of Purebloods as he is of Muggles and Muggleborns, and he seems to discriminate not between 'Wizards' and 'Muggles', but between 'those who serve Me' and 'Those who oppose Me' (remember that he went after the Pureblooded Prewetts and Longbottoms, as well as others who I think were Purebloods; and Severus Snape seems to be climbing quite high in the organisation). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 15:46, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I seem to reacall an interview with JKR where she mentions the (unintentional) and creepy similarity between the system of blood purity followed by the wizards in her books and the Nazi's.

<p>As interesting and thorough as this article is, much of it seems to be original analysis and speculation by fans who come to their own conclusions based on evidence given by the books and JK Rowling. Although I have nothing personally against this, Wikipedia needs to be based off of reliable secondary (and not primary) sources. Which means, no original research.</p>
<p>In addition, I don't think that talk about genetics is approriate at all in this article, as it was demonstrated how, in the world defined by Rowling, the laws of genetics don't exactly work as they should. And we're bringing in terms that should be deemed irrelevant to the subject, and talk about genetics is obviously original research. However, if you ask me, magic ability could probably be linked to "magic energies" present in the cells themselves, or maybe mitochrondria, which have their own DNA and exist as part of the cell.</p>
<p>Anyways.... alot of this stuff has got to go, i think...&#160;:(<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueaster_fa8e.html" title="User:Blueaster">Blueaster</a> 23:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears at this point that the article will be kept, so I will report some of the issues raised:</p>
<p>The reason that this appears to be a "fan article" is because it reads like one. It simply describes a concept used throughout the series, making no reference, that I can find at least, to the literaty significance of said concept. It gives a <i><b>ton</b></i> of facts about the stories (way too many) without delving into the symbolism <i>behind</i> the concept. It just doesn't "look" encyclopedic. It looks like the kind of thing I would expect to find on a Harry Potter fansite, not in an encyclopedia. As it stands, this isn't an article about a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_%28literature%29.html" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a> but about a simple <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_technique.html" title="Literary technique">idea</a> used in the books.</p>
<p>The article needs a serious reduction in current content; there are far too many examples, making it seem like an attempt at a research paper and not an encyclopedia article. While articles shold be detailed, this one reads like an <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EListcruft_170b.html" title="Wikipedia:Listcruft">example farm</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it has a serious lack of secondary sources, which is one of the main reasoms it was nominated for deletion. As the main source for this seems to be the books themselves, it appears to be <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">original research by synthesis</a>, which is generally forbidden by Wikipedia policy. It needs to cite multiple <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary sources</a> that report <b>the same</b> information that is presented in the article.</p>
<p>If these issues are not fixed soon after the deletion discussion closes, it stands a good chance of being nominated again with a reason such as "Previously closed as <b>Keep and cleanup</b> but was not cleaned up and still appears to fail <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and is still written like an essay" which is more likely to attract some "delete"&#160;!votes than the current nom. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small><i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.Z-man_8ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man"><font color="navy" face="cursive">¢</font></a></i></b> 19:53, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One major problem I noticed going through the article is the prevolence of words/phrases like "can be assumed", "is implied", "therefore", etc. Words like these are basically the definition of original research by synthesis of published material. You can't just say: "The book says A and it says B so, C must also be true." That may be fine for a research paper, but not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small><i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.Z-man_8ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man"><font color="navy" face="cursive">¢</font></a></i></b> 02:59, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
