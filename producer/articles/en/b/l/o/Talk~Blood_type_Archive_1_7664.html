<p>What still needs to be done here? There needs to be expansion on the evolutionary and social significance sections, but that needs to be left up to someone with more medical expertise. Is there anything else? <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">Kerowyn</a> 07:55, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Frankly, the article is in a fine shape and needs no further cleanup. It could indeed do with some expansion (such as the automated typing done in transfusion laboratories) but cleanup is not necessary. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 08:08, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would it be worth promoting the Kell group to its own section? After ABO and rhesus incompatibility, Kell incompatibility is probably the third most important cause of serious hemolytic reactions in transfusion patients. In fact, when it comes to typing 'trauma packs' (units of packed red cells for use in urgent tranfusion situations where they can't wait for group-specific blood) at my laboratory we use Diamed Rhesus/Kell cards and won't use a K-positive unit. -- Danielle</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Blood type is determined by the antigens (epitopes) on the surface of a red blood cell. Some of these are proteins, while others are proteins with polysaccharides attached. The absence of some of these markers leads to production of antibodies against this marker. The exact reason why this happens is poorly understood, as generally an antigen needs to be present to elicit an immune response.</i> -This needs editing, the reason the antibodies against the A and B antigens are present is that there is no negative selection of the B lymphocytes that produce these antibodies, and the production of antibodies against antigens A and B is constitutive (unless prevented by negative selection).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now if you could give a source for this fairly speculative idea (why would it be consitutive? what other antibodies are produced constitutively?). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 13:25, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you believe that a certain area of the article needs particular improvement, please let me know here. This article was given to the Taskforce because "It repeats itself, is weirdly formatted." I'll try to clean up what I can, and check the science of the article, but the article as is looks fine. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">Kerowyn</a> 01:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've done some cleanup after reverting to a stable version.

<dd>It now reads like a textbook, not an encyclopedia. Reverted. Scientific and technical info IS important, but it should also be easy for people that are not medical students to get information quickly, especially with regards to things such as what blood types can accept what.<br /></dd>

<p>Under "Social significance" the article states:</p>

<dd><i>In the United States, few African Americans donate blood, resulting in a shortage of U-negative and Duffy-negative blood for African American patients.</i></dd>

<p>However, the U-negative type is not mentioned anywhere else in the article, and Duffy-negative only briefly mentioned (and its significance to African-Americans remains unexplained). <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENeckro_8bdb.html" title="User:Neckro">neckro</a> 01:16, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>'Other blood types' observes that "These blood types systems are generally not significant for blood donations". But 'Social significance' implies that Duffy, at least, <i>is</i> significant. Could somebody who knows their facts better than me correct this discrepancy? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 00:46, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>These other blood types usually aren't medically significant. Duffy does seem to be significant because of its occurance in African populations. I'll see what I can do. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerowyn_1be6.html" title="User:Kerowyn">Kerowyn</a> 02:09, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Actually Rhesus is indeed medically significant, because of the "Mother-fetus incompatibility", but this is essentially a "Western problem". In Asia, less than 0.01% of the people are rhesus-negative, indeed "very rare". On the opposite, Duffy-negative groups are not rare since most people in Africa and the majority of African-Americans are Duffy-negative. Some tribes in India are also predominently Duffus-negative. It is even possible that there is more Duffy-negative people in the world, than Rhesus-negative people. And this is medically significant because Duffy-negativeness provides some resistance against two variants of malaria. So, in addition of some focus on the Rhesus, the statistics focusing on US and Europeans (while there are huge geographical variations) make the article a little WASP-oriented as it is now.</li>

<dd>Just going by the blood group, it's possible for a B+ father and a A+ mother to produce a O- child. AFAIK, brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes, so that part seems unlikely from my experience. For an objective result, a DNA paternity test is still indicated. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 04:50, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can a O+ dad and an A+ mom have an O- child?</p>
<p>Yes. Take the major blood group first: Dad has two "O" alleles (if he had any other, he wouldn't be type "O".) Mom has at least one "A" allele. Her other allele can be either "A" or "O", and she'll still have blood type "A". If it's an "O", and her child inherits it from her, the child will also inherit an "O" from its dad, and will be blood type O. So an "O" dad and "A" mom can have either "O" or "A" children. If mom is AO, about half their children will be type A, and half will be O. If mom is AA, all their children will be AO.</p>
<p>Now take Rh factor. Both parents are Rh+, so each has at least one Rh+ allele. But their other allele can be Rh+ or Rh-. If each of the parents has both Rh+ and Rh- alleles, they will both be Rh+, but will be able to have either Rh+ or Rh- children (three quarters of their children would be expected (by chance) to be Rh+, and one quarter would be expected to be Rh-). - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 3 July 2005 05:04 (UTC)</p>

The correct pronunciation is "blood type null". <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landsteiner.html" title="Landsteiner">Landsteiner</a> named this blood type 0 (null) because its red blood cells carry neither the A nor the B antigens—the amount of A and B is zero.

<li>Actually, it's the letter 'O', not the digit '0' (and it would be by common usage even if Landsteiner had named it '0', which he didn't). Landsteiner called it "C" when he published in 1901. Group ‘C’ was first labelled ‘O’ in 1910 by von Dungern and Hirschfeld. Whether it stands for "Ohne", meaning "without", which has been claimed, or is a symbol meaning "null", it's now ABO not AB0. The page you point to is one of 57 pages that Google finds on the web that give AB0 and blood type, as compared with 13,500 that use ABO and blood type. -- <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:11, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I certainly wouldn't advise using Google to solve a science fact or a historic fact, but it's fine as a quick-and-dirty way to document current usage, especially when the count is overwhelmingly lopsided. I frankly can't think of a reference that would say "use 'O' not '0'" (or vice versa): the most likely would be a style guide such as the <i>American Medical Association Manual of Style</i>, but I'm not even sure it would be addressed there, and I don't have it at hand. Taking the two most likely from those at hand, it's "ABO" in Harrison's <i>Principles of Internal Medicine</i> and William's <i>Hematology</i>, and in pretty much any textbook where you can tell the "O" and "0" apart. And consider this: When someone tells you his blood type, he says "blood type oh", not "blood type null" or "blood type zero". Which would be one reason why even <i>if</i> it did start as "0" it certainly has wound up as "O". -- Your sanguinary friend, <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 21:28, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Outside view from Germany: Over here, this is definitely blood type 0 (zero, "Null" in German). I have often observed that speakers of English, especially Americans, say "Oh" (the letter O) even when they clearly actually mean "zero" (in phone numbers, for example), presumably because it is shorter (one syllable, as opposed to two for "zero"). (Similarly, they call the last letter of the Latin alphabet (Z) a "see" instead of a "sed", even if "see" already is the third letter of the Latin Alphabet (C).) So my guess would be that, even if the blood type was at first spelled as a 0 (zero), it was pronounced as "oh" anyway, which lead to it being written as "O" also. --<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenzweig_438e.html" title="User:Rosenzweig">Rosenzweig</a> 15:02, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually there is a distinct difference between the American pronounciations of "Z" and "C", and its aural discernment by native Anglophones (of any country) is not even an issue. "Z" as pronounced by Americans ("zee") is far closer to "tsee" than to "see". It's the same difference as that between "zip" and "sip"...easy for native Anglophones, difficult for others. But that's way off-topic.</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't say the zee/see descernment was a non-issue. It can be hard to tell them apart on some circumstances, even for a native speaker. Pronouncing it 'zed' might be recommended if it is vitally important that people understand you.</dd>

<dd>Most often you would use a latex agglutination test. It detects antigen in a sample using antibody bound to a bead or other visible material. A positive reaction causes the beads to clump together. The bead clumps can be seen with the naked eye. A negative reaction leaves the latex beads in solution and looks milky. If beads coated with anti-"A" antibody cause clumping, you have the "A" gene; if beads coated with anti-"B" antibody cause clumping, you have the "B" gene. A "type and crossmatch" used before transfusion is a more detailed and comprehensive test. - &lt;unknown user&gt; 21:21, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A transfusion reaction occurs when antibodies react to the antigens present in blood. O type blood does not contain any A or B antigens, so it does not cause transfusion reactions.

<dd>I suspect the answer is that differences in our genetic makeup make us different and there may be some selective advantages to certain blood types in certain conditions. Variety is good. Say, for instance, one rare blood type somehow protects you (and a small bunch of people with the same blood type) against a new, incurable deadly infectious disease that's rapidly spreading across the globe, well, if a significant proportion of the world's population gets killed off, suddenly your blood type is not so rare anymore.

<p>In the book Eat Right for Your Type, Dr D'Adamo states that in ancient populations, Type O was predominant, and other types were rarer mutations. As different conditions were imposed on a population for different reasons (such as migration to different regions), other types proved to be more suited for survival in those circumstances. Off the top of my head, I remember him offering the Black Plague in Europe as an example where Type A came to dominance because of better survivability characteristics than Type O. He also states that some foods contain <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lectin.html" title="Lectin">lectins</a> that agglutinate all ABO types (a bean, maybe castor or lima, I forget which) which is problematic, while some foods only agglutinate certain types. Furthermore some foods prove to be beneficial for certain ABO types, which explains his book's title. Many early diets and cooking styles native to populations reflect these predispositions (if only as a matter of natural selcetion at work), he proposes, and it would be good for us to assume similar diets to improve our health. Frankly, I am suprised to see no mention of D'Adamo's work in Wikipedia, perhaps I will hunt down his books and offer more. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastlan_a711.html" title="User:Castlan">Castlan</a> 19:09, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While not as rigourously strict with the science as it should be (at least what is presented in his books) ER4YT doesn't seem to be significantly paranormal or disprovable. So while it has a stigma of pseudoscience, that stigma hasn't really been justified. Some supposed refutation I have come across turned out to be of even poorer quality, either reflecting it's own pseudoscience, or a lack of familiarity with the nominal subject. I would really like to see some explicit, maybe even rigorous debunking of D'Adamo's (occasionaly controversial? I can't see why) offerings. As of yet, I consider this closer to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a> than unfalsifiable pseudoscience.</dd>
<dd>In any case, I don't think that anything I previously posted on this matter is all that fantastic. Is the mere mention of Doctor D'Adamo, or Eat Right For Your Type (ER4YT) enough to invalidate the respose I offered? Other than that vague stigma, is my above answer to the utility of divergent blood types unhelpful or incorrect? I do believe that I was careful enough to avoid anything that wasn't NPOV. Maybe, I shouldn't have tread so lightly, so as to provoke more of a direct response. Because while I like how it advocates my [Type O] consumption of most animal proteins, I find it's avoid lists including wheat and dairy to be cumbersome. My strongest objection to what D'Adamo presents is that it isn't comprehensive (cumbersome) enough. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastlan_a711.html" title="User:Castlan">Castlan</a> 07:58, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Chimps have dominant A and a little O, and gorillas dominant B with a little O. Humans have supposedly evolved from a common ancestor, and we have over 95% identity with the chimp genome... So A being the "oldest" is extremely likely. O is a mutation. --Ody 20:44, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wait a minute...if we have common blood types with both chimps and gorillas, wouldn't all three have to be present in some ancestor? Unless, of course, humans are the product of chimps and gorillas (or their distinct ancestors) crossbreeding... Aklaus 07:06, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the section stating that Japan researched blood type because "Western scientists were using blood type information as a sign of Asian inferiority because B type is common among asians and animals" (paraphrase). After exhaustive searching, I am prepared to say that this is probably an urban legend.

<p>In Japan, a popular belief is that personality is related to blood type. From the preponderance of some blood type in a population, "experts" claim to be able to deduce the character of that population. The "experts" also believe that they can calculate how well the blood types of different people match. A Japanese employer could therefore aim to get a proper mix of blood types among their personnel. Am i correct to assume Japanese prefer blood type B? I just assumed that because blood tpye B is more common in Asia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no preferred blood type in Japan, it's situational. On the surface, it's all about gauging compatibility between people. Below the surface, it's a way to justify preconceived conclusions about a person or group of people. From direct observation, it seems to me that the traits the Japanese like to ascribe to "Type O" also coincide with traits that they ascribe to stereotypes of Westerners. Well, やっぱり ... looks like "Type O" is more common in Westerners than Japanese. 211.128.87.99 07:00, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I've learned about Japanese culture and my own personal deductions, I would say that the Japanese Blood Type Theory is the foudning reason why video games often list blood types in character stats. Because most Japanese people know the personality traits assigned to each blood type, companies put them in character stats in order to inform people of the character's personality in a shortened way.Spacegirl92 06:56, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It turns out there are more factors including antibodies that can make a donor incompatible with a recipient.

<p>What would happen if I received a transfusion from someone who had an incompatible blood type?

<dd>It depends on the nature of the incompatibility, but an Arh- patient receiving Brh+ may develop a severe reaction with acute haemolysis, respiratory failure and renal failure.

<p>I tried to do some cleaning up, but immediately realised that the old format was a lot better. I don't think we need subsections on every one of the ABO system. It clutters and distracts. Most of this information can be explained briefly in some prose and then elaborated in clear tables. For example, a table could state that a person with AB can receive all types, that RBCs express both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and that the world prevalence is 4%.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to classify Kell, Kidd etc as "blood types". They are part of a person's extended RBC antigen pattern, which is identified as part of blood transfusion screening. They are not <i>alternatives to</i> ABO. Someone can be A Rh+ve and be positive or negative for Kell at the same time. The only problem is that in people <i>negative</i> for these epitopes, administration of a batch of <i>positive</i> blood will give rise to antibodies which may complicate further transfusions.</p>

<p>Chaosfeary, I'm not sure why you reverted. The information I removed was <i>completely</i> redundant. Everything you inserted was simply the contents of the tables in the form of fairly clumsy prose. You were creating headers for every ABO/Rh subtype, which was not necessary to get the basic point accross.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I've been restructuring the article to make it more user-friendly. This includes a short introduction of the general principles of blood type, and a historical note on Landsteiner, Wiener and other pioneers.</p>

Try looking for von Decastello and Sturli</p>
<p><br />
in 1901 von Decastello and Sturli discovered group AB. (A. von Decastello and A. Sturli, 'Ueber die Isoagglutinine im Serum gesunder und kranker Menschen', Mfinch. med. Wschr., 1902, 49: 1090-1095.)</p>
<p>Independently, two other workers-in addition to Landsteiner, and von Decastello and Sturli-demonstrated that human blood could be classified into four groups. Jan Jansky (J. Jansky, 'Haematologick6 studie u. psychotiku', Sborn. Klinick;, 1907, 8: 85-139.), a Czech, published his work in 19075 in an obscure local journal. In America Moss published his own (very similar) work in 1910.(W. L. Moss, 'Studies on isoagglutinins and isohemolysins', Bull. Johns Hopk. Hosp., 1910, 21:63-70.)</p>
<p>unfortunately inadequacies of communication led to duplication not only of work, but also of the nomenclatures devised to describe the new blood groups.</p>
<p>Landsteiner had designated his three groups by the letters A, B, and C-the latter being that in which "the serum agglutinates the red blood cells of Group A and B but the red blood cells of C are not influenced by the sera of A and B" -while von Decastello and Sturli had not given any particular name to the fourth group which they had discovered.</p>
<p>Jansky had used Roman numerals to identify his four blood groups and Moss did likewise-but whereas (by chance) both Jansky and Moss had used II for Landsteiner's A, and III for his B, they differed over the usage of I and IV, Jansky referring to Landsteiner's C as I, and to the group of von Decastello and Sturli as IV, while Moss reversed this, calling Landsteiner's C group IV, and von Decastello and Sturli's group, I.--Neilfraser3010 13:31, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took this out becuase while basically correct it is not to do with blood types in the generally used sense. (There are another 140 or so Haemoglobin variants mostly of no significance, if one wanted to get into that). "The autosomal recessive disorder <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickle-cell_disease.html" title="Sickle-cell disease">sickle-cell anemia</a> (so named because it causes red blood cells to become flatter and <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickle.html" title="Sickle">sickle</a>-shaped) is found primarily in people of African descent; while this condition causes significant health problems, the same gene also gives resistance to malaria. This resistance is a dominant trait, so somebody who inherits only one copy of the sickle-cell gene enjoys better resistance to malaria without the problems of anemia. This offers carriers an evolutionary advantage in malaria-prone areas, an example of <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterozygote_advantage.html" title="Heterozygote advantage">heterozygote advantage</a>.

<p>and got confused. My my blood donor card lists my blood type as "A pos". I had to read the whole article to realize the "pos" referred to Rh factor, and that "A pos" was NOT a synonym for "B-negative". I'm not sure if/how to address this.

<p>I'm not a geneticist, but the tables in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_type.html#Rh_factor_frequency" title="Blood type">Blood_type#Rh_factor_frequency</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_type.html#Inheritance_2" title="Blood type">Blood_type#Inheritance_2</a> seem to disagree.

Similarly, shouldn't an allele frequency of 1% in the non-African, non-European population translate to a factor frequency of 0.01% rather than the 0.1% stated? The European figure looks right, though; allele frequency = 40% = 0.4, 0.4<sup>2</sup> = 0.16 = 16% as stated.</p>

<dd>That could account for it in theory, but I'd be surprised if inter-group mixing was low enough to allow for those numbers in practice; since both disagree with the theoretical answer by a factor of exactly 10, I think a calculation error is the most likely explanation. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:38, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that it is a bad habit to write "Rh negative" as "Rh-". These occurs several times on this page. Anyone, who has worked in blood bank would know that that this could be misread or changed with a smudge. You could get disiplined for this sort of sloppy writing in a blood bank. It may not be taught like this on the wards but it is equally vital on the wards I think. It is the minimum to write "Rh neg" and "Rh negative" would be preferable. Similarly "Rh positive" should never be written "Rh+". "Rh pos" is the minimum and preferably "Rh positive". Accuracy if vital in all aspects of blood groups. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> 18:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that when labelling samples etc, robust identification is good. But in <i>discussion</i>, it's not as much of an issue, and compact expression can be handy when naming blood types over and over. For instance, the Australian Red Cross blood bank's "About Blood" section uses the +/- notation in explaining blood types to potential donors<a href="http://www.giveblood.redcross.org.au/Donor/aboutblood/bloodtypes.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.giveblood.redcross.org.au/Donor/aboutblood/bloodtypes.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, as does the San Diego Blood Bank<a href="http://www.sandiegobloodbank.org/blood_donors/blood_donation_faq.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sandiegobloodbank.org/blood_donors/blood_donation_faq.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and the (UK) National Blood Service uses both<a href="http://www.blood.co.uk/visually_impaired/vi_e13basic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blood.co.uk/visually_impaired/vi_e13basic.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But if the +/- notation is deprecated in a clinical setting, that could be worth acknowledging in the article (especially if it can be confirmed that this is a worldwide practice; many other blood collection policies vary from place to place). --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 22:23, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If O allele is recessive, how did type O came to be the most frequent?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because it's common enough that a lot of people inherit two copies of it. If the incidence of O allele is ~ 65%, then the chance that you'll get two copies of it is 0.65 x 0.65 ~ 40%, so we have roughly 40% type O, with the rest split between A, B, and AB.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If A, B, and O alleles were all equally common (33% each), we'd expect to see only 11% of the population with O, 33% with A, 33% with B, and 22% with AB - but as it happens, O is significantly more common than A or B. A recessive allele that's common enough can still become the most frequently expressed. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 02:42, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From the above reference, how about something like this: "Animal blood sometimes agglutinates (to varying levels of intensity) with human blood group reagents, but the structure of the blood group antigens in animals is not always identical to those typically found in humans. The classification of animal blood groups therefore uses different blood typing systems to those used for classification of human blood." Refs:

<li><i>Two categories of blood groups, human-type and simian-type, occur in apes and monkeys and can be routinely tested by methods established for grouping human blood. Abundant data have been obtained on blood groups of chimpanzees, baboons and macaques.

Two complex chimpanzee blood group systems, V-A-B-D and R-C-E-F systems, proved to be counterparts of the human M-N-S and Rh-Hr blood group systems, respectively.

<dd>I agree that there is not enough information on horses in particular from this reference, but it says "These are similar to A, B, AB, and O groups found in humans."

<p>It's nice to have such a well-designed page to start with for MCOTW! Excellent work! I think that <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman's</a> thoughts above are right on. This could be a nice portal-esque page into the wide world of transfusion medicine. It's certainly likely to be the place that most laypeople would look when searching for information about a wide variety of blood type related information. I think that this article would do well to use the summary style which is popular on large subjects undergoing featured article consideration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization - I think that the lead is too long, too involved, and not in lay terms. I think that changing the structure to one more reminiscent of the medicine template (ie history last) would be somewhat beneficial, though I think that information about the ABO/Rh groups should be at the top because they represent the most common introductions to blood type. Much of the ABO blood group and Rhesus information could be off-loaded into separate articles and ABO delinked from this page. Creation of individual antigen pages would be nice - I've created a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_human_blood_group_systems.html" title="List of human blood group systems">list of human blood group systems</a> but will await comments before replacing the list currently in the article. Bombay phenotype and McLeod phenotype could go on their respective system pages and/or could have their own pages created. I think that compatibility and human diseases (such as HDN) should stay on this page, though separate articles could also go into more depth. I think that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfusion_medicine.html" title="Transfusion medicine">transfusion medicine</a> should be expanded and the platelet/FFP information should be placed there.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just my preliminary thoughts and I'd love to hear what everyone else (especially those who have done so much good work here!) thinks.

I have synced the list with the main page and would be appreciative if you'd point out the errors so they can be fixed! Lists such as the one currently on the page do not fly at FAC and using the separate page is at least one way to go. I prefer to make redlinks when I feel that an article should be created. I think that all of the antigens should be created, so I think that it makes sense to link them now instead of having to go back later! I think that a separate page for the "minor blood group antigens" in addition to the list also makes sense. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 02:23, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, thanks! That sure was quick! I am leaving for summer holidays, and won't have time to comment any detail now, but I think you've done a marvelous job! Only one thing, you use K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> for K and k. I don't think this is standard nomenclature, although K1 and K2 (no sub- or superscripts), are sometimes used. Also, for the K<sub>null</sub> phenotype, I believe a superscript usually is used: K<sup>0</sup>, and not a subscript as you have used. I'm not changing it now since I don't have time to check sources. Regarding the separate list of blood groups, the most glaring error was the statement that H was not immunogenic, but by syncing you fixed that one. The only remaining item that I would question, is the usage of K<sub>1</sub> for K. Regarding the transfusion medicine template, I understand your suggestion as removing the {{cardiovascular_system}} template, and creating a {{transfusion_medicine}} template. I agree wholeheartedly, but have no idea about how to do this. Again, thank you. --<a href="../../../v/i/b/User%7EVibo56_016d.html" title="User:Vibo56">vibo56</a><sup><a href="../../../v/i/b/User_talk%7EVibo56_fcce.html" title="User talk:Vibo56">&#160;<u>talk</u></a></sup> 11:35, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I went ahead and created the transfusion medicine template. Several other things could be added (such as cross-matching, Coombs test, etc.) but I left it where it is. I propose adding the antigen systems to the template as the pages are created. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 23:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that the wiki needs an page on cross-matching blood. There is a Coombs test page which I did some work on. Should HDN be in the template? <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> 13:13, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I added HDN to the template. The Coombs page has some nice information - I think that it would be nice to have a better crossmatching page. I rewrote the introduction to this page. Let me know what you think. The other introduction was wonderful, but I'm thinking ahead and wanted to make sure that each medical term is explained before we use it. Sometimes it leads to imprecise (or even erroneous!) language, so let me know if I've made a mistake! I think it would be nice to go into the history of the discovery of ABO, Rh, the Coombs test with Kell, etc. shortly thereafter. Discussion of the ABO/Rh in some detail, a representative/interesting sample of other antigens, followed by discussion of disease states. A lot of this is already in place, I'm just hypothesizing one way to develop the page. I too will be leaving for the summer (one month in Siberia away from computers) on Thursday so hopefully this page will be featured when I return! <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 03:13, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Linked McLeod syndrome to <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kell_antigen_system.html#McLeod_phenotype" title="Kell antigen system">Kell_antigen_system#McLeod_phenotype</a> until a separate page is created for it.</dd>
<dd>The intro could do with restoring the statement that the article is mainly on human blood types (even though the page on animal blood types does not exist yet), otherwise it's a great improvement.</dd>
<dd>I have shortened and simplified the ABO system section as it now has its own page, where more detail can be included, and summarised the history of discovery, as the use of ABO was too repetitive, will do the same with Rhesus. <a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApers0n_d5e5.html" title="User:Apers0n">apers0n</a> 10:19, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry, I forgot to add that I think a) we should move the page to "Blood type (human)" or b) should put a disambig at the top of the page to a "blood type (non-human)" page. Even if we write an exhaustive article on humans, if we leave it this way (even with a caveat that the article will cover just humans) we will not get it past FAC because it will not be complete. See <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> for a similar case in which we had to create a non-human pneumonia page to satisfy FAC. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 10:52, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In creating the template, I've set up a few other new pages for anyone who would like to share their expertise. I created a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfusion_reaction.html" title="Transfusion reaction">transfusion reaction</a> page which is pretty stubby but should discuss the common reactions and should be plugged into the "request for expansion" on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfusion.html" title="Transfusion">transfusion</a> page when done. I've created <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transfusion-related_immunomodulation.html" title="Transfusion-related immunomodulation">Transfusion-related immunomodulation</a> to round out the red links associated with that. There are still multiple antigen systems to work on, but I've added <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kell.html" title="Kell">Kell</a>, <a href="../../../k/x/_/Kx_antigen.html" title="Kx antigen">Kx antigen</a>, and <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidd_antigen.html" title="Kidd antigen">Kidd antigen</a>. And then there's this article. I think that it will improve when we can draw on the supporting pages. We still need really nice <a href="../../../a/b/o/ABO_dd88.html" title="ABO">ABO</a> and <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhesus_factor.html" title="Rhesus factor">Rhesus factor</a> pages. Others have mentioned writing them so I'll hold off for now. However, I think that they will be key to allowing work on this particular page to go forward with summary style, etc. The Bombay information needs to be moved off onto an ABO page. We need to meticulously reference all of the statements that remain. I think that we should expand the clinical importance section of the article and maybe discuss acquired changes in blood type/antigens in a small section. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 03:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><i>The ABO antigen is also expressed on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein, which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding).

<li><a href="../../../c/r/o/Talk%7ECross-matching_8130.html" title="Talk:Cross-matching">Talk:Cross-matching</a> has a To do list.</li>
<li>The Transfusion medicine template section on Blood products could be usefully pointed towards a new page on Blood products - alternatively it could point towards the category?</li>
<li>The transfusion medicine template points Transfusion reactions to 'Blood_transfusion#Complications' - this could do with it's own page.</li>
<li>Human blood group systems (and consequently the Blood type page) has increased the number of recognised blood groups from 26 to 29 following parts of this discussion copied from the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Talk%7EHuman_blood_group_systems_0d42.html" title="Talk:Human blood group systems">talk page</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"The intro states that the ISBT recognises 26 systems. The table lists 29. Something is wrong here. Number 3 and 28 appear to refer to the same system. Moreover, Issit and Anstee (Applied blood group serology 4th edition, Montgomery Scientific publications, 1998) state that "The Ii collection does not satisfy the criteria established by the ISBT working party for designation as a blood group system" (page 277). The ISBT working party insists that there has to be absolute genetic independence, before enumerating a new blood group system. When such evidence is absent, the term antigen collection is used. Thus, Ii is an antigen collection, and not a blood type system. Regarding GIL, I'm not sure about whether independence is established, but since the gene has been cloned and the human genome has been sequenced, this should be knowable. 62.16.189.71 19:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC)"</dd>

<dd>"Looking at the ISBT website again it says: "<i>Blood group collections (Table 3): genetically-, biochemically-, or serologically-related sets of antigens, <b>which do not fulfill the criteria for system status</b>"</i> includes <b>I</b> and <b>Glob</b>, although these are also listed on table 1 (Blood group systems) - updated 2004.

<p>Can Rhesus D Pos and Rhesus D Neg be added? Or is this an idea for a new svg. It might be informative to see visually that although RhD antigens (if Rh D positive) are present on RBC's there is normally no antibodies, (and that if they do occur they are usaully, but not always IgG). The Rhesus part can go on the rhesus page, the ABO part can go on the ABO page (I have just made a link on the ABO page - the svg looks fine there) and a combined image can go on the blood type page. Or does this sound too complicated? This expanded svg can go in ABO &amp; Rh section of the blood type page. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> 09:54, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll work on several different ways to present it and see what looks best. Probably over the next week, since I'm in a stretch here of overnight shifts. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 03:07, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just finished a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_agglutinin.html" title="Cold agglutinin">cold agglutinin</a> svg and will work on a few others as time permits. <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 05:36, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With different headings and caption this svg would also work on the agglutination (biology) artical page. It would also work on the blood groups page with yet different headings and caption in the compatibility section. I do not known how to edit the headings of the svg. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> 10:06, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I can do it if you let me know - I didn't know if you'd prefer to have an IgG/Coombs type on the agglutination page or if you'd rather have one side with and one side without IgM (either of which would be easy!). I'm almost done with the ABO and Bombay antigen diagram (I am done but want to sit on it for a few days) <a href="../../../i/n/v/User%7EInvictaHOG_427a.html" title="User:InvictaHOG">InvictaHOG</a> 14:56, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Good point; agglutination (biology) would include both IgG Coombs type agglutination and IgM agglutination. There is a schematic on the Coombs page. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> 08:51, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
