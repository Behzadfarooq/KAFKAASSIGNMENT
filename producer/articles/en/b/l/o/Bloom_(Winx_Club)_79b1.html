<p>Bloom truly cares for her friends. She's the glue that holds the group together: after the other girls bicker and argue, Bloom's the one that plays peacekeeper and smooths everything out between everyone. Bloom is the only one, out of her 6 friends, who has a name that doesn't end with the letter "A" (this may be due to the Italian origin of the show).</p>

<p>Bloom was born on December 10th<sup id="_ref-birthday_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birthday" title="">[1]</a></sup> on the planet Domino (Sparks in the 4kids version).<sup id="_ref-homeworld_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homeworld" title="">[2]</a></sup> She was born into royalty. She has an older sister named Dafne(who is now dead). Her real parents are Queen Miriam and King Oritel. Shortly after birth, her planet was attacked by a coven of witches who sought to retrieve the Dragon's Flame<sup id="_ref-dragon_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dragon" title="">[3]</a></sup> from Domino.<sup id="_ref-homeworld_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homeworld" title="">[2]</a></sup> During this battle, the lively culture and population was decimated. In final sacrificial act to ensure that the Dragon's Flame<sup id="_ref-dragon_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dragon" title="">[3]</a></sup> did not fall into the wrong hands, Bloom's sister, Dafne, sent her into a portal that lead to another planet, Earth.</p>
<p>On Earth, Bloom appeared in a building that her father Mike, a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefighter.html" title="Firefighter">firefighter</a>, was in. Mike rescued Bloom and eventually adopted her. Bloom's adoptive mother was Vanessa, a <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florist.html" title="Florist">florist</a>. Bloom grew up to have an uneventful childhood and had no awareness of her true origins. In her youth, she received a gift, her close pet rabbit Kiko and met her nemesis, Mitzi.</p>
<p>In her late teens, Bloom encountered <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a> fighting at a local park with <a href="../../../k/n/u/Knut.html" title="Knut">Knut</a>, an ogre. Just as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a> was about to be defeated, Bloom used a magical attack and turn the fight in Stella's favour, and both of them were able to defeat <a href="../../../k/n/u/Knut.html" title="Knut">Knut</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a>, impressed with Bloom's power, encouraged her to return to Alfea, the prestigious School for Fairies which she studied at. Curious about developing her powers and where they came from, Bloom agreed, after convincing her parents.</p>

<p>At Alfea, the School for <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy.html" title="Fairy">Fairies</a>, Bloom and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a> shared the same dormitory, and they met <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flora_%28Winx_Club%29_799e.html" title="Flora (Winx Club)">Flora</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musa_%28Winx_Club%29_d197.html" title="Musa (Winx Club)">Musa</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecna_%28Winx_Club%29_ff7e.html" title="Tecna (Winx Club)">Tecna</a>, their fellow roommates, and soon they became friends. One day when they were all going out together in Magix City, they were attacked by a trio of witches, otherwise known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Trix_%28Winx_Club%29_926f.html" title="The Trix (Winx Club)">The Trix</a>, Icy, Darcy and Stormy who attacked Bloom for spying on them. Soon, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a> and the other girls repelled the attack, and when they got back to Alfea, they decided to call themselves collectively the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winx_Club_6c93.html" title="Winx Club">Winx Club</a>.</p>
<p>Being the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winx_Club_6c93.html" title="Winx Club">Winx Club</a>, they gained the attention of <a href="../../../m/s/2E/Ms._Faragonda_e4e8.html" title="Ms. Faragonda">Ms. Faragonda</a>, the headmistress of Alfea. <a href="../../../m/s/2E/Ms._Faragonda_e4e8.html" title="Ms. Faragonda">Ms. Faragonda</a> took interest in the reasons of constant attacks on the girls of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winx_Club_6c93.html" title="Winx Club">Winx Club</a> and in particular, Bloom. <a href="../../../m/s/2E/Ms._Griselda_8b43.html" title="Ms. Griselda">Ms. Griselda</a>, assistant to the headmistress, also took notice of the group but perceived Bloom and her friends as unsettled first-year students.</p>
<p>After the continued attacks culminated in the kidnapping and rescue of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a>, Bloom and her friends learned that the reason for the constant fighting was that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Trix_%28Winx_Club%29_926f.html" title="The Trix (Winx Club)">The Trix</a> were seeking to get the power of the Dragon's Flame,<sup id="_ref-dragon_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dragon" title="">[3]</a></sup> and after a fight in which Bloom unleashed an enormous amount of energy, were soon convinced that Bloom had it. Bloom, unfamiliar with the term Dragon's Flame,<sup id="_ref-dragon_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dragon" title="">[3]</a></sup> sought the guidance of her headmistress and was told the history of Domino.<sup id="_ref-homeworld_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homeworld" title="">[2]</a></sup> Bloom herself would not know that she had this power into the Trix later succeeded in taking it, leading to a series of journeys for Bloom to regain what she had lost.</p>
<p><a name="Appearance" id="Appearance"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloom_%28Winx_Club%29_79b1.html" title="Edit section: Appearance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Appearance</span></h2>
<p><b>Civilian</b><br />
Bloom has red hair, blue eyes, and medium skin tone. Her daily outfit consists of a blue and yellow midriff shirt, spangled blue colored jeans and yellow wedge sandals. She occasionally, and from season 3 onwards, wears a blue and white striped shirt with little pink hearts, a denim miniskirt with over-the-knee blue socks and lace up blue high-heeled boots.</p>
<p><b>Winx</b><br />
Her Winx outfit is a sparkly blue top decorated with a gold jewel at her chest, a matching skirt and blue ankle boots. She also wears blue gloves around her arms from elbow to wrist and wears a small golden tiara with rounded points atop her head. Her wings are cyan with teal tips. Her Charmix is a heart pin with a pink bag at her waist of the same shape. Surprisingly, (considering both <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layla_%28Winx_Club%29_dd1c.html" title="Layla (Winx Club)">Layla</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a>, who are also princesses), Bloom is the only <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winx_Club_6c93.html" title="Winx Club">Winx Club</a> member that wears a crown in her fairy outfit. (While Stella once did have a crown in the first episode "<a href="../../../i/t/_/It_Feels_Like_Magic_e921.html" title="It Feels Like Magic">It Feels Like Magic</a>", it was a princess-like outfit.)</p>
<p><b>Evil Winx</b><br />
Officially known as 'Dark Bloom', her eyes change color to yellow, with cat-eye pupils. Her lipstick and eyeshadow become purple. Her Winx outfit is of an almost-black blue instead of the usual cyan, but it still sparkles. Her tiara is silver with sharp points and her brooch is a purple diamond. Her wings are sharp and cyan with gray tips.</p>
<p><b>Enchantix</b><br />
The brand-new Enchantix transformation expansion within Season 3 provides each Winx Club member with not only new powers and abilities presumably, but also essentially an entirely new look while within this state, as well. Bloom's Enchantix transformation has not been seen in the show as of yet, but promotional art has been released of all the Winx Club's Enchantix transformations.<a href="http://www.winxclub.com/preview_en.php?lingua=en" class="external free" title="http://www.winxclub.com/preview_en.php?lingua=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.winxclub.com/preview_en.php?lingua=en</a><a href="http://www.winxclub.com/preview_en.php?lingua=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.winxclub.com/preview_en.php?lingua=en" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Bloom's Enchantix is a multi-layered, frilly-like outfit, while primarily cyan in color, also consists of various, rainbow-organized colors of light green, soft pink, light yellow and purple, with pink, translucent above-the-elbow gloves. Her wings, now ample in size, are both light yellow and pink, with a soft alice blue outlining and speckled with dark blue decorative jewels. Her hair (the only one of the Winx girls, besides <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecna_%28Winx_Club%29_ff7e.html" title="Tecna (Winx Club)">Tecna</a>, it seems, to not have it styled in pigtails) has also grown several inches in length and has seemed to earn a much more tame, elegant look and style. She has also discarded her cyan colored boots and dons strappy, barefoot sandals, and wears two sets of blue, flower shaped berets on either side of her head (ironically instead of a tiara as the other Winx girls do, negating <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecna_%28Winx_Club%29_ff7e.html" title="Tecna (Winx Club)">Tecna</a>, and as she traditionally does while within her regular Winx form) in addition to earrings of the same color and shape.</p>

<p>Bloom has a relationship with Prince Sky (who, in the first season, swapped identities with his squire, Brandon, who is Stella's boyfriend. Bloom and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_%28Winx_Club%29_72b0.html" title="Stella (Winx Club)">Stella</a> found out about it in the episode "Secrets Within Secrets" (4kids version: "Royal Heartbreak"))</p>

<p>Bloom is the strongest and most powerful of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winx_Club_6c93.html" title="Winx Club">Winx Club</a>. She has the power of the Dragon's Flame,<sup id="_ref-dragon_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dragon" title="">[3]</a></sup> which is an ancient source of long-lost power and the most powerful magic in all the known realms. She hails from the planet\ Domino,<sup id="_ref-homeworld_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homeworld" title="">[2]</a></sup>or Sparks in the 4kids version, which was destroyed many years ago, with only her and her sister Daphne in spiritual form to be survivors. Domino<sup id="_ref-homeworld_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homeworld" title="">[2]</a></sup> turned into a dark, freezing place.</p>
<p><b>Winx</b><br />
Bloom's transformation sequence is probably the longest out of the Winx girls. Firstly, Bloom spins down into a ball of flame, and it explodes in a white flash. Bloom claps her hands high above her head and cross her hands. Her sleeves and top burn into place. Her wings then stretch out and her tiara flashes onto her head. She flies upwards, and then draws a heart with her fire powers. In her "Charmix" transformation she twirls around before a silver heart appears around her jewel on her top. Then she does a double twirl around and the pink heart appears at the side of her skirt. She was the first to get her Charmix during the Winx's trip to the Resort Realm, but she would not use it until after she had returned to Alfea (she was fifth to transform, only ahead of Flora, who had not even earned hers by that time).</p>
<p>Bloom's attacks are based entirely around the element of fire, and usually consist of fiery blasts and explosions. Bloom has also been able to create fire in different forms, such as when she defeated Icy in the finale of season 1, she created a mass of fire shaped like a dragon, which strangled and broke the enormous "ice" block which held her. Bloom does not name her attacks as often as her fellow Winx girls do. Bloom has also the ability to heal people, as first shown in the 10th episode of season 2 when she revived Sky who died after an attack of Icy in Red Fountain. Later, she used this power to cure the pixies from the spell from Darkar. She would learn about why she had healing powers just before a convergence exam, and at the end of season 2, when she used it to heal herself and her friends, bringing Riven back to live (he sacrificed himself so <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musa_%28Winx_Club%29_d197.html" title="Musa (Winx Club)">Musa</a> could live).</p>
