<p>Now we begin another area of contention: rewriting the winx club character biographies. I initially started rewriting blooms article with the intention that it should be written in a biographical style detailing events from the entire series and that its layout be applied to all enteries. Ultimately, the entire project just became overwhelming trying compress 40+ episodes into one single article (and probably be best left to a season synopsis). With that in mind, I would like to begin the discussion about "How should we write the articles for the winx club characters?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Template Layout</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When I created the template, I had in mind that only information from the <a href="http://www.winxclub.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.winxclub.com/" rel="nofollow">winxclub.com</a> be present to avoid a cluttered appearance and the discrepancies from other versions be list in a section in the article. However, it would be a shame to undo all the contributions from Malkinann and would like recommend that if discrepancies are added to the template they should be listed like <b>Bold italian version</b>/plain 4Kids version.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing I would like to bring up the "gender" designation in the template: should we do away with it? Considering that I seriously doubt anyone else (from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Winx_Club_characters_79d0.html" title="List of minor Winx Club characters">minor character list</a>) will ever have their own article, I have been considering changing "Gender" to "associated pixie" or something to the effect.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Article layout</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As I have mentioned earlier, a biography from events in the series is an ambitious project and one that only the most determined should undertake. With the intention of avoiding spoilers, how about something like this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personal life</dd>
<dd>Magical abilities</dd>
<dd>4Kids modifications</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that those three sections can describe all the characters suffienctly.. If anyone has better ideas, I would like to see them.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin586_fd91.html" title="User:Kevin586">Kenn Caesius</a> 17:45, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whoops, I didn't see this when you first made it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Adding "Associated Pixie" sounds like a good idea. The devil in me suggests perhaps adding "Token Handbag Boyfriend" as well... &#160;;)</dd>
<dd>Firstly: I'd suggest changing "Age" on the template to something like "Age at first appearance" - it's confusing to have their 'current' ages. On <a href="../../../a/m/i/Ami_Mizuno_9e89.html" title="Ami Mizuno">Ami Mizuno</a> and other SM pages, we've just got an age range.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If we were to adapt the SM format to the Winx Club, you'd have something like:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Name + first appearance</li>
<li>Personality profile</li>
<li>Appearance/forms (civvie outfits, Winx costumes and Enchantrix descriptions go here)</li>
<li>Statistics (? - perhaps this could go in the Winx Club character template, if anywhere)</li>
<li>Magical abilities</li>
<li>4kids changes</li>
<li>Voice actresses</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But then that'd leave out the Friends/Foes section (which currently is pretty woeful for most of the characters). Maybe have a "relationships" section as well? -Malkinann 08:51, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Very well, I will go through with the following changes to the template: Gender will be changed a "Associated Pixie" and Age will be changed to "Age at first appearance". Hopefully someone else will fill out the information because it all escapes me at the moment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for your suggestions (that I am sure refer to) regarding the article layout, I think we apply almost all it in some meaningful way. I have reservation about including "statistics" because I doubt there at are any but I will admit that I have never sought them out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the friends and foes section is very woeful and suggest that they eliminated, in favor "Relationships" explaining closness between one another and boyfriends.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin586_fd91.html" title="User:Kevin586">Kenn Caesius</a> 16:42, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I've done a re-org of Bloom according to my suggestion. How does it look? It's still kind of rough - personality profile should cover both personality and "biography". We might also want to rename all the main character articles to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloom_%28Winx_Club%29_79b1.html" title="Bloom (Winx Club)">Bloom (Winx Club)</a> etc. to minimise on link errors. (Winx Club Character), (Winx club character), (Winx Club character) etc. Perhaps we should use the ref tags for notes for when we want to say "Domino (Sparks in the 4kids version)" etc? I had a bit of a go with them on the main Winx Club page. - Malkinann 22:46, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>With your reorganization, I will say that its starting to look good. I am going to search other articles of similiar fictional characters because as I have stated before, the "biography" has to go or drastically rewritten.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have noticed the inconsistant naming of the winx club characters but tolerated it because of the bigger problems with the main article. I support your suggestion to rename the winx club character with a consistant title.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd>Finally I support your suggestion as to how you will use references.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin586_fd91.html" title="User:Kevin586">Kenn Caesius</a> 23:17, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, we shouldn't reorganise the others like I've organised Bloom until you've had a peek at how other fictional characters are organised? With the notes system, most of the 4kids dub section has become obsolete - so I've commented it out on Bloom. Perhaps it should be kept for big things, like personality 180s, or super-annoying accents etc. - Malkinann 01:57, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did not mean to give you that impression. You should go ahead and reorganize the other articles as per whatever discussion we have here. I was refering to my need for inspiration and guidance in rewritting the articles. Seeing how the article appears now, you usage of the "notes" should be applied to all the character articles and that something should be done about the redundant mentions. When I have time, I will go through each article eliminating the 4Kids information from the template.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin586_fd91.html" title="User:Kevin586">Kenn Caesius</a> 16:09, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've had a go at all of them except for Flora - I don't really want to change that article until we get some sort of input from the person who made it so comprehensive. I've probably stepped on their toes enough by moving the page. Some of the sections on the others are really short once you tease them out from the rest of the prose. Would it be possible to change the character template so that in the name box we could have the girl's signature colour? (Fuchsia for Musa, Cyan for Bloom etc.) I think it'd look really spiffy!&#160;:) - Malkinann 23:55, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If I recall correctly, the article on the flora character was taken over by anonymous user who seemed have a particular affection for her (Did you see her talk page?). To me, the article has taken over by the <a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFancruft_4a77.html" title="WP:Fancruft">WP:Fancruft</a> and as comprehensive as the article my be, the majority of its content will have to be trimmed and pruned to bring it inline with our (not to mention wikipedias) standards of content and prose. Reviewing the history of the article, you should go ahead and edit it: it seems that anonymous user has it out of his/her system.</dd>
<dd>Your suggestion to add color to the template is a very good idea but its application it a bit beyond me (it was hard enough to figure out tables). Would you happen know to anyone who is very good at tables and templates that would be willing to help us out?--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin586_fd91.html" title="User:Kevin586">Kenn Caesius</a> 17:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I tried to edit it a bit, but there was too much stuff! I think that bringing it in line actually has given it more chance to expand... &#160;:o In the template, I've added some colour by copying from the Herobox template - to change it, you need to use "background:" and then a hex code. I'm not sure that I've got all the colours quite right - if you could look them over, that'd be great. &#160;:) - Malkinann 01:12, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The colors look good but now the names are off-centered... oh well, just one more thing to keep me coming back. While you are here, can you review the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Winx_Club_episodes_40e9.html" title="List of Winx Club episodes">List of Winx Club episodes</a> and figure what is going on? all the episodes have tagged with Sponsors and cryptic coordinates and now it seems that some anonymous user is suggesting that all episodes get their own articles. Unless I get explain as to what it all means, I am going to revert that article.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin586_fd91.html" title="User:Kevin586">Kenn Caesius</a> 01:46, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Are they off-centre? I can't really see it. Perhaps there's an extraneous space or two in that line from when I copy-pasted. I've reverted the 'sponsorship' edits, for reasons I've discussed on that talk page. - Malkinann 01:58, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The User:Sokai seems to have preempted my initial plans to add more image to the winx club characters, but I may to do it anyway as s/he has not used the proper copyright tags (which I have commented about in her/his talk page).</p>
<p>It is my intent that over the weekend of November 25th to take some screenshots of Layla's morfix and start a discussion of other useful screenshots that would add to the other winx club related articles. However, I have decided to start that discussion right now because soon I will revert all changes made by User:Sokai to assess the possibility of adding my own images.</p>
<p>And so I would like to start: what screenshots would help winx club related articles? I am hesistant to take images of each of the girls transformation as I believe that there is not enough article to contain four or five images. Additionally, I would like ask for suggestions as what episodes would provide good screenshots: scenes that have a lot of action tend to be blurred by action and the interlaced NTSC fields so I will need need episode names where the subject is standing still for at least two seconds.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin586_fd91.html" title="User:Kevin586">Kenn Caesius</a> 18:26, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does bloom actually have a sister? I think the statement is false.Cartoonborg 23:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is true. The definative source comes from the <a href="http://www.winxclub.com" class="external text" title="http://www.winxclub.com" rel="nofollow">winxclub.com</a> website under section refering to "other characters" (or something like that).
