<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocks without policy basis</span></h2>
<p>It used to be the case that logged-in users were never blocked except by Jimbo. Then we added the provision that users whose only edits were vandalism could be blocked (e.g. WoW). Then we added blocks to enforce AC rulings. Now there have been a few instances where users have been blocked based on community consenus, see <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAccount_suspensions_de39.html" title="Wikipedia:Account suspensions">Wikipedia:Account suspensions</a>. I changed the policy wording to acknowledge this. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 22:00, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self-blocking</span></h2>
<p>Why is self-blocking not allowed? I see no compelling practical reason to disallow an admin to block themselves in order to enforce their own WikiBreaks, but maybe I'm missing something. -- <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 22:35, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The relevant sentence contains an "unless" statement: "Sysops should not block themselves ... because the resultant "autoblock" may affect other users ... unless they know what they're doing (i.e., they have a static IP)." Self-blocks are quite okay if your IP is static or you're willing to undo any autoblocks. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 01:08, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The "unless" was added later. This had been discussed extensively at one point. In addition to the problems with the autoblocker, the point was that the blocking mechanism isn't something to be used lightly for such things as wikivacations. Since admins have the ability to reverse self-blocks anyway, they accomplish nothing useful. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 14:52, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If I may, I'd like to suggest a more effective method of self-blocking which does not disrupt Wikipedia: editing your <a href="../../../h/o/s/Host_file.html" title="Host file">Host file</a>. Adding an entry "127.0.0.1 en.wikipedia.org" to it (minus the quotes) will make the site completely inaccessible from that computer until the line is removed. An entry needs to be added for each domain that the user desires to block (wikipedia.org, meta.wikipedia.org, wiktionary.org, etc.). I won't presume to add this suggestion to the policy page, but perhaps someone else would.--<a href="../../../t/i/d/User%7ETidyCat_dd7f.html" title="User:TidyCat">TidyCat</a> 23:54, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Semi-open proxies? I hate to get all black and white here, but a proxy is either open or not. Proxies like those run by ISPs to speed up their customers' web access may be a slight problem in blocking, but as they restrict access to those proxies to their customers (with one or two notable exceptions) all edits are still clearly coming from that ISP which makes them easy to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/checkuser" class="extiw" title="m:checkuser">m:checkuser</a> and short term blocks are viable where necessary. Proxies anyone can edit through on the other hand make access untraceable (except for devs, and even then not always), and not indef-blocking them would make RC patrol a nightmare.
<dl>
<dd>I meant regular proxies; just ones with so many users (AOL, comcast) that vandals regularly take advantage of the ISP to similar effect. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 23:18, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Your new message on my talk page suggests your issue is mainy with closed-off ISP proxies: My view is that at least for the ISPs that don't force people to edit through their proxies (either through having transparant proxies (comcast I think), or giving their customers software that won't let them change the proxy settings (AOL)), proxies should be blockable just like regular IPs, but there should be a separate template for it with instructions on how to disable proxies in their web browser (writing instructions that work for everyone won't be a small job though) so people can just stop using the proxy and continue editing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A nicer long-term solution is for the list of servers wikipedia accepts the X-forwarded-for header from to be expanded. That way people can edit through their proxies but their edits are tied to their originating IP instead of that of the proxy they're editing through. The only problem is that you have to trust the XFF header the proxy server provides, so it can only be done for proxies of reputable ISPs. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 22:17, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Blocking IPs from a proxy network like <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tor.html" title="Tor">Tor</a> forever is like locking out an entire provider because of some abusers on his network. Why not make short-term blocking on "dangerous" IPs more flexible, for example by not requiring admin privileges for a short block? --Freedom of speech 15:51, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No wonder that only a few people oppose. If you must expect oppression for speaking publicly and have to use a proxy to protect yourself, you need much courage to speak at all. Many are not even heard because they have too much fear. Neutrality would be served better if the consensus would not be built only by those who can afford having their words linked to their identity. I'm sure there are better ways to deal with possible vandalism than by simply locking certain people out. --Freedom of speech 18:40, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This concerns an ArbCom case that I'm gathering evidence for. A user claims that he was able to view the IP address of blocked registered users by clicking on the autoblock link in the block log. Has this ever been the case? I wasn't able to find any record of this bug in Bugzilla. This user has only be around since early July, so that's time period I'm mostly concerned about. He claims that the bug has now been fixed.

<dd>The actual IP address rather than a numeric code appeared in the block log up until about a couple of years ago. I am unaware of any recent software bug or feature that would allow an IP address to be determined. I would imagine that the most practical means of determining another users' IP address would be to get them to click on a link to a non-Wikipedia site that logs such information, perhaps by disguising it as linkspam, a diff, or an offsite-hosted image. Emailing a message to the user that contains a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_beacon.html" title="Web beacon">web beacon</a> would also work if the target user's email program were configured to display inlined HTML images. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 06:33, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been trying to gather evidence for the same ArbCom as above, but some administrators have been blocking people while failing to include a reason or any evidence of a reason or a rule being broken. It makes it very hard to track down administrators that abuse their power. If no valid reason is given for a block, how can it be verified?

The Administrator adds evidence of that reason or rule being broken that another administrator can easily verify. The administrator does not make up his or her own rules to justify a block. If more than one line is needed to explain the block, the administrator may record the block at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_enforcement_4358.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy enforcement">Wikipedia:policy enforcement</a>.</blockquote>

<dd>I agree that administrators should have already read the reasons for blocking before attempting to block, but the descriptions in the list are lengthy and confusing. The bottom line is that many administrators have been making up their own rules, citing things that are not in the "exhaustive list of the situations that warrant blocking based on policy alone," nor do the blocks have "exceptional, widespread community support." I want to assume the best here, that these administrators are just confused by the lengthy policy description. I think we should concisely list the situations that warrant blocking in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#How_to_block" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">How to block</a> section as a reminder of the rules that govern us all.

<dd>Sorry to interrupt your rant, but you cetainly did <i>not</i> hear me correctly. I never said that an admin should be able to block without stating a reason. I said that the blocking policy already states that admins should enter a reason and that your changes was just instruction creep. The reason field is meant to contain exactly that: a reason why the block was made. It's not meant to contain detailed evidence. If someone has a problem with the provided reason, they should contact the blocking admin, or post a report on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>.

<p>There has been a gradual liberalization of the blocking policy over time, which I support. I myself have blocked users for combinations of reasons and for reasons that are not on the list, and have found the community to support such blocks in nearly all cases. While I can appreciate Mr. Stark's frustration over his particular case, I see no abuse. Since Mr. Stark clearly owes the community an explanation for some of his edits, I do not believe that this policy proposal should be taken seriously. Accordingly, I have removed the poll that Mr. Stark had added here. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 17:14, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know how to tell the difference between static and dynamic IPs. An anonymous IP is one that doesn't identify either the person using it or their ISP. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianjd_bb34.html" title="User:Brianjd">Brian</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrianjd_da26.html" title="User talk:Brianjd">Jason</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brianjd_ff5a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brianjd">Drake</a> 07:12, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A static IP is one that gets assigned to the same computer/person for a long time; a dynamic one is one that frequently gets reassigned. Blocking a dynamic IP for too long is bad, as the person you were trying to block moved on to an other IP and the next person to get the IP ends up blocked. Telling them apart is more of an art than a science, looking at the reverse DNS is generally a good start. AOL addresses used to all be dynamic (dialup), but these days there are AOL ADSL IPs too I think, though I'm not sure if they can be told apart.</li>
<li>By <i>anonymous IP address</i> the page just means IP accounts, i.e. users who haven't logged in and whose edits are assigned to the IP they're editing from. Note that when you block an IP, you not only block not-logged-in users but also logged-in users who edit from that IP. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 07:27, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks. I wasn't sure that was what was meant. But since we're encouraged to block anonymous IP's indefinitely, how do we know we're not blocking logged-in users along with them? Although the problem may be cleared up now, I was thinking of an anon IP that was used as a sockpuppet to revert the Urdu article a good fifty times, with no other edits on its contribution page. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:10, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Instant blocking for vandalizing high-traffic articles</span></h2>
<p>We should discuss whether it is OK to instantly block people for vandalizing high traffic articles (specifically, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>). Currently there's a disagreement over whether <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> should begin with this warning in an HTML comment: "Anyone who vandalizes the page may be blocked for 24 hours or more without further warning." I think this warning was added by <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">User:Golbez</a> during a period of sustained vandalism - see <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_Archive_29_5fc8.html#Article_Protection_Issue" title="Talk:George W. Bush/Archive 29">Talk:George W. Bush/Archive 29#Article Protection Issue</a>. Several editors felt that a "zero tolerance" policy towards vandals was better than semi-permanent protection. The warning remained there for several months until it was removed by <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a>, who believes that it is not supported by policy.</p>
<p>Is it good policy to block vandals on the first offense (only for the highest-traffic articles)? <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is edited hundreds of times per day and most of those edits are vandalism. It's a time consuming task to repeatedly warn vandals, almost none of whom ever go on to become legitimate contributors. More importantly, the more lenient we are with vandals, the more likely it is that the article will be viewed by readers in its vandalized state. Instant blocking does reduce the amount of vandalism on high traffic pages. It isn't appropriate for test edits or edits to low-volume articles. When it comes to high-visibility articles, we need to care more about the integrity of the encyclopedia than about hurting the feelings of some anonymous vandal. The blocking policy may not support instant blocks, but should it be changed to allow them on extremely visible articles? People keep removing the zero tolerance warning from the article so I'd like to get consensus here. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 00:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I say, one warning, using new template that explains politely that the article they vandalized is a priority article (or something along that line of thought)...then if they vandalize again, impose a 12 hour block (with blocking admin informing user on the usertalk of the block of course)...if they come back in a few days then another warning, then on second incidence, block for 24 hours...etc., etc. But this test, test 2, test 3 stuff is a waste in many cases.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 01:17, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Personally, I think this is an okay policy, with restraint. I think that we should give 1 warning, perhaps a new template that basically says "You have vandalized/blanked a controversial page. If you wish to continue testing Wikipedia, please use the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Sandbox</a>. If you continue vandalizing pages, you may be blocked without further warning." But we should keep some sort of a warning at the top of the articles (i.e. "Vandalism on this article may result in a block. Please make useful edits.") What does everyone else think? <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> <a href="../../../p/o/s/WP%7EPOST_8e4c.html" title="WP:POST"><font color="blue">W<sub>S</sub></font></a> 01:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It isn't supported by policy, nor is it sensible, nor is it fair, to block editors who, perhaps in their first edit, expend some animus on George W. Bush, Stalin, Saddam Hussein, Tony Blair or some other hate figure of their choosing.</p>
<p>To warn a new editor who mucks around with an article, go to his talk page and plop a {{test}} template there. If he keeps it up for long, consider blocking him. This isn't difficult. The new editor may well go on to become a regular contributor.

<dd>Agree that this is the most sensible way to do this. My experience is that when "caught" in the act (e.g. a {{test''x''}}' added to their talk page immediately after the vandalism, they get the point that there are consequences and that they better behave and maybe even consider contributing. The most powerful statement to vandals is that there are people that care about the project and the vandalism gets quicklt reverted. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossifresco_e1f8.html" title="User:Jossifresco">≈ jossi fresco ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossifresco_e06c.html" title="User talk:Jossifresco">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossifresco_7c01.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossifresco">@</a></small> 04:57, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>I can't help thinking that some of this could be dealt with by better or more flexible messages appearing after "edit" is clicked - an idea I've had previously thinking about having Talk-page specific edit messages (see <a href="../../../t/a/l/Template_talk%7ETalkheader_4033.html" title="Template talk:Talkheader">Template talk:Talkheader</a> and its AFD discussions). For instance, we could add messages that only anons see, relating to vandalism and testing and general welcome; perhaps only the first few times an IP edits (unless tagged SharedIP). On problem pages like GWB we could have longer, more specific messages, perhaps directing people to appropriate outlets elsewhere (or even a VandalizeMeCreatively subpage copy of the article - no that's nuts&#160;:) ).

<p>On one side we lose the editorial effort spent reverting yet another "nazi flaming homo" driveby, time which otherwise could be used improving WP. On the other side we lose all the positive contributions to WP those vandals might be making in the next 24 hours. Tough call there.</p>
<p>To argue against my position, autoblocks for "aggregious and blatant" vandalism means we need to define those terms and not expand them to block newbie tests that happen to cover some small addition that's been discussed ad nauseum and removed.</p>
<p>Dunno...I think it's worth testing the autoblocks for a while, but keeping a close eye on the situation. If the admins get overzealous, we can revert the policy.

<p>Policy issues aside, the fact of the matter is GWB was vandalized just as frequently as any other high-traffic article even with the instant-block warning at the top of the article.

<dd>EricN, you should spend some time catching up on the previous discussions with respect to blocking 'vandals'. Most people who edit aren't trying to break wikipedia, in fact they are often quite shocked that the editing worked at all. Further there is actually no way for us to block someone who is determined to cause harm, all we can do is slow them down. Fortunately, thats all that is required: our change patroling process is remarkably effective and appears to scale fairly well, and we're not yet doing anything really creative yet. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 20:52, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, but should the same rules apply to all articles, or should certain articles be treated separately? If FAs get special treatment when they are highly visible, would that logic not apply to articles that are also highly visible because of their subject matter? What would it require to create a small class of articles that users cannot make their first edit on?

<p>Instant, short-term blocks with <b>appropriate messages when they try to edit the page</b> and <b>appropriate warnings before editing</b> are warranted for blatant vandalism.

<p>I don't like this for two reasons: first, we shouldn't block without warning, imho. And second, having a warning/threat like that in a HTML comment (or anywhere else) is, essentailly, making a threat that will not neccessarily be acted upon - it is dependent on who spots the vandalism. This second reason is the same reason why I, as a non-admin, do not put {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} on to vandals user talk - I canot act on that threat. When we make empty threats to block vandals, we reduce the effectivness of warnings about vandalism, by creating an attittude of "well, they threatened to block me last time and didn't". -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 16:35, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sign me up for supporting a 2-4 hour block for high traffic vandalism. They know they are vandalizing so this isn't going to surprise them. I think they are most surprised when they get to do it repeatedly. A small block like 2-4 hours will not hamper real users. (I agree with AJR that we should not make false threats.

<dd>I never proposed blocking users without warning. I proposed putting a warning on the edit page.

<dd>I wonder is it easy to implement the different actions on pressing the Save and Move buttons for the ordinary and high traffic areas? Say, on the High Traffic Areas it would first display a dialog <i>You are attempting to modify the content of a highly visible area...blah-blah-blah... vandalizing the page can get you banned or event persecuted by such and article of the criminal code... it is always a good idea to discuss on the talk page ... the sandbox for testing is here...

<dd>I prefer the "should" wording. Self-unblocking to get around 3RR and other valid blocks is bad and merits an RFC. In a few cases, however, a block is placed in bad faith and should be removed by the victim. <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuanaco_98c8.html" title="User:Guanaco">Guan</a><a href="../../../g/u/a/User_talk%7EGuanaco_7540.html" title="User talk:Guanaco">aco</a> 17:23, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's often the case that the least capable person of rationally judging the validity of the block is the person blocked, as he or she is likely to have a very biased and emotive view of the situation. It's better if some other admin, preferably one not already involved, judges if the block was unfair and needs to be removed. Take as an example the situation with Duncharris above, who obviously felt that the block was in bad faith, but not everyone agrees. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:39, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Matt's point makes sense, but I am still inclined to agree with Geni. If a block violates policy I don't see why you shouldn't be able to unblock yourself. In Dunc's case, Ed's block was controvertial but not entirely against policy, but I could envision a block which was totally wrong. While in such a case it should be easy to get someone to unblock you, it shouldn't be strictlyforbidden (much like getting caught by the autoblocker...you <i>can</i> undo that, but even that is less than idea). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 17:52, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I guess it's better to leave it as a guideline rather than creating a legalistic, watertight rule. The real problem here, I suspect, is that the person arguing that Dunc's unblock was not against policy is taking a far too literal view of how one reads policy (he's reading it like an Internet RFC). I think most people acknowledge, including Dunc, that it was wrong for him to unblock himself. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 18:16, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I think the changes on unblocking are generally an improvement. However, my original point was that "should" should be changed to "must". It is clear in this discussion that there are differing views on what the present policy means. "Should" can be interpreted as a recommendation and, if it is, "absolutely" makes little sense to me. "should absolutely <i>not</i>" should be changed to "must absolutely <i>not</i>" or "should <i>not</i>". I strongly prefer the former, given that quite proper exceptions are provided. I agree with Matt, if an administrator blocks my user account, however foolishly, mistakenly or maliciously, I am the last person to judge the issue. Is it really so difficult to contact another admin? (BTW I think "sysop" should be changed to "administrator" globally). <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThincat_aebc.html" title="User:Thincat">Thincat</a> 10:04, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly, as I'm sure I've said before. I expect an admin to be able to use their judgment to be able to figure out if this kind of stuff is right or wrong , regardless of if it's in policy. Indeed, I would hold them accountable regardless of if it's in policy or not. However, some people tend to see (or act on at least) rightness or wrongness only in the context of policy. E.g. in the case of the type of admin that most recently prompted this discussion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ed_Poor&amp;diff=29538515&amp;oldid=29537908" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ed_Poor&amp;diff=29538515&amp;oldid=29537908" rel="nofollow">"it's not against policy to do so"</a>-kind-of-attitude.

I want administrators to be <i>above reproach</i>, and the only way I can see to do that <i>thoroughly</i> is to make reproachful conduct grounds for loss of admin access.</p>
<p>I didn't propose it that way because I didn't think that policy would garner wide support. People have an aversion to conflicts among administrators. Admins obviously want to trust each other, not suspect each other ... and the rest of us want to trust that our project isn't being run by clowns who ban and de-op each other like <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> kiddies.</p>
<p>But ... maybe I'm wrong, and an "abuse it and lose it" policy regarding administrative access <i>would</i> fly here. Maybe the recent case shows how abuses of admin access can make things much worse for ordinary editors -- to the point of driving people off the project.</p>
<p>What I really objected to, in the case that inspired this proposal, was the impression that I got from the administrator's conduct: that he acted as if his administrative access entitled him to do things ordinary editors are forbidden from doing: bullying, making personal attacks, and POV-warring ... and worse, that he could back up his threats by blocking people who disagreed with him.</p>
<p>The point isn't to "punish" abuse, though. It's to make abuse unappealing to those who might consider doing it ... and more importantly, to make it <i>abundantly clear</i> where the boundary is. It's also to strongly remind people who are in a high-risk situation -- that is, administrators in heated personal &amp; POV conflicts -- that they are not alone; that they don't have to take matters into their own hands; and that they can call for help instead of doing something destructive. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 07:22, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's the difference between policy and enforcement of policy. We should have this addition to be able to say "stop," but I don't think this is the place to specify how to enforce that. Administrator abuse is <i>serious</i>, and that's why it takes an arbcom or something to remove the privilege. If an admin violates this policy, or <a href="../../../p/p/o/WP%7EPPol_0bed.html" title="WP:PPol">WP:PPol</a>, or <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, etc., then file it under administrative abuse and take the appropriate action. But this is our policy on how and when it is appropriate to block or unblock, <i>not</i> our policy on the administator status. The fact is, I think, it should be dealt with much more individually than a universal policy declaration could ever hope to do. (And, btw, I think a temporary block for any admin abuse accomplishes nothing constructive; the whole point of a block is to prevent disruptive <i>editing</i>, and admins can even still perform admin functions while blocked.) <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:51, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a whole bunch of good points. Here's a different one: <i>How long should it take to bell the cat?</i> In the recent case, admin abuse went on for days -- long enough for an AfD to close -- before a relatively uninvolved person (an administrator, as it happened) had the guts to stand up to the abuser and get him to quit. Prior to that, other people had raised the abuse issue but had been basically ignored -- both on talk pages and on the WikiEN-L mailing list.</dd>

<p>good proposal, but "dispute" should be qualified. Of course, trolls will try to abuse this policy by portraying blocking admins as out to censor their pov (happens already, of course). We should at least say "content dispute", otherwise no admin will be able to block the same troll twice, since the troll has just to rant a little bit on admin's talk page after the first block, and will claim to be in an "ongoing dispute" at the second block. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:20, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with this proposal for the reasons dab has given. I've seen several trolls and disruptive users claim to be in a dispute with an admin who has simply given them a warning or blocked them for something, and in fact one of the disruptive users tried to float a proposal very similar to this a few months ago. It would mean that any admin with experience of dealing with a disruptive user could be accused of being "involved." I would like to see the wording of the blocking policy on this point stay as it is. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:34, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not the point, Haukurth. A disruptive editor shouldn't be allowed to stop an admin taking action just by crying "conflict," which becomes true by definition the minute they say it, and this happens a lot so it's not an "eventuality." To ask another admin to act would involve having to post explanations with diffs and so on: more work for what might be a simple and obvious case for the admin with experience of the situation. For example, I have a lot of experience with one disruptive user who I can spot a mile away when he posts with sockpuppets, and I block him when I see it. However, I can also spot when someone is pretending to be him to get him into trouble, which has happened, and I know on those occasions not to block. It would be close to impossible for me to explain how I know the difference, but I've not been wrong yet. That kind of experienced involvement should be encouraged, but this proposal would discourage it, which is why I oppose it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:41, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is true that an admin attempting to deal with a troll in good faith (vandal/miscreant/etc...) is likely to end up being "in conflict" with that user in some sense, and we don't <i>always</i> want people posting on WP:AN. I think there is a need to shore up the policy though, to make it absolutely clear that blocks like Ed Poor's recent one are not acceptable. I've tweaked the suggestion above to keep the current policy wording about "article editing conflict", and added a clause in italics.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Users should not block those with whom they are currently engaged in an article editing conflict. <i>Nor should an admin block if it could reasonably be perceived as a conflict of interest by the wider community</i>, even if they believe the blocking policy justifies a block. Personal disputes, editing or revert wars, or mutual accusations of bias all tend to blur people's judgment of each other's actions. An offense always seems more threatening when someone we don't like or trust is the one doing it. An administrator involved in a conflict should do what any other editor should do -- use dispute resolution. In cases where an administrator in a conflict thinks an immediate block is necessary, they may post to WP:AN/I to ask uninvolved administrators to review the situation and perform the block."</dd>

<dd>I'm wondering if this is a case of hard cases making bad law. Matt's suggestion is an improvement, but is there a need to change the policy? Ed had been involved in a content dispute with the person he blocked and the offense wasn't reason enough to block anyway. Ed violated the current policy, so why are we responding by changing the current policy? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:25, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Most of the proposed addition is just clarification, explanation and good advice. Blocking is typically controversial, so I think it's good to provide plenty of that sort of stuff. So without changing the policy, per se, we could just expand it to:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Users should not block those with whom they are currently engaged in an article editing conflict, even if they believe the blocking policy justifies a block. Personal disputes, editing or revert wars...&lt;and the rest&gt;</i>"</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Would you object to that? Somewhat separately, then, I guess, I'd still suggest adding the clause "<i>Nor should an admin block if it could reasonably be perceived as a conflict of interest by the wider community</i>", but it's not, as you point out, a direct response to Ed's recent questionable block (although it's similar). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:48, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Look, if someone is, for example, going around adding white supremacist POV to the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> article, and after being reverted by an admin, goes on a spree of calling that admin "N*gger-lover" etc., then that admin is perfectly within his/her rights to block the individual. As well, editors deliberately <i>create</i> content disputes with admins they don't like; it's easy enough to follow one around and revert their edits, then claim a content dispute. I've seen it happen to others, and it's certainly happened to me as well. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:02, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Quite, I wholeheartedly agree with you. My hope was that the (admittedly wooly) clause about "reasonably be perceived as a conflict of interest by the wider community" would allow admins to carry on doing such blocks in such cases. Currently, of course, the policy suggests that it <i>would</i> be wrong for an admin to block an abvious troll/vandal if they could somehow manufacture a content dispute (although it would never be an issue in common sense practice). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 18:16, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>SlimVirgin is right. We are proposing major policy changes based upon one example of an administrator who is alleged to have blocked another user in relation to a content dispute; yet the vastly more common case is of admins blocking editors for disruption, 3RR violation, personal attacks etc., and then being accused of having a content dispute with them (or bias against them). Frankly, I have recently become fed up with incessant <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, and have begun warning (more than once), and then blocking editors who indulge themselves in them.

<p>Any sort of engagement with a troublemaker -- issuing a warning, reverting with a careful explanation, trying to discuss, or protecting a page -- often precipitates retaliatory action by the troublemaker. It is impossible to be fair and evenhanded (giving warnings and using the least draconian means first) while simultaneously maintaining the total freedom from conflict that some are suggesting be required before issuing a block. Clear cases like Ril's should, IMO, be handled by admins without involving the AC. In that case <a href="../../../e/r/w/User%7EErwin_Walsh_5aa4.html" title="User:Erwin Walsh">User:Erwin Walsh</a> claimed that I should have refrained from blocking because I was "involved" -- even though I had no prior editing experience with Ril up until acting upon a note from others on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Conflict vs. vandalism</span></h3>
<p>I see that a number of people are concerned that "no blocking people you're in conflict with" would be misapplied to deter administrators from consistently blocking trolls, persistent vandals, or the like.</p>
<p>Let me point out that the basic rule here is <i>already</i> part of the policy. There are no new <i>rules</i> here. There's only new clarifications of an existing rule, and an offer of help -- a reminder that admins who are tempted to break the rule should instead look for help from uninvolved admins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I can see how folks would see a need for clarification regarding the difference between struggling with a persistent vandal or troll, and being in conflict with a "real" editor.</p>
<p>Let me point out first that <i>no</i> administrator should be put in the position of feeling that they are the <i>only</i> line of defense against a specific abuser. If you feel you're standing alone, <i>ask for help.</i> Invite other people to review what you've done and what needs to be done, and to help out. We <i>need</i> this kind of review, so we can be sure that admins who are acting <i>with</i> consensus get the support they need ... and admins who are acting <i>against</i> consensus get told so in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>(If you think you're standing alone, that could mean that you haven't asked for help ... but it could also mean that you're way out of line. That's why people should ask for help and review sooner rather than later in these situations.)</p>
<p>I like the idea of emphasizing the appearance of conflict of interest. Nonetheless, I think there's a distinct difference that needs to be made between a conflict among editors over a matter of substance, and a conflict with a persistent vandal.</p>
<p>One way of getting at that distinction is that the kind of conflicts we want to address here are frequently matters of <i>disputed fact or opinion.</i> They're matters which have a larger scope beyond Wikipedia -- like political, religious, or national disputes; disputes regarding ideology, law, ethics, or morals; and <i>especially</i> current hot-button issues such as creationism, abortion, ongoing wars, or the like.</p>
<p>Anyone have specific phrasing suggestions regarding that? --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 19:56, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, but your suggestion doesn't just emphasize the point. In fact, you're proposing a fairly major change to the blocking policy, which would allow trolls to claim they were in conflict with a particular admin who was getting wise to their ways. It's like people picking fights with arbitrators then demanding they recuse from a case. We should stand up to that, not adjust the policy to accommodate it. The current policy is quite clear: we can't block where we're involved in a content dispute, which makes sure we don't use our blocking powers to gain editorial advantage.

<p>I've added notes to the 'indefinite non-policy blocks' section to note the ban on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_banned_users_3583.html" title="Wikipedia:List of banned users">Wikipedia:List of banned users</a>. Note that if someone is being that much of a dick, the usual response on WP:ANI is a string of followups saying "Good!" and complaints of gross admin abuse from an IP or two; such community bans are in practice not all that controversial. Which is nice - even when admins are at each others' throats otherwise, they do try to avoid <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheel_war.html" title="Wheel war">wheel wars</a> - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 15:06, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But they're not exactly banned <i>until</i> then (just blocked).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unwarranted threats of blocking</span></h2>
<p>If I am threatened to be blocked for vandalism, and it is determined that the threatening individual was patently false in their accusation, yet they continue to make threats, can any action be taken on them? If so what? I would consider this to be harassment and intimidation, and I would like action taken on this individual (once the administrators have determined that his actions were out of line) Here is the text from my talk page of the offense:</p>
<p>The Rock (entertainer) This message is regarding the page The Rock (entertainer). Please stop. If you continue to vandalize pages, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia. SycthosTalk 04:34, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Rock's mother is not Hawaiian, she is Samoan. So take your threat and shove it. I already reported you for your unwarranted threat. --208.254.174.148 04:40, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
In fact, I request Sycthos to be either censured or himself blocked. Other users have responded that he has threatened them as well (please see his talk page) for vandalism. Whatever unwarrented drastic measures he would seek against another contributor, I ask that the same severe level of consequence be applied to him. He should not be allowed to continue to threaten Wikipedia contributors, it's a form of intimidation and control, and it's an avenue to creating a POV atmosphere. --208.254.174.148 04:50, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This isn't really the right place to report such things. If you disagree with a generic blocking template, explain why it wasn't vandalism, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civilly</a>, to the user who left the warning. He may have misunderstood it. If warnings are very persistent, you <i>could</i> file a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">request for comment</a>, but those are kind of a big deal, so it's easier just to ignore one error. If you are actually blocked wrongly, the proper place to report it is <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/c/z/User%7ESCZenz_212c.html" title="User:SCZenz">SCZenz</a> 05:04, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you are saying his comment was a generic automated post of some kind? I am not familiar enough to be aware of that. I think the explanation is already given in what I copied into this section above. --208.254.174.148 07:01, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not an automated post. It is more like a form letter -- a pre-written message that a user can choose to leave on another person's talk page. It doesn't show up on your talk page unless the sender specifically put it there.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notifying the blocked user: make mandatory?</span></h2>
<p>My apologies if this has been debated ad nauseum before.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that immediately notifying the blocked user of the block, with reasoning and justification, is not mandatory. The policy page says it is "customary" and only for long blocks. I think it ought to be mandatory except in cases when it is obviously not needed, such as blocking a WoW sock or a bot-generated vandalism account.</p>
<p>Ideally, the software would automatically generate a talk page message for the blocked user with the blocking admin's supplied reason for the block, but it is quick and easy to leave a talk message, and there is no reason not to communicate reasoning and justification with someone you've just blocked. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 02:51, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that this should be highly encouraged. In fact I'm fairly sure people won't disagree, so I've been bold and changed the "how to block" section to read "Users should be notified of blocks on their talk pages." Also, for my own part, I'd be much more likely to undo an unexplained block if I could see no obvious reason for it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 02:58, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with this in general, especially as the policy has recently been changed to say that admins looking to <i>undo</i> a block <b>must</b> in most cases discuss it with the blocking admin first, but I think there are exceptions. For instance, if an account has been used for nothing but persistent vandalism and they've received proper warnings then there is no reason to add an additional message that the block was for ignoring those warnings. That's just extra documentation of the obvious that there often isn't time for when dealing with a vandal onslaught. Blocks on contributing users are another matter entirely and ought to be fully explained on the talk page and/or AN/I as noted under different sections of the policy. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 14:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reversion of contribution's of a blocked user</span></h2>
<p>I think we should add something like: <i>The blocking admin can at his or her discretion revert the latest contributions of the blocked user. The reverts done to the last version of a valid contributor do not count as an involvement into the editing if the administrator was currently uninvolved into the article or against the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> if he or she was involved previously. All other possible types reverts or edits by a blocking admin count as ordinary edits</i>. The reason I want to put it here is that I saw instances of admins not reverting disruptive edits made from open proxies out of fair to be labeled as involved into an edit conflict/violation of 3RR. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 06:17, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While the policy may not explicitly cover it there is a standard practice of admins blocking people posting clear vandalism even after having reverted that vandalism themselves. I don't think that's a problem. For things which <i>aren't</i> vandalism it is alot less clear. Blocks for 3RR aren't meant to be for 'disruptiveness' or to endorse one version of the article over another - they are to enforce a non-activity period in hopes of discussion rather than just reverting back and forth. I've already seen admins issue blocks (even where no 3RR was committed) and protect pages on articles where they <i>clearly</i> were involved in the content dispute. I don't like the idea of giving such behaviour cover (not that anything is done about it <i>currently</i>) behind an exception for non-vandalism article edits which the individual admin judges to be 'disruptive'. If this is meant only to apply to vandalism, then as I said, I've seen that being done frequently and agree it ought to be formally stated. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 11:33, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
