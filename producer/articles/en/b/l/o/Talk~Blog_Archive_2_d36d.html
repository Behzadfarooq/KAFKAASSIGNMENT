<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feeds</span></h2>
<p>(I've never been to a discussion on a Wikipedia article before, so I hope I don't do anything wrong. Please let me know if I do) I have been under the impression that a blog, has to have some kind of feed (RSS 0.9x, 1.0, 2.0, Atom 0.3, 1.0, etc.) for its posts in order to be a blog, and not just any website with information posted in reverse chronological order. In the same way that a podcast has be be included in some kind of feed that lets you subscribe to it in order for it to be a podcast and not just an mp3 file with people talking (or music for that matter). But nowhere in the article about blogs are feeds even mentioned, although it is beyond doubt that feeds are an important part of blogs. But are they as important as I've thought (that is, you have to include a feed to call your website a blog), or am I mistaken? <small>The above unsigned comment was by <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForteller_e742.html" title="User:Forteller">User:Forteller</a> at 21:06, 30 December 2005 -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 05:39, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I know a number of blogs that do not have feeds, and actually remember a couple years ago when feeds weren't common at all. Time was, one had to visit each blog's webpage manually to check to see if it had updates. So no, a feed is not necessary for a site to be a blog, and not all sites with feeds are blogs. However, I know little about podcasts, so you may be right there. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 05:39, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Neutrality</span></h2>
<p>The statement "while The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other establishment media outlets formed a mass media cheering section for the revolution in telecommunications, Schreibman's News Columns and Special Reports conveyed a radically different story: of "telco feudalism" enacted by that revolution, in a legislative process that was rife with corrupt polticial influence peddling, by Congressional leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS), and by House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA)." Seems to be partisian even with citation in place. Just becaule Dole and Gingrich may have done it, and from that paragraph it is hard to understand what is being claimed, it doesn't mean that people on both sides of the isle aren't guilty of simular things. <a href="../../../d/r/k/User%7EDrknexus_47e9.html" title="User:Drknexus">Dark Nexus</a> 16:52, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<pre>
   "Netrality" is not the point in enlightened journalism or blogging.  The whole idea 
   of political discussion is to participate in shaping our community or civilization 
   in some profound way toward betterment.  If "Dark Nexus" can think of other examples 
   of political corruption he should add them, rather than exercising the despicable 
   practice of unilateral censorship, which failed the test of legitimacy in the Dark Ages
</pre>
<p><br />
Isn't stretching to distinguish the concept of a blog or blogging from something like "traditional websites" or "usenet forums" an admission of the inherent reality that in fact blogs are not distinguishable from these activities or concepts at all? It seems clear to me now that you can't compare blogging to web publishing because in fact what has happened is that <i>web publishing has become blogging</i>. We struggle to compare between this and that precisely because we cannot.</p>
<pre>
   This is an interesting point.  There certainly are similarities between all the forms of
   electronic communications, which are not limited by the inherent motives of political 
   discussion driven by commercial "news" vendors.  What is most interesting of all in this
   new media is the lack of constraint on volition that the civil society of yesterday 
   suffers.  Bloggers, and others, in this media say what is on their minds, which offers
   a better view of reality than political pundits spinning stories for politicians.

<p><b>Techniques to Increase Profits Through Website Promotion by www.itsallaboutlinks.com</b></p>
<p>Anyone who is any sort of internet business knows that profits are the most important thing to attain. The key to gaining more profits is through website promotion. With the right website promotion, you can be sure to gain mass profits that you would not have had without it. If you are interested in learning how to gain more profits this way, please read on for some tips.</p>
<p>The first part of gaining profits through website promotion is to have an excellent website design. You cannot expect to gain any profits through a website that is designed poorly or that is difficult to navigate. Make it easy for visitors to your website to find what they need and make a purchase. This will gain you fast profits.</p>
<p>The second thing you should do to gain profits is to use search engine optimization, or SEO. SEO has been widely used to put people's websites at the top of a search engine's list. It is found that most people that use a search engine only visit the website that is listed at the top of the list. This is why you need to use SEO to help with your website promotion. With the proper SEO, you can attract more visitors to your website. More visitors means more profits for you.</p>
<p>Next, to gain more profits you can use email marketing. Be sure that when you use email marketing to gain profits that you are not using spam. Use an opt in list instead. Have an opt in list posted on your website. An opt in list is when people request to receive email material from your website. It has been shown that opt in lists give a 40% increase in response. This means that you will again have more profits.</p>
<p>In order to gain profits through website promotion, you must be sure that you go after your target audience. Be sure that your website's design attracts the type of people that would be interested in your product or service. Also, be sure that your email marketing sends out emails and ezines to people that will actually read it and have an interest in it. If you don't, you cannot expect to gain profits.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can incorporate the use of affiliate programs to help with your website promotion. Have links to your affiliates on your website. Your affiliates will also do the same. With you and your affiliates working together to promote your website, you will start to see more website traffic and more profits.</p>
<p>Website promotion is the only sure way to gain profits for your business. Without it, you can easily find yourself in a hole that is hard to dig your way out of. Be sure to utilize all of these methods so that you can attain more profits.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Examples</span></h2>
<p>Could we perhaps remove all external links to examples of blogs from this article? The few that are notable and worth linking have articles we can link, and the others are just non-notable blogs people wanted to promote and added in. What's more, we shouldn't be putting external links outside the external links section except for references, which these aren't. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 21:49, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Can anyone give me some links to actual, working "FriendBlogs"? I can't find any English language examples via Google, and the only web engine for it that I could find, Funchain.com, is apparently down. Also, the vast majority of hits for that word are of mirrors of this article. If I'm not able to find multiple, working examples of one of these soon, and no one posts any examples here on the talk page, I will delete the category. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 06:16, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I finally managed to catch Funchain when it was up, and couldn't immediately see any difference between its blogs and a normal blog, so I'm removing FriendBlogs as a category. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 19:25, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As the Partner Blog category seems read more as a proposal than as a description of something that already exists, I am removing its category.

<li>Is there any reason for the etymology of the neologism "blawg" in the Topical:Legal section?

<dd>Checking the history of the <a href="http://wearcam.org/glogs.htm" class="external text" title="http://wearcam.org/glogs.htm" rel="nofollow">CyberLog</a> and "glog" entry shows it was posted anonymously by 24.103.60.117 on 1 January 2003. Since then it has been transmogrified by further anonymous editors, and it seems the original meaning has been lost. I've read through some of the hyperlinks in the last 24 hours, and much of it reads like an <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a> trip, making one think it was all made up as a joke. However, it seems there's truth to the story, since Steve Mann, cofounder of the Wearable Computing Project at the <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_Media_Lab_0365.html" title="MIT Media Lab">MIT Media Lab</a>, began experimenting with some <a href="http://wearcam.org/steve5.jpg" class="external text" title="http://wearcam.org/steve5.jpg" rel="nofollow">crude homebrew equipment in the early 1980's</a> while he was a student at MIT. That was a decade before the World Wide Web, 17 years before IEEE 802.11 WiFi became a published standard, and they were playing around with wireless networking using amateur radio equipment operating in the <a href="../../../v/h/f/VHF_08d2.html" title="VHF">VHF</a> and/or <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_high_frequency.html" title="Ultra high frequency">UHF</a> bands. Wearable computers haven't been an interest of most radio amateurs; amateur radio was a means to an end for a few individuals interested in wearable computers. The paragraph probably needs to be revised by going back to the beginning and researching the sources of the story. <a href="../../../h/y/d/User%7EHydrargyrum_f7da.html" title="User:Hydrargyrum">Quicksilver</a> 22:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleanup</span></h2>
<p>I posted the cleanup notice because this article is a mess and I don't have enough time to clean up all of it myself. If you want to help, you do some of the tasks mentioned above, or help out in any way possible, really. For example, the History section is much too long and merits its own article - if someone willing to massively edit that huge section were to split it off, that'd go a long way towards making this article shorter and more readable. Most text past the Formatting section needs to be substantially re-written, if not removed as dross, so feel free to do that as well. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 17:35, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>All these "damn subsets" are under consideration for consolidation, removal, or expansion into their own pages, as noted above. Even when categories are split off, though, a summary is left on the main page, so there's only so much that can be done with splitting off categories. Splitting off the history page, though, would cut down on the article size immensely. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 01:51, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Who is Vigdor Schreibman? I removed several paragraphs about him (including an inappropriate section header). There were many early Internet journalists. If he started in 1993, he certainly wasn't the first person posting news to the Internet. I've never heard him referenced as the first blogger, actually I've never heard of him at all. This strikes me as vanity. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 20:00, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Who the hell keeps adding that tripe in. I'm AFDing Vigdor Schreibman article right now. --Timecop 00:43, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I don't think that AfDing that article was the most appropriate response. However, the Vigdor Schreibman stuff that keeps being added is blatantly POV, has little root in fact, and is also poorly written. Wikipedia is not a place to post manifestos. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 02:50, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AfDing the Vigdor Schreibman article may be right, but it's totally unproductive as a response to what's happening in <i>this</i> article. I propose that the Vigdor material, edited down, be included as yet another bullet point in the "Precursors" section (without the claim of being the first blog, since this begs the question of the definition of "blog"), and if the edited material is deemed notable on its own, another article be created specifically for it at Federal Information News Syndicate. Comments? Also, whoever keeps blanking or reverting the blanking or that section, knock it off and participate in the discussion here. <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 20:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticisms?</span></h2>
<p>This is not a POV question, but is there nothing criticizing blogs out there, not any negative voices? It seems everyone has good things to say, but does the medium have any inherent flaws? bodhidharma 01:27, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it does. The problem is, all the jerks with blogs who have this article on their watchlist will immediately jump if anyone begins making any kind of negative edits. --Timecop 00:49, 22 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Once the Vigdor stuff dies down, I'd be interested in hammering out a criticisms article, although perhaps couching it in terms such as "limitations of the medium" or some such would go far in keeping people happy with it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 03:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I was just wondering if anyone has some good sources of criticism? I would like to add some sections, but I can't seem to find any sites with definite criticisms--it seems that the entire web and lots of the traditional media is enamoured with blogs, and I am looking for voices of dissent. bodhidharma 15:41, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure that if you asked your local reference librarian that he/she could point you to tons of criticisms of them. Most caveats about stuff one finds on the web (or, even, Wikipedia) transfers to the blogosphere, in that anyone can post anything, be it truth, lies, or somewhere inbetween. I also recall back in the 2004 US Presidential elections that many of the talking heads were complaining about blogs posting the early numbers that the talking heads had and were using to bend their commentary, but not actually reporting on. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 05:45, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vigdor Schreibman's Involvement in Wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>Most or all efforts to insert content on Vigdor Schreibman appear to be by Vigdor Schreibman. OmniCapital is part of Schreibman's OmniCapital.org. Whois shows 141.156.91.165 and 141.156.138.45 are registered to Verizon in Virginia. Schreibman appears to live in the D.C. area. Some of the edits are signed by Schreibman. The person keeps reverting to the same version, even though that removes work done by others. Schreibman needs his own article, but he does not deserve inclusion in the Blog article. If Schreibman is the persistent editor here, then perhaps his shunning by colleagues in the Press Gallery was merely due to his personal style. Someone who represents himself through a self portrait in the style of van Gogh is making a bold statement: "There is no such thing as bad press." <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony717_7fd0.html" title="User:Anthony717">User:Anthony717</a>. 27 December 2005.</p>

<i>The Federal Information News Syndicate</i> (FINS), <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/bio_schreibman.htm" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/bio_schreibman.htm" rel="nofollow">Vigdor Schreibman</a>] Editor &amp; Publisher, was from its inauguration on Jan 11, 1993, an Internet-based news organ; its web-based archive -- the first "blog" -- was located, first, on Jan 9, 1994 at the University of Maryland, as <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/Special_Reports/Fins-SR2-01.txt" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/Special_Reports/Fins-SR2-01.txt" rel="nofollow">FINS InfoAge Lib</a>. Three years later this archive became, on Aug 20, 1997, <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/" rel="nofollow">Fins Global Information Age Library</a>, at SunSITE (Sun Software, Information, and Technology Exchange) located at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where it has operated continuously during the past eight years. This archive was designed as an experimental "digital library" containing back issues of Fins News Columns and Special Reports, as well as pivotal public policy papers "communicating the emerging philosophy of the Information Age." <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/bio_schreibman.htm" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/bio_schreibman.htm" rel="nofollow">Vigdor Schreibman</a> was also "the first Internet-based writer to seek accreditation from the Congressional press gallery," according to Michael Wines, writing in his "Media" column at <i>The New York Times</i>, Feb. 26, 1996, at D7. The threat of Internet-based news reporting alarmed the establishment press. Wines sought to disparage internet-based reporters in his story. He compared them with "throngs of Lilliputians" like the editor of FINS, who inhabit the virtual world of cyberspace while reporters of the established press were depicted as "Gullivers," "a colossus of a creature" drawing upon the imagry of the story of <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/News_Columns/Fins-NC4-06.txt" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/News_Columns/Fins-NC4-06.txt" rel="nofollow">" Man-Mountain</a>, told by the great eighteenth-century satirist Jonathan Swift in his book <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>. However, the fiercely independent, Internet-based news reporting set in motion by Vigdor Schreibman quickly established a new mode of reporting that did not conform to the elitest imagry Mr. Wines sought to convey. Nor were these internet-based reporters -- the first bloggers -- likely to become merely acquiescent tools of the Big Money controlled Congress and its compliant news media. While <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, and other establishment media outlets formed a mass media cheering section for the revolution in telecommunications, Schreibman's News Columns and Special Reports conveyed a radically different story: of "telco feudalism" enacted by that revolution, in a legislative process that was rife with corrupt polticial influence peddling, by Congressional leaders such as <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/Special_Reports/Fins-SR3-29.txt" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/Special_Reports/Fins-SR3-29.txt" rel="nofollow">Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole</a> (R-KS), and by <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/News_Columns/Fins-NC3-16.txt" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/News_Columns/Fins-NC3-16.txt" rel="nofollow">House Speaker Newt Gingrich</a> (R-GA). Those stories were to pave the way for a new class of media politics with an "unforgiving toughness and a mastery of new means of communications" that within a decade exploded into a serious challenge between <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9339863/site/newsweek/" class="external text" title="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9339863/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">" The Beltway versus The Blogosphere</a>, as reported by <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Fineman_de97.html" title="Howard Fineman">Howard Fineman</a> in <i>Newsweek-MSNBC</i>, September 14, 2005. In the early days of the 21st-century the politics of Internet Bloggers has become a powerful new instrument of <i>Countervailing Power</i> moving toward an overthrow of the governing class. The next crucial generation of bloggers will be compelled to democratize communications with the facilitation of technology that can manage <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/Technique_Democracy/Fins-TD-09.htm" class="external text" title="http://sunsite.utk.edu/FINS/Technique_Democracy/Fins-TD-09.htm" rel="nofollow">A Technique of Democracy</a> which is needed to "form a more perfect Union" as the First Americans envisioned in the Constitution of the United States. In the absence of a genuine Union the governing system will be guided by the coercive phenomenon of "Groupthink" responsive to raw power alone, which is what has been occuring for some time.</blockquote>

<li><b>Remove</b>: "Groupthink" is not always a bad thing. If people didn't form consensus on things, we couldn't have common knowledge and we wouldn't have common sense. If Mr. Schreibman's only champion is himself, then he cannot be recognized for an accomplishment. There is clearly no single inventor of blogging, but there are popular contributors to the art, and they are recognized. If Mr. Schreibman had inserted into the article a brief, specific and factual claim about his contributions to blogging, then he might have got his mention without all this fuss. As it is, he should be afforded a link in the "See also" section or the "External links" section. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony717_7fd0.html" title="User:Anthony717">User:Anthony717</a>. 27 December 2005.

<p>What about trendy blog elements such as HNT which has mass participation across different types of blogs? They exist in different blogs, and are therefore elements, rather than types of blogs, for they do not themselves characterise the blog. At what point do fads become rituals? Presses above question about "new terms." Since it is widely participated in (perhaps a form of blog "slang"?), can something like it be considered to have evolved from blogs? Is it the "fennel salad" of the noble blog, or the "buffalo wing night", and should both be considered blog cuisine? <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> Coloneldoctor (<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColoneldoctor_dd9a.html" title="User talk:Coloneldoctor">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Coloneldoctor_c549.html" title="Special:Contributions/Coloneldoctor">contribs</a>) 00:39, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Since I've had to revert this twice, I'm going to talk about it. This is not a sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, allowing full user manipulation of the situation to their specifications.</dd>

<p>The previous sentence is fine. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 02:03, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
