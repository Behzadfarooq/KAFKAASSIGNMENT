<p>Is the information on Elizabeth's persecution of Catholics relevant to an article on the the term Bloody Mary? I think it should be cut -- there are plenty of historical figures who executed large numbers of people and are not called "Bloody." Should we provide a list of <i>every</i> tirant who we feel deserves that epithet? Of course not! I say cut Elizabeth. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel_Bastedo_8a43.html" title="User:Joel Bastedo">Joel Bastedo</a> 18:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why not - they were sisters - they followed each other. As you say not all who kill are known as "bloody", but these two were. The article is called 'Bloody Mary'. Mentioning her sister shows that Mary was not unique. But to sugggest that Mary was 'bloody' while Elizabeth was 'good' would be biased. They were both killers. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClemMcGann_9ec9.html" title="User:ClemMcGann">ClemMcGann</a> 18:41, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it's important, then sure, leave it in, but don't rewrite history. It is simply wrong to say that Elizabeth was known as "Bloody Bess." She never was, which is Tarrago's point. He chose the title for the book to shock people, and by shocking them to make them ask: why am I surprised to see Elizabeth's name prefaced by the epithet "Bloody" instead of "Good Queen", when she was just as bloody as "Bloody" Mary? The answer has a lot to do with the Protestant slant to English history, as Tarrago points out. But that doesn't excuse pretending that Elizabeth <i>was called</i> bloody because a historian points out that perhaps she <i>should</i> have been. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel_Bastedo_8a43.html" title="User:Joel Bastedo">Joel Bastedo</a> 06:34, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Like it or not, Elizabeth was known as "Bloody Bess" by those who she persecuted. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClemMcGann_9ec9.html" title="User:ClemMcGann">ClemMcGann</a> 11:11, 15 July 2006 (UTC) And, btw, if you are interested in the Anglican church, see a recent article <a href="http://listserv.episcopalian.org/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0601a&amp;L=virtueonline&amp;P=2497" class="external autonumber" title="http://listserv.episcopalian.org/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0601a&amp;L=virtueonline&amp;P=2497" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> 'And, by the way, "good Queen Mary" is more widely known as "Bloody Mary".' 11:19, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>She was referred to "Bloody Bess" by the Catholics? So you say. What's your citation? I don't remember reading that in Tarrago, but perhaps I missed it. More to the point, that isn't by any means Elizabeth's most common or enduring epithet. Both during her reign and in the centuries since, she has been commonly known as <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_4e8e.html" title="Elizabeth I">Good Queen Bess, the Virgin Queen, and Glorianna</a>. The only place I have encountered her being referred to as "Bloody Bess" is in persuasive essays and historical articles that seek to highlight the unjust and inglorious side of her reign. They use the term for effect, not because it was widely used historically. That said, some Catholics probably did call Bess "bloody," quietly and when no one could hear them. But that's not the same thing as Elizabeth being "known as Bloody Bess" like her half-sister was known as Bloody Mary! I can write an article calling Richard I "Richard the Meanhearted" because it took as much intolerance and meanness as bravery to wage his bloody crusades. But it would be wrong to say that he "became known as" Richard the Meanhearted -- Lionhearted is still his most recognised epithet. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel_Bastedo_8a43.html" title="User:Joel Bastedo">Joel Bastedo</a> 14:21, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interesting, re: Irish Catholics and Flemmish fishermen. It certainly didn't stick, presumably because of the dominance of Protestant Anglicanism under Elizabeth and since.

<dd>Actually, upon reading the sources you provided, I see that only one of them (the Irish website) actually claims that anyone called Elizabeth "Bloody Bess." The <i>North American Review</i> article makes the same point that Tarrago makes: any impartial reader of Tudor history would conclude that Mary's ugly epithet "Bloody" is unwarrented, and that Elizabeth's gentle-sounding appelation, "Good Queen Bess," is unearned. But the reviewer's point is to praise the book he is reviewing for disabusing the "popular mind" of its prejudice against Catholic Mary and in favour of Protestant Elizabeth, a prejudice which has earned them their unfair epithets. Moreover, the reviewer's criticism of the book is that its author goes to far: if readers took the book seriously, he warns, the two objectionable epithets would not be discarded as the should be, but they would be reversed, and people would start talking about "Bloody Bess" and "Good Queen Mary." That criticism only makes sense when the reader knows that Elizabeth is commonly called "Good Queen Bess" and Mary called "Bloody Mary," rather than the reverse! Surely you see that? Anyway, I put a reference to the review in with the Tarrago article, since the two authors are making the same point. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoel_Bastedo_8a43.html" title="User:Joel Bastedo">Joel Bastedo</a> 16:53, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says, "A song about her makes U.S. Navy sailors sing, Bloody Mary is the girl I love, her skin is as tender as DiMaggio's glove" -- I remember the lyrics being "tender as a baseball glove", but I don't have the song handy.
