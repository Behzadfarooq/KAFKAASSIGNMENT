<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why classify these writers as “journalists” or “reporters?”</span></h2>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Why classify these writers as “journalists” or “reporters?” One, by definition they are not. Two, bloggers do not desire to be, nor do they pretend to be such. Yes, some reporters’ blog but not all bloggers are reporters. Hence, it is intellectually inconsistent. These are writers and diarists, to be sure. But they neither report the news (they only link to it, copy it, comment on it) nor do they work for news organizations, from Mother Jones to The New York Times to the Weekly Standard, to ABC or CNN. Yet, these news organizations practice blogging, but not all bloggers are “reporting.” Furthermore, the very way one writes a blog, the ethos, pace, nature, is wholly separate from journalism. Blogging is its own medium, its own media, and only when categorized as such has it reached maturity.</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree to your views because personally as a blogger I do not consider myself as a journalist <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowie1337_4a9d.html" title="User:Cowie1337">Cowie1337</a> 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Educational Uses of Blogs</span></h2>
<p>Teachers and academics are beginning to hook into the power of blogs as teaching and learning tools - not least because Blogs lend themselves to social constructivist and situative modes of delivery. It's also a sign that teachers are increasingly seeking to cater to a new generation of learners, the so-called 'digital natives' for whom social software is an integral part of everyday life. A good example is the extensive use of blogs and wikis by Victoria Davis at Westwood Schools in the US. She uses a central wiki to summarise the learning of the group and links out from this to the individual blogs of her class members. In this way the students can learn from sharing their work and their research outside the classroom and it's worked as a way to engage the learners and encourage them to take a more active, participative role. Does this merit a new section or should it be included under 'Types of Blogs?'<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerylikeawhale_9a05.html" title="User:Verylikeawhale">Verylikeawhale</a> 13:02, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Types of blogs (proposal)</span></h2>
<p>A "BroseF" is the next gereration of web 3.0, a collection of Blogs from a forum user group looking at social profiling.</p>
<p>The "Types of blogs" section is a horrible mishmash of stuff, some fairly standard, some not. It tends to attract particular focuses of individual interest, but it doesn't add up to an encyclopedia article, I don't think. Instead it's become a hybrid of article and list that doesn't work well as either. I personally think it could be eliminated altogether, since it will never be a comprehensive list; people could use "see also" instead. But I know that won't fly, so I would like to see if we could do some streamlining. It would be good to have a real typology of blogs, instead of this randomly accreted list. However, I don't know of a standard typology, so I think we should fall back on types that have a main article. So here are my suggestions, AfD-stylee:janani</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: <b>Rename</b> "Online diary"</li>
<li>Professional or career: <b>Delete</b>, no main article, include under Topical?</li>
<li>Paid: <b>Delete</b>, no main article</li>
<li>Cultural: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Social: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Topical: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Business: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Science: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Moblog: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Collaborative: <b>Delete</b>, no main article (but there should be one)</li>
<li>Educational: <b>Delete</b>, no main article</li>
<li>Directory: <b>Delete</b>, no main article</li>
<li>Link: <b>Delete</b>, no main article</li>
<li>Forum: <b>Delete</b>, no main article (and "not a blog (technically speaking)")</li>
<li>Spam: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Sketch: <b>Merge</b> with Photoblogs, no main article</li>
<li>Photoblogs: <b>Keep</b></li>
<li>Clubbox (does this really warrant a section?)</li>
<li>Political blog: <b>Keep</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback welcome. I could see possibly creating redlinks for Collaborative/Community, since I think that's a major use of blogs; that section as of now is an unrepresentative collection of wikilinks, some good, some not. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 15:28, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will add that if you take a look at the main articles that are linked to, several of them are pretty poor (notably Social, Cultural, Business, Clubbox), and so another option would be to prune further and delete some of the crappoer articles. Another taxonomy:
<ul>
<li>Corporate or Business (article needs improving)</li>
<li>Educational (maybe)</li>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Political</li>
<li>Spam</li>
<li>Topical</li>

<dd>I second. At minimum, the less notable varieties (or perhaps all) should be collapsed to a single bulleted list, rather than having 30 separate subsections. 24.7.106.155</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>OK, I did some pruning. Of course, the first thing that happened was that someone added two new categories in, one with a main article (Shock blog) that was pretty poor. If this is detined to become a dumping ground for everyone's idea of what's a new trend in blogging, I'm inclined to take ComputerJoe's advice. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 22:11, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I also agree - the current mishmash was the result of the last time a pruning was attempted, and it's gotten messier since then.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The "home page" boom of the mid-late ninetees</span></h2>
<p>I keep thinking the popularity of blogs among most people (that just keep a diary) reminds of the 'personal home page' phenomenon of mid-late ninetees. Even if they are technically different, most 'bloggers' use them quite similarly as 'home page' authors used and still use their own, for personal stuff, personal thoughts. I wonder if a section with that connection should be included. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 161.76.99.106 (<a href="../../../1/6/1/User_talk%7E161.76.99.106.html" title="User talk:161.76.99.106">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_161.76.99.106_e1fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/161.76.99.106">contribs</a>) 05:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Agreed, the <i>History</i> section could use a more thorough re-write. It began with the "home page" boom from the first popularization of the World Wide Web (1994-1998). It also completely neglects the <b>E/N</b> (Everything/Nothing, Entertainment/News) phenomenon, such as <a href="../../../s/t/i/StileProject_92df.html" title="StileProject">StileProject</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>, BadAssMofo, etc. There's also the tangental connection to the CamGirl ("camwhore", JenniCam, AnaCam, ChelleCam, Nay<sup><a href="http://mija.nu" class="external autonumber" title="http://mija.nu" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://sacred.nu/" class="external autonumber" title="http://sacred.nu/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup>) phenomenon from 1996-current; apexing around 2001. Arguably, dynamic aggregators such as <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/i/BoingBoing_7d97.html" title="BoingBoing">BoingBoing</a> constituted a kind of weblog as well, though predating the term. <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.162.255.58.html" title="User:71.162.255.58">71.162.255.58</a> 22:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This really needs to be reconsidered some, given articles by Rebecca Blood and others identifying a higher level (and smaller) hierarchy. That doesn't mean this list would not be included necessarily, but that it may not be the right approach. This whole article needs revising I believe. I am writing my thesis on blogs as genre right now and trying to do a more thorough history than I've seen other places, and will have lots of sources, and will be glad to come back and help on this topic when I finish in a couple of weeks. --Mark.d.anthony.sr 23:50, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a common usage error here: "a blog comprising of videos is called a vlog, one comprising of links is called a linklog[5], or one comprised of photos is called a photoblog[6]." A thing is not "comprised of" its parts; it "comprises" them. It looks like someone tried to fix the "comprised of" error, and didn't quite finish. I fixed it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blogs on wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering if the user pages on wikipedia was on the way to become more like blogs , since they are much like them execpt that the editing options are more limited than blogs . I was also wondering if the wikipedia admins plan to make the user pages editing options just as numerious as the options found on any normal blogs eg. editing bacground , musics , sounds , images , video , downloads and a list of friends also on wikipedia user:pages and maybe external friends list.</p>

<dd>No. User pages are there to help us build an encyclopedia, not to become myspace. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 22:02, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure if this is the correct place to discuss this (didn't want to edit the main page without checking) but Open Diary was definately not the first blog platform to innovate with open user comments. "The Captains Log", which I ran from 1997 to 2002 (now offline) was a reverse-chronological diary site with fully open user commenting.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original content</span></h2>
<p>I think a major criticsm of many blogs is the lack of orginal reporting and new content. Most blogs just link to a bunch of other websites and then add their little commentary (such as Gawker.com, zero original reporting, but occasionally they will point out something interesting/humorous about journalism and the news media).</p>

<p>How many other people find the word "blog to be without a doubt the ugliest synthetic word ever? Sounds like the stuff someone blew out their nose onto the sidewalk.

I don't think it should, not at first glance, anyway. An online journal is a different genre altogether from blogs. I am writing my thesis on blogs as genre right now and will come back and help on this topic with sources, edits, etc. I can also explain more about why online journals, which are an ancestor of blogs, should not be merged and conflated with blogs. They should remain two different entries, but maybe have a "see also" link between them when mentioning in the re-written blog entry that one of its ancestors is online journals. But, English usage does change, and if all online journals take on the same features as blogs, with the key feature being frequent posts presented in reverse chronological order, then we might have to reconsider. --Mark.d.anthony.sr 23:51, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origins of the word "blog"</span></h2>
<p>This paragraph uses Merholz's own website as a source:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on 17 December 1997. The short form, "blog," was coined by Peter Merholz. He broke the word weblog into the phrase "we blog" in the sidebar of his weblog in April or May of 1999. [2] "Blog" was accepted as a noun (weblog shortened) and as a verb ("to blog," meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog").</i></dd>

<p>Does anyone else find this to be problematic? If an independent secondary source cannot be provided to verify this, I am afraid the mention of Merholz should be removed. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFerreira_c585.html" title="User:RFerreira">RFerreira</a> 01:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Moocat 11:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)Hi all. Would appreciate any advice you could offer on this: I'm really not sure whether it's at all worth mentioning--or possibly footnoting--on this topic, but has anyone heard of the term "e-log" or "elog" as a precursor (or at least, a "distant but indirect ancestor") of the blog? The term "e-log"--for an e-mail-based personal journal--was coined (I think) in mid-March 1996. Any thoughts on the relevance of this meaning of "e-log," and whether it should be included here or in a separate topic?</p>
<p>BTW, I Googled 'e-log', and there's a Unix-based package called "ELOG" for "electronic logbook" that describes "elog" as "...part of a family of applications known as weblogs." This meaning of "weblogs" however is very different from a blog. It appears to be a log of configuration changes to a UNIX server, and NOT a personal journal entry and so completely different than the use of "e-log" as described above.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggesting..</span></h2>
<p>Hello all, yesterday, I had made an edit which was something like:</p>
<p>Blogs As Money Making Tools:</p>
<p>Now-a-days, there are a large number of people who have started to use blogs as money making tools. Blogs have a very simple and common business model to make money. The authors of the blogs, create a place where a large number of people come. This kind of place is perfect for advertising. So the author of the blog puts up some advertisements and starts to cash-in on the “traffic” or blog popularity he/she gets.</p>
<p>This is the exact same way a large number of websites make money. However, more people opt to blog because it is much more easier to create and maintain blogs. The above explanation over simplifies the process. When using you blog to make money, you have to think about getting people to come visit you blog, making your blog popular etc. All this takes a little work. There are some websites on the Internet, that give you an idea about the complete process and how you must go about making money from your blog. One such very good resource is <a href="http://www.indiahowto.com/make-money-online-blogging.html" class="external text" title="http://www.indiahowto.com/make-money-online-blogging.html" rel="nofollow">“How to make money online bogging?”</a></p>
<p>One of the administrators, Gwernol deleted my edit saying that "link to money making scheme". I was asked by him later to post this here. I think it would be a good idea to plead my case and say why I insist that this section be added.</p>
<p>Firstly, I ask all of you to please look at the link. It is NOT a money making scheme. I am from India. The site indiahowto.com is very popular there and they do not run "cheap money making schemes".</p>
<p>I understand that you would like to maintain high standards of wikipedia and I too do not have any intention of spamming wikipedia. Gwernol, suggested that I am trying to promote "my website" through wikipedia. Even if I am, please take a look at the link. It takes the wikipedia user to a "quality" article that gives much more information about the subject. It does not ask for money or a sign up or anything. It just provides free information. There is a section where the author jokes about the people who start blogs giving him links. But that is an Indian context joke about "Guru Daskhina" It has no serious intent.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. You cannot explain "How to obtain blog links?" and "How to get blog traffic?" here. These kind of things are not to be put in encyclopedias. However, if you site good article outside wikipedia, that provides quality information, that should not be a problem right? So, please re-view my addition as i have not spammed. I have genuinely added more content. I don't mind going into more details in my edit however, this will not fit the context of the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<dd>Hi! First off, thanks for spending some of your valuable time in an effort to help Wikipedia. I believe I can speak for the whole community in thanking you for your time. However, there are a few problems with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blog&amp;diff=62130840&amp;oldid=61983266" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blog&amp;diff=62130840&amp;oldid=61983266" rel="nofollow">your edit</a>.

I suggest taking a look at these links, so as to get a better feel of what type of edits Wikipedia deems as valid. You use statements such as "This kind of space is perfect for advertising", "All it takes is a little work", and "One such very good resource is..." These statements are written in an unencyclopedic tone and as, such inappropriate for the article. Furthermore, the link you provided is a personal website, not a reputable computer science or advertising stragegies journal; also, you don't use the source to back up any of your statements. While I welcome you to contribute, I fear that your efforts will go for naught if you don't read the policies regarding editing, as your edits will be reverted.

<p>I would suggest that in the historical portion a mention be made to some of the early computer gaming sites like Blue's News, Redwood's, Stomped, that in the mid 90s were blogging even though it wasn't called that, and had far more traffic and visibility than a lot of these what in my view are obscure 'pioneer' sites. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValwen_fc82.html" title="User:Valwen">Valwen</a> 04:27, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Right now, not getting into the issue of covert advertising, I agree with the notion that blogs have been used (also abused) to earn money. The most important case in point is the Google(tm) Adsense. You put a blog, you maintain it as you would have done it for your writing pleasure, i.e. free. Then you place some ads and you may earn too.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Need more on the relationship between personal voices and broadcast</span></h2>
<p>Was really interested in comments on Rathergate and how blogging broke through into the mass media. However I feel this section needs an update to show how the blogosphere has impacted on the tone, personality and authority of more established, mass media properties. E.g. The Guardian newspaper blog in the UK has made a virtue of giving their columnists a blog voice with a tone and personality different from that in their printed counterparts. Even the venerable children's TV show Blue Peter (about to enter its 50th year!) has changed it's tone and personality by giving it's presenters their own video blog voice instead of a single, editorialised 'team' voice.</p>
<p>Blogs are taking the cult of the celebrity even further than previously seen in mass media 'reality' shows. We now read, see and hear correspondants own reactions to events around the world.</p>
<p>I think a few worked examples of this phenomenon are required here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Transamazonian (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Transamazonian_6ee7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Transamazonian">contribs</a>) 14:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">merge with <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_journalism.html" title="Citizen journalism">Citizen journalism</a>?</span></h2>
<p>There's really no significant difference between <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_journalism.html" title="Citizen journalism">citizen journalism</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blogs</a>, as 'citizen journalism' sites are really just blogs that random people just set up, primarily more as an editorial forum for their own point of view and less to actually report the news. Calling this 'journalism' is actually quite a bit of a stretch. So I'm thinking that the best approach here would be to merge the citizen journalism article as a subsection into this article, since the sites are essentially just blogs anyway. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 17:43, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Blogroll shouldn't be put into I don't think, I had to search up the term, and found it quickly with blogroll being its own term.</p>
<p>Blogroll is it's own term, I agree with the fact that online diary should be combined with the blog entry because they have the same meaning. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan444123_333c.html" title="User:Ryan444123">Ryan444123</a> 13:28, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV/Clarification Issue</span></h2>
<p>While I was browsing through the article (which is otherwise a nice overview), one particular paragraph under "Blogging and the mass media" caught my eye as a potential problem. Specifically, it's this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bloggers' credibility problem, however, can be an advantage for the bloggers and for the mainstream journalists who take an interest in them. News organizations are sometimes reluctant to tell stories that will upset important people. But when bloggers or activists make sensational claims, then they become stories themselves, and journalists can use them as cover for reporting the underlying scandals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see two potential issues here. The first is one of a NPOV issue in the allegation that "news organizations are sometimes reluctant" to report a particular story for fear of offending "important people." Obviously a statement like that needs some form of citation, or it's a personal opinion, and thus original research.</p>
<p>The other issue has to do with the logic of the paragraph. Even if we disregard the suppression allegation, the paragraph displays a lack of understanding of the news cycle and principles of reporting. Most outlets would love a juicy scandal story -- they sell papers. The problem is that journalistic ethics (fair, neutral, accurate and evenhanded) and media law (libel in particular) play a big part in developing and publishing a story. In other words, if a news outlet can't run a story due to legal concerns, then they're not going to be able to use bloggers "as cover" to make an end run around libel law (comes back to the qualified privilege under the law).</p>
<p>Rather than just rewriting it myself and risk having someone subsequently revert back, I wanted to try to establish some kind of consensus first. So if any of you have any suggestions for how best to edit it, or arguments in favor of it remaining as is, please do share. JEJoyce 00:47, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Madrid 11-M</span></h2>
<p>I Think there is a mistake in the paragraph <i>Blogging was used to draw attention to obscure news sources. For example, bloggers posted links to traffic cameras in Madrid as a huge anti-terrorism demonstration filled the streets in the wake of the March 11 attacks.</i> Since the purely anti-terrorist demonstration of day 12 was widely covered by the mainstream media and the Government (actualy the governement was leading it and pushing it's slogan "Con la Constitución"...It makes sense to think that blogs, and pages like indymedia played a more imortant role next day, 13-M, when protests were held to question the Governments insistance that it was ETA and not the Jihadist terrorists who were behind the attacks. I would modify the paragraph, but since I never heard of <i>Bloggers linking to traffic cameras in madrid</i> I rather wait...If somebody has any info please reach me at my discussion page. --<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarano_53ba.html" title="User:Varano">Varano</a> 17:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too US / western world focussed</span></h2>
<p>The article is riddled with assumptions of the blogosphere being entirely US based. It also, in numerous places assumes that the reader is from the USA too. So I award this article an LGS tag.--Ordew 11:23, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
