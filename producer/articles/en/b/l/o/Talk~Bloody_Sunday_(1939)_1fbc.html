<p>We would surely like to know what was Bromberger Blutsonntag.<br />
It is Sunday - when&#160;?<br />
What happened&#160;?<br />
Why&#160;?<br />
What happened next&#160;?<br />
Who were the perpetrators&#160;?<br />
There was some official Communist propaganda but obviously there was also Nazi propaganda that we don't want to put in this article. Right&#160;?<br />
<a href="../../../k/p/j/User%7EKpjas_9cb5.html" title="User:Kpjas">Kpjas</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Added quotes from Nuremburg trials: there is clearly more than one point of view about these events. -- Anon.
<dl>
<dd>There is another Bloody Sunday on 9th and 10th September 1939 there were 1500 Polish inhabitants executed in retribution for the Bloody Sunday of 3rd Sept.<br />
It was given prominence by the Communist authorities after the war of course.<a href="../../../k/p/j/User%7EKpjas_9cb5.html" title="User:Kpjas">Kpjas</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that i have a book about Bydgoszcz which quite clearly proves that there was no such thing and shows how false data was collected by Germans (for example, they counted every Pole with German sounding name, some of people supposedly killed were found alive etc)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The actualisation: I've found interview with author of the book, which changed his mind and now is of opinion that massacre happened and umber of victims is about 358 (but definetely not 5.000). <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">User:szopen</a>

<p>Moved to talk: The numbers quoted in document are now usually lowered to 20 to 40 Polish soldiers killed in Bydgoszcz at September the first, and in whole about 13.000 inhabitants of Bydgoszcz murdered during the war.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody can updare recent documents of IPN? <a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECautious_0785.html" title="User:Cautious">Cautious</a> 22:41, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeti, don't kwno why you removed "from already prapred lists". There is no point in arguing that there were no such lists: there were. The members of Nazi party, German activists etc were on that list. The intention was to separate people from that lists, not to kill them; the utter failure of Polish government was that it started action during the war, because making it earlier would made interning easier.</p>
<p>It is also not the sign of "germano-fobia" of whatever. The same were doing other governments and it's quite natural - interning, not killing. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a></p>
<p>Also German pastors and politicians, some of them very old, were taken from their homes and forced to walk, some of them never returned. The real Nazis were arrested before the war.</p>
<p>Except for the ones who hid their political preference, were agents, or parachuted down 2 days earlier. Duh! <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> 14:08, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article uses the term 'diversants'. I couldn't find the word diversant in my dictionaries (I tried two of them).</p>
<p>What is a diversant? Maybe it is an incorrect translation of the Polish word 'dywersant' - however, I don't know that word either. Is it something like 'saboteur'?</p>

<p>Bromberg Bloody Sunday event and its consequences were summarized in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_atrocities_in_Poland_1117.html" title="World War II atrocities in Poland">World War II atrocities in Poland</a>. This remaining material might be merged with the article:</p>
<p>"According to Nazi propaganda:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to the events in Bromberg, throughout western Poland a portion of the German residents were rounded up, jailed, marched eastward, shot and buried in nearby woods. This all occurred in the confusion of the military retreat. When advancing German forces neared the prisoner marches, they were some times executed as a spies, but more frequently released.</dd>
</dl>
<p>German and Polish historians continue to argue about the validity of the claims.</p>
<p>As German forces gained control, immediate executions killed over 3,000 Poles, many with unproven culpability. More reprisals were soon to follow. A <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> witness described the beginning of the massacre as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The first victims of the campaign were a number of <a href="../../../z/w/i/Zwi%C4%85zek_Harcerstwa_Polskiego_d405.html" title="Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego">Boy Scouts</a> from twelve to sixteen years of age, who were set up in the marketplace against a wall and shot. No reason was given. A devoted priest who rushed to administer the Last Sacrament was shot too. He received five wounds. A Pole said afterwards that the sight of those children lying dead was the most piteous of all the horrors he saw.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Following this, the <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> troops began rounding up schoolboys in the street, who were similarly executed. The witness continues:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Thirty-four of the leading tradespeople and merchants of the town were shot, and many other leading citizens.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The troops then attacked the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Jesus_37d2.html" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuits</a>, looting and ransacking the church. The priests were taken to a barn, where the local <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> population was already imprisoned, and they were all subjected to abuse. Altogether, some 1,000 people were killed in the ensuing massacres." --<a href="../../../t/t/y/User%7ETtyre_65d2.html" title="User:Ttyre">Ttyre</a> 14:20, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would just like to point out the quality of grammar in the text was horrible, and at some points I had to read sentances several times to infer any sort of meaning from them. I did my best to clean up the mistakes that I saw, but the sentances were sometimes simply too ambigious. Articles should only be written and edited by people who no only have a decent understanding of the language that they're writting in, but are able to produce a sufficiently coherent text. If not, please stick to contributing to the Wikipedia in your language. Sooner or later someone will see the need for the article in their language and translate it.</p>

<dd>I think it's still disputed. Take a look e.g. at this (apologies for citing in Polish):

<dd><i>W „Nowej Trybunie Opolskiej” dyskusja o „Krwawej niedzieli” pomiędzy prof. Włodzimierzem Jastrzębskim a dr Tomaszem Chincińskim. - Nie znaleźliśmy natomiast żadnych dokumentów, z których by wynikało, że to Niemcy przygotowali słynną dywersję bydgoską. W związku z tym nadal bazujemy tylko na materiałach drugorzędnych polskich i niemieckich. A propos tych ostatnich - wśród polskich historyków panuje niezrozumiały dla mnie wstręt do źródeł hitlerowskich. Zakłada się z góry, że te dokumenty muszą być sfałszowane przez ówczesną propagandę. To błędne podejście. W tych dokumentach znaleźć można całe mnóstwo ciekawych informacji – mówi prof. Jastrzębski. - Ja wysnuwam zupełnie inne wnioski z tych materiałów. Dokumenty, do których udało mi się dotrzeć w Londynie, przede wszystkim meldunki polskich armii z 3 września, są absolutnie bezcenne, bo powstawały na gorąco – mówi dr Chinciński. „Krwawa niedziela – protokół rozbieżności” 10.09.2005 r.</i></dd>

1) German press and relations of Sept 1939 were prepared by the Propagandaministerium of Dr Goebels. In 3rd Reich there was a strict system of political control of the press. The propagandaministerium issued day-to-day huidance of what may be written in press and how. Also, the presentation of Bydgoszcz case was guided by Propagandaministerium. The term "Bromberger Bloody Sunday" itself was decreed by Goebbels for obligatory use in German press. Hitler-time publications are as true a representation of facts of Sept 1939 as, for instance, publications in 'Pravda' were representaions of facts in Afganistan during 1979 on. In this context it is not an 'abomination' but rather rational estimation of published German sources.</p>
<p>2) Post-war German publications re-write of what was written in Hitler times. The present usage of Goebbels' term "Bloody Sunday" is an evidence.</p>
<p>2) The shooting to people on the streets of Bydgoszcz was not a fact done in hidden rooms, but in public. The shots and casualties were seen by seen by thousands of people. Mr. Jarzebski came to the conclusion that what had been seen by those mass of people was their sheer mistake (and those bodies of Poles shot in the streets were surely a fatamorgana? or perhaps they were cause by that Polish officer who allegedly shoot up in the air to open way for his military unit?), and he relies on Hitlerian and post-Hitlerian German publications. It is silly to believe it, I dare say. Quite similarly, also the existence of Gulag archipelago was "under dispute" some time and there was an unreasonable "abomination" of Soviet sources which "proved" it never existed. Please notice the similarities in both cases.</p>
<p><b>The Polish Pigons</b></p>
<p>I must ad, that the killing of German Civilians where not the first killings, done by the Polish on German. After the IWW in the areas witch where disputed like Upper Slesia their happend Killings against Germans True Polish the first time . A product of the peace treatys. Beween the war was a lot of unjust done against the German minoity from the Polish side and that endet in the Killings on the beginning and on the end of the Second world war, so it is a little bit amoral to blame everything only on Hitler and the Germans and to think the Polish are the peaceful unguilty pigons.

<p>Seems to be a not supported opinion. Could you supply some details?</p>

<b>Killing of German civilians in Poland 1939 German numbers</b></p>
<p>"August Müller, witch worked for the "Commission for the history of German in Poland" a half German state commission, has created an archive with 4.332 Names of sure death Germans murdered by Polish because they where German in 1939 in the fist weeks of the war. That is the lowest possible number. The Chief of the police commission on this of the German Reich, Wehner gave on the 20.05.1964 on an official meeting in Mannheim the number 6.300,- Germans killed by the polish witch can be seen as the highest number witch was surged for. Anyway it is very difficult because Germans lived all over the huge Polish state and the actual serge vor victims took mainly place in the Part of Poland witch was German before the first WW so the number could be even be slightly higher.

<p>IIRC it was the list of the Germans from pre-war Poland which died during September-October 1939. I've seen a number of 5000 dead. However, it's hard to call them "lowest possible number of murdered by Poles", since it is a number of Germans killed, not "murdered by Poles". It includes probably victims of lynchs as well as sabotageurs, killed by air-raids etc. It's hard to believe that only Poles died as victims as air-raids - bombs choose no victims. <a href="../../../s/z/o/User%7ESzopen_9055.html" title="User:Szopen">Szopen</a> 11:30, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It says little to nothing and it lacking even the remnants of a citation effort. Furthermore, nobody in the English speaking world refers to this event - if they bother to learn about it - as the Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday...its Bromberg " " not only because nobody has a clue how to pronounce it (sorry Poland), but in a historical context, that is how it is remembered on an English page.--72.94.90.144 09:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Watch it there, Space Cadet. Do not try to make me feel like an "ignorant" foreigner...especially on my own turf. This is English Wiki. You have quite a track record as a Polocentric, and you don't even have the "excuse" of isolation and sheer size like the US does. I am raising the question as to whether it is referred to as Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday or Bromberg Bloody Sunday, and I'm pretty sure the latter is the case <b>outside of Poland</b>.

<p>Checking the article's history, I see that it was only recently changed to Bydgoszcz instead of Bromberg with the logic that it is either this, Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday, or its full German equivalent. I do not agree with either solution.--72.94.90.144 22:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure how the post-WWI revisionism suggestion relates to Bydgoszcz/Bromberg Bloody Sunday except your effort to classify this particular event as part of a supposed long line of German fairy-tales. I'm not sure I buy that.--72.94.90.144 22:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't change my comments just because you don't understand them. Let me educate you: "Post Scriptum" means "after signature". Google hits don't represent encyclopedic knowledge. The "revisionism" part was added by mistake, my apologies. It was meant for another anon. Can you please get an account? <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpace_Cadet_187d.html" title="User:Space Cadet">Space Cadet</a> 00:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Obviously I know what post scriptum means, don't be such a smartass. I was simply trying to keep your comments seperate from mine so people can follow this conversation. In light of this though, I think it is pretty ironic that you changed the title of this discussion, which I designated before you even got here. But anyway, yes, I agree that Google hits do not represent "encyclopedic knowledge", but a mere 51 hits certainly suggests what I am suspecting: "Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday" is not how this event is referred to outside of Poland. Obviously neither of us is accomplishing anything here and naturally you are going to disagree with me, so I guess <b>we should see how the rest of the wikicommunity feels.</b> For the sake of our conversation though, why are you so sure that <i>Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday</i> is "correct" for reasons other than personal preference? Also, I'm kind of fascinated by Poland's representation on Wikipedia; is English really that predominant in Poland? Hardly anyone seems to speak English in eastern Germany, though the Czech Republic is a different story...--72.94.90.144 04:04, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This incident does not seem to be referenced frequently in English. Based on publications, Bromberg is used slightly more frequently than Bydgoszcz based on Google Books (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?as_q=Bromberg&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Bloody+Sunday&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_libcat=0&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_drrb=c&amp;as_miny=&amp;as_maxy=&amp;as_isbn=" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?as_q=Bromberg&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Bloody+Sunday&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_libcat=0&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_drrb=c&amp;as_miny=&amp;as_maxy=&amp;as_isbn=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>,<a href="http://books.google.com/books?as_q=Bydgoszcz&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=%22Bloody+Sunday%22&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_libcat=0&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_drrb=c&amp;as_miny=&amp;as_maxy=&amp;as_isbn=" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?as_q=Bydgoszcz&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=%22Bloody+Sunday%22&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_libcat=0&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_vt=&amp;as_auth=&amp;as_pub=&amp;as_drrb=c&amp;as_miny=&amp;as_maxy=&amp;as_isbn=" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) and Scholar (<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Bromberg+%22Bloody+Sunday%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Bromberg+%22Bloody+Sunday%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>,<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Bydgoszcz+%22Bloody+Sunday%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Bydgoszcz+%22Bloody+Sunday%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>).

<dd>I don't insist on "Bydgoszcz", just a comment. English usage would probably depend on on the origin of the information and it can be equally "Bromberg" or "Bydgoszcz". As probably there are more German than Polish authors, I expect "Bromberg" would be more frequent (but I'm not sure of the "size matters" argument really applies here). On the other hand the city both before an after the Nazi occupation belonged to Poland and had Polish name and maybe we could respect that&#160;? --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 06:48, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is an odd case, since it is not frequently discussed in English. I'm usually not one for worrying about local sensitivities, so I'd rather go with a name most commonly used in English, if applicable. I'll inquire if john k would be willing to provide input. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 20:20, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean who has more historians: Germany or Poland&#160;? I think you don't need to ask john k to answer that question. I also expect that German historians, being more numerous, have overall more research output, so the German names will always prevail if quantity is all that matters. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 21:35, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not trying to discern whether there are more instances of <i>Bromberg Blutsonntag</i> or <i>Krwawa niedziela</i>. I am interested in whether the "Bromberg Bloody Sunday" / "Bloody Sunday of Bromberg" or "Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday" / "Bloody Sunday of Bydgoszcz" are used more with <a href="../../../u/e/_/WP%7EUE_8b64.html" title="WP:UE">WP:UE</a> in mind. I would be fine with using Bydgoszcz in the title if that is the predominant usage. Actually, after taking a look at the other titles at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Sunday_4817.html" title="Bloody Sunday">Bloody Sunday</a>, an idea to take into consideration is simply calling it "<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Sunday_%281939%29_0ebe.html" title="Bloody Sunday (1939)">Bloody Sunday (1939)</a>.

<dd>Indeed, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Sunday_%281939%29_0ebe.html" title="Bloody Sunday (1939)">Bloody Sunday (1939)</a> would be consistent with all the other Bloody Sundays naming and then "Bromberg ..." and "Bydgoszcz ..." would redirect to it. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 07:22, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday → Bloody Sunday (1939)– The desired title is neutral and fits with the naming scheme of similar events at <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Sunday_4817.html" title="Bloody Sunday">Bloody Sunday</a>. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOlessi_e981.html" title="User:Olessi">Olessi</a> 19:04, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
