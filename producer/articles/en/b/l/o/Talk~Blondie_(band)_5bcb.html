<p>How is Blondie one of the most influential bands of the 20th century? Big, yes; influential, no. How many modern bands cite Blondie as an influence? I can't think of any off the top of my head. Unless someone who knows more about Blondie cites some sources and some artists who cite Blondie as an influence, I'm going to modify and/or remove that statement. --<a href="../../../e/l/y/User%7EElysianfields_8b58.html" title="User:Elysianfields">Elysianfields</a> 00:52, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When you do that, go in the history and check out what happened on August 1. A perfectly good version was deleted and replaced with a rather POV fan-rave.

<dd>Thanks for pointing out which version was the non biased. I merged them as best as I could. The new version has a lot of superflous information, but I figured we might as well keep it; and I'm not comfortable deleting tons of stuff without anyone else's consent. Especially since I know virtually nothing about Blondie. Anyway, hope the merge is satisfactory. I also restored the old image because:
<dl>

<ul>
<li>The new one is by no means flattering</li>
<li>It's a good representation of Blondie in their heyday.</li>

<p>Right, first things first.</p>
<ol>
<li>Blondie was, and still is Disco, thank you very much. Heart Of Glass ring any bells? If that isn't disco, then I dont know what is, also their last single Good Boys was modern disco, and was hailed by some reviewers as the Heart Of Glass of 2003.</li>
<li>Second thing. Blondie was not mainly punk. Thier first 2 albums were punky, but the third and forth, were New Wave and power pop, which, incidentley, were there most famous. The Fith and sixth were an eclectic mix of dance, calypso, reggae, 1920's style, and classical.</li>
<li>Blondie has influenced many people, for example, <b>Gwen Steffani, Madonna, Garbage and Kelly Osbourne</b> among others all say that they were influenced.</li>
</ol>
<p>So dont go telling me what Blondie was, and so forth, because I will disprove you otherwise! And finally, if, as you say, you dont know much about Blondie, dont interfere with things you know nothing about, as I will continually change them back to how they were and how they should be. I am a massive Blondie fan and collecter of their records, I think I know better! <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScaryspice_9ed6.html" title="User:Scaryspice">Scaryspice</a> 10:45, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That also makes you extremely biased</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What you are saying is correct however the style in which you place it into the article is out of step with the other articles here. The phrase "Blondie is Punk. Blondie is Rock. Blondie is Pop. Blondie is New Wave. Blondie is Reggae. Blondie is Disco. Blondie is Hip-Hop." - that's just not encycopedic style. Of course "Heart of Glass" is disco. Of course "Island of Lost Souls" is reggae (and calypso for that matter). Whether it's accurate or not is beside the point. Also it is not necessary to make linked words bold. Once again that is not the correct style. I'm reverting because I disagree with the style in which this things are presented, which is not to say that I think it's inaccurate. Please have a look at other music based articles to see how they're set out. It's not a question of you being more knowledgeable about Blondie than other editors. Unconventional as Blondie may have been, an encyclopedic article needs to conform to a certain style. I'm going to revert it back. Please don't revert it.

Can people here calm down about "labelling" a style for Blondie. Disco? Punk? They created a lots of both (and much more) and this can be heard on the 1st four albums and that captures the zetigeist of the City in the late seventies.</p>

<p>Is it possible to refer to the blow-up at the Rock and Roll Hall of fame in this article? Or would that qualify as gossip and hearsay?<a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetHeart666_449e.html" title="User:SweetHeart666">SweetHeart666</a> 17:54, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be a fair amount of sarcasm in this article. Any amount would be inappropriate for an encyclopedia article. I would clean it up, but I don't know anything about Blondie.

I know it still needs a <i>lot</i> of work but I hope that it's a start. Maybe I've taken it from a "bad, bad article" to merely a "bad article"&#160;;-) I have&#160;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Broken the career into sections, each of which desperately needs to be expanded upon, but I've tried to provide a chronological summary of their career which I see as being in 4 stages. (1. early success as a new wave act, 2. huge success as a pop act, 3. a lengthy hiatus and 4. a regeneration/return).</li>
<li>I've rewritten a lot of text but the only section I decimated was the lengthy postscript to their Hall of Fame induction. It was gossippy, uncited and unnecessary and gave excessive weight to one incident in a 30 year career. The tensions within the band should be discussed but this was really putting all eggs into one basket and it made the whole artice very lopsided.</li>
<li>created a "Legacy" section. I think this is where critical commentary can be put, along with who they've influenced and their overall impact on music in general.</li>
<li>removed "Previous band members" section. It was hugely repetitive and the same info is now included in the "Band members" section, simply by adding dates after their names. I've removed the Bellamo sisters completely. I understand they provided backing vocals (so did numerous other people at different times) but I can't find anything to say they were ever band members - so out they go. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 01:21, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you have done a brilliant job, well done. This article is great now, a huge improvement on the previous one. Keep up the great work!<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul75_3357.html" title="User:Paul75">Paul75</a> 23:25, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. I appreciate the comment. I'd like to see it eventually grow into a featured article - I think the band is interesting and influential enough to warrant it. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 15:51, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I love the direction this article has taken, and appreciate all the work involved. I, too, didn't like the sarcasm I'd found here some time back. I've made some minor edits and hope they're helpful as the article moves along. Even Blondie's detractors have to admit they were a major band straddling genres at a vital and fascinating and acrimonious crossroads in music, and deserve a balanced, objective bio. It's ironic people didn't get the point of what they did, and blamed them for not remaining any one thing, or for becoming any other thing. Abrazame 12:52, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a couple of suggestions. The article should really talk more about the 1978-1981 period when Blondie was really huge in the U.S. &amp; UK. It seems to go in depth into the rise and fall of the band then glosses over their peak period. In particular, the touring - how much did they tour during this period - how big were the shows (attendance) and what cities, etc? Also, Blondie's influence on dance music. The double 12" of Rapture/The Tide Is High spent 4 weeks at #1 on Billboard's dance chart in 1981. After their breakup, several remixed versions of their hits became dance hits in the U.S. including Rapture, Heart Of Glass, and Atomic which went top 10 on the U.S. dance chart in 1994-1995.

<dd>Hi, thanks for your comment and I couldn't agree more. I've been working on this over the last couple of weeks but I haven't been able to find a lot of reliable info. Even their official website glosses over the middle bit and focuses on the beginning and end of their career. If you can add anything please do. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossrs_2f75.html" title="User:Rossrs">Rossrs</a> 10:37, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw a documentary on the BBC recently ("Blondie - One Way Or Another" Friday 21st July at 22.35pm.) which discussed in some detail the acrimonious feelings about previous band members. It also showed the unbelievable scene at the band's induction into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame with Frank Infante begging Debbie Harry for him and Nigel Harrison to be allowed to play with them. The change of line up over the years is not well represented. I think that the band line up should be added against each album and single. The documentary also showed their ex manager talking about "kicking out Gary Valentine". I think the article would also be inmproved if it had more information about why the line up changed and why there is so much bad feeling about it all. --ChrisGrahamUK 11:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
