<p>Queen Mary I of England (reigned <a href="../../../1/5/5/1553.html" title="1553">1553</a> – <a href="../../../1/5/5/1558.html" title="1558">1558</a>) is called <b>Bloody Mary</b> because of her persecution of Protestants. The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, started fitfully in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> by King <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, became established policy under the brief reign of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a>. Mary, like her mother <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Aragon_0c7a.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, whom Henry VIII had spurned, was a devout <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a>. She contracted an unpopular marriage to the equally devout <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>. The pair, with the assistance of conservative churchmen such as <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Bonner_e7bc.html" title="Edmund Bonner">Edward "Bloody" Bonner</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Gardiner_afb6.html" title="Stephen Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a>, sought to reimpose Roman Catholicism upon the religiously divided country.</p>
<p>During her brief reign of just over five years, Mary had 283 people <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_at_the_stake.html" title="Burning at the stake">burnt at the stake</a> for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heresy</a>. Her persecutions were notable also for the prominence of their victims; the first person to die was the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Rogers_%28religious%29_6f26.html" title="John Rogers (religious)">John Rogers</a>, who had completed and published Tyndale's work as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew%27s_Bible_222f.html" title="Matthew's Bible">Matthew's Bible</a>. While heresy trials and executions occurred both before and after her reign, she executed more than twice as many as had been executed for this crime over the preceding century and a half.</p>
<p>Mary's half-sister <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a> succeeded her. In contrast to Mary's violent epithet, Elizabeth was commonly known as "Good Queen Bess,". However, on one occasion, Elizabeth had about eight hundred Catholics executed for restoring the Mass in a few towns. This has prompted some historians to suggest that a more fitting name for Elizabeth would be "Bloody Bess."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Indeed, Irish Catholics reversed the epithets, calling Mary "Good Queen Mary," and Elizabeth "Bloody Bess."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Mary_%28person%29_246b.html" title="Edit section: In folklore">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In folklore</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folklore.html" title="Folklore">folklore</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_street_culture.html" title="Children's street culture">children's street culture</a>, "Bloody Mary" is the name of a children's game in which a <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">ghost</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch.html" title="Witch">witch</a> of the same name (or sometimes other names, such as "Mary Worth") is said to appear in a <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirror.html" title="Mirror">mirror</a> when summoned. One of the more common ways participants attempt to make her appear is to stand before a mirror in the dark (most commonly in a bathroom) and repeat her name three times, though there are many variations. Some include chanting a hundred times, chanting at midnight, spinning around, rubbing one's eyes, or chanting her name thirteen times with a lit candle. Most of these are meant to disorient people. In some versions of the legend, the summoner must say, "Bloody Mary, I killed your son!" or "I killed your baby." In these variants, Bloody Mary is often believed to be the spirit of a mother (often a widow) who <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_murder.html" title="Child murder">murdered her children</a>, or a woman who was murdered shortly before or after her wedding. In stories where Mary is supposed to have been wrongly accused of killing her children, the querent might say "I believe in Mary Worth." This is similar to another game involving the summoning of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bell_Witch_60c0.html" title="The Bell Witch">the Bell Witch</a> in a mirror at midnight. Similar rituals are also used to summon spirits in the movies <i><a href="../../../b/e/e/Beetlejuice.html" title="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>) and <i><a href="../../../c/a/n/Candyman_%28film%29.html" title="Candyman (film)">Candyman</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>). The game is often a test of courage, as it is said that if Bloody Mary is summoned, she would proceed to kill the summoner in an extremely violent way, such as ripping his or her face off. Other variations say that the querent must not look directly at her, but at her image in the mirror; she will then reveal the querent's future, particularly concerning marriage and children.</p>
<p>Bloody Mary Worth is typically described as a child-murderer who lived in the locality where the legend has taken root years ago. There is often a specific local <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graveyard.html" title="Graveyard">graveyard</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone.html" title="Tombstone">tombstone</a> that becomes attached to the legend.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various people have surmised that the lore about taunting Bloody Mary about her baby may relate her tenuously to folklore about Queen Mary I. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>The queen's life was marked by a number of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriages</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_pregnancy.html" title="False pregnancy">false pregnancies</a>. Had Mary I successfully borne a child, this would have established a Roman Catholic succession and threatened the continuance of her <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution.html" title="Religious persecution">religious persecutions</a> after her death. Speculation exists that the miscarriages were deliberately induced. As a result, some retellings of the tale make Bloody Mary the queen driven to madness by the loss of her children. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> It is likely, however, that Queen Mary I provided only her nickname to the Bloody Mary of folklore. She is also confused in some tellings of the story with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Queen_of_Scots_7b58.html" title="Mary Queen of Scots">Mary Queen of Scots</a>. Bloody Mary is sometimes said to have bathed in the blood of her child victims (or more commonly the blood of virgins) in order to retain a youthful complexion; this would appear to confound her with <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Bathory_d007.html" title="Elizabeth Bathory">Elizabeth Báthory</a>.</p>
<p>The mirror ritual by which Bloody Mary is summoned may also relate to a form of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divination.html" title="Divination">divination</a> involving mirrors and darkness that was once performed on <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>. While as with any sort of folklore the details may vary, this particular tale encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_%28symbolism%29.html" title="Skull (symbolism)">skull</a>-face of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28personification%29.html" title="Death (personification)">Grim Reaper</a> instead; this meant, of course, that they were destined to die before they married.</p>
<p>The appearance of a ghostly figure in the mirror could be explained quite easily for the more complex rituals, for example spinning around whilst summoning Bloody Mary in front of a mirror lit by candles. The combination of dizziness, rapid movement and flickering lighting could easily fool the eye into seeing someone, especially when the idea has already been implanted. The participant may think that they have seen a spirit, it is, however, most likely a trick of the eye brought upon by the combination of darkness, fear and disorientation.</p>

<p>In the video game <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Twisted_Metal%7E_Black_8204.html" title="Twisted Metal: Black">Twisted Metal: Black</a></i>, a playable character goes by the name "Bloody Mary." She was a girl who believed in romance since her childhood, though her need for affection was always unrequited. She acquired her nickname when she snapped at a friend's wedding; she stabbed her to death and stole her blood-soaked gown.</p>
<p>In the video game <i><a href="../../../t/e/r/Terranigma.html" title="Terranigma">Terranigma</a></i>, Bloody Mary is a boss that the player battles after a quite disturbing and unsettling trek through her castle. The castle itself is filled with zombies, skeletons, giant spiders and other horror-based creatures, as well as a few living armors. The player constantly encounters references to Christopher Columbus and Queen Mary. The game claims that despite Columbus' protests, Queen Mary had him take her three sons with him to the new world. Something went wrong however, and Queen Mary's three sons were killed. When Columbus returned, he was locked in the dungeon to rot for eternity. Queen Mary's spirit remained behind as Bloody Mary out of her hatred and spite for Columbus, believing him responsible for the death of her children.</p>

She remained to haunt the mirror and could be summoned in the usual fashion; in this version, however, she only kills those who harbor a secret in which someone died.</p>
