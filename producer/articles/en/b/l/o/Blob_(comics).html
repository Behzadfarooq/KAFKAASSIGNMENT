<p>Fred J. Dukes was born in <a href="../../../l/u/b/Lubbock%2C_Texas_5ed1.html" title="Lubbock, Texas">Lubbock, Texas</a>. He started out as a member of a <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circus_%28performing_art%29.html" title="Circus (performing art)">circus</a> <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideshow.html" title="Sideshow">sideshow</a> under the name <b>the Blob</b>. He was contacted by <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor_X_9919.html" title="Professor X">Charles Xavier</a>, who told him that he was a mutant and asked him to join the X-Men. At the mansion, the other X-Men disliked him for his obnoxious attitude. The Blob refused Xavier's invitation, saying he was better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tried erasing his mind of what had transpired, the Blob escaped. He gathered up the other Circus members and they attacked the mansion. Xavier was able to wipe everyone's minds, and the Blob went back to the circus.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The mutant <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magneto_%28comics%29.html" title="Magneto (comics)">Magneto</a> sought the Blob out to recruit him into his <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Evil_Mutants_4701.html" title="Brotherhood of Evil Mutants">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, restoring Blob's memory through a jarring hit to the head. The Blob would accept the invitation temporarily, but later when it was shown that Magneto had no real concern for Blob's safety, he left the brotherhood. He would later join <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystique_%28comics%29.html" title="Mystique (comics)">Mystique's</a> incarnation of the Brotherhood, remaining also when it was reformed as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Force_%28comics%29_16ec.html" title="Freedom Force (comics)">Freedom Force</a>. After Freedom Force's dissolution, the Blob joined <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toad_%28comics%29.html" title="Toad (comics)">Toad's</a> Brotherhood and later the incarnation led by Professor X, and even became leader after Xavier left. Months later, Dukes joined the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabretooth_%28comics%29.html" title="Sabretooth (comics)">Sabretooth</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martinique_Jason_bc5c.html" title="Martinique Jason">daughter</a> of the original <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mastermind_%28Jason_Wyngarde%29_da53.html" title="Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)">Mastermind</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus_%28comics%29.html" title="Exodus (comics)">Exodus</a> recreated the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offered to join, but was quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considered him useless. This was a major blow for Dukes' already weak self-esteem, for which he sought the counsel of therapist Sean Garrison. After a session, Blob attacked the Xavier Institute, though he was defeated by the combined efforts of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mutants_95bf.html" title="New Mutants">New Mutants</a> and the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellions_%28comics%29.html" title="Hellions (comics)">Hellions</a>. He was then arrested by <a href="../../../s/2E/h/S.H.I.E.L.D._6d56.html" title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarlet_Witch_a6c7.html" title="Scarlet Witch">Scarlet Witch</a>'s depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob was one of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimation_%28comics%29.html" title="Decimation (comics)">thousands of mutants to lose their powers</a>, though his skin did not shrink to compensate the loss of his bloated mass, giving him huge folds of loose skin all over his body. The depressed Blob attempted to commit suicide by cutting his wrists, though his loose skin prevented him from accomplishing a single cut.</p>
<p>In the last panel of <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderbolts_%28comics%29.html" title="Thunderbolts (comics)">Thunderbolts</a></i> #103, the Blob can be seen in the background in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Zemo_8451.html" title="Baron Zemo">Baron Zemo</a>'s prison for supervillains that the Thunderbolts have apprehended.</p>

<p>Though now depowered, the Blob's mutant physiology granted him a number of advantages. He had superhuman strength and great resistance to physical injury. The Blob's highly elastic blubbery skin had proven to be difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine_%28comics%29.html" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine's</a> claws; though with sufficient force the claws could lacerate his flesh. On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by Cyclops was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. He could also alter his personal <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> field to make him virtually immovable, although an incredible force could uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he was standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to lift the Blob against his wishes are the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incredible_Hulk_6232.html" title="Incredible Hulk">Incredible Hulk</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_Guy_bdac.html" title="Strong Guy">Strong Guy</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossus.html" title="Colossus">Colossus</a> (Uncanny X-Men #206). Despite his morbidly obese appearance, his agility was the same as that of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently caught his opponents by surprise.</p>
<p>The Blob had superhuman strength which had greatly increased over the years, in a manner very similar to that of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing_%28comics%29.html" title="Thing (comics)">Thing</a>. This improvement was said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.</p>
<p>What few weaknesses the Blob did have mostly circumvented his physical resistance. He was able to be injured by attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth and ears did not have the same blubbery protection as the rest of his body. Dukes was susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation. The Blob could also be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. He could be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense body mass it would require a great deal.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Universe_2345.html" title="Ultimate Universe">Ultimate Universe</a>, Blob is again a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. His powers work in the same manner as his <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth-616.html" title="Earth-616">Earth-616</a> counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the <i><a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_X_bf49.html" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a></i> saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly and is often seen browsing the internet or talking to people via instant messaging. One such incident led to Blob pretending to be a model/physics expert named Naomi and cyber seducing <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_%28comics%29.html" title="Beast (comics)">Beast</a> - leading to the discovery of Magneto's survival and, eventually, to the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_War_4e9f.html" title="Ultimate War">Ultimate War</a> saga.
