<p>Prior to my edits (sorry, i wasn't logged in) some pro-furry had placed some sneaky stuff into the "topical issues" covered in bloom county section.</p>
<p>The creepy furry bit was where Opus' and Lola Granola's "inter-species relationship" was one of these "topical issues." Let me be very clear: there is nothing topical about having sex with animals. Except, of course, if you're a furry. Anyway, their relationship was more likely a metaphor for inter-racial relationships, or if it wasn't a metaphor, then it certainly wasn't topical.</p>
<p>I then snipped the bit about kids role-playing because the link was to RPGs with structure and the like, not the "playing pretend" that occured in the strip. Not once did a 20-sided die appear in any strip I ever read.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know about the "role-playing" link, but I distinctly remember a strip in which Opus, as personals editor of the newspaper, took down an ad from a woman seeking a relationship with a "small, flightless waterfoul", or something to that effect. It's in "Bloom County Babylon", IIRC. I have no idea if this was Lola Granola, nor was it "discussed at length." Can someone confirm who or what Lola Granola was? Are there even different races of penguins? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephBarillari_83cd.html" title="User:JosephBarillari">jdb ❋</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephBarillari_0a57.html" title="User talk:JosephBarillari">talk</a>) 01:31, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are there different races of penguins? Oddly enough, this comes up in bloom county when one day someone (I think it was milo) tells opus he looks more like a puffin.</p>
<p>My major point of contention, however, was to keep furries from sneaking the implication that fucking animals is somehow a topical matter. I'm far less atached to the term I replaced it with, "inter-racial." I welcome everyone who has a different non-furry interpretation of the lola granola matter to change it as they see fit.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin.html" title="Penguin">penguins</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/f/Puffin.html" title="Puffin">puffins</a> are not even very closely related, as birds go. That's irrelevant, of course.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, I don't think there's a <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry.html" title="Furry">furry</a> conspiracy going on here. That phrasing had been in the article since its original version, and I've always taken it as a joke, and kind of a clever one. Since it's been called out now, and this is Wikipedia, it has to go. The solution, however, is not to claim that the months long, much built-up engagement between Opus and Lola Granola at the height of the strip's popularity, was somehow about inter-racial relationships. It was <i>funny</i>, because he's a <i>penguin</i>, but he walks around and talks like a person, and everyone accepts it, so when he wants to get married, why shouldn't he marry a person? We're playing with narrative conventions in comic strips here, not talking about race relations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are moments in Bloom County where species is used as a metaphor for race, for example when Hodge-Podge is upset to learn that Portnoy is a Groundhog. More often, species is distinguished from race, as when Opus sings "Penguin State of Mind". Interracial dating comes up when Binkley is in love with Blondie, but it's not "discussed at length".</dd>

<p>One characteristic of zealots is that they typically lack a sense of humor or any understanding of the nature of satire: They take everything literally. You have nearly gotten to the nub of the issue: Opus <i>is not a penguin</i>, any more than Dogbert is a dog or Bugs Bunny is a bunny. Opus is a human that's <i>drawn like</i> a penguin (sort of). Using animal caricatures and giving them human characteristics is an old literary style. I gather that these "furries" are somehow trying to push the idea that the strip is literally sanctioning bestiality. Well, to cross-quote Scott Adams and P.T. Barnum, "There's an idiot born every minute". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:01, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I don't see any evidence than any "furry" has ever had anything to do with this entry, or has advanced any argument about Bloom County having anything to do with furry culture. I'm sorry, no. Someone misread a <i>joke</i> as a "furry pushing the idea that BC was promoting bestiality". In fact, there is no such furry. The idea that inter-species relationships was a topical issue dealt with in Bloom County was merely silly. A one-off joke. Regarding idiots and minutes, on the other hand, you have my agreement. <a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a> 18:35, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Aha. I think I get it now. Maybe <i>I'm</i> the idiot... Don't answer that. &gt;:) So the reference was basically a joke, and someone else misinterpreted it, and on it went, and it's probably just as well to take it out. I can dig it. Anyway, being a naive sort, I'm <i>assuming</i>, but don't know for sure, that the term "furry" refers to someone who believes in bestiality. Well, at least there's the hope that they <i>won't reproduce</i>, eh? &gt;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:51, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What the word "<a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry</a>" refers to is stranger than anything in Bloom County or on this talk page. It's not bestiality so much as... something very odd. Spend enough time in the wrong places online, and you begin running into furries, <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">otherkin</a> and all sorts of... well, all sorts. <a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a> 01:44, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree with the decision to restore the original endtime plot info. There isn't enough background information contained in this page for the paragraph to exist and make sense to an outsider (imagine how "Donald Trump in the body of Bill the Cat" sounds to an outsider and you'll see my point). Plus, it just didn't seem to fit after the mention of both spinoff strips, and it didn't flow well with the wording style of the rest of the section. --<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamite_XI_c221.html" title="User:Dynamite XI">Dynamite Eleven</a> 23:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it could perhaps be integrated better, but I like the idea of an ending summary that doesn't really give away anything and followed by a more detailed rendition. To be honest, I'm an outsider because I don't know much about Bloom County beyond reading some of the strips, but the detailed ending interested me, and captured some of the unusual action in the strip. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransUtopian_743a.html" title="User:TransUtopian">TransUtopian</a> 06:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, what I would like to see done with this page is have it turned into a well-detailed and well put together page something like the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_and_Hobbes_386b.html" title="Calvin and Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a> page. Such a page would not only be more than able to accomodate detailed Bloom County endtime material like the original, but would also look pretty darn cool. But as the page is at present, the original info just didn't seem to fit with the information already given in the rest of the article above it. --<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamite_XI_c221.html" title="User:Dynamite XI">Dynamite Eleven</a> 19:30, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi:</p>
<p>The strip was very topical and newcomers to the strip (I am NOT getting older!) probably wouldn't get a lot of the humour without footnotes. Given the length that the strip ran, from 1980 to 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell, I can't imagine a huge encyclopaedia of additional material needs to be added, just examples of how the strip handled some material, say Michael Jackson's nose or the rise of home computing.</p>
<p><br />
Oh yeah, one more thing. As far as I know, he was the first in the US strips to regularly include 'photocopied' material, say when Michael Jackson appeared.</p>

<p>I gave you the scan of an entire Steve/Bobbi/Opus strip, but I really beg to differ as to the last image of Steve Dallas toward the end of the article being unnecessary. Look at Wikipedia articles for strips such as <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_and_Hobbes_386b.html" title="Calvin and Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></i> or a TV show like <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> - lots of pictures are included, and most major characters are represented by an image. Steve Dallas was a major figure in this strip from beginning to end, and I think a picture of him deserves inclusion in this article. I'm restoring it. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastic_editor_1eff.html" title="User:Plastic editor">relaxathon</a> 04:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As long as we're talking images, here, I believe that this article needs more actual strips. At present, we have 2 book covers, a small strip excerpt, and (just recently) a picture of Steve Dallas. While it's nice to show the various characters, it's also important to show an actual strip.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, I've taken the liberty of re-introducing the <b>Opus' Last Birthday in Bloom County</b> image into the article. I moved the book cover to the list of compilations.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would again argue that the cover of the 'Loose Tails' collection makes a far more appropriate header image. It's fully legible at a reduced size and features most of the main characters; not to mention that this is the norm for famous comic strips' articles on Wikipedia: either a good representative cover from one of the strip's treasuries, or some other clear image of it's principle character(s). See <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Far_Side_6f1e.html" title="The Far Side">The Far Side</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_and_Hobbes_386b.html" title="Calvin and Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield.html" title="Garfield">Garfield</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/o/o/Boondocks.html" title="Boondocks">Boondocks</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilbert.html" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/o/o/Doonesbury.html" title="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a></i>, and many others.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You may also notice how rare it is for an entire strip to be featured on Wikipedia, partly because it walks a much finer line between the educational purposes of this site and full-on copyright violation. Not to mention how hard it is for Wiki contributors to agree on a single puchline worthy of inclusion... --72.224.153.104 17:26, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I removed it because <i>it didn't go well in the section that it was placed into</i>. Where the image is right now (<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloom_County_e768.html#Notable_storylines" title="Bloom County">Notable storylines</a>), a more suitable image should be placed (something having to do with, well, one of the storylines...maybe a panel from a strip or something). I'd rather have that picture of Steve in the characters section, but Milo's already taking up a lot of space there. --<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynamite_XI_c221.html" title="User:Dynamite XI">Dynamite Eleven</a> 16:22, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I guess that I was considering it in the more abstract notion that Steve figures into so many of the storylines described in the section, but I see your point. Maybe this article could have meatier character descriptions, allowing for a few more thumbnails to fit up there? Individual pages are all good, but theres also something to be said for a comprehensive article that doesn't require a casual reader to click into so many sub-pages.</dd>

<dd>But anyway, you were right, I replaced the Steve image with something more appropriate. --72.224.153.104 17:32, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
