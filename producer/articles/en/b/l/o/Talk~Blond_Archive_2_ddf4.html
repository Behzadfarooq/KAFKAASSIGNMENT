<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blonds and Fertility</span></h2>
<p>A television show informed me earlier that blond hair is a biological sign of fertility in adults, and suggested the possibility that this might be the cause of blonds being seen, traditionally, as attractive. The television show was hardly a reliable authority on this; has anyone else heard that theory? 82.69.37.32 11:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The photo currently at the top of the photo is clearly a dye-job. Just look at the dark eyebrows! I, for one, think that articles on hair color should have pictures of people whose hair is naturally that color. --68.239.204.54 00:26, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The girl in that picture still has dyed hair. No doubt she is a blonde of some form, but her eyebrow colour suggests she is more an ash blonde than a pale blonde as depicted. I will work on getting some pictures of family as we all have varying shades of blonde. It would be cool to show the different shades. I myself have honey blonde hair, but will have to find a picture that doesn't show too much of my face as I really don't want to be on the Net. --Beckie S</dd>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: I am a natural blonde and my eyebrows are dark... you can tell my hair is natural because it has many tones.. i.e. it's darker underneath and sunkissed on top. It goes darker in winter and the sun makes it light again in the summer. It was very white until I was 7 and is still blonde now. I am over 40 - but not out!&#160;;o) oh yeah and I have a degree... but I am a bit dizzy sometimes! I have very dark skin too (I am a natural blonde with dark eyebrows and dark golden skin!) I have English-French-East European roots.</p>

<dd>I am not convinced that these two women are natural blondes. But although some may dislike the idea, why not suggest a male person? Here is a German actor who is definitely blond, and very much so: <a href="http://www.daserste.de/heimat3/darsteller_dyn~darsteller,291~cm.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.daserste.de/heimat3/darsteller_dyn~darsteller,291~cm.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.daserste.de/heimat3/darsteller_dyn~darsteller,291~cm.asp</a> It's Uwe Steimle from Eastern Germany, well known as actor and cabaret artiste. Hopefully, there is no copyright issue here, but I gave you the reference, and the wikipedia image of Uwe Steimle is quite bad.</dd>

<dd>I completely agree. The "natural blonde" photo, with the tan skin, black eyebrows and dark brown roots is most deffinately not a Nordic woman. Also the two pictures listed in the first one, that is also a dye job, and the second one looks like a person with natural light bown hair. Considering that natural blonde people make up 2% of the worlds population, finding a picture on one really would be hard to find!</dd>

<dd>About the dark eyebrows... I know some blond Scandinavians with EXTREMELY dark eyebrows and they've never dyed their hair. They also seem to have dark facial hair as well. In fact, this seems to be common among many natural blonds I am aquainted with. Can anyone explain it?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, some blondes have dark eyebrows. I myself have light golden brown ones compared to my rather drastically lighter hair. Nowadays lots of blondes can have darker skin as well due to the fact that genes are so mixed and skin and hair pigment levels can vary. My sister is blonde and tans very well, whereas I am peaches and cream fair skinned. Being Scandinavian in ancestry myself, I can say that my sister carries more of our part Saami genes than I do and many Nords are Saami-mixed these days. However, there IS a difference between dark eyebrows as a result of darkening ash or golden blonde hair and dark eyebrows of a brunette. Eyebrow hair is thicker on average than scalp hair and will appear darker on almost everyone. However, the picture displayed is that of a Brazilian model who is known for dyeing her hair many colours and most often has bleached platinum locks. While she may be a darker blonde of some sort, I highly doubt that frosted blonde she is sporting in the picture is her natural colour. Beckie S.--07:01, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What was wrong with the picture of Marilyn Monroe? Isn't she the iconic blonde in Anglo-American culture?</p>

<dd>Marilyn Monroe was actually a natural redhead, but her bottle blonde has set quite a standard for North American blondes, as fake as it may be. Most natural blondes don't have platinum or bleached looking locks.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Picture. Blonde VS. Albinism</span></h2>
<p>WTF?! who deleted the picture of the boy with platinum blond hair that I had?-<a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusboy_4eb4.html" title="User:Busboy">busboy</a> 03:12, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wasn't the one who deleted it but I can imagine it was due to the fact that the boy did not have platinum blonde hair, but white hair due to albinism. The picture was also featured on the page for albinism in humans. Despite that someone said in here that they think light blonde hair/people are a type of albinism, albinism and being blonde are two VERY different things. A blonde person lacks pigment ethnicically and can pass down these colors. It is very possible for a person of northern European descent to be born so extremely fair that they have pale skin, white hair and blue eyes and NOT be albino. Albinism is a genetic defect that both normal colored parents must have and pass on to a child. If that child has children one day, unless they have children with someone else carrying the albino gene, their children have normal coloring. Same can not be said for the pale blonde person. So I can only imagine that was the only reason the picture was taken down, but I'm NOT possotive on the motive because I didn't remove it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But I do stand by albinism not being the same as being born blonde.&#160;;) Being blonde is not a form of albinism.</p>
<p>Actually, depending on which type of blonde you are talking about it is. The yellow-haired toddler on this page has OCA2 or a subtype of OCA1 in conjunction with ocular albinism. It is even said on the albinism page that, people with albinism can have dirty blonde or light brown hair. Various subtypes of OCA1&amp;2 exist mostl among whites, scince all blondes are some type of albino.<a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusboy_4eb4.html" title="User:Busboy">busboy</a> 16:50, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, not depending on what type of "blonde" I am talking about, being born ethnically blonde and being born ALBINO are not the same thing. There is a difference between a "blonde" person and a "person with blonde hair." A person of African ancestry can have albinism and have blonde, or even white hair, (and rarer cases of red) and still not be a "blonde". And there is a HUGE difference between occular albinism (the dirty blonde/light brown hair you're talking about which only affects their eyes and not their skin and hair) and occulocutaneous albinism. Having blonde hair means you have Scandanavian ancestry, no matter what nationally you are, even if your family has lived in Japan for x amount of generations and you consider yourself Japanese. Albinism is a condition. No, all blondes are not some type of albino, please understand the difference between pigment (think of it as contrast) and melanin (think of it as hue/saturation, what makes red hair red and blonde hair yellow), and that albinism is a condition which must be diognosed by an eye doctor (sometimes even as late as 18 people are diagnosed). I know a few blonde people I can take to an eye doctor and they can have perfectly normal eyes, no matter what color, or even if they are near/far sited and still not have the condition known as albinism.</dd>
</dl>
<p>X-posted to albinism for humans.</p>
<p>The same reason a blonde person is not an albino, is similar to why a maltese is not an albino dog, or why whites aren't albinos, however,the thing that causes them to be fair haired is directly related to albinism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"How can a gene that tells someones DNA to produce little to no pigment in the hair and a certain type of melanin to turn the hair yellow be related to a genetic defect condition in which the person has no pigment or melanin at all? That is not the same. Blonde hair evolved when people started moving away from Africa and no longer needed pigment and began to migrate to other areas less hot/receiving straight UVA/UVB rays from the sun. They dropped the pigment because they no longer needed it, not because they picked up some form of albinism. This theory seems to be more of your own with disgarding a few scientific facts."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The same thing that causes blacks to have blonde hair, is the same thing that causes whites to have blonde hair, A type of albinism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It's not unusual for a white person to have blonde hair. It is unusual for a black person to have blonde hair since most people of African ancestry have either dark brown or black hair. This (having natural blonde hair) is usually attributed to perhaps mixed lineage or the condition occulocutaneous albinism, or even when a form of malnutrition can turn the hair different colours. You act as if it is perfectly normal for a black person to have blonde hair and though I have seen people of African ancestry with natural red hair because of mixed parenting, I have never seen one as a natural blonde though I have seen dyed blonde hair and extensions."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Consider this: Africans(albinos) were actually the first ones to have blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I cringed at this one. You have either not taken a few science classes or chose to diliberately disagree. I think you have your own personal opinion here, and I'm vaguely familiar with this theory "Africans use to be white, blonde haired and blue eyed and then turned black". Africans are not albinos since albinism is a condition, not representing a whole nationality like you have here. People moved out of African and into different parts of the Eastern hemisphere and developed different characteristics. They lost their pigment because they did not need it, not gained it. Blonde hair and blue eyes is one of the last things that humans attained when they began to move to the northern lattitudes of Scandanavia, not the earliest and certainly not the first. Red hair is actually more "recent" than blonde. There aren't many blue eyed blonde people in Africa, and if so, it's probably because they came from Europe a few hundred years ago (South Africa and England for example) not because they were there first."</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are using "blonde" here as a euphamism for "white", when blonde hair is technically race non-specific.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The entire world attributes blonde hair to white people. It's not a secret. People all over the world of all races dye their hair blonde, yet usually when a girl of Japanese ancestry is born with natural blonde hair it's because she has mixed parenting. I have even seen an African-American with blue eyes, but he's not ashamed to say because one of this parents/grandparents was "white." These things are not unusual for "white" people, yet considered unusual when blonde hair turns up in other places. Hmmm, wonder why that is. Again, the entire world attributes it to white people."</dd>
</dl>
<p>We deem the name "albino" to those with OCA1, however,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"No, obviously you don't know much about albinism at all since OCA1 is just ONE form of albinism. There are nine others. All of whom under the condition are considered to be people with albinism."</dd>
</dl>
<p>scince albinism is fairly common,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Like 1 in every 17,000 common?"</dd>
</dl>
<p>it is logical to say yellow blondes(like the toddler)have a type of albinism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A blonde toddler with yellow hair is not the same thing as a toddler with OCA1 with WHITE hair."</dd>
</dl>
<p>(P.S) Blonde hair does not mean you have scandinavian in you, as some italians do, and italians have black blood in them. And pure africans can have blonde hair to.<s><a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusboy_4eb4.html" title="User:Busboy">busboy</a> 23:36, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd><s>"Ever heard of immigration? That just about solves everything you said. Two black people from Africa can go to Ireland, have a baby and the baby would be considered Irish because that is the country the baby was born in. Doesn't mean that somewhere down the line the baby didn't have African ancestry. Blonde hair evolved in the latitudes we call Scandanavia, because it needed that region to be so far up in the Arctic circle for he hair to turn yellow because of the little UVA/UVB rays. Doesn't mean you won't find blonde people in Africa or Brazil, just means their ancestors came earlier from Scandanavia (or jumped from there to Europe and then to other place, ect.). The proper term for these fair skinned, blonde haired people would actually be Nordic, but that has a bad rep. due to some supremists, but it's actually a scientific term. If what you said happened normally and that people could not trace blonde hair to such attributes because it was so normal for it to pop up anywhere, then you would not have people who bother to study genetics. Your equation doesn't add up and some of the things you said are highly uneducated. Again, not sure where you're coming from, but most of this sounds like your opinion, like how Africans are really white blue eyed blonde people, which completely disagrees with science. I won't argue your opinion, I'll just argue for all the facts out there that being blonde is not a form of occulocutaneous albinism, and even if some people with albinism have blonde hair (and their parents both had brown), it doesn't mean they enherrited it from two parents with a recessive gene. Albinism is a condition."</s></dd>

<dd><s>I think, you are completely wrong when you state that a person with blond hair has scandinavian ancestors and that blond hair evolved in Scandinavia. I think, it is vice versa. Blond people (that were common all over Germania) migrated to Scandinavia and not the other way round. Moreover, hasn't it been often remarked that people in northern Sweden are less often blond than more down to the South of Sweden? Otherwise, give us evidence that blondes evolved in Scandinavia and spread from there! And let's not forget, many, many Russians have extremely blond hair and are blue-eyed and I am not convinced that all this started in Scandinavia, it ended there, maybe, yes.</s></dd>

It is very, very common for dark haired (European) parents to have blond children, firstly (and that is not my main argument here) because children usually have ligh(er) hair, but also secondly because either of the parents obviously carries a genetic feature for "blondness". This has absolutely zero to do with a genetic defect! And yes, there is usually no difference whatsoever in the status of such a child (should it keep on being blond later in his lifetime) as as blond as compared to the child of two blond parents. No need to talk about defects, but surely there seems to be a need to take a good lesson in genetics!&#160;;-)</s></dd>

<dd><s>"Um, no. See Human genetic variation. While the core human genome almost certainly derives ultimately from Africa, the origin of the so-called "races" doesn't have anything to do with albinism, and "white people" are largely a western-migratory split-off of central Asians mingled with older Pre-Indo-European populations who may have been in Europe since the last Ice Age (depending on which theory you prefer, both Asians and indigenous paleolithic Europeans were descended from different groups migrating out of Africa, or even the "native" Europeans may have been descended from an earlier west-moving group of Asians). "Caucasian" people are, like the Japanese and other north Asians, lighter-skinned than equatorial peoples apparently because they simply don't need the sun protection, and thus over a long period of time evolved away from producing what for them would have been excessive amounts of melanin pigment. Cf. genetically caucasoid populations in southern India, who are much darker than Europeans generally and even than many northern (cooler climate) Indic populations. Compare also the skin tone of Polynesians, ethnic Filipinos and others farther east and south to that of central-east Asians in China; the complexion of Amazonian Natives to that of North American First Nations, etc. Basically, the closer you get to the equator (when speaking of populations who have been indigenous since prehistory), the darker the skin tone is, to protect against the more direct UV radiation of the sun (there are always exceptions of course - Australian Aboriginals are quite a bit more southerly than equatorial Africans but quite dark when not hybridized with European genes; but they also colonized an area that is basically a desert, with little cloud cover for most of the year). Personally I don't think anyone has an adequate theory yet why certain populations become much paler than others, such as Scandinavians and true Russians (by which I mean ethnic Russians in the area historically known as Russia, not Soviets or Russian Federation citizens in general, who are from a wide variety of ethnicities) - despite being commonly thought of as "extra-White" they have even more definitively Asian genes, on average, than most other Euopeans due to historical invasions of Huns, Avars, Tatars, etc. See also the Japanese who on average are paler than Koreans at roughly the same latitude (and especially see the Ainu, a unique and even paler ethinicity that lingers in a few places in modern Japan). Native North Americans have lived at climes just as temperate-to-cold and northerly as the aforementioned groups for seemingly about as long a period of time, but are uniformly darker than the Old World populations. The climate effect is clearly just one factor among many, with gene dominance being the prevailing one. If you sent a million Irish to a desert-and-jungle planet and a million Congolese to an ice planet, I do not believe that if you returned in fifty thousand years you'd find they'd traded skin tones. Rather, they'd probably both be a medium color, on the way to evolving to suit their environment better, and most of their non-hue-related ethic features would remain unchanged (though probably not all of them - some traits are probably genetically linked to others.) And to come full circle, the albinism gene woud not have helped those on the ice planet in evolving toward producting less melanin - the albinism gene almost certainly causes too many problems for it to be naturally selected for - the vision deficits easily cancel out, in surivability terms, the benefits of not wasting bodily resources generating unneeded pigment. Would an "anti-albino" hyperpigmentation gene do well on the hot planet? Dunno. I have not read up on hypermelanism at all, so I don't know if comes with any negative side effects the way albinism does, and it is (as a genetic disorder; I'm not speaking of an ethic tendency toward a darker shade that some other ethnicity) very rare in humans anyway, much more so than albinism." — SMcCandlish [talk] [contrib] ツ 10:50, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<dd><s>Interesting post. Your basically saying natural selection is at work which takes a long time, but see this article for a discussion of sexual selection as a way to explain why blond's appeared so recently in the human record in Europe. If a culture values blond hair (or light skin - not sure if they always go together), this gives those who are naturally blond a reproductive advantage, which can spread a trait very rapidly, in particular among small isolated populations. I would say this could only occur in northern latitudes because no culture near the equator would value blond hair and light skin simply because it is a disadvantage (skin cancer). -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 14:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>
