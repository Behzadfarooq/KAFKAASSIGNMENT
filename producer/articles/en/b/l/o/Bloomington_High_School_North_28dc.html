<p>Bloomington High School North is noted for its academic achievement in several areas. It has consistently ranked in the 95th percentile in <a href="../../../a/c/t/ACT_90d9.html" title="ACT">ACT</a>, <a href="../../../p/s/a/PSAT_c4f5.html" title="PSAT">PSAT</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/SAT_684e.html" title="SAT">SAT</a> scores, well above the Indiana state average.
