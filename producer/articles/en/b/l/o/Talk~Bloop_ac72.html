<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Talk%7EBloop_ac72.html" title="Edit section: Gas bubble?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gas bubble?</span></h2>
<p>I've listened to the Bloop recording and it hardly resembles a biological sound. In fact, it sounds like a very large air-bubble escaping its former confines. I've seen some recent Scientific studies on The Science Channel that energy companies are researching alternative energy sources (Methane) and that some of these sources could derive from the ocean floor. So, it would be possible to build a theory that these noises are gigantic methane burps eminating from the Earth's crust. --Bourbon King 20:08, 13 July 2005 (UTC)Bourbon King--Bourbon King 20:08, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that scientist are very aware of gas rising from the bottom of the ocean. The sound file that has been made available has been speeded up also, and I think scientist have an idea of what makes that sound biological and they base their assumptions on some other information concerning oceanic life. The sound could be from bubbles, but perhaps bubbles caused by an animal. And I think Wikipedia is no place to build up new theories about the phenomeon but to inform about existing theories.
<dl>
<dd>Oh, it does sound a bit like a bubble. But keep in mind that the various recordings you'll find on the net are sped up at least 16x. I've heard a slower version, and it doesn't sound like anything at all. Remember, these are very low frequency recordings. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadix_5c9e.html" title="User:Radix">Radix</a> 15:12, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah, on the NOAA link, it says that the recording was sped up.</p>
<p>I'm fairly cetain that scientists may have considered the revolutionary "maybe it's a bubble?" theory. So on one hand we hand we have presumably well-funded and educated specialists with experience in the field and the correct instruments, and on the other we have some guy who downloaded a sound file from the net. Ummmm.... (Falcore)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As of today, these well-funded and (supposedly) well-educated specialists haven't drawn to any conclusions, as the article points out they are OPEN to any suggestions which tells me that anybody's guess is as good as their well-funded ones. That hardly merits them as "gifted" in my book. LOL ---</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Anybody's guess is as good as their well-funded ones." Wrong! These people know more about what's going on down there than a random "anybody." They're aware it IS something different, but just because they don't have a clue of what it could possibly be it doesn't mean their opinions are as valid as any other. You can't try to make a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_unified_theory.html" title="Grand unified theory">grand unified theory</a> if you don't know anything of <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, and just because physicists are battling to find one for years it doesn't mean theirs are just as good as yours would be. So, a good theory is backed up with data and knowledge, and these people have it, so their theories are better. ☢ <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKieff_55f7.html" title="User:Kieff"><span style="letter-spacing:1px"><span style="font-size:110%">Ҡ</span><i>i</i>∊<i><span style="vertical-align:-0.2em;font-size:110%">ff</span></i></span></a><span style="font-size:120%">⌇</span><a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKieff_8631.html" title="User talk:Kieff"><span style="font-size:110%">↯</span></a> 05:57, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm removing the Furthur Trivia section, which states "The geographic coordinates of the sound were, interestingly, somewhat close to those of the lost city of R'lyeh from H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu stories." To me, this is completely errelevant, as there are millions of fictional works, and probably every coordinate on Earth has been described in at least one of them. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMickeyK_5749.html" title="User:MickeyK">MickeyK</a> 22:35, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can definitely see your point, but it does seem relevant to <i>some</i> people (<i>v.</i> the dedicated Bloop page) so I think it's worth mentioning, especially as mere trivia.

<p>Uh, hi. Not sure if I'm doing this right. First time contributing, I'll get an account later. Anyway, since it was asked, I checked my copy of the 'Call of Cthulhu' story (from 'The Best of H.P. Lovecraft', 1982 Ballantine Books). The exact quote is 'and in S. Latitude 47[degrees] 9', W. Longitude 126 [degrees] 43', come upon a coastline...' Not knowing much about geography, I have no idea how close that is to the bloop.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks! That's very useful.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>50 S 100 W compared to 47 S 126 W? *researches nautical miles about* Well, that's a small but countable number of miles/kilometers off. But then, how big is R'lyeh?&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Since the subject matter is so mysterious, it's fun to know stuff like this. It would be worth working out exactly how far off the signal is, though, and putting that instead of 'somewhat close'. Much more informative. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 02:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the reference to the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blooper.html" title="Blooper">blooper</a> enemies of SMB, due to the fact that they appeared before 1997 and the bloop itself.</p>

<p>It seems to me that a rational thought towards investigating this, especially since it was heard several times in a local area, would be to possibly send something to search the area? Did no one send anyone or anything to the place to see if they could find anything? Has the area been searched since then?</p>
<p>As for being an animal or something, I don't know. You'd think we'd have heard it again, it has been almost a decade. Whatever it was, and assuming it hasn't been repeated or anything, we can assume it was some special event that hasn't occured since, or before(or at least in the past of the sensors involved).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Talk%7EBloop_ac72.html" title="Edit section: Odd Article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Odd Article</span></h2>
<p>Some of the wording in this article is ambiguous or incomplete; it would be nice for the original author to go back and do a re-edit. For instance, this is from the article: "The Bloop, although it sounded like a blue whale, originated 4,800 km away, seemingly ruling out any known marine animal."</p>
<p>4,800 km away from what? I can only assume they meant the sensors that recorded the sound. Why does it rule out any known marine animal? Is it too deep? Too far from shore? Or does it mean that because the sound was so loud from so far away, it must have been something bigger than any known animal? I can only assume. This is an extremely ambiguous statement.</p>
<p>Some of the question about the trivia section discussed above would have been answered as well if it was mentioned WHY this is significant. Of course, as is stated in the discussion above, probably every single location on earth has been mentioned in a book somewhere before.</p>
<p>But how many books have mentioned a specific longitudal location of an ancient sleeping sea monster, and then, in real life, a mysterious noise is recorded underwater, which some scientists speculate may be from a huge animal, very close to the same position named in the book? I think that's very relevant. It should have been explained in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>50 S 100 W compared to 47 S 126 W: approx. 1000 nautical miles apart, i.e nowhere near, not "very close" (roughly 2000 Kilometers distant). It is as remarkable a coincidence as someone writing about strange lights in the sky over the southern tip of Italy and then something unexplainable being recorded over London a few generations later. Put a 2000Km wide circle on the globe and you're bound to find something to 'tally up' in the covered area, especially if you add several decades either way as an extra dimension, and then include works of fiction as another. 81.178.114.172 17:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
