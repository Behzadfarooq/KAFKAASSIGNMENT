<p>This proposal, based on <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:550">BugZilla bug 550</a>, aims to introduce a new level of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking</a> that would reduce the level of collateral damage done by blocking certain IP addresses, while at the same time reducing vandalism by allowing blocking anonymous editing from specific IP addresses that can't be satisfactorily blocked at present.</p>
<p>At present we have 2 kinds of blocks, one by username, the other by IP. The IP block locks out everybody, even logged-in users. This causes situations like <a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.167.234.2.html" title="User talk:209.167.234.2">this</a>, <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.171.198.6.html" title="User talk:62.171.198.6">this</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.180.83.6.html" title="User talk:202.180.83.6">this</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/6/User_talk%7E206.15.239.253.html" title="User talk:206.15.239.253">this</a>, and <a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.156.6.54.html" title="User talk:202.156.6.54">this</a>.</p>
<p>When I blocked an IP the other day I received this email response:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is the third time this happens. That IP is used by Datastream, the only ADSL provider of my country, Malta. It is used as a gateway and actual IPs are different. By blocking that IP you have blocked all ADSL users in my country! Now while I recognize there's some moron vandalizing pages, you have to find some way to get to his REAL IP not the ADSL gateway!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This could be prevented if we could allow the user to log in and still edit.</p>

<p>Blocking IP addresses commonly associated with vandalism that are also used by good users, but allowing logged in users to still use that IP address.</p>

<p>This new form of blocking will only affect specific IP addresses, most obviously will be AOL, which would almost certainly be blocked due to the level of vandalism.</p>
<p>There will be two main consequences of this; 1) Vandalism will be reduced as we can block them more effectively, 2) Good editors will no longer be blocked just for using the same IP address as a vandal.</p>

<p><b>1)</b> Some more determined vandals will simply make a user account if the IP address is blocked, and carry on vandalising Wikipedia, solutions to this problem include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Only allowing approved user accounts to be made on blocked IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Pros: Adds a human element into the process, thus making it more accurate in most cases.</dd>
<dd>Cons: We need to find people to approve these accounts.
<dl>
<dd>Possible solution: Allow all already-registered users to approve accounts.
<dl>
<dd>Pros: Makes sure that there are always people who can approve.</dd>
<dd>Pros: May help establish links between longstanding accounts and vandals.</dd>
<dd>Cons: Makes it possible (although hard) to get around the block for vandals.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Place hurdles on the creation of new user accounts from blocked IP addresses:
<ul>
<li>Putting a time delay on new user accounts from the blocked IP address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Pros: Potential contributors on blocked ips can make accounts and continue editing.</dd>
<dd>Cons: Potential contributors may be deferred and not willing to wait, determined vandals may be willing to wait.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to solve a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captcha.html" title="Captcha">captcha</a>, either when creating a new account or occasionally when saving a page from a blocked IP (or both). Brion Vibber is currently adding captcha code to MediaWiki (to impede link spamming) which could be used for this purpose. This solution could also be combined with the time delay solution if either is considered too weak to be sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Pros and Cons: Similar to time delay proposal.</dd>
<dd>Additional pro: Prevents bots from using shared/anonymous IPs.</dd>
<dd>Additional con: Captchas can cause major accessibility problems.</dd>
<dd>Additional con: Captchas don't stop non-automated vandalisation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Ask for a valid email address.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Pros: Requires no extra work, will stop all but most determined vandals.</dd>
<dd>Cons: un-wiki?</dd>
<dd>Additional con: Like captchas, some legitimate users will be unable to pass this stage</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing. These vandals would have been vandalising wikipedia anyway, at least this way we can block their new user accounts (unlike before where we couldn't realistically block them at all). Possibly we could have a separate <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_newusers_2b1e.html" title="Special:Log/newusers">Special:Log/newusers</a> page which lists new user accounts from blocked IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Pros: Least work to implement</dd>
<dd>Cons: Easier for vandals to get around IP blocks.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>2)</b> Some good users will be forced to log in.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A price worth paying. At the moment some good users are blocked just for using the same IP as vandals.</dd>

<dd>after 138 votes it's <b>63-70-6</b>... so that on the main question of whether to have a softer form of blocking it's <b>134-6</b>.

<dd>After 138 votes it's clear that the community supports the proposal. So it's probably a bad idea to do any more "pile-on" voting.

<li><b>Support</b> Yes, definately. This would cut down massively on annoying schoolchildren vandalism, whilst allowing good users to edit with minimum fuss. I don't think that there should be restrictions on setting up accounts, as this would still cause problems in the example listed above, and most vandals wouldn't go to that trouble anyway.</li>

<li><b>Support</b> This one looks technically feasible and should cut down high-school vandalism considerably.

<li><b>Support</b> Good point by nae'blis above. Also, we should be more worried about preventing good users from signing up than dealing with vandalism; the whole basis of this proposal is to minimize collateral damage to good users, not to make them jump through hoops. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 17:20, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> When editing from my AOL dialup, I have on a good many occasions hit a block due to previous vandalism by anon users. Now I can and do unblock, previously I had to find an admin, or log out of aol and back on, and soemtimes even that didn't help.

<dl>
<dd>I just noticed a comment on the talk page, suggestiong that this new form of block would be used only in rare cases, and probably only after someone has complained about being the innocent victim of the sort of block we have now. In that case I see little point to this proposal. I support it <b>only</b> on the understanding that the new form, as a less drastic remady, would normally be used first, and a block of the current sort would be used only after that failed, or when theat was food reason to belive that it would not be effective in a particualr case. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:53, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> Yes, we need something like this so vandals can be blocked and good users can edit. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:02, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Definitely. No sense blocking people that don't need to be blocked. If they go so far as to create an account, that just brings it to the next level of security; a utility that tracks which usernames are on a blocked IP, and how long they've existed/how many edits they have, would be helpful for monitoring, I'm sure. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast_23ee.html" title="User:Radagast">Radagast</a> 22:37, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

I would also support the proposal below so long as one gets implemented. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">stianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">hablamé</a></sup> 09:34, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Support the creation of a new bolck type - I have been hit while editing from Internet cafes. I would also support the proposal below, but I think it would be better to do things one stage at a time: we can rediscuss the question of account creation if and when it is necessary. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> 17:25, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> I support this, especially as I just ran into someone with this problem on WikiEN-l. On the other hand, I hope the blocking admins don't use this as an excuse to just (for example) block all of AOL all the time just because it makes things a little easier (what I call the Beef Irradiation Problem). Make these blocks the standard ones, then if that doesn't work add the delay as per below, then if that doesn't work just block everything.<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiaparowits_0d73.html" title="User:Kiaparowits">Kiaparowits</a> 19:01, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> If viewed from the direction of "this proposal allows <i>legitimate</i> editors to edit when their otherwise <i>shared</i> IP has been tagged for vandalism" then it is a very very good, pro-Wiki idea. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">REDVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 14:09, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> My thinking is that content-based vandalism detection would be far more effective than editor-based methods such as this; however, among the options provided, I think that this one is the least onerous. I think it should be considered an interim solution and not a final one; to take a lesson from recent American History, no matter how high you build the levee, Nature will find a way around, under or through it ... and the discussion here is very much about building higher levees. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 00:52, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Absolutely. I actually proposed this same idea recently and only just discovered that this page already exists. Having special restrictions for accounts created from blocked IP's seemed sensible to me at first, but on pondering, it just seems to create a second class of wikizens unnecessarily, as many vandals will jump one or two hoops, but the curious contributor will just be turned off. Keeping a list of new users (under a week old, or with less than 10 article edits) made from these accounts, and tagging them accordingly in History/Recent Changes, can cut the extra patrolling overhead that might be created by vandals creating accounts when they normally wouldn't. <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhoenix-forgotten_5f18.html" title="User:Phoenix-forgotten">Phoenix-forgotten</a> 01:35, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> Having just been autoblocked for no other crime than being an AOL user for the third time this week, I am strongly inclined to support this proposal. If there are concerns about the details of its implementation (such as the provision of some kind of "hurdle"), those could always be developed over time by provisionally implementing the "simple" semi-blocking policy and adding "hurdles" later if they seem necessary. I am <i>not</i> in favor of doing nothing; it may be unusually bad for me as an AOL user, but my personal experience lately has been that the disruption due to collateral damage is actually becoming worse than the disruption due to vandalism that the blocking policy was intended to resolve <a href="../../../v/r/e/User%7EVremya_d4a9.html" title="User:Vremya">Vremya</a> 10:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Strict scrutiny" means that any measures instituted for security must address a compelling community interest, and must be narrowly tailored to achieve that objective and no other.</dd>

<li><b>Support</b> I am often blocked because I use a shared IP and someone else with the same IP keeps on vandalising Wikipedia. If we implement this change, we can block IPs more freely without worrying so much about collateral damage. As for vandals creating accounts, I will say that many vandals are just one-time pranksters, which will be stopped with the IP blocks. The more determined vandals are in the minority, and by forcing them to create accounts, the speed at which they can vandalise is decreased, and they are easier to track. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHildanknight_74fc.html" title="User:Hildanknight">J.L.W.S.

<dd>It is quite legitimate for people to edit from IP addresses. By allowing many IP wide blocks you are reducing peoples chance for anonymity, and therefore leaving them open to possible retribution from government or other organisations.

<dd>Anonymity of IPs is beside the point. The type of our Wikipedia account has nothing to do with preemptive wiretapping and routine censorship of your local Internet access. On the contrary, any editor who wants basic anonymity should set up an account, because edits from IPs (obviously) reveal retraceable IP information to the world. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 10:52, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

IP address blocks should be waived for logged in users, since they tend to be people committed to advancing the Wikipedia.

In that case I see little point to this proposal. I support it <b>only</b> on the understanding that the new form, as a less drastic remady, would normally be used first, and a block of the current sort would be used only after that failed, or when theat was food reason to belive that it would not be effective in a particualr case. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:53, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Because of one admin blocking one vandalism I could not edit for most of last night. This is not what wikipedia is supposed to do, so I vote for this NOT to block common IPs, but to allow registered users that wants to do real edits to actually do that. (and if anyone wonders that talk page have a warning not to block that IP unless really nessesary, but it was still blocked after one (or maybe two vandalsms). The block was changed from 48h to 24h by the original admin after my email (I think) and later reveted totally by a admin on the same IP.

<li><b>Support</b> Yes. I think this should be the default method of blocking anonymous vandals. I see no reason that the time delay couldn't be as much as 24hours, which would often be the case anyway if they found their ip address blocked. This would also allow problematic IP ranges to be blocked on a more permanent basis which would proabbly be more effective at stopping vandalism. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 11:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have voted on the section above as well, but implementing the right sort of a hurdle can significantly add to the value of the project. I don't like that captcha ideas, but the e-mail idea seems to be reasonable (we can forbid free E-mails here, the same way we forbid the open proxies), we can also use a $1 credit card transaction as in paypal, it is quite unlikely that a user have a hundreds of credit cards (the underaged can ask their parent to help them here). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">abakharev</a> 05:09, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - time delay hurdle only, any other hurdle would be a different rule than other new log-ins get - it they don't have to have email and they don't have to pay or submit credit card details - I really do not like that suggestion from abakharev. The time delay should come with a meaningful message to explain why and would of course only apply while the IP or IP range is being blocked. I think an hour is perhaps too long. The time hurdle runs contrary to the promise that "anyone can edit" but is probably necessary to slow down vandalism.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 21:13, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. The present system of blocking vandals only works for vandals that have a unique IP address. There needs to be some equivalent for those with a shared IP address. The fact is that if you have a unique address, then that information is in the Wiki system and can potentially be traced to your home/work computer. Users sharing an IP should be in the same situation of having some unique identifier in the Wiki system, an email address at the very least. This would mean a vandal would have to go to the trouble of getting another email address if they were blocked in order to create a new user name.

<li><b>Very strong Support</b> — My school is blocked as a repeated vandal as well, so I know how frustrating it is when you are locked out of editing with your own account because of someone else's idiocy. This policy would truly be helpful for many who are unfairly blocked from shared IPs. I would support a 1 hour delay, as it discourages casual vandals (albeit not determined ones), while providing an easily (in home conditions, not too hard in work conditions) performable condition the editor must fulfill if he doesn't already have an account —<a href="../../../u/e/d/User%7EUED77_0872.html" title="User:UED77">UED77</a> 01:03, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> I was made painfully aware of this due to a block which came due to one student out of 40,000 at my university <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ansell#QUT_Wide_proxy_block_isn.27t_reasonable.21" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ansell#QUT_Wide_proxy_block_isn.27t_reasonable.21" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Even as a registered user, I was not able to do anything. True, I could have gone to my technical department to have the one vandal looked at, even though they reverted their edits immediately after placing them and it would possibly be seen as wasting their time to present the same evidence that the blocking admin showed me. I think putting a slight hurdle up would deter such a non-intrusive vandal, while still allowing registered users to edit, that part is a non-negotiable for me. I do not see why the registered editors part of this proposal has not been accepted already, it has more than 90% consensus and is the part which is causing the pain for current editors. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 22:58, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. I like someone's idea of approved users. This would be a tier above anonymous or very new editors, but relatively easy to achieve, for instance it could be given automatically to any user registered for, say, over a month. However if such a user were to engage in vandalism, or act like a sockpuppet, any administrator could demote them back to pre-approved level. Regaining approved level would require a certain minimum number of good-faith edits and no bad. Any user would still be able to edit, but only approved users would be eligible to vote on AfD or to edit semi-protected pages. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 10:23, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support - kind of</b> Yes, but not TOO big a hurdle, it should still be possible to make the accounts. I have been really annoyed on IRC when people run through the same tonne of complaiunts about AOL vandalism, i've been through it a million times. here's how it goes: 1) somebody complains that there is a new AOL vandal on the loose b) somebody says we should range block him c) somebody DOES rangeblock him d) I complain line all hell that i can't edit e) block is lifted, reluctantly f) somebody says ALL aol IPs should be blocked indefinitely g) everyone offers their opinions (mainly in favour) h) i say how much collatoral damage it would cause i) everyone says let's do a survey and see how many AOL edits are vandalism j) i say that would be innacurate, because respected users of wikipedia would be logged in, so it wouldn't work k) the vandal finds out he's unblocked, and starts again l) somebody does a range block m) an administrator that uses aol lifts the block and tells everyone to shut up n) somebody changes the topic. My point is that every IP I have access to is always getting blocked, and i'm sick of the prejudice against AOL users, but, if we do implement this feature, admins will feel less guilt in blocking an IP for an extended amount of time, so the number of long-term blocks would go THROUGH THE ROOF!!!, and I just don't want us to be stopping legitimate users of AOL who don't have an account here to be kept from editing because there was some person a year ago who used that IP for the wrong thing. We do need to allow editors to edit when their IP is blocked, but let's not get liberal with the blocks because i'm worried that we will end up stopping anon newbies from joining us.

<dd>Flcelloguy, can you elaborate on how this will adversely impact major-ISP users such as AOL customers? My understanding is that currently, vandal blocks sometimes catch both anons and registered users from the target IP range. If I am wrong, this may change my vote above. <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 13:33, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is pretty much what happens. At present, if there's a blanket block on an IP, everyone on that IP gets banned. The proposal is to ban all anons from an IP while allowing registered users at the same IP to continue ediing. As I see it, it will actually have the opposite effect to what Fleclloguy says, in that a block on any IP will no longer affect everyone at an IP, but only some of its users. It will reduce the "collateral damage", not increase it (and as a busy admin who's been blocked twice times in the last week because of a blanket IP block, I'm all in favour of that!). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 13:44, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font>

<dd>I've posted a (IMO) lengthy response on the mailing list; <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-October/030824.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-October/030824.html" rel="nofollow">you can read it here</a>. I think I've covered my opinion regarding this in that post, but I'll clarify myself here as well. Currently, (AFAIK) AOL IPs are rarely blocked for long periods of time; range blocks of the AOL IPs are extremely rare, if any. In either case, I sympathize with those being inadvertantly prohibited from editing, but the amount of time those IPs are blocked should be kept to a minimum. In either case, my opinion is that all of the AOL IPs and multiple other public-use IPs will be blocked using this new blocking form, restricting anonymous editing. However, this would not stop vandalism, because vandals can just use log-in or create accounts. There's been some discussion above regarding limiting new accounts, but IMHO this would prove ineffective and against the spirit of the wiki: email addresses should not be required (see mailing list post), captchas would do nothing since most of the vandals are not automated bots, and one-hour limit creations would severly impede the creation of accounts on a significant portion of the population. Do we really want to say to those who use AOL: "sorry, someone just created an account, and because the IP is blocked, you have to wait an hour to create one, and someone else most likely will register before you do?" Anyways, my opinion is that this policy would 1) hinder anonymous editing, a crucial principle of wikis and Wikipedia, 2) actually encourage vandals, and 3) increase collateral damage by restricting editing and account creation on hundreds of potential contributors while not filtering out vandals.

<dd>The one hour block does not mean one account per hour on each IP address, it means every account registered will only become active after one hour - most vandals will not bother waiting around, after all, very few vandals are actually determined.

<dd>Oops, sorry, must have misinterpreted the "one hour" thing. However, I still feel the same way about that - we shouldn't limit new accounts to editing one hour after creation; many users will be frustrated at this and just leave. This is, IMO, also going against the basic principles of wiki - that anyone can edit *now*, not one hour later. Many potential contributors would be deterred by this one hour delay; however, vandals wouldn't — they would just create more accounts continuously. Vandals have already shown that they are persistant and determined and (unfortunately) continue their actions, while potential editors and contributors can easily be chased away by these restrictions. Personally, I wouldn't have waited an hour after stumbling upon Wikipedia, I would have just continued anonymous editing or have left — but since the IP address would be blocked, we're putting ourselves in the danger of scaring off and chasing away potential valuable contributors while not deterring vandalism. Are we to discourage more people to join us when we have such trouble retaining good users already? <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> | <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">W</a><sub><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignpost_5b65.html" title="Wikipedia:Signpost">S</a></sub> 20:34, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think in quite the opposite way; that we have trouble attracting good users because we have such a bad reputation among the kind of people who would be the best editors (i.e. the highly skilled). We have this repution because we are so open to vandalism. Now lets not make this into a discussion about whether we should stop all anonymous editing, because this proposal would not affect that many people. You quote "anyone can edit", this technically will not be breached as anyone could still edit (well, as long as they have a computer...), but I understand your point that is probably in breach of the principle behind "anyone can edit", however, wikipedias fundamental policy is that it is community driven, and this proposal seems quite popular with the community at the moment. Plus the 1 hour thing is just a number I plucked out my head, it could be 15 minutes, or nothing at all. thanks <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose"><font color="darkgreen"><i><b>Martin</b></i></font></a> 21:15, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Flcelloguy, thank you for both the link to your full answer and the synopsis here. I'm relatively new, so I don't have a lot of "institutional knowledge" to go by. What I'm seeing is that this proposal (essentially a bugfix) will allow registered users to avoid IP blocks that are supposed to be targetted at anon vandals. The rules for IP blocks currently are *more* restrictive for new users, as they can/will/may be blocked even if they create an account, am I right?</dd>
<dd>I'd like to have more data; I recently observed someone saying that 9/10 edits to Wikipedia are made by anon users; what's the rate of blockage/day? How many times is a single IP range blocked, on average, for the 24 hour/30 day period specified in the guideline? How many users get blocked because of IP blocks right now? I'm not convinced that Option 1 above is any more restrictive to the "anyone can edit" policy, unless you are reading it as proposing indefinite blocks on large chunks of IP addresses that known vandals haunt. If so, then I missed it. <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 02:35, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for participating in the discussion! I'll try and answer all your questions here. True, while the new type of block is less restrictive, this proposal essentially means that all of the AOL IP ranges will be blocked. From the policy: <i>This new form of blocking will only affect specific IP addresses, most obviously will be AOL, which would almost certainly be blocked due to the level of vandalism.</i> Right now, AOL blocks are extremely rare, and I've never seen a range block (which blocks all of the IP addresses in a certain range) been applied to AOL. True, we do get vandalism from AOL, but most of it is petty vandalism, and the only reason we tend to notice it more is because it's AOL. We don't have a major problem with vandalism here, and considering AOL services more than 25 million users in the U.S. alone, the amount of vandalism per person is quite small. There has been, IMO, no need to block any of the IP addresses for extended periods of time (i.e. more than 15 minutes), and it's extremely rare for an AOL IP to be blocked. I don't have specific data on the number of blocks, etc., but you can view the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" title="Special:Log/block">block log</a>; most of the blocks are for registered users and then vandals on other IP addresses. In addition, AOL IP addresses also make useful contributions to Wikipedia. We shouldn't try to suppress IP editing; the whole spirit of Wikipedia is that anyone can edit, even if not registered. Regarding the amount of IP editing overall - no, I can't provide a single number, but if you click on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a> that should give you a good idea of how much is edited by IP addresses. I would give a rough estimate of 50-50 for the amount of IP editing versus registered user editing. Blocking users is not used that often, in my opinion: again, see the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" title="Special:Log/block">block log</a>. I would give an extremely rough estimate of about 50-100 blocks a day, excluding <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilly_on_Wheels_8114.html" title="User:Willy on Wheels">Willy on Wheels</a> blocks and open proxy blocks. Regarding your question on registered users being blocked: in my opinion, there's not that much of a problem right now. While I sympathize with those who are inadvertantly blocked, I think only a small minority of registered users have been inadvertantly prohibited from editing. In either case, I think this policy will do nothing to change that; instead, we could just promote wiser use of blocks. Again, as I have said, this policy (in my opinion) would go against the very spirit of Wikipedia — that <i>anyone</i>, no matter what ISP they use or what vandals are doing — should be able to edit. I think I've covered all your questions, but feel free to ask me more.

<dd>As I understand the issue, you're correct that they would probably be using a different IP address on the second page they go to (either to edit again or to make a new account). <i>However</i>, they would never run into this sort of block again if they kept logging in!

<dd>Here is a summery:
<ul>
<li>Allow users to watch edits by other users and IP ranges, as opposed to just pages.</li>
<li>Allow users to create, edit, &amp; share lists of pages, users, &amp; IP ranges which could be included in anyone's watchlist.</li>
<li>Create a featured list functionality where users vote to feature some such lists, and all anonymous edits from featured lists are identified by list membership.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So all anonymous AOL &amp; U.S. Senate edits would be identified as such. Each user could just the probability of vandalism based upon the IP address identifier, or even watch lists they felt were suspicious (AOL, U.S. Senate, etc.).</dd>
<dd>Admins might also execute blocks based upon such lists, but they'd need to include the version of the list page to use. Once you've got this sort of fined grained watching functionality, you should add <i>both</i> "edit certification" (registered users certify anon edits) and "anon block" (this proposal) as weaker forms of blocking for specific IP ranges, lists, etc.</dd>
<dd>BTW, admins should have a "random moving vandal" option to their block time, it would choose a random block time based upon some unpublished algorithm, with most blocks being less than one hour, but with some lasting 24 hours. This would force the vandal to move, as they can't risk camping an IP address for 24 hours to vandalize again, while minimizing the damage done to random users. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffBurdges_be5a.html" title="User:JeffBurdges">JeffBurdges</a> 16:33, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>So you want to integrate this proposal with yours but you're going to vote against implementing this one? That doesn't make sense. It seems you've assumed this will only be blanket applied to cases like the congress situation which is incorrect. Your proposal alone doesn't solve some very specific problems where an ip adress is used as a proxy and a large amount of vandalism comes from it, but it is not possible to block because longstanding contributors also contribute through it. It appears you have not very carefully looked at the justification for this proposal. You're welcome to also have your own proposal, but your reasons for voting against this one aren't very compelling. For one, it's not necessarily going to be hundreds of anons, it will be applied as needed, when there is consistent vandalism. Also, assuming this proposal has been made with intent to abuse it, is clear failure to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:56, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> I think this is approaching the problem from the wrong end. Rather than creating a new type of blocking, we should create a new type of user: a "confirmed" user would have immunity from any IP-based block, and could only be blocked explicitly by username. Here, "confirmed" status essentially means "not a throwaway account": this could be granted right away for established users with even a modest contribution track record, while a new user confronted with an autoblock would have to perform some small non-automatable task that takes a minute or two, like responding to a page of a dozen captchas, or maybe (friendlier to the visually impaired) answering some automatically-generated questionnaire that requires human reading and comprehension skills and maybe a bit of research on Wikipedia or Google (eg, "who was the mother of the wife of the predecessor of the predecessor of Louis XIV of France"). This creates a mild "effort barrier" to discourage serial sockpuppet creation seconds apart (which we've been seeing a lot of lately), but it's only a one-time-ever hassle for legitimate users. I'm not sure creating a new type of blocking solves the core problem, which is: an established user, once "confirmed", should <i>never</i> be autoblocked under any circumstances (under any "new" or "old" form of blocking). For example, an Arb Com member getting autoblocked because of the actions of another person is simply nuts. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 05:12, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b> On one side, I think this may have the effect of significantly restricting IP editing; That's a bad thing. On the other side, there's no justification for blocking a logged-in user just because he shares an IP with a vandal. If the software is doing something I don't want it to do, the software needs to change. I can't bring myself to say, "No, don't fix this. I want to be forced to occasionally block people who have done nothing wrong." At the same time, I think fixing this without making other changes in how we block and how we deal with vandalism, will do more harm than good. JeffBurdges has some good ideas above, as does Curps. For now, with reservations, I support fixing the software to not block users I don't intend to block. But I also support making other changes at the same time, to mitigate any problems fixing this may cause. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 19:02, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> I have a fix for bug 550 (it's a fairly trivial task) but I abandoned work on it over six months ago on recognising the political implications. I don't want to further restrict the usability of the site by non-logged-in editors, and by making it easier to block editing by specific IPs and ranges without causing collateral damage, I believe this would be the effect of the proposed new type of block. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 12:24, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are, of course, entitled to your opinion, but I don't quite understand you here. Are you saying that this new form of blocking will encourage admins to block with less fear of collateral damage? I find that the current system is broken - and in some cases (AOL, schools, SingNet come to mind), significant vandal activity is taking place but collateral damage prevents a block. For example, at my school about 2 pages are vandalised per day - escalating to a block every two weeks or so - but I offset this with sometimes 10-15 constructive edits per day. Unfortunately, when the school's IP is blocked for vandalism, I, and thus the project, suffer from the collateral damage. This new form of blocking could be implemented in situations like this to let people like me continue to contribute to Wikipedia, whilst locking out vandals if they are particularly obnoxious. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWerdna648_4a6e.html" title="User:Werdna648">Werdna648</a><sup><a href="../../../w/e/r/User_talk%7EWerdna648_bc69.html" title="User talk:Werdna648">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Werdna648_26b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Werdna648">C</a></sub>\<sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Werdna648_360a.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Werdna648">@</a></sup> 14:42, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am with Werdna here. I edit from school all the time, and I find that every few days, I need to unblock myself because of vandalism from that IP. This wouldn't change "it's a shared IP, so only block for an hour or two at most (my policy)", but it would allow people who obviously aren't going to vandalize to edit from a blocked IP, which ultimately helps the project. —<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_70c9.html" title="User:BorgHunter">BorgHunter</a> <sup><s><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgHunter_AntiUBX_f305.html" title="User:BorgHunter/AntiUBX">ubx</a></s></sup> (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBorgHunter_76ea.html" title="User talk:BorgHunter">talk</a>) 17:15, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not really the point being addressed. the way things stand at the moment, when you block a vandal on a shared IP, there's a good chance that a lot of legit users will be blocked at the same time. The proposed changes would stop that from happening.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I don't think this will be helpful as there will be a profusion of sock puppets from vandals. Instead, a rating system can be introduced for users (good, bad and neutral). Each new user, when they create an account will start with a rating of neutral. Other users who see edits of the new user, will rate them either positively or negatively. A tally of the votes received by the user will decide whether he is good or bad. Now when an ip is blocked, it would block all bad users from that ip and allow all good users. Neutral users will be barred from eiditing protected/semi-protected pages.

<dd>One other comment: I've reviewed a fair amount of ip contributions and have been suprised to find a lot less vandalism than I would expect and a good amount of valuable additions. New users often don't 'get' the wiki concept at first (I know I didn't) and can't believe that they can really contribute without proving themselves worthy. Making people login to do so or go through some other authenitication step is asking a lot of faith from them--many users will wonder why they should bother. I think the proper order of things is to get new users hooked on Wikipedia first and then encourage conformity to various policies later. Lastly, I've seen a lot of online communities start with an ethic of openness and then set up barriers to 'make things more orderly'--often leading to a major decline in participation. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 03:16, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Both of these comments miss the main point. In the case of the first comment, it's not a question of catching vandalism, its the fact that when a vandal attacks our only real method of stopping it from recurring is to block the user. In cases where vandal share IPs with other editors and do not have usernames, all these good users are also blocked. I regularly have my account blocked, and many toher users do likewise, simply because an unregistered user with the same IP is vandalising the site. With regards to the second point, again, it's got nothing to do with conformity - its all to do with helping us to stop the blocking of good users whenever a vandal starts to cause problems. Sure, some may be put off by having to get a username, but it's hardly a big deal to do. We're not talking about having to pay a registration fee or even reveal an email address, and takes 30 seconds to do. I doubt that a significant number of new users would not bother simply because of that. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 02:45, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>After thinking it over, it sounds like the first option for the proposal is consistent with the problems I outlined, provided that there isn't a special policy for blocking anon IPs, which this proposal could be seen as a first step towards (e.g. more frequent and longer, even permanant blocks to induce editors to register). That seems like the best compromise since it keeps legitimate users from being punished by the blocks and provides an incentive to register. The creation of many sockpuppets from an IP is also an important problem and I don't think that captchas or email verification are the way to go for that...maybe a time limit on the creation of new accounts for persistent offenders would be a good solution. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntonrojo_cf86.html" title="User:Antonrojo">Antonrojo</a> 13:29, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Recap --</i> The main issue being addressed here is that you (effectively) have one block of IPs which is shared by both undesirables, and genuine users. In effect that means that any given IP can be a blocked or a legitimate user. The suggestion is to allow users with accounts to bypass blocking. The problem is that is legitimate users can bypass an IP block by using an account, so (of course) can the undesirables. Also, by using an account, it becomes less immediately obvious that they are editing through an IP block, so blocked editor detection may become a little harder. One must now checksock in all cases, leading to a lot of "indeterminates" with AOL etc. On the other hand revealing IP's is not desirable either in order to protect legitimate user anonymity.</p>
<p><i>Proposed solution --</i> Edits made through a blocked IP (where the edit was only possible because the editor concerned used an account) should be flagged, to allow easy identification of edits made through an IP block.</p>
<p><i>Consideration --</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Benefits -</i> bona fide editors can check if an editor using an account *would* have been blocked had they not used an account, which will greatly help identify socks and blocked users, but will not significantly impact on legitimate users.</li>
<li><i>Coding -</i> A single field added to the table of edits, indicating whether the edit was allowed through a blocked IP due to using a named account. A flag then displayed in DIFF or CONTRIB or HISTORY summaries and the like next to edits which were. Not too complex.</li>
<li><i>Anonymity -</i> since no IP information is given, the only additional disclosure is that a user "would have been blocked" had they not used an account. Not expected to be much of an issue, there are many blocks, and a legitimate editor could be anywhere (it is the blocked editors who one can guess where they come from).</li>

<p>Editors don't need IP's to detect socks. They need to be able to tell if domains (or significant IP octets) for 2 edit match, to identify if the same editor did both. That's the main thing needed to detect a blocked editor trying to edit the same article through a block. For most blocked users, if the style, article focus, and most of the IP/domain matches, its probably a blocked editor running the account.</p>
<p>So here's the suggestion: - allow users to view an "editors hash" based on most significant data of the IP or domain, next to each edit. Again, this doesn't ID anyone (since the whole address isn't used and hashes aren't easily reversible), but it does allow for a simple <i>comparison</i> of IPs between editors, a sort of quick check that users can do for themselves before requesting a Checkuser or stirring up wiki-accusations.</p>
<p>This could be made accessible to editors in general: - Allow a hash of the top 2 or 3 octets and/or main domain+tld, of any user to be visible next to each edit, as an "editors hash". Doesn't ID anyone, but does provide a very good armory for everyday users to quickly identify likely socks whether or not editing through an account, without needing access to the IPs or to ask someone else to Checkuser for them. Allows IPs to be compared without disclosing their value. Would probably identify most socks quickly, and reduce load on WP:RFCU.</p>

Would this be practical?</p>

<p>As of July 11, 2006, the voting stands at 88-124-11.

This is settled policy and should be implimented as soon as practical. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 06:57, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It isn't a bad suggestion, but while we are still waiting for the <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550" class="extiw" title="bugzilla:550">BugZilla bug 550</a> to be implemented, what is the rush to close this discussion. People are still voting both ways, albeit, though more are for the hurdle than against recently. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 07:12, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There have been Bug 550 fixes prototyped a couple of times now, Tony and then... I don't want to re-scan the whole bug history, but a couple of them. I think everyone went on the back burner while this policy proposal bubbled around a bit.</dd>
<dd>The fundamental situation has not changed - users are still as blocked as they were six months ago or a year ago or two years ago, and the volume of editors is not suddenly sharply higher. But as someone reading and responding on Unblock-en-l, the number of AOL users complaining about IP blocks is significant. The visibility due to Unblock-en-l going live has increased, and in my opinion demonstrates that this has been a fairly serious problem all along which has just not been sufficiently visible. Now that it is...</dd>
<dd>In my opinion, looking at the polling, we have consensus. If we have consensus, then we should implement. Anyone who disagrees that we have a working consensus here is welcome to object to closing, but I think we passed the "results are clear and evident and overwhelming" point months ago now... <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 08:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If closing this is going to put greater priority on the implementation then I am all for it. If closing this prematurely will force the developer to make compromises in the design of their solution, which is possibly a large chunk of the work, then it will not be the best in the long run. From looking at the history on the bug, the second "premature" option is possibly not an issue, however, there may be other alternatives I have not pointed out. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 11:53, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We obviously have consensus on not blocking logged in users, but clearly not on the login hurdle. Another way of saying "almost 3-2 working consensus" is "less than 60% in favour"&#160;:-) 72.137.20.109 18:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand that this decision involves software modifications, and the design of the software change is important. The change is in part dependent on whether it is more preferable to have option 1 or option 2 as listed above. This is one of the two longest decision making processes I have ever been involved in on Wikipedia. The other drawn out debate I have been involved in was <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_locations_0e4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Template locations">Wikipedia:Template locations</a>. Other than these exceptional processes I think the rest of Wikipedia settles nicely into a consensus within a reasonably short (ie, weeks.. up to 2 months max mostly) timeframe. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 07:09, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
