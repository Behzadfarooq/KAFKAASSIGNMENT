<h2><span class="mw-headline">History/Precursors</span></h2>
<p>I think the article could use a paragraph noting the evolution of personal webpages to blogs in the mid-90s. Back in '94 and '95, lots of us were running personal homepages and posting updates in a reverse-chronological fashion. Examples include Justin Hall's Links from Underground and my site, Andy Carvin's Waste of Bandwidth, both of which date back to '94. From an editorial point of view, they were blogs, since they expressed our opinions and were published by us, but from a technical point of view they weren't, since we were just typing our own HTML and FTPing the pages to our servers manually. The most important evolutionary moment occurred when someone decided to _automate_ the process so that a journal writer could focus on writing while the blogging software would HTML it, post it online and archive. It was the creation of this assistive technology that made Web journaling an activity that any Internet user could do, even with zero HTML experience. This opened up Web journaling to everyone, and thus the blogging phenomenon was born.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blog definition</span></h2>
<p>Who can post on a weblog? How it is different from wikipedia and internet forums? Please explain. Reading your article gives no answer to this essential question for someone (like me) who has no idea what blog is.</p>
<p><a name="Weblog.2Fdiary" id="Weblog.2Fdiary"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Weblog/diary</span></h3>
<p>It should be noted on the main page that personal weblogs are better known as "diaries", because that's what they are. To call LiveJournals weblogs is to give a new word to something that's already got a meaning.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would disagree with this; yes, most blogs function as diaries, but not all blogs are diaries; far from it. Blogs gained popularity as a journaling tool, but they've become much more powerful than that, being used for civic journalism, online collaboration, education, etc. - --<a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcarvin_7b22.html" title="User:Acarvin">acarvin</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I will revise that section as such; if you want to change it back, <i>please</i> post a response here when doing so.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But LiveJournals tend to be public media, and allows users to not only view each entry, but comment on them as well. I don't think the word 'diary' connotes such public interaction. While the word 'diary' can be used for a <i>subset</i> of LiveJournal (specifically LJs with entries that whose views are restricted to the author or only a select group of people), I don't think they apply to LiveJournals that allow the general public to view and comment on its entries. --<a href="../../../t/-/b/User%7ET-Boy_4523.html" title="User:T-Boy">T-Boy</a></dd>

<dd>"Weblog" is coming archaic, relatively speaking. Blog is the term people recognize and use in the majority of situations. How about if you call the article Blog but acknowledge upfront that it's an abbreviation of Weblog, which is used less frequently? ---<a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcarvin_7b22.html" title="User:Acarvin">acarvin</a></dd>

<p><a name="More_definition_quibble" id="More_definition_quibble"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">More definition quibble</span></h3>
<p>Next quibble: "A weblog ... is a website that tracks headlines and articles from other websites." That would have been a decent definition before about 1999. But now that excludes Weblogs like the <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/news03/update_archive/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/news03/update_archive/index.html" rel="nofollow">Fermi National Laboratory Accelerator Update</a> [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:7jMTSHzWAZQJ:www.fnal.gov/pub/news03/update_archive/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:7jMTSHzWAZQJ:www.fnal.gov/pub/news03/update_archive/" rel="nofollow">Google cache</a>], not to mention practically all the Weblogs on <a href="http://livejournal.com/" class="external text" title="http://livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">LiveJournal</a>. The defining feature of a Weblog, I think, is that it gives more prominence to the date an item was posted than other Web sites do. (I have to go home now, but I'll revise the article later if no-one does it first.) -- <a href="../../../m/p/t/User%7EMpt_c78a.html" title="User:Mpt">Mpt</a> 07:32, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another defintion quibble about the scope of the blog label. When I think of blog, I think of something run by an individual posting diary type stuff, or personal commentary on sites. As the definition stands, sites like <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">Fark.com</a> fit in (and are defined as) blogs. I'm not sure this is truly accurate. --<a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaidinBDJ_4aea.html" title="User:GaidinBDJ">Barry</a> 17:08, Sep 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps say something to the effect that blogs are a form of online publishing that generally is written by a single person or a small group, with the most recent entries posted at the top and previous entries appearing serially below that. One key thing to communicate is that blogs became a big phenomenon because blogging technology - ie, the software that run blogs -- made it easy for anyone with relatively little tech skills to publish their ideas on the Net. Prior to blogs, personal publishers needed to know HTML, FTPing, etc, which meant most journals were technically oriented. But once anyone could post their own journal thanks to the new blogging tools, the medium transformed in to a broad free-for-all of ideas, all following a similar serialized journal format. ---<a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcarvin_7b22.html" title="User:Acarvin">acarvin</a></p>
<p><a name="Weblog_versus_blogs" id="Weblog_versus_blogs"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Weblog versus blogs</span></h3>
<p>It's a shame that this entry conflates blogs with weblogs. It could use some disambiguation with an entry on blogs and one on weblogs. Blogs are more about one person whereas weblogs are more like a news website. Andrew Sullivan's site is a blog, whereas Slashdot and Kuro5hin are weblogs. I looked through this entry and didn't see any mention of weblog software such as phpNuke and PostNuke. This entry conflates blogs and weblogs and will end up confusing people.</p>
<p>This entry should also talk about personal zines, which are really the cultural phenomenon that precedes blogging. In fact, there are more than a few perzine editors who made the move from printed perzines to blogging. Blogging really follows in the footsteps of all the zining that was going on in the 1980s and 90s.</p>

<dd>I have never heard of a distinction between blogs and weblogs. If you want to include that in the article, you might want to mention that most do not make the distinction. I absolutely agree, though, that personal zines were a precursor to weblogs. - <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobra_libre_aad9.html" title="User:Cobra libre">cobra libre</a> 19:15, Apr 1, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah I always thaught blog=weblog. To define it otherwise would really muddy the waters. More debatable would be whether or not Slashdot can really be classed as a blog.

<p>On a similar note, I dont really agree with that first definition [1]. Who the hell calls webserver log a web log? Certainly people who come to wikipedia seeking the definition of 'blog' will be confused by this. Maybe the best thing would be to move the blog definition back to the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a> page, and make <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weblog.html" title="Weblog">Weblog</a> a dissambiguation page. -- <a href="../../../n/o/j/User%7ENojer2_32fa.html" title="User:Nojer2">Nojer2</a> 16:04, 13 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Trackback controversy</span></h2>
<p>The controversy over Trackbacks is a genuine phenomenon and thus deserves inclusion in the article, but I am wondering if the point should be made that Trackback's perceived faults actually lie with the common pop-up page implementation, and not with Trackback itself? This is actually discussed in the link to sixapart.com, but not in the article. - <a href="../../../c/o/b/User%7ECobra_libre_aad9.html" title="User:Cobra libre">cobra libre</a> 19:22, Apr 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>As of 8/31/04, in the section "Blogging Begins," Dave Winer is credited as follows: "One of his most important contributions was the creation of servers which weblogs would "ping" to show that they had updated." This is correct. However, the sentence that followed was incorrect: "This made it possible for blogs to easily "trackback" other blogs that referenced a particular story, a key feature of blogging." Userland's Weblogs.com is a central update ping broadcast service, and has nothing to do with "trackbacks" and blog cross references. I had removed this sentence once before, but it has since been restored. I have removed it again; if I am wrong, please post an explanation.</p>
<p><a name="Persistency_of_Blog.3F" id="Persistency_of_Blog.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Persistency of Blog?</span></h2>
<p>The word log usually means something meant to be a permanent record of some events. Since a lot of these weblogs are published in a few software service companies like blogger.com, how likely are these logs vanish upon the termination of these companies? For example, some photo posting companies like photopoint.com left million of their users in a limbo when they went out of business. Are these Blogs archivible by the authors?</p>
<hr />
<p>In many cases, yes. Blogger publishes your weblog to your own web hosting service, so if Blogger disappears, the web pages remain. For software you install yourself, such as MovableType, your website and underlying data remain yours even if Six Apart disappears. As for hosted weblogs, if the company disappears, the weblog may become inaccessible, and it's up to the company to give their users the opportunity to retrieve their data-- just as if your web hosting provider went out of business.</p>

<p>I'm an RC junkie. This page got my attention after an anon added (his own?) to the list of example blogs. I have renamed "Example weblogs" to "Noteable weblogs" and cleaned house accordingly. The purpose of an example is to give someone an idea of what is being discussed. A few examples will suffice in this case. The list had grown excessively long, effectively becoming a place to "list your own blog." That is unnecessary and contrary to the spirit of the Wikipedia. Some of the blogs listed no longer exist. In one case, the blog still exists but the blog begins with "Why I've stopped blogging." I cleaned the list to include only noteable, active blogs. I believe these should be plenty to use as examples. I'm not familiar with all of these blogs, so I may have made errors of judgement as to which are actually noteable. Feel free to modify the list, but please do keep the new header "Noteable weblogs" to keep this list from becoming a long list of advertisements. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 09:55, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you look at the table of contents, this article seems a bit cluttered, I think all these listed examples of blogs and blogging systems should all be under 'External Links'. Any objections to that change? -- <a href="../../../n/o/j/User%7ENojer2_32fa.html" title="User:Nojer2">Nojer2</a> 17:02, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Techniques to Increase Profits Through Website Promotion by www.itsallaboutlinks.com</b></p>
<p>Anyone who is any sort of internet business knows that profits are the most important thing to attain. The key to gaining more profits is through website promotion. With the right website promotion, you can be sure to gain mass profits that you would not have had without it. If you are interested in learning how to gain more profits this way, please read on for some tips.</p>
<p>The first part of gaining profits through website promotion is to have an excellent website design. You cannot expect to gain any profits through a website that is designed poorly or that is difficult to navigate. Make it easy for visitors to your website to find what they need and make a purchase. This will gain you fast profits.</p>
<p>The second thing you should do to gain profits is to use search engine optimization, or SEO. SEO has been widely used to put people's websites at the top of a search engine's list. It is found that most people that use a search engine only visit the website that is listed at the top of the list. This is why you need to use SEO to help with your website promotion. With the proper SEO, you can attract more visitors to your website. More visitors means more profits for you.</p>
<p>Next, to gain more profits you can use email marketing. Be sure that when you use email marketing to gain profits that you are not using spam. Use an opt in list instead. Have an opt in list posted on your website. An opt in list is when people request to receive email material from your website. It has been shown that opt in lists give a 40% increase in response. This means that you will again have more profits.</p>
<p>In order to gain profits through website promotion, you must be sure that you go after your target audience. Be sure that your website's design attracts the type of people that would be interested in your product or service. Also, be sure that your email marketing sends out emails and ezines to people that will actually read it and have an interest in it. If you don't, you cannot expect to gain profits.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can incorporate the use of affiliate programs to help with your website promotion. Have links to your affiliates on your website. Your affiliates will also do the same. With you and your affiliates working together to promote your website, you will start to see more website traffic and more profits.</p>
<p>Website promotion is the only sure way to gain profits for your business. Without it, you can easily find yourself in a hole that is hard to dig your way out of. Be sure to utilize all of these methods so that you can attain more profits.</p>

<p>"Ham radio also had logs called "glogs" that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s."</p>

<dd>ham radio? wouldn't it be wearable computer users? i mean, i'm sure the two intersect a little, but i don't see that the ham radio community is the same as the self-made cyborgs. also i think people still keep glogs, though i'm too lazy to seek out examples. - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 03:18, Sep 12, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">List of weblogs</span></h2>
<p>First, List of notable weblogs (which contained content originally in this article) went through VfD and the decision was to delete. Then, List of notable weblogs was redirected to List of weblogs, which also went through VfD and the decision was to delete. Now, recently, there have been two attempts to add this Wikicracy-rejected material to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weblogs.html" title="Weblogs">Weblogs</a> article itself.</p>
<p>I'm just one person (of course), but I'm going to revert any re-addition of this content. It was rejected by the wikicracy twice, and it needs to stay out. If there's an issue with this, take it to mediation instead of starting an edit war. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman">Stevietheman</a> 17:58, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Meaning of "weblog"</span></h2>
<p>I've heard weblog dissected by some bloggers specifically as "we blog, not web log". I don't know if this is common or not.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I very much doubt that. Every news story I've heard about blogs descrbe the word as short for "web log". If it stemmed from "we blog", then where does the word "blog" come from? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 21:15, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a stylistic point. The word "blog" is used 187 times in this article. I know this an article about blogs, but it does make for extremely repetative and clumsy reading, made worse by the fact that "blog" is a clumsy and unfortunate word in the first place. Blog blogging blogs blogged blogger blog blog. Ugh. Someone please find ways of avoiding the repetition. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalefire_eaed.html" title="User:Palefire">Palefire</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ease of Use</span></h2>
<p>I think the key aspect of a blog is how easy it is to update. The reason they are so popular is that you don't necessarily need to know anything about HTML to have one, if you use Blogger or LiveJournal. This allows anyone to produce one, which gives us the variety and range of blogs that you can find today.</p>
<p>In other words, the huge number of them is almost certainly down to their ease of creation and ease of maintainance. How you could prove this, I don't know. Out of interest, does anyone have any idea how many blogs exist today (whether still updated or not)? --Adam (03/11/04)</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4059291.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4059291.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a>: <i>Technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. Some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained.</i> <a href="../../../c/%C3%A9/%C3%A7/User%7EC%C3%A9%C3%A7aqui%C3%A9%C3%A7a_9864.html" title="User:Céçaquiéça">Céçaquiéça</a> 22:46, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
