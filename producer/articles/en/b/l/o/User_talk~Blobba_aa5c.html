<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:CHICK fIT.png</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<li>Please do not insert unverified speculation into Wikipedia, because <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. This includes the creation of articles on albums that haven't yet been officially announced, such as TBA Ashlee Simpson, TBA Mariah Carey etc., and uploading fake album covers to put in these articles. For albums that haven't yet been announced, I'd recommend editing the article on the singer and adding the information about any forthcoming albums there. Remember to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to accompany the information.</li>
<li>Please do not copy and paste text material from copyrighted websites. If the information is relevant to include, rewrite it in your own words, but do not simply copy and paste because that is plagiarism and will be removed because it could get Wikipedia into serious trouble.</li>
<li>Please do not copy or cut content from one article to another without mentioning the original article in the <a href="../../../e/s/_/WP%7EES_f020.html" title="WP:ES">edit summary</a>.

<p>Hi there. Further to my previous comments, please stop uploading images without specifying their source and selecting an appropriate licence.

<dd>Also, it has been sugggested that the album covers you have uploaded may have been created by you. This is not useful and using these images within article will lead to confusion. I'd ask you to consider this before uploading any more images. If you fail to do so, you risk your edits being deemed unconstructive and damaging to Wikipedia.

<p>Hi Blobba, I have just finished deleting the 48 images of unreleased albums that you uploaded, many of which seem to be fake and probably all are.
