<p>I'm rather edgy about coursing and related articles being included in this article and matching category. In coursing, unlike most other sports in this category (e.g. hunting), the death of the hare is not the objective - the objective is for the dogs to pursue the hare and force it to turn. By design, nine times out of ten the hare escapes, as hares literally have eyes practically in the bank of their head, allowing them to dodge at the last second. Plus greyhounds a) run out of steam within a few seconds b) have no sense of smell and c) are, like all dogs, very very stupid. The remaining one out of ten hares are generally ill and not long for this earth anyway.</p>
<p>Admittedly the figure is lower for illegal coursing, but condemning legal coursing because of that would be like condemning boxing because of the injuries sustained during bare-knuckle fighting. Perhaps if a less emotive term than 'blood sport' was used I'd feel differently, but we can't choose our language.</p>
<p>I'm not going to be bold and remove it myself because some of the Southern US 'blood sports' also seem to avoid outright killing of animals, and I don't want to come in from outside and screw up other people's definition of 'blood sport' for the sake of my own personal bias. But I'd be interested to see if anyone else has any thoughts on this. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 14:57, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I spent the better part of an hour yesterday at a large library trying to find the origin of this phrase, but even the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> is vague about first uses, which go back to the late 1500's (essentially the beginning of writing on such things). There was also some conjecture in other sources that the phrase originally refers to "bloods" (aristocratic rowdies, what in the US would probably be called "frat boys" today) or physical blood. There seems to be a strong rise in the use of the phrase in the late 1800's as part of Victorian social reform, particularly around <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_welfare.html" title="Animal welfare">animal welfare</a>. Given this history, there seems to be a strong case that the phrase is pejorative in modern usage, especially in the sense that it confounds "sports" where the sporting aspect is chase and an animal's ability to run away with spectacles such as cockfighting where the point is to forbid and prevent the animals from doing anything other than fighting or being killed. In modern hunting terminology, this is the distinction between "fair chase" and stocked ponds for children's fishing and "canned hunts" for yuppies. Most participants in such "sports" as hunting, fox hunting and fishing "fail" in the sense that they often don't kill anything, yet they still consider that "good sport" because of the spiritual and recreational aspects of the pursuit. Current use of the term "blood sport" is either (A) historical, referring to Victorian spectacles, (B) rhetorical, as by <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_welfare.html" title="Animal welfare">animal welfare</a> activists or (C) metaphorical, to describe various social nastiness. The fact that the term is not often used to refer to <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladiator.html" title="Gladiator">gladiators</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling.html" title="Professional wrestling">professional wrestling</a> would seem to support this. <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorybowman_5a57.html" title="User:Rorybowman">Rorybowman</a> 17:07, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page has been written as POV it is not accurate. Hunting is a blood sport, just check any decent English dictionary. I agree that "Blood Sport (hunting)" is a bad title. I did not name it. Perhaps, we should have four articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood Sport (disambiguation)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Blood Sport (bait)</li>
</ul>
<p>-involving dogs</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood Sport (humans)</li>
</ul>
<p>-sports humans are involved in, boxing, hunting, fishing, trapping etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood Sport (animals)</li>
</ul>
<p>-involving animals 'other than' dogs, Cricket fighting etc.</p>
<p>Or one article called "Blood Sport" with the above as separate subtitles.</p>
<p>However, if there are no agreed changes the article should be reverted back as it is incredibly incorrect&#160;! <a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWritersCramp_60df.html" title="User:WritersCramp">WritersCramp</a> 03:22, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Would you be amenable to putting the whole mess back into <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_sport.html" title="Blood sport">blood sport</a> and introducing subtitles? I checked the OED earlier in the week and it seems from that the term involved the rural <b>chasing</b> of animals in the 1500's, then the <b>confining</b> of animals to fight in the 1800's, then the expansion of the term for other nastiness in the 1900's. This is a phrase with a vague and curious history, with no one dictionary really doing it justice. Perhaps divide into <b>chasing</b> activities (fox hunting, coursing), <b>combat</b> activities (cockfighting, baiting) and <b>other</b> uses (such as boxing, gladiatorial combat or politics)? That seems to capture the historical evolution more accurately. If reverted, how far back does it revert? That is why I am thinking a return to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_sport.html" title="Blood sport">blood sport</a> might be the better part of valor. - <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorybowman_5a57.html" title="User:Rorybowman">Rorybowman</a> 03:44, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Which is the problem. The term is just muddled, and if we aim for more precision we risk losing the ambiguous, NPOV essence. I've made a stab at it (no pun intended) with this rewrite and adding a picture of a modern <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull_fight.html" title="Bull fight">bull fight</a>. Since almost nobody is sympathetic to the Spaniards we don't gore the standard fox-hunting <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Liberation_Front_22fb.html" title="Animal Liberation Front">ALF</a> bull, we show that such things still exist and we have a more attractive layout. I think that the current page would work just fine as a generic <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_sport.html" title="Blood sport">blood sport</a> article, allowing us to lose the currently innacurate <b>(hunting)</b> subtitle.

<p>Well, the three of us, so far, agree that the (hunting) subtitle is wrong. The current article is also the most obvious article for anyone typing "Blood sport" into the search box or making a blind wikilink for the term. I don't see any POV issue either, the existing content functions at least as section stubs for the growth of the term. I see no reason not to do this. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 06:50, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the contrary: <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> is our guideline here, which clearly states that the primary meaning of a term should be at the name of the term with a link to further disambiguation. This article is overwhelmingly the primary meaning of "blood sport". Just look at the "what links here" for the dab page. Not a single one of those mis-directed links expects to find a dab page, or any other meaning of the term. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 17:46, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I must agree with the above. The blood sport disambiguation page can (and should) be kept, but the words "blood sport" should go to this page, as it's by far the most widely used meaning of the phrase. At present, it seems oddly counterintuitive, and perhaps downright incorrect, to have this page as a separate one listed as "blood sport (hunting)". -Terraxos, 00:56, 24 January 2006</dd>

<p>I have moved this article from its present rather unfortunate title back to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_sport.html" title="Blood sport">blood sport</a>, as this is the main meaning, and created a new <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_sport_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Blood sport (disambiguation)">blood sport (disambiguation)</a> page. For simplicity I suggest leaving this talk here, so the rationale for such a move will be clearer to future editors. - <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorybowman_5a57.html" title="User:Rorybowman">Rorybowman</a> 14:38, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
