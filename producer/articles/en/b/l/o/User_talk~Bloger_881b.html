<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just so you know, you don't need to leave a message on my personal Talk page when you reply to me. It's enough to simply reply on the Take page of the article in question. I have it added to my watchlist and will see any comments you make.--<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 17:32, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>About the AfD. The way it works here is as follows. Someone nominates the article for deletion. Just so you know, any user can nominate an article for deletion. Once the article has been nominated, a notice goes to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_May_11_ad50.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 May 11">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 May 11</a>. I see that you have commented on the AfD already. Now, any user of Wikipedia can comment, and this deletion debate will be there for seven days. At the end of seven days, if there is a concensus to delete the article, the article will be deleted. Just so you know, it's not a "vote", in that the number of for and against votes will not be tallied to get the result. It really is a debate where concensus needs to be reached.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just some advice: I have to tell you that the article, as it stands now, is almost guaranteed to be deleted. You have to realize that there are two absolutely unbreakable rules at Wikipedia, specifically <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. My feeling is that this article may not violate the second, but it violates the first pretty dramatically. If you don't see why, please read both of these. The problem here is that it doesn't matter whether or not the subject matter in your article is true or not. What <i>does</i> matter, and matters infinitely much, is whether another reader can verify the information that you've added. This means that some of the information is in a neutral third-party source (specifically, you cannot use the webpage of the organization you're describing). In any case, my guess is that most experienced Wikipedians will think that this article violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and this is a big no-no.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry that your first article had so much trouble. Stick around for a while and get a feel for things! Soon you'll know how things work around here.--<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 21:21, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for being polite, but I am sorry, your recent arguments have not changed my mind. Almost everything that you can type in Google search will yeild thousands of results, they just aren't related. I also do not see the relavence of the "hardship" of the Neturai Keuta rabbis.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 00:05, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From what I can see, It is just links to their website, a couple of blogs, or a few other websites for similar fringe groups. Not one reputable organization commented on them.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 00:17, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bogger, as I responded on my talk page, I had voted to Keep the article if there was verifiable information, other than the website itself, backing up the existence of such a group.

<p>I closed the AfD because it had already gone through the prerequisite number of days of AfD discussion. The discussion is not ongoing, it is closed. AfDs close after at least a week of discussions, and this was clearly a week old. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:52, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, once an AfD is transferred to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_Old_da15.html" title="WP:AFD/Old">WP:AFD/Old</a>, it's old enough to be closed, and those are closed after a week. I say "at least" a week because sometimes these AfDs get stuck unclosed due to backlog. In this case, I was taking care of the backlog. The AfD had already gone on long enough for me to close it. And the fact that I did not participate in the debate makes it even better for me to close it, because I am a neutral, uninvolved party who is capable of looking at this objectively. That's what I did. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:03, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you have new material that you believe is adequate to overturn the results of this AfD, you shouldn't post it in the AfD itself because the AfD is now inactive. The best place to present your new material is in <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, but only if the new material is sufficient enough, in your opinion, to overturn the results of the AfD. You should read <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> very carefully before listing something, because <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> is usually about process and whether I violated process when I closed the AfD. Your new information is unlikely to prove that I broke process, and the information might also be insufficient to get your article undeleted, but if you think it will, you can always try.&#160;:-) However, if you do so, I must ask that you let me know so I can weigh in and not feel like I'm being backstabbed. Alternatively, you can tell me what your new information is, and I'll give you my opinion on whether this new material will likely overturn the results of the AfD. I can guarantee you that I'm neutral to this because I was just a neutral AfD closer looking at other people's votes. Just let me know if you need any help. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:16, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm... if these newspapers are available online, you might not even need to have the editors confirm the existence.

<dd>Perhaps it would. However, the notability of the True Torah Jews themselves were already evaluated and dismissed by those who contributed to the AfD. I think the notability of the TTJ is in question, and I don't think the two newspapers would increase the notability of the TTJ. I could be wrong, however. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 21:08, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

I'm not sure how long discussion goes for, but I've noticed that backlog there tends to be a little longer than a week. If you want, once you have your material ready, I can create a fresh entry in the DRV for you to put your content in. Also, not all the people who contributed in the original AfD need to be in the DRV.

<dd>"Google hits" refers to the number of entries the term shows up when you do a search for it on Google. "Google ranking" might refer to Google PageRank, which shows how many pages link to it: the higher the number, the higher the rank, and the higher the rank, the earlier it shows up on a Google Search.

<p>(Dear Geogre this is the article you requested)</p>
<p><b>True Torah Jews</b> is a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-profit_organization.html" title="Non-profit organization">non-profit organization</a> formed by a group of religious <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Jews_cec6.html" title="Orthodox Jews">Orthodox Jews</a> dedicated to spreading its view that the ideology of <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> is in opposition to the teachings of traditional <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It opposes both the ideology of Zionism and the creation of a Jewish state (the nation of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>) before the coming of the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshiach.html" title="Moshiach">moshiach</a>. Therefore, the NPO works to 1) inform the world that it views Israel as not a Jewish state, but as a Zionist state, 2) to change references to Israel in media and popular culture from "Jewish state" to "Zionist state", 3) to inform the philanthropic public that giving to Israel is giving to Zionism rather than Judaism, 4) to inform Jews themselves about rabbinical opposition to Zionism as an ideology.</p>
<p>The group is not affiliated with any groups or coalition, but is rather a grassroots movement within the orthodox Jewish community that enjoys significant support among anti-Zionist orthodox Jews.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Its outreach efforts include a web site <a href="http://www.TrueTorahJews.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.TrueTorahJews.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a weekly newsletter called <i>Parsha Pearls</i> that has a weekly lesson from the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">torah</a> that focuses on Jews in exile <a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/parsha/index.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/parsha/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and it issues newsletters on special occasions (e.g. on the Israeli Independence Day) <a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/parsha/docs/nutrina.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/parsha/docs/nutrina.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The group also takes out ads in the leading American newspapers and on leading radio stations and talk shows with a significant Jewish audience expressing the above beliefs and messages. Finally, it puts out press releases on the position of True Torah Jews on current events.</p>
<p>The web site of the True Torah Jews receives many many hits daily, In fact in the mouth of July 2006 alone the site had over 104,127 pages visited and 75,134 unique visitors with a total of 1,831,950 hits. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> (Although it’s not the most hits a website can receive, and other websites – about different things – receive more hits, however given the limited amount of people interested in this subject – in respect to other subjects – and the amount of hits the website receives, it is percentage wise comparable to the amount of hits a well visited website of any subject should receive.) Consequently of the above, the TTJ makes quite an uproar with far reaching results since the TTJ has no other goal – as for example selling an item – besides educating people, the meare fact that a significant amount of people visit and read the material on the site is accomplishing the goal.</p>
<p>In addition, some mainstream Jewish press has commented on the movement True Torah Jews. For example both, “Der Yid” and “Der Blatt” (The official newspapers of the two <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satmar.html" title="Satmar">satmar</a> factions the Aron’s and Zalman’s) have written about the TTJ group and its activities in its article on the Israeli elections <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

<li>Bloger, that's my edit version. Compare the diffs, if you want to see what changes I made for readability. There is at least one significant citation still needed, and you really should have something about <i>what effect</i> the TTJ has generated. Example: "In 2006, the web presence of True Torah Jews received coverage in ____, and some mainstream Jewish press has commented on the movement True Torah Jews represents. For example, ____ has mentioned the anti-Zionist movement in its article on _____. As part of an ongoing debate in the Orthodox Jewish community, the True Torah Jews effort represents one of the more vigorous defenses of the messianic expectation." Something along those lines would emphasize the effect of the site/movement and help survive any AfD critique. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:13, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>hi, I was just wondering if you happened to know of any websites that teach you some basic Yiddish. I've looked on Wikipedia too, but I didn't find anything. We have many pages that teaches you a few lines in hundreds of languages and I just want to make sure that Yiddish will not be left out.

<p>Hello. Just in case it is not on your watchlist, please look at <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-sacrifice_under_Jewish_Law_f6b2.html" title="Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law">Self-sacrifice_under_Jewish_Law</a>. It was tagged for copy-editing, and I gave it a shot. I changed the references to "negative commandments" to "prohibitions," since I have discovered that "negative comandments" causes a lot of confusion for most folk who are not accustomed to the phrase. I did some other tidying up, too. I would appreciate your checking it to make sure I didn't accidentally alter any meaning. --<a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQueezbo_5cac.html" title="User:Queezbo">Sean Lotz</a> 06:26, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
