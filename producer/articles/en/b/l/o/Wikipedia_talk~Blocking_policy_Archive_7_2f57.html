<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocking in "clear and obvious" cases?</span></h2>
<p>I'm wondering if one aspect of the wording of <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a> is in fact unhelpfully tight, and should be slightly relaxed.</p>
<p>Some scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>User X and admin Y have been editing on some article. User X engages in repeated clear and obvious vandalism to the article that would usually fall within the exception to 3RR, and this now happens to the point where a block or semi-protection would be usual. Since admin Y is co-editing with user X, he/she is limited to reverting and isn't allowed to apply that block.</li>
<li>User X and admin Y had been co-editing on some article, and after a period of disruption, user X got blocked eventually for some significant breach of policy (<a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> or similar). User X returns as a sock. Since admin Y was involved in a content dispute with user X, he/she isn't allowed to block the sock but must explain on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> to others why the newcomer is a sock, and explain the background of User X's history to others unfamiliar with X, before a block can be set on the new sock.</li>
<li>User X and admin Y are editing on the same page. User X posts clear and obvious defamatory/attacking comments on the page about some other user Z who is also involved in the editing, which given the editor and article history would usually get a suitable block under current practice for <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. Because they co-edit, admin Y is not allowed to block user X for the matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>The common theme is, a user who makes what is a <i>clear and obvious</i> breach of some policy, is nonetheless unable to be dealt with by an admin even if the matter is obvious and not contentious, instead he/she must recuse from action.</p>
<p>Usually this is a Good Thing - usual reasons, if it matters someone else will do it, and it prevents edit/wheel wars. But sometimes its a Bad Thing, because like 3RR, when a Bad Action is "clear and obvious" it becomes a problem if it can't be immediately rectified, or it the inability of the admin most aware of the situation to take such action becomes a means to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">play games</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see discussion of whether a "clear and obvious" exception should be included in <a href="../../../b/p/_/WP%7EBP_c8aa.html" title="WP:BP">WP:BP</a>, since this does happen. A proposed wording would be something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Old:</b><br />
Sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>New:</b><br />
Sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute.<br />
Exceptionally, <b>simple and obvious blocks</b> (such as 3RR, and ongoing clear obvious vandalism or spam) are not usually considered to be contentious. In such cases the risk of miscalculation is upon the admin, who is <b>strongly advised</b> to leave it to others to decide whether to block where possible, in order that their judgement does not come under question.</li>

<p>An admin placing a block almost always acts believing their block to be a clear case where a block should be applied. Which is pretty much the reason for the bar on using a block against someone you're in dispute with. Disputes tend to cloud judgement, and this bar should remain absolute. If it's a 'clear and obvious' case, then another admin will make the block. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 19:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Block account creation</span></h2>
<p>According to the instructions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Block anonymous users only prevents anonymous users from the target IP address from editing, but allows registered users to edit. Prevent account creation prevents new accounts from being registered from the target IP address. These options have no effect on username blocks.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This doesn't seem to be the case. I have just recently blocked User:Ronhudson.com due to an inappropriate username, and just received an e-mail that he is unable to register a new account. So what effect do these option have on account blocks? Are they applied to the automatic IP blocks, normally lasting a day? - <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 11:43, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Indefinite Blocks</span></h2>
<p>It seems like there doesn't go a day without a controversy rising up from use of an indefinite period block. Maybe there should be some consideration given to if there should be some restrictions, or review, of placing indefinite blocks? There does seem to be a lot of cases where an indefinite block turns into a de facto ban by inertia.</p>
<p>I can't really think of a reason why an individual admin would ever need to immediately place an indefinite block, even in cases of grave personal threats. A week long, or month long, block could be placed while it was investigated, and then if required, an indefinite block placed. But I think it might be time to start requiring indefinite blocks have approval before being placed, not after. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 23:41, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I think I'd suggest adding the following text as a section bellow the current one on bans.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Indefinite Blocks</dt>
</dl>
<p>An indefinite block is one where the blocks length of term has been set to 'infinite' or 'indefinite' by the admin placing the block. It is very important to note that indefinite blocks are not community bans, and are not intended to remain a permanent block. An indefinite block should eventually be lifted. Admins should be cautious with applying an indefinite block, and they should be the exception with most cases having blocks with set lengths. Generally, an indefinite block should have occurred only after some discussion in a relevant area such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> or <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Blocks that have to be applied immediately should not be applied as indefinite blocks, an indefinite block can be placed later as required.</p>

<dd>Indef blocks on IP ranges are usually avoided, however accounts can be indef blocked if they are vandalism / personal attack only, issue death threats or have inappropriate user names. My understanding is that such blocks can be the subject of an appeal. Personally, I don't think automatically including every single vandalism only account on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> would be a step forwards. Currently, the practice is to raise the cases that involve more judgement and not bother with the very straightforward - I wasn't aware this approach was causing problems. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 20:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Issues over use of an Indef block gets raised pretty regularly now on ANI or RfA, so some better guidance appears needed. Indefinite blocks are the highest restriction an admin can place on an account on their own, so should have had some special guidance.</dd>
<dd>As to if they should have a discussion expected before making an indef block... I really don't think asking admin to make a short note along the lines of</dd>

<dd>somewhere appropriate before making an indef block is a big issue or burden. It doesn't have to be on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, just somewhere it'd get third party review.

<dd>However, that's probably not as important as making clear the difference between an indefinite block and a community ban, and the expectation the indefinite blocks are *not* infinite, and should eventually be removed. Here's a different version without advice to get consensus first.</dd>

Community bans must be supported by a strong consensus and should never be enacted based on agreement between a handful of admins or users." Immediate review on AN/I is a *requirement* of Community Bans, and is not optional. Placing indefinite blocks should not be used as an alternative to this process. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 20:44, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I suggest you reacquaint yourself with actual practice. Impostor accounts, SPA/vandalism accounts and obscene usernames are, de facto, permanently blocked. Threats of physical harm are potentially subject to review and reinterpretation, at least if they're not a SPA. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:46, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The phrase "An account used solely to make personal attacks or vandalise articles" might need to be reformulated because one could otherwise read it as saying that an account which made one edit, which happens to be vandalism, should (almost always) be blocked indefinitely. The last sentence seems to say that indefinite blocks resulting from a ban are permanent; however, the ban is not necessarily permanent. For the rest, I've no strong opinion on the proposal. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Specific attention to indefinite blocks is a good point, and distinguishing <b>1/</b> A long block, for serious misconduct, <b>2/</b> A community ban, and <b>3/</b> An indefinite block that is allowed to slip into a <i>de facto</i> ban mostly due to inertia, is probably worthwhile.</p>
<p>I suggest the following clarification, which is clean and simple: The main distinction between an indefinite block and a community ban could be defined that the former applies to an <i>account</i>, the latter to a <i>person</i>. Thus a <u>community ban</u> applies where the <u>person</u> should not have access again - they attack, they make threats, they are persistently vandalistic or disruptive, they have exhausted patience. An <u>indef block</u> applies to cases where the <u>account</u> should not be used again - it has an obscene name, it's a sock-account in breach of WP:SOCK, it's an account used by a banned individual. Perhaps the policy could simply be along these lines:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The placing of an indef block is limited to very specific cases - either the account itself is unacceptable (without comment on the user), or else it has been placed in respect of a community ban as noted on <a href="../../../l/o/b/WP%7ELOBU_4a0a.html" title="WP:LOBU">WP:LOBU</a> and on <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, and described as such in the block summary.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that an indef block <i>without</i> a community ban would then never need to be appealed, since the person themselves is not prohibited from editing, it is merely that they may not edit through that account. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 13:21, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>An indefinite block is one where the blocks length of term has been set to 'infinite' or 'indefinite' by the admin placing the block.

<p>Indefinite Blocks are almost always appropriate in the following situations,</p>

<li>An account used to make personal attacks or vandalise articles.</li>

<p>Indefinite blocks may be reviewed by other admins at any time, and as with all other blocks should only be applied as precautionary measures not putative ones. Indefinite blocks should only be considered permanent actions against an individual if they are the result of a ban.

<li>That's better, although you should probably add a line about impersonation accounts (e.g. User:Berbario, that kind of nonsense) and probably about socks. It may be useful to make a distinction between simple cases (basically SPAs) that are permablocked almost without exception and without controversy, and actual semi-long-term editors that make threats and such. Basically, abusive SPAs or socks are permablocked, actual editors are not. How's this:</li>

<dd>I think it's important to distinguish indef blocks (apply to accounts) from bans (apply to users). It solves the problem with a "clean" definition of each. Saying that an abusive user can be banned and <i>also</i> that abusive accounts can be indef blocked is unhelpful, it leads directly back to the same problem of confusing/distinguishing a block from a ban. Solution: - A ban is when an <i>individual</i> is prevented from editing. An indef block is when an <i>account</i> is prevented from being used, eg due to inappropriate name, sock use, or to enforce a ban on its owner. An indef block on an account alone (without ban) doesn't exclude an individual from Wikipedia, a ban does. Simple and clear-cut distinction. See above for more detail. <a href="../../../f/t/2/User%7EFT2_b822.html" title="User:FT2">FT2</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic">(<a href="../../../f/t/2/User_talk%7EFT2_8c21.html" title="User talk:FT2">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_FT2_cd1f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)</span></sup> 15:27, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the distinction between accounts and users is what needs to be emphasized in the policy. People can review what they like, but don't let's positively encourage anybody to review indefblocks of, say, abuse-only accounts which existed for 23 minutes and made 16 obscene userpage edits before being permanently blocked, because it's actually counterproductive. If the individual behind an abuse-only account reforms and wants to edit constructively, as one would hope happens sometimes, there's not IMO any need to require them to make public penance, apologize, or carry with them a compromised block log. Let them simply create a new account for a clean start. Secondly, it's undesirable to clog up ANI or <i>any</i> page with these huge numbers of obvious permablocks (even I, who by no means go looking for vandals, have done a crapload of them—I wonder how many are made every day?), as that can only distract from the very important task of <i>review of bans of individuals.</i> I endorse Radiant's version (assuming "putative" is a mere typo for "punitive"?). <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 17:52, 31 January 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Does not helpfully clarify and distinguish a block on an abusive account/user and a ban on an abusive account/user. Gives the effective impression that for the one problem, there is both block and ban, and that both are possible and not clearly distinguished -- but its terribly important to choose the right one anyhow.

<dd>Right now, what I'd look for is something that makes clear indef blocks and indef bans are <i>not</i> the same. Saying that both can be applied to a situation involving an account or user that is "vandalistic" or makes "personal attacks" does not actually help. It just reiterates the undesired impression that we're confused on terminology or use. The key question is, whether an "indef block" used on an "abusive account" is really a ban created/imposed on the person, or a block of the account (but not of valid editing by the same person under other accounts). A block should be of an account, a ban is of an individual. Key distinction, and very simple. Suggested modified proposal:</dd>

<li>I am pretty sure a former admin will have the contacts/knowhow to get themselves unblocked, if it was a voluntary block. E-mail, IRC, many admins even talk to others over telephone. So I wouldn't be worried about it from that angle. Personally, I think self-blocking is a needlessly dramatic way to leave... but sometimes even the best of us just get that upset. I guess Centrx is right that it's instruction creep, if there really are no technical problems with self-blocking anymore. I think there should be <i>something</i> to discourage people from requesting de-sysopping, self-blocking and otherwise trying to burn all their bridges in a huff. Most of the time people regret those actions eventually, sometimes the next day. But it should just be friendly advice, not policy. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 16:28, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I generally agree with W.marsh.

<dd>I have an instinctive dislike of drama. And self blocking is a drama piece... if a person <i>really</i> wants to leave they have a simple remedy, not to visit the URL. Inevitably a significant number will request unblocking or resysopping (if desysopped) when they get past that phase, mood, or reaction (or whatever it is). But as noted, "sometimes even the best of us just get that upset". So the question is between these two views:
<ol>
<li>Self blocking is unnecessary and allowing it will encourage drama only. Don't allow it.</li>
<li>Self blocking is something people may feel they need to do if upset, but not something we need to take note of. Allow <i>temporary</i> self blocking, on the understanding that all such blocks are not considered meaningful to the project and will be unblocked on request if any admin is prepared to do so (ie as long as they don't wear out patience or there isn't a legitimate basis for blocking).</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversial blocks of established users "regardless of the reason"</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Controversial_blocks" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">This section</a> of the policy page says that "blocks of logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions" are controversial "<b>regardless of the reason for the block</b>." (Emphasis is mine.) I'm wondering if 3RR blocks are an exception to that? I can see that an established user with a clean block log might feel quite insulted at being blocked in response to an uncivil comment made to another user, so it would probably not be the best way of dealing with that. But I've been looking at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3RR_4b52.html" title="WP:AN/3RR">WP:AN/3RR</a> (which is how I found this page), and it seems that anyone who makes a fourth revert to an article within 24 hours can be reported and blocked, regardless of that editor's history here. (I note also that an administrator may choose not to block.) I'm reluctant to change the policy page, as it might seem that I'm trying to change policy, but could someone more experienced say if the intention was that 3RR blocks, when applied to established users, should be included in the list of "controversial blocks"? Thanks. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> 21:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, it says they <i>can be</i> controversial regardless of the reason. If you think that isn't clear, feel free to reword. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 11:52, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, because whether a revert should "count towards" 3RR (to use the annoying parlance that policy forces) can be quite controversial sometimes. See the <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">User:RickK</a> block log/leaving drama, he was basically blocked for 3RR as he tried to remove what he considered to be a copyvio from an article. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 15:12, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
