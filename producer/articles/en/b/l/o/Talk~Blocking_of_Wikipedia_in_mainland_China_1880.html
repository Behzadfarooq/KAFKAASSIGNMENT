<p>I was in China a few weeks ago, and Wikipedia was blocked in Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou and Beijing. 76.102.62.11 04:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="Block_due_to_Topics_related_to_Falun_Gong.2C_Tiananmen_Square.2C_Taiwan.2C_Tibet_and_others" id="Block_due_to_Topics_related_to_Falun_Gong.2C_Tiananmen_Square.2C_Taiwan.2C_Tibet_and_others"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Talk%7EBlocking_of_Wikipedia_in_mainland_China_1880.html" title="Edit section: Block due to Topics related to Falun Gong, Tiananmen Square, Taiwan, Tibet and others">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Block due to Topics related to Falun Gong, Tiananmen Square, Taiwan, Tibet and others</span></h2>
<p>In my opinion the block of Wikipedia in China is very simple to explain: In China it is illegal to publish anything related to Falun Gong, Tiananmen Square, the Taiwan and Tibet Issue (and lots of other stuff). Only the state owned media is allowed to publish anything related to that, and what they will normally publish (if at all) is propaganda information that is far away from the truth. By the way, everyone working in a Chinese media company needs to be member of "The Party" (Communist Party). There are strict policies at ISPs (which are also state owned) to enforce these rules. For example, Falun Gong is outlawed in China, and official instructions to media, ISPs and law enforcement is to "protect" the Chinese people from such content by simply blocking it.</p>
<p>To illustrate how this works in a real life scenario with something else than the Internet, I would like to make an example using Hong Kong TV channels. The city of Shenzhen is a special economic zone with its own border within China. The city is located right north of Hong Kong, behind the border to the PRC. There are two reasons why you can still receive Hong Kong TV channels: the city is very close, so you could use an antenna to receive the signals, and the cities (state owned) official cable TV providers (ie. Topway Shenzhen) are also carrying Hong Kong channels. However, when there is a report on one of these HK channels about a topic that China avoids, such as the anniversary of the massacre of Tiananmen Square, the cable TV provider in Shenzhen has simple instructions to cut the signal during the time the report is on air.</p>
<p>They way they do it is simple. They just pre-recorded many old HK government advertisings to play them again and again when they cut something out of the news. Sometimes they even replace the complete program with an old one (not sure if this is due to laziness to cut single fragments of a program). Sometimes they just play the old news from HK instead of today's news. "They" apparently believe that they cut so well and that the people of China are so stupid, that they wouldn't realize anyway.</p>
<p>You have to understand that the official Chinese version of what happened at Tiananmen Square is completely different from what really happened. Just remember the attention that Google received internationally after word was out that Google works with the Chinese government to censor search results in China. There are Wikipedia articles about this. You also need to be aware that these special economic zones such as Shenzhen or Shanghai are not the same as the rest of China. While people in these zones seem rich and have access to technology and media, there are other parts in china that are basically cut off (borders) where they don't have such luxury. People from outside of these zones can't just travel to one of these places. They don't have the necessary ID cards/passports and they could not get it. On the other hand, many of these people from the so-called country side will get a permit if they are working in one of these factories inside the cities.</p>
<p>So to cut this long story right here: the reason why Wikipedia is blocked is because there is lots of content on it that is outlawed in China. It is not only these topics mentioned in the title, but probably plenty of other topics that would go against the government, the party, the leader(s), and historical happenings in the past. If Wikipedia wouldn't have all that, it would probably not be blocked in my opinion. I am not aware of any blocks just because the government wouldn't want Chinese to have access for other reasons that that (comment if you know any).</p>
<p>Feel free to use info from this comment on the main page, but if you do so I suggest adding a few links to other related Wikipedia articles (like to Shenzhen, Tiananment Square massacre, etc). I am normally not involved in such articles but thought to report my own observations from the ground. I travel a lot.</p>

<p>I know that people are not suppose to talk about the topic on the discussion page but I don't know where else to or how else to post/tell about/you people this. I am Chinese, and I think the blocking of the site might also be partly due to its title. Through the translation says its an encyclopedia, the word free might be wrongly translated into 自由 which means freedom/liberal/liberty; not free/free of change. Though I am not sure whether this is done on purpose or not? But translating it to 免费 which means free of charge might help to lift the ban? <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Bethune_fd41.html" title="Norman Bethune">Norman Bethune</a> 02-Dec-05</p>

<dd>The Vietnamese Wikipedia discussed the same issue earlier this year, and a community-wide vote led to the changing of our motto from <i>Bách khoa [toàn thư] tự do</i> (free/<a href="../../../l/i/b/Libre.html" title="Libre">libre</a> encyclopedia) to <i>Bách khoa toàn thư mở</i> (open encyclopedia) to skirt the issue entirely. The point was made that Vietnam's own motto, <i>Độc lập, tự do, hạnh phúc</i>, contains the word "freedom", but we decided to change the motto anyways, since visitors often thought that we weren't fluent in either English or Vietnamese and had mistranslated "free/<a href="../../../g/r/a/Gratis.html" title="Gratis">gratis</a>". –&#160;<a href="../../../m/x/n/User%7EMxn_bd81.html" title="User:Mxn">Minh Nguyễn</a> <small class="plainlinks">(<a href="../../../m/x/n/User_talk%7EMxn_f72c.html" title="User talk:Mxn">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mxn_39ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mxn">contribs</a>)</small> 04:20, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well I've always taken it to mean "free of charge". The more idealistic meaning may appeal to the activist segment of Wikipedians, but that's a pretty small number of people. My guess is that most readers will interpret it in the same non-rheritorical way as I do. 62.31.55.223</dd>

<dd>I don't think it could. Chinese speakers are not drawn from all over the world like English speakers. There is a lack of variety of perspectives among them, and most of them are trained to strictly follow the Chinese Communist Party line, which makes the concept of a "neutral point of view" alien to them. 62.31.55.223 19:33, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have seen so many people like you who are claiming others are biased while their own claims are purely ungrounded. Let me ask you: How many Chinese have you ever met? And how many wikipedia pages created/modified by Chinese have you ever read and classified as biased? So far, your claim is purely an insult to the intelligence of Chinese people and a discrimination based on country and origin indeed.--<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiao_cd5d.html" title="User:Liao">Leo</a> 23:03, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When I was in China last fall (oct-dec), I did notice I was unable to get to the wikimedia sites. Initially, I thought it to be not a huge deal because I had a list of mirrors from <a href="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Copies_of_Wikipedia_content" class="external free" title="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Copies_of_Wikipedia_content" rel="nofollow">http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Copies_of_Wikipedia_content</a> which I could use to get at the information (though of course not make any edits). However, after a few weeks, probably around mid-November, I noticed that access to this list of mirrors was giving me the same errors as when I tried to access Wikimedia sites! Wasn't sure it was worth mentioning in the article, so I'll include it here. I'm no longer in China but will be going back in a few weeks and can confirm this then. --<a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanchuck_4aca.html" title="User:Vanchuck">Vanchuck</a> 22:04, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is very well written and fascinating.

<dd>PRC only has territorial claim on Taiwan (ROC), but it has no power to govern Taiwan, it's a de facto independent country. Why Hong Kong and Macau unfilted? I don't know why the brutal authority shows their lenience on the two regions. plarq</dd>

<p>I am a user in mainland China,I have compelling evidence to suggest that the block is due to topics related to Falun Gong and Tian'anmen Square Incident.The blocking has been lifted because the central government is now technically able to partially block wikipedia entries without interfering with pure-scholastic ones.Attempts to access entries of Falun Gong and Tian'anmen Square Incident will result in immediate "drop out",a phenomenon quite similar to the technic used in google censorship.Also,the user will be denied access to wikipedia for a brief moment. Suffice it to say,the government has realized wikipedia's importance as a knowledge base,and now has the ability to filter certain contents,that is why they have come to the conclusion of partial-unblocking. If you are outside mainland China,try those entries through a Chinese proxy server,that should prove my point.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Photonboi1988 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Photonboi1988_b0f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Photonboi1988">contribs</a>) on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">12 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</small></p>

<dd>I too am a user in Mainland China; personally, it's obvious that the hand of the "great People's Republic of China" is behind this, subjecting its citizens to what we prefer to call call 愚民教育 (translates literally to "stupid people education", which means to feed false information and propaganda to its people to make them "stupid" and "ignorant" of the woes around them). The hypocrisy is vile, and I think this article should be improved upon and given more attention so that we can all give a good laugh at this country; perhaps then they will realize the foolishness of their ways. -"7th Pen" 15:47, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unblock wikipedia in english is a good thing for chinese people, allow chinese people to build their own one will be greater&#160;!

<dd>I beg to differ. Since most mainland Chinese lack the diversity of perspective and liberal education, the completely uplift of the ban could serve more for Chinese government and harmful to NPOV policy of Wikipedia. Image numerous Chinese wiki'ers flooded into every Taiwan-related articles and vow to annex Taiwan by any means. Since a larger proportion of English-speaking mainland Chinese people receive better education and suffer less penalty of Chinese propaganda and lack of international perspective, I suggest adminstrators of Chinese Wikipedia translate more China-related articles of English Wikipedia to 中文 wikipedia. plarq</dd>

<p>and you are making same false accusations justl like what you did on the chinese site.

</ul>
<p>Which of my edits on the Chinese Wikipedia are you concerned about? This is the first time you've ever mentioned this to me. As for the deletion of your edits, this is because you were spamming all of the Village Pump pages, and refusing to discuss civilly, much like what you are doing right now.</p>
