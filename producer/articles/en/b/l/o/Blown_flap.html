<p><b>Blown flaps</b> are a powered <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerodynamic.html" title="Aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> <a href="../../../h/i/g/High-lift_device.html" title="High-lift device">high-lift device</a> on the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing.html" title="Wing">wings</a> of certain <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> to improve the low-speed <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lift_%28force%29.html" title="Lift (force)">lift</a> during <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeoff.html" title="Takeoff">takeoff</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landing.html" title="Landing">landing</a>. The process is sometimes called a <b>boundary layer control system</b> (<b>BLCS</b>). They were a popular design feature in the 1960s, but fell from use due to their complex maintenance needs. Today a simpler version can be found on military <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cargo_aircraft.html" title="Cargo aircraft">transport aircraft</a>, although the term is not widely used.</p>
<p><a name="Mechanism" id="Mechanism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blown_flap.html" title="Edit section: Mechanism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mechanism</span></h2>
<p>In a conventional blown flap a small amount of the compressed air produced by the <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jet_engine.html" title="Jet engine">jet engine</a> is "bled" off of the compressor stage and piped to channels running along the rear of the wing. There it is forced through slots in the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flap_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Flap (aircraft)">wing flaps</a> of the aircraft when the flaps reach certain angles. This air follows the flap profile, aimed downward to provide more lift. The bleed air prevents the boundary layer (slow-moving air that accumulates on the airframe surface) on the upper surface of the flap from stagnating, further improving lift. At low speeds the amount of air being delivered by this system can be a significant fraction of the overall airflow, generating as much lift as if the plane were travelling at much higher speeds. This costs little, during landing at least, as the engine power is significantly reduced anyway. During takeoff the tradeoff is not so obvious, particularly in "hot and high" conditions.</p>
<p>Development of the general concept continued at <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> in the 1950s and 60s, leading to simplified systems with similar performance. The <i>externally-blown flap</i> arranges the engine to blow across the flaps at the rear of the wing. Some of the jet exhaust is deflected downward directly by the flap, while additional air travels through the slots in the flap and follows the outer edge due to the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coand%C4%83_effect.html" title="Coandă effect">Coandă effect</a>. The similar <i>upper-surface blowing</i> system arranges the engines over the wing and relies completely on the Coanda effect to redirect the airflow. Although not as effective as direct blowing, these "powered lift" systems are nevertheless quite powerful and much simpler to build and maintain.</p>
<p>In general, blown flaps can improve the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_767.html" title="Boeing 767">Boeing 767</a> delivers a <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coefficient_of_lift.html" title="Coefficient of lift">coefficient of lift</a> of about 2.8, external blowing improves this to about 7, and internal blowing to 9.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blown_flap.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>During the 1950s and 60s, <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> generally evolved towards smaller and smaller wing <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planform.html" title="Planform">planforms</a> in order to have low drag at high speeds. Compared to the fighters of a generation earlier, they had <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing_loading.html" title="Wing loading">wing loadings</a> about four times as high; for instance the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> had a wing loading of 24&#160;lb/ft² (117&#160;kg/m²) and the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messerschmitt_Bf_109_aa3a.html" title="Messerschmitt Bf 109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> had the "very high" loading of 30&#160;lb/ft² (146&#160;kg/m²), whereas the 1950s-era <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-104_Starfighter_eca8.html" title="F-104 Starfighter">F-104 Starfighter</a> had 111&#160;lb/ft² (542&#160;kg/m²).</p>
<p>One serious downside to these higher wing loadings is at low-speed, where there simply isn't enough wing left to provide lift to keep the plane flying. Even huge flaps could not offset this to any large degree, and as a result many aircraft landed at fairly high speeds, and were noted for accidents as a result.</p>
<p>The major reason flaps were not effective is that the airflow over the wing could only be "bent so much" before it stopped following the wing profile, a condition known as <b><a href="../../../f/l/o/Flow_separation.html" title="Flow separation">flow separation</a></b>. Effectively, there is a limit to how much air the flaps can deflect overall. There are ways to improve this, through better flap design; modern airliners use complex multi-part flaps for instance. However, large flaps tend to add considerable complexity, and take up room on the outside of the wing, which makes them unsuitable for use on a fighter.</p>
<p>The concept was first tested on the experimental <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting_H.126_d847.html" title="Hunting H.126">Hunting H.126</a>. It reduced the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stall_%28flight%29.html" title="Stall (flight)">stall</a> speed to only 32 mph, a number most light aircraft cannot match. The first production aircraft with BLCS was the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed.html" title="Lockheed">Lockheed</a> <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-104_Starfighter_eca8.html" title="F-104 Starfighter">F-104 Starfighter</a>, where after prolonged development problems, it proved to be enormously useful in compensating for the Starfighter's tiny wing surface. It was shortly adopted for <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Aviation_a78d.html" title="North American Aviation">North American Aviation</a>'s <a href="../../../a/-/5/A-5_Vigilante_c5e4.html" title="A-5 Vigilante">A-5 Vigilante</a>, the <a href="../../../f/-/4/F-4_Phantom_a9dc.html" title="F-4 Phantom">F-4 Phantom</a>, the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn_Buccaneer_b919.html" title="Blackburn Buccaneer">Blackburn Buccaneer</a> and the ill-fated <a href="../../../b/a/c/BAC_TSR-2_6b6d.html" title="BAC TSR-2">BAC TSR-2</a>. On the TSR-2 it reduced the takeoff distance for this large and highly loaded aircraft from 6,000&#160;feet (2800&#160;m) without the blowers, to about 1,600&#160;feet (750&#160;m) with them turned on.</p>
<p>When they reached operation, blown flap systems were found to be a maintenance nightmare. They were continually breaking down due to clogging with dirt, and were generally unreliable. As a landing aid then, the system was practically useless on many designs due to poor reliability. On many designs the system was removed from later production runs.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1970s the lessons of air combat over <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> changed the thinking considerably. Instead of aircraft designed for outright speed, general maneuverability and load capacity became more important in most designs. The result is an evolution back to larger planforms to provide more lift. For instance the <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-16.html" title="F-16">F-16</a> has a wing loading of 78.5&#160;lb/ft² (383&#160;kg/m²), and uses <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leading_edge_extension.html" title="Leading edge extension">leading edge extensions</a> to provide considerably more lift at higher <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angle_of_attack.html" title="Angle of attack">angles of attack</a>, including approach and landing. Given the problems with in service and the better lift from the larger wings, blown flaps have generally disappeared. More recent designed fighter aircraft achieve the same improved low-speed characteristics using the technically more complex <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing-wing.html" title="Swing-wing">swing-wing</a> design.</p>
<p>In the 1970s new methods of constructing blown flaps were designed, with the original system becoming known as <b>internal blowing</b>. Two systems of <b>externally blown flaps</b> were developed, both using the direct exhaust of wing-mounted engines on otherwise simple flaps. The amount of thrust from a modern engine means that typical flap designs are "split" near the engine so they don't have to deflect the exhaust, but if you make the flaps strong enough the effects can be tremendous. (The <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airbus_380.html" title="Airbus 380">Airbus 380</a>, because of its massive size, is one of the few major commercial airliners to use externally blown flaps, as evidenced by the lack of a "split" in its flaps behind its engines.) Another modification, <b>over-the-wing blowing</b>, relies on the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coand%C4%83_effect.html" title="Coandă effect">Coandă effect</a> to make the exhaust of an over-wing engine follow the flaps to be deflected downwards. Experimental designs using both of these systems were tested in the 1970s, but have only entered production on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonov_An-72_416c.html" title="Antonov An-72">Antonov An-72</a>, and later the <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-17_Globemaster_III_d81e.html" title="C-17 Globemaster III">C-17 Globemaster III</a>.</p>
