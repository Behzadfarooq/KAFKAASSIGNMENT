<p>This article does not provide a formal/informal/intuitive definition of what a "blob" really is. Right now, a blob can be anything which is detected by any of the corresponding methods. This is of course correct from a practical points of view, but somewhat unsatisfactory from a conceptual/theoretical point of view. I assume that the inventors of these methods had some idea from the outset about what they wanted to detect before they went ahead and constructed a specific detector. This mean that there should be an introductory section about what a blob is.</p>
<p>There should also be a section on the applications of blobs. Otherwise there is no reason for using blob detectors.</p>
<p>If this article is extended in the proposed way, with blob detection as only one aspect, it appears relevant to rename it to "Blob (computer vision)".</p>

<p>Contrary to the suggestion, I do NOT think that it would be a good idea to rename this article to "Blob (computer vision)". The terminology "blob detection" is well established in the field of computer vision, and the article gives an overview of the main approaches to blob detection as they are used today. The terminology "blob detection" is also in close analogy with the terminology "<a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge_detection.html" title="Edge detection">edge detection</a>", for which there is also a good article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, "blob detection" is clearly well established. Also, it the present state I have no problem with the current title. However, I was hoping to be able to tweak this article in the direction of giving a general overview of blobs in general rather than blob detection in particular. I my view, the blob concept is as interesting as a long list of methods for detecting them. --<a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKYN_0594.html" title="User:KYN">KYN</a> 20:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not agree with the previously presented argument in the talk page on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corner_detection.html" title="Corner detection">corner detection</a> that argues that the article <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_%28Computer_vision%29_e854.html" title="Feature (Computer vision)">Feature (Computer vision)</a> should serve as a model for the articles on corner detection and blob detection. From my viewpoint the article on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_%28Computer_vision%29_e854.html" title="Feature (Computer vision)">Feature (Computer vision)</a> is too abstract and not useful at all to unfamiliar readers. Even for familiar readers (to whom I count myself) have substantial problems to appreciate the value of that article. Tpl 15:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have never argued that <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_%28Computer_vision%29_e854.html" title="Feature (Computer vision)">Feature (Computer vision)</a> should serve as a model for the articles on corner detection and blob detection. I just pointed out that it exists and also that, as you have also noticed, it needs additional work. It was previously in a category for computer vision stubs, but later somehow removed, and is currently out there in the void. If you don't like it, change it. --<a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKYN_0594.html" title="User:KYN">KYN</a> 20:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, the article on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_%28Computer_vision%29_e854.html" title="Feature (Computer vision)">Feature (Computer vision)</a> has been rewritten by Serviscope Minor. I think that it is much better now. Tpl 15:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do also find it wrong to say that this article on blob detection provides no formal/informal/intuitive definition of what a "blob" really is. The article says that a blob is a point or a region that is either brighter or darker than the background and that there are two main classes of blob detectors, differential blob detectors and extremum-based blob detectors: For the class of differential blob detectors, three operational blob detectors are described in detail: (i) scale-space extrema of the normalized Laplacian operator, (ii) scale-space extrema of the determinant of the Hessian, and (iii) scale-space extrema of difference of Gaussians. For each of these notions of blob, a precise and fully operational differential geometric definition is given, which directly leads to efficient and robust algorithms for blob detection. Concerning the extremum-based methods, I agree that a more detailed description would be valuable in the article concerning the notions of grey-level blobs and maximally stable extremum regions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The definition "a point or a region that is either brighter or darker than the background" is perhaps relevant but does not capture the idea fully. There are several ways blobs can be used:
<ul>
<li>A small region which is either brighter or darker than the background. In the typical case, a Laplacian based operator can find the center of this region. We get a point as a result. The point describes the location of the blob. I would call this an interest point, but it is based on a blob feature in the image.</li>
<li>A small region defined by any image features which we want to characterize by more than its location, typically by adding information about area or a second order moment matrix. For example, in some cases we cannot make precise measurements of the location of a point and instead describe its location in terms of a blob. Also, if the blob is slightly larger than small, it may be more relevant to detect it by first finding its edge (typically looking like a circle) and then detect the circle from its characteristic orientation pattern. This approach is suitable to detecting cells in microscopy images. As a result, we get a blob (a small set of point) located on each cell. Each blob can then be further process to verify/falsify the hypothesis about a cell.</li>
<li>I have also noticed that Per-Erik Forss√©n exploits the idea of blobs in his thesis. Here, blobs are defined as a representation of general segments condensed into parameters that describe their first and second order moments. Also, the corresponding segments are defined by means of general features (although color is the main feature) which are consistent over scale.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Having written this does not mean that I have a more general definition myself, I was merely hoping that such a definition can be accomplished. --<a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKYN_0594.html" title="User:KYN">KYN</a> 20:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With blob detection (or corner detection) with automatic scale selection, each blob (or corner) feature gets an attibute of scale, which in turn implies a region. In this respect, blob features (and corner features) with complementary scale attributes satisfy both requirements of interest points and regions of interest. I agree that blob descriptors can also be obtained in other ways, such as edge detection (for particularly simple images where almost connected and closed edges can be expected) or different types of segmentation approaches. The resulting methods would however not be referred to or included within the traditional notion of blob detection. Tpl 15:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Such a description, however, requires the use of figures, which I have not been able to find a satisfactory solution for in terms of open copyright-free pictures. If anyone would have the ability to produce these figures, I would be willing to complement on the text concerning the technical definitions. Nevertheless, references are given to the original sources where grey-level blobs and MSER are defined and described in detail, including applications.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What types of figures do you need? --<a href="../../../k/y/n/User%7EKYN_0594.html" title="User:KYN">KYN</a> 20:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would need open and copyright-free pictures that show the necessary illustrations needed to describe the notions of grey-level blobs, grey-level blob trees, scale-space blobs and maximally stable regions. There are illustrative figures in the papers by the original authors on these notions. Tpl 15:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Concerning the application of blob descriptors, I agree that such a description would be valuable for unfamiliar readers. The usefulness of these blob descriptors has nevertheless been strongly demonstrated in previous work on image matching, object recognition, tracking and texture analysis. I will complement the article with a text that is more explicit on this. Tpl 12:11, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now there is a draft article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interest_point_detection.html" title="Interest point detection">interest point detection</a> that makes an attempt to define what should be meant by an interest point and how this notion relates to corners and blobs.</p>
