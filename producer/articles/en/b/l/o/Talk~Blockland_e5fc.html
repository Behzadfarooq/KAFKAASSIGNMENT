<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Talk%7EBlockland_e5fc.html" title="Edit section: Blockland Clans">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Blockland Clans</span></h2>
<p>Blockland features organized groups of users called <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clans.html" title="Clans">clans</a>. The purpose of clans is mostly to have a group of users to play with but as of late, many <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newb.html" title="Newb">newb</a> have started clans merely to boost, fondle, and message their own <a href="../../../e/g/o/Ego.html" title="Ego">ego</a>. Mostly when asked why they started a clan they respond "cuz i was bord lolololololol&#160;:)&#160;:)&#160;:)&#160;:)" and so on and so forth. Here are two examples on newb-ish clans:</p>
<p>+<a href="../../../g/t/a/GTA_4240.html" title="GTA">GTA</a> clan+ This clan was recently started by a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newb.html" title="Newb">newb</a> called GTAROCKS!!!!! Basically they "kill people," and do "street gang type things,". This is a clear example of a newb that takes himself to seriously and forgets that Blockland is a computerized game.</p>
<p>+Jedi+ This clan clearly has too lenient of a recruiting system. The clan is probably the largest in Blockland, featuring 20 members or more; although it is thought to be good to have a big clan, there is a saying that goes "Quality, not quantity". the clan is so large because it lets every single newb join. The clan is overrun with <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbs.html" title="Newbs">newbs</a>.</p>
<p>Not all clans are full of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newbs.html" title="Newbs">newbs</a>, there are some good clans.</p>
<p>+[Ninja]+ The oldest existing clan in Blockland, it was started by Vrutega. Unfortanetly, Vrutega left Blockland and disbanded the clan. "I did not disband the clan. I took a break from blockland and when I came back, my clan fell apart (10/26/05)" After the clan fell, Andi, the last member of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan.html" title="Clan">clan</a> took over and recruited some of the most respectable members of the Blockland community such as Lanhoj, the maker of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Time_ea17.html" title="Age of Time">Age of Time</a>, "Magic Pants" who is known for his pixle art, "RichardCQ, Speckz," the former leader of [Minish], a <a href="../../../z/e/l/Zelda.html" title="Zelda">Zelda</a> based clan, and "Air Foxx". Andi still wants "EnygmaX" and "Mytourdeforce," a Modder,to join. "Snot" has also joined too.</p>
<p>+Myrmidon+ Myrmidon is a clan that was started by "Carlos", "Murasuma," "Goron Leader", and "Otis da HouseKat". Unfortunately, the clan did not attract enough members to last, through. Their alliances included, [Ninja] [Minish] [Shinobi] [IM] and many more.</p>

<p>The above was removed from the article in my recent revert. The existence of clans is worthy of being mentioned, which is why I moved the text here for reference, but the above text is very biased, and has a very informal tone, as well as the self-announced shameless advertising. I don't think it is up to any encyclopedic standards, and that is beyond repair. As I said, though, it's not just nonsense (although a lot of it is), and it would be a valuable addition if done better. Please have a look and see what you can do. --<a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> 21:12, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we ought to decide on how to order the list of mods here. As it is now, it varies in accordance with the opinions of the last anonymous editor (which there are a lot of here) as to which mod is the best. I believe alphabetic ordering is nice, standard and objective. User:MCP has argued in an edit summary that chronological is better, as this prevents people from naming their mod AAA and thus having it placed first. On the other hand, does this matter at all? One could change my surname to "Aaaronson" and get first place in the phone book, or would it indeed matter to anyone? Please discuss, and if there's consensus we'll put a comment in the wikitext to prevent at least some of the anonymous people from trying to order the mods by awesomeness. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 13:18, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Because of the highly volatile state of the Mods community, alphabetical listing would be best. I help make RTB (an add-on pack to blockland), so that would put my mod pretty far backward on the list, but I don't mind. The wiki isn't even noticed much by community members anyway, so I noboddy is probably going to take advantage of using "AAA" in their mod names. Plus, we already have the "AiO" and "BLM" mods before there was even a wiki article, so it's not like there's much else people could do. I vote for alphabetical. <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocheeze_00a5.html" title="User:Mocheeze">Mocheeze</a> 4 November 2005.</p>

<dd>Done. If anyone disagrees, please explain here. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 10:34, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EldKatt the issue here was never about an easier read for the order. It simple was a puerile effort my mocheeze to list his mod (RTB) above TBM out of some childish rivialry. Luckily as you cleverly pointed out, the article "THE" in TBM's name doesn't count as the sorting word. Thank you. MCP 22:40, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, because Mocheeze never considered that when he suggested the alphabetical order. All his, and anyone elses attempts to improve this article are cleverly vieled attempts at insulting you and your mod. It is clear this page should be locked, and you the only one allowed to edit it. You do realise how crazy and obsessed this makes you sound, right? --216.99.124.165 02:23, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Anyone sad enough to talk about Blockland in this way deserves to be shot and put in a crappy clan... I guess it comes down to the fact that Blockland is just for 'n0obs' and you are all too...</p>
<p>I suppose that the best solution would be to lock it completley, or perhaps hand over control the original author of the game, rather then a third party.</p>
<p>^ Retarded suggestion, is completely against what wikipedia stands for. Anyways, I'd like to note that someone deleted the list of game mods avaliable for this game.--136.159.248.174 00:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you want to revert something that a person modifies, please only revert the SPECIFIC parts you think need to be changed. All of the other work of an edit doesn't need to be lost just because you don't agree with one part of it. I'm really tired of seeing, "Blocklanders are a special group of free gamers that need a constantly changing game in order to keep their highly active minds entertained." every time I look at this article just because MCP reverts an entire edit because he thinks one word about TBM was too neutral. So please everyone, do us all a favor and selectively revert? There is a lot that needs to be improved about this article, and reverting it fully only inhibits the revision process. <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocheeze_00a5.html" title="User:Mocheeze">Mocheeze</a> 06:28, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If someone tries to sneak in one biased or untrue statement into their edit, it is safe to assume that all their edits are biased and untrue. Even if you tell 9 truths for every 1 lie it still makes you a liar. MCP 04:11, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fail to see the logical reasoning behind this claim. If I meet one person from Loiusiana who's racist, I should then assume that all people from there are also racist? I hope not. It would do everyone a favor if you would see each change separately. Otherwise you'll just have reverts going back and forth for the entire article. Nobody wants that. I'm not going to correct every single grammatical, spelling, or POV error separately out of fear for you or someone else reverting the entire thing, and I don't think many other people are willing to do that either. <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocheeze_00a5.html" title="User:Mocheeze">Mocheeze</a> 06:16, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's a very counterproductive view, MCP. We should be trying to make a good encyclopedia, not pass judgment and punishment on those we deem to be liars. <a href="../../../e/l/d/User%7EEldKatt_ef11.html" title="User:EldKatt">EldKatt</a> <small>(<a href="../../../e/l/d/User_talk%7EEldKatt_f6fd.html" title="User talk:EldKatt">Talk</a>)</small> 09:14, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is that an indirect admittance to lying, MCP? I hope not, and hope to see unbiased contributions from now on. This goes to EVERYONE reading this. EnCarnate 04:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First off, Mocheeze missed the point entirely. Secondly, I'm not punishing anyone. I am simply reverting a post to a previous one when I read something false or grossly biased, and as for the ever small minded EnCarnate, I don't make these biased contributions or edits that you speak of. I merely revert edits that are incorrect, false or biased, or I change dead external links to working ones. Also I have been known to insert translations of sloppy English in talk entries without changing any of the original poster's words. You guys really need to grow up and stop trying to fight for your right to spout falsehoods about <a href="http://www.thebettermod.com" class="external text" title="http://www.thebettermod.com" rel="nofollow">TBM</a>. MCP 15:49, 16 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What is so difficult about changing one or two words, instead of reverting an entire article? It seems like a reasonable request, no matter what the subject matter is. I've seen you revert massive efforts by users whose sole meaning was to take away all POV from a post, no matter what the bias. Just because an article reports some things that you don't think favors the appearance of your mod (ie. the warning by the Blockland developer not to use TBM), that doesn't make it untrue that he warns of that. It's not "vandalism" to report something like that, because that's really what is happening, for example. <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocheeze_00a5.html" title="User:Mocheeze">Mocheeze</a> 16:43, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mocheeze, the problem here is that you consider the information to be non POV when it is YOUR POV. MCP 00:18, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's funny because I feel exactly the same way about you.&#160;:) Obviously there should be a common ground, I hope. <a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocheeze_00a5.html" title="User:Mocheeze">Mocheeze</a> 23:43, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I can't make POV comments when I have made no comments at all in the entries to which you are referring.MCP 20:21, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is hopeless. Why not lock it and let only some good people edit it?&lt;DARK in a 200kb comp in India , with a billion spywares on every comp, and the IE history folder filled with porn sites, suffering from inhospitible climate.&gt;</dd>

<p>I noticed in the history that people add/remove links to The Better Mod, and upon research it appears to be seen as malicious, so to be safe, I'm going to add a link and put a little warning, hope that's OK. EnCarnate 22:18, 25 November 2006</p>
<p>There is nothing malicious in the TBM code. This is just a hoax spread by feeble coders threatened by TBM, so in order to put an end to that bs, everyone decided it would be best not to mention ANY mod in the wiki article for blockland. You should read above.MCP 08:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Apparently the idiotic debate over RTB and TBM still remains. links have been created to RTB TMB and TBG (The Builder's Game). Iban 00:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The debate over mod was settled long ago. <b>Our consensus</b> was to just remove all reference to individual mods for a few reasons. The mods aren't notable enough to deserve so much of the article to. Also, there's no really good way to determine which mods get listed, and which order to list them in that satisfies everyone's opinion on the subject. I'm proud of how well we ended up handling the situation in the end. All sides came to an agreement, so let's not try and upset the balance when there hasn't been any new relevant happenings regarding the subject of individual mod listings. --<a href="../../../m/o/c/User%7EMocheeze_00a5.html" title="User:Mocheeze">Mocheeze</a> 19:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoops it's not ready.</p>
<p>On the plus side, we've improved everything significantly in the past couple of weeks but that means that we have to make sure things are stable before releasing it. So we're gonna take two weeks or so to make sure everything is stable and throw in a few more good features.</p>
