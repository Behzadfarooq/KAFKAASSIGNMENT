<p>The move of this from "blowfly" to "blow-fly" seems rather pointless, as both, plus "blow fly", are correct, and in common use. Also, according to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>, the <i>most common</i> name should be used, and according to the google hits for <i>"Blow-fly" Calliphoridae</i> (almost 1,000) versus <i>"Blowfly" Calliphoridae</i> (over 6,000), "blowfly", the original name of this article, is by far the most common, and "blow-fly" seems to be even less common than "blow fly". However, since the usage apparently varies partly by what country's English one learned (the OED was the only reference work I found using the hyphenated form [and even it had usage citations using the single-word form]--all others used either one word, or two separate words), I don't want to move it back and start a new 'whose English should we use' can of worms. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 03:44, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey guys, I took the liberty of adding my two cents the blowflies. Unfortunately, Wiki code is still pretty foreign, so my edits are pretty much devoid of links. If someone explains how to insert pictures, it wouldn't be too hard to dig up some photos of several species for the readers.</p>
<p>I know taxonomy is always a sticky subject, but what happened to the Polleniinae? Although we have two genra here in California, I work mostly with Lucilia and Phormia, so I don't know much about about that subfamily, did it get assimilated into one of the other two?</p>

<p>Does anyone mind if I change the taxobox photo to this one? I think it is much clearer than the current one, and doesn't have the reflective background.

<p>I wouldn't if I were you. The current one shows the hairs on the back of the fly, and, your one is a top - down view, and the wings block out the view of the hind legs. Your one looks to much like housefly. Listen --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFREAK_e40f.html" title="User:FREAK">FREAK</a> 08:39, 21 june 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Listen"? Anyway, you can see the hair on the back of my fly, and it has much better focus on the hair on the abdomen. Also, the same number of legs can be seen on both photos. They both have the back legs obscured (acutally, I just noticed you can see the legs through the wings in my photo, and not in the other). --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 12:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have changed it. Your objections don't make any sense, the only way I can figure it, is if you mixed the photos up? --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 14:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspected it meant the southern United States.

<dd>Yes (sigh!), it happens all the time. It is in particular a problem in biology-related articles, as most of the literature focuses on the species of a particular area. For example, in none of my own books on insects, plants, or mushrooms is there any information on whether individual species occur on other continents at all. Makes it pretty hard.</dd>

<p>I am working in an office where many dead squirrels have been found in our ceiling. Now there are dozens of huge flies. Landlord doesn't seem too concerned and the bosses don't care because the flies are not in their offices (which actually have doors). They have removed a few of the dead animals. Obviously not all because the flies and the smells keep coming. The whole situation disgusts me, as well as my coworkers. Can blowflies transmit any kinds of disease to humans?? I am very concerned about this as they are constantly buzzing around us and landing on our persons, desks, papers, etc. Is there anything I could do on a legal level, citing this is an unhealthy environment? Unsanitary at least? Someone please enlighten me...thanks Grossed Out <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.80.147.241_5b60.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.80.147.241">65.80.147.241</a> (talk) 15:10, 25 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
