<p>In <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milestone_Media_4742.html" title="Milestone Media">Milestone Comics</a>' fictional city of Dakota, the <b>Blood Syndicate</b> is a loose affiliation of super-powered individuals brought together by circumstance; 35 issues of their eponymous <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a>, written largely by Ivan Velez, Jr., were published between <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>.</p>
<p>The Blood Syndicate differed from other supergroups in that they were (in Velez's words) "not a team - they're a gang". In fact, they were the surviving remnants of <i>multiple</i> <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_gang.html" title="Street gang">street gangs</a> (thus the name, a combination of "<i>Paris Island Bloods</i>" and "<i>Force Syndicate</i>"), who had gained superpowers in the so-called <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_%28comics%29_15fa.html" title="Big Bang (comics)">Big Bang</a>, and decided to use them for a greater purpose. However, their constant in-fighting, the unsustainability of their methods, and their lack of a central vision (particularly after the death of their first leader) led to the Syndicate's eventual disintegration.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquamaria.html" title="Aquamaria">Aquamaria</a></b> - Maria (last name unknown) survived the Big Bang while floating in the (fictional) James River; as a result, she was transformed into "living water". A former member of the Sociedad de la Cruz gang, she exhibits all the properties of water - for instance, she has survived evaporation and recondensation. She also has substantial control over water in all its forms: she can induce tsunamis and geysers, and shape near-freezing vapor into ice sculptures. Although the physical changes implied in becoming "living water" would seem to be greater than those in becoming "living brick" (though the human body is mostly water), Aquamaria, unlike Brickhouse, does not display any signs of brain damage. The character was renamed "Aqua-Maria" when she appeared in the animated series <i>Static Shock</i>.</li>
<li><b>Boogieman</b>, or <b>Boogie</b> - Martin Berger is able to transform into what is essentially a giant blonde humanoid rat. He is also able to communicate with the hyper-intelligent rats of Dakota (and possibly with ordinary rats), even when untransformed. A post-Texador member, Berger joined the Syndicate during their attack on the S.Y.S.T.E.M. conspiracy, but was nearly expelled when, in the aftermath of the Demon Fox encounter, the other members discovered, after seeing him in his human form for the first time, that he was secretly <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white</a>. This weakened the relationship he had with the rest of the Syndicate: although he was able to recruit their aid when Dakota's hyperintelligent rat population warred with giant man-eating cockroaches, when his mother was trapped in a hospital full of angry inter-dimensional chihuahuas, he chose to rescue her by himself.</li>
<li><b>Brickhouse</b> (or <b>Brick</b>): Marta (last name unknown) survived the Big Bang while pressed up against a brick wall; as a result, she took on its characteristics, becoming a 10-foot-tall, super-strong woman of living brick (complete with mortar lines). Unfortunately, this led to a substantial amount of brain damage, and she was subject both to <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">epilepsy</a> and retrograde <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesia.html" title="Amnesia">amnesia</a> (by the time the series was cancelled, she still did not know her last name). Despite the massive biological changes implicit in becoming "living brick", she was still able to eat, bleed, grow "hair", and conceive a child (her subsequent <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a> may, or may not, have been the result of mystical attack). Her name was inspired by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodores.html" title="Commodores">Commodores</a>' <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul</a> classic, "<i>Brick House</i>". The <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">character</a> "Brickhouse" appeared in the animated series <i>Static Shock</i>.</li>

<li><b>DMZ</b> - DMZ's name is a reference to the Demilitarized Zone between <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. DMZ was one of the most mysterious of the group. He has superhuman strength and durability, and is able to fly; furthermore, his eyes glow. DMZ never speaks (except during <i>Worlds Collide</i> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercompany_crossover.html" title="Intercompany crossover">crossover</a>, when he said the word "Damn"); nor does he ever take off his mask, even to eat. DMZ was somewhat a loner but would always show up when trouble started. His exact origins are not known. He spends his free time atop a bridge, whirling a lamp on a chain in the hopes of signaling to passing extra-terrestrials, and wears what appears to be the uniform of the police officers of <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon_%28comics%29.html" title="Icon (comics)">Icon</a>'s interplanetary civilization; for these and other reasons readers suspected that DMZ was an alien, however, Dwayne McDuffie has said that DMZ is "on his home planet". This seems to be confirmed when Icon asked DMZ to join him (when an alien rescue party arrives for Icon) and he declines.</li>
<li><b>Dogg</b>: Originally Texador's pet dog, Dogg gained human-level intelligence and speech (while remaining a dog in shape, personality, and abilities). First introduced in Issue 2; and in Issue 26 was beaten up and left for dead on the other side of Paris Island from his home - he was found by some kids in Issue 27 and later turned over to a S.Y.S.T.E.M. research facility in Issue 28 and escapes from them. in Issue 33, when he arrived at the Factory, he is shot by Tech-9 (really Masquerade), but is saved by Flashback. When Pyre formed his own Blood Syndicate, Dogg was one of those who rejected the offer to join.</li>
<li><b>Fade</b>: Carlos Quinones Jr., he has the same name as his father and is the brother of Sara Quinones (Flashback). He can fly and pass through solid objects, and frequently has difficulty becoming substantial. He is actually "spread out" over a three-second interval, and is thereby able to, for instance, punch someone and leave them unharmed until after he has left. As was stated in the comic, "Fade isn't what he does, it's what he endures." He is a deeply-closeted <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a>, and may have been in love with Texador (Tech-9). He also has the undeveloped ability to travel back (and possibly forward) in time by significant amounts. A side effect of this ability are the instances of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvoyance.html" title="Clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a> he sometimes displays. The character appeared in the animated series <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Static_Shock_c8dd.html" title="Static Shock">Static Shock</a></i>.</li>
<li><b>Flashback</b>: Sara Quinones, sister of Carlos Quinones (Fade). Flashback can fly and can travel back in time three seconds, an ability she uses to change the past. She considers herself responsible for the welfare of the Syndicate as a whole because she has witnessed (and reversed) their deaths and severe injuries on multiple occasions. She is also a <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html#Crack_cocaine" title="Cocaine">crack</a> addict. She is the inspiration for the character <i>Nina Crocker/Time-Zone</i>, in the animated series <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Static_Shock_c8dd.html" title="Static Shock">Static Shock</a></i>.</li>
<li><b>Holocaust</b> (later <b>Pyre</b>): Leonard Smalls is the illegitimate son of Dakota <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor.html" title="Mayor">Mayor</a> Thomasina Jefferson. A superhumanly strong pyrokinetic, Smalls left the Syndicate after a leadership struggle with Texador, and chose to abandon the small-scale world of gangs for the greater possibilities offered by organized crime. As an initiation ritual, he was obliged to surrender something of great value to him: his name, and the reputation that came with it. Unable to call himself Holocaust, Smalls renamed himself Pyre. As Pyre, he tried to reform a new Blood Syndicate of his own recruiting: BoogieMan, Flashback, Mistress Death, Bad Betty, Fade, Tarmack, Bubbasaurus, and Rocket (who was undercover). Smalls then reclaimed his name - Holocaust.</li>
<li><b>Kwai</b> - one of the two non-Bang Babies in the Blood Syndicate (DMZ being the other), Nina Lam was the 77th - and last - incarnation of a Chinese mystical being. Originally a 9-year-old girl, Lam was mystically transformed into a 7-foot-tall adult woman with albino-pale skin, immensely long hair, and pointed ears. She encountered the Syndicate in the wake of their defeat by the Demon Fox, and thanks to Flashback, survived a booby trap set by John Wing's Demon Fox Tong. After the Blood Syndicate was saved and restored by Nina Lam, now Kwai, she joins the Blood Syndicate and periodically calmed Brickhouse's seizures. Kwai fought along side the Blood Syndicate a number of times and was once shot during a crackhouse raid; while she went into a healing cocoon, Hannibal White (Wise-Son) tortured Kwai's shooter. Later Kwai's healing light changed the Blood Syndicate back to normal for a short time, and learns that she's down to her last life. After Brickhouse and Third Rail leave, Kwai decided to leave, later seen returning to her homeland, the Kingdom of Kwen Lun; meeting with her old friend, the Monkey King, revealing that she needs to ask her father, the Jade Emperor for another life, as she is sentenced to death without reincarnation; ending up in the Kingdom of Ti Yu (hell), Kwai was offered marriage to the Dog God there to save her existence, but decides she can't marry him; finally in a battle royale with the Blood Syndicate against the Demon Fox, Kwai and the Demon Fox destroyed each other.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Masquerade</b>: a shapechanger able to assume the form of any animal (including humans), Masquerade was a woman who concealed her true nature from the rest of the Syndicate by transforming into an idealized male version of herself. (Feeling like a man trapped in a woman's body, Masquerade's use of her powers made her a rarity in traditional comics -- a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexual.html" title="Transsexual">transsexual</a>.) She fled the Syndicate after reflexively stealing several thousand dollars from them, and later returned in the guise of a resurrected Rolando Texador (Tech-9), hoping to be accepted as their leader (whether this was her own idea, or if it was suggested by the Demon Fox, is unknown).</li>
<li><b>Oro</b> is a former police officer who survived the Big Bang as a member of the riot squad. After the Big-Bang he was for a time a member of the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_Cabinet_%28comics%29_9ab4.html" title="Shadow Cabinet (comics)">Shadow Cabinet</a> but was kicked out, and later framed for the murder of his partner from back when he was a police officer, and subsequently sought refuge with the Syndicate. He can fly, and produce blinding visual displays.</li>
<li><b>Tech-9</b> (or <b>Tech</b>): Rolando Texador, formerly leader of the Force Syndicate, had the ability of "talismanic telekinesis" making him able to shoot endless quantities of bullets from any and all guns, with perfect accuracy. He could also materialize guns in his hands; his favorite type of gun was, obviously, the Tech-9 semiautomatic <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handgun.html" title="Handgun">handgun</a>. Charismatic and with military training, he master-minded the Syndicate's formation and led them in their raids on <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">crackhouses</a>; unfortunately, his flesh spontaneously melted off his bones when his superpower destabilized. Later in the series, Masquerade impersonates Tech-9 having sided with the Demon Fox. He is the inspiration for the character <i>Tech</i>, from the <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Static_Shock_c8dd.html" title="Static Shock">Static Shock</a></i> animated series.</li>
<li><b>Third Rail</b>: The son of Korean immigrants, Pui Chung is able to absorb any form of energy, and can use the energy he absorbs to grow in size and strength. He became romantically involved with Brickhouse, and after one too many disputes over Wise Son's leadership, they left the Syndicate and opened a fast-food restaurant together.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/Wise_Son%7E_The_White_Wolf_9545.html" title="Wise Son: The White Wolf">Wise Son</a></b> (or <b>Wise</b>): Hannibal White, leader of the Syndicate after Texador's death and a Black Muslim ("Wise Son" is a <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'anic</a> reference), is invulnerable. Although he is able to, for instance, shave his head (as he did in 1997's <i>Wise Son: the White Wolf</i> miniseries by <a href="../../../h/o/_/Ho_Che_Anderson_d039.html" title="Ho Che Anderson">Ho Che Anderson</a>), he is completely immune from physical harm. He has also shown the ability to resist mental manipulation, and to survive the draining of large quantities of his lifeforce. He is the father of Edmund White, and has sole custody.</li>

<li><b>Babe</b> - Bodyguard of the <i>House of L'Amour</i> beauty salon, and possibly lover to its <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvestite.html" title="Transvestite">transvestite</a> beautician. As a Bang Baby, he resembles a humanoid <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Bunyan_%28lumberjack%29_3ab2.html#Lumberjack_legends" title="Paul Bunyan (lumberjack)">blue ox</a>. Seen in Issue 27 "<i>Possessions</i>" - returning to the House of L'Amour after being held by S.Y.S.T.E.M. (Originally, he was distraught after returning from S.Y.S.T.E.M. with an enhanced -- more muscular -- appearance.)</li>
<li><b>Bubbasaur/Bubbasaurus</b> - Bubba Brown, able to turn into a huge <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur.html" title="Dinosaur">dinosaur</a>-like creature; introduced in Issue 11 as a spurned student going after a high school principal -- Carlos Quinones Sr. (Fade's father) -- though Bubba Brown was seemingly killed in a fight with Fade (Carlos Quinones Jr.) he was picked up by Mom's S.Y.S.T.E.M. troops and is taken to Garden Station.</li>
<li><b>Demon Fox</b> - The Demon Fox is a Chinese mystical being and emotional vampire who first appears in Issue 6. It is awakened by John Wing, leader of the Demon Fox Tong, when he killed his wife in order to unleash the Demon Fox. (This is in response to being humiliated by the Blood Syndicate after failing to kill them.) The Demon Fox finally strikes in Issues 7 &amp; 8 as it tears apart the Blood Syndicate, and brings up the darkest secrets of each Syndicate member. After defeating the group, the Demon Fox kills Wing after granting his wish. Afterward, it is defeated by a newly-transformaed Kwai (previously Nina Lam) who comes to the rescue of the Blood Syndicate. The Demon Fox aided Masquerade in <a href="../../../i/m/i/Imitate.html" title="Imitate">imitating</a> Tech-9 - by giving Masquerade some of Tech-9's essence so she can assume leadership of the Blood Syndicate; in Issue 35 "<i>The Beginning of the End</i>" - in an all-out battle royale between the Demon Fox and Masquerade vs the Blood Syndicate - Kwai and the Demon Fox destroy each other.</li>
<li><b>Edmund</b> and <b>Cornelia</b> - Wise Son's (illegitimate) son and little sister, respectively. They frequently visit him at the factory the Blood Syndicate call home, regardless of the constant danger they place themselves in.</li>
<li><b>Mom</b> - head of the Amber Cell of the S.Y.S.T.E.M./Coalition &amp; heading the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a> into creating custom-made Bang-Babies and controlling them. Mom runs the Garden Station, the command center for the Amber sector of S.Y.S.T.E.M.</li>
<li><b>Templo</b> - Juan Templo; one of the founding Blood Syndicate members, was first seen in Issue 9 "<i>Fade to Back</i>" in December 1993 -- the origin of the Blood Syndicate following the Big Bang is seen; the Blood Syndicate believed Templo was killed -- but in Issue 19 "<i>Collections</i>", Templo is seen alive in a hospital. In Issue 21 "<i>Retrievals</i>" Templo is seen at the Garden Station where he is revived by Mom's scientists, in Issue 24 "<i>Things Fall Apart</i>" Templo along with others (Karess, Babe, Masquerade, Oro, and the Cross Station survivor survived the Garden Station war. In Issue 26 "<i>Prodigals</i>" Templo along with Mistress Mercy and Rose go to the church of Father Francisco.</li>
<li><b>White Roaches</b> and the <b>Rats</b> -- two groups of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermin.html" title="Vermin">vermin</a> who acquired human characteristics during the Big Bang, they are now large, intelligent, and (especially in the case of the White Roaches) hostile.</li>
