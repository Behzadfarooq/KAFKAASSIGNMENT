<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blok_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Blok first appeared as a member of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Super-Assassins_74cf.html" title="League of Super-Assassins">League of Super-Assassins</a>, where he was manipulated by the Dark Man, a clone of <a href="../../../t/h/a/Tharok.html" title="Tharok">Tharok</a>, into attacking the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Super-Heroes_043c.html" title="Legion of Super-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. Blok, possibly the last of a silicon-based species native to the planet <a href="../../../d/r/y/Dryad_%28comics_planet%29.html" title="Dryad (comics planet)">Dryad</a>, had been convinced by Tharok that the Legion was seeking to destroy his home world, when in fact the Legionnaires were working to save it. When he learned that the Legionnaires were not his enemies, he turned on the Assassins and eventually joined the Legion. He knew very little of the rest of his race; it was not even clear to him whether his form was that of an adult or a child.</p>
<p>Blok was relatively slow to acclimate to life in the Legion, though he eventually forged a close bond with two of his teammates, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timber_Wolf_%28comics%29_aa40.html" title="Timber Wolf (comics)">Timber Wolf</a> and the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Witch_%28comics%29_c933.html" title="White Witch (comics)">White Witch</a>, the latter with whom he spent a great deal of leisure time perusing the Legion's voluminous archives. He remained with the team for several years, eventually choosing to leave following the catastrophic Black Dawn affair and the increased scrutiny and suspicion of Earthgov towards all Legion activities. He eventually found his way to the <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppet_Planetoid_99a2.html" title="Puppet Planetoid">Puppet Planetoid</a>, where he spent a few years in isolated contemplation. Shortly thereafter <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polar_Boy_0f6d.html" title="Polar Boy">Polar Boy</a> officially disbanded the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p>
<p>In 2994, Blok's former teammates <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Boy_a262.html" title="Cosmic Boy">Rokk Krinn</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chameleon_Boy_0e33.html" title="Chameleon Boy">Reep Daggle</a> began to reorganize the team, a move which immediately attracted the attention of the corrupt Earthgov. In order to discourage and demoralize the new effort, the alien <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominators.html" title="Dominators">Dominators</a> who had been secretly controlling Earthgov for years hired <a href="../../../r/o/x/Roxxas.html" title="Roxxas">Roxxas</a> to seek out and kill Blok as a warning to his other teammates. Roxxas tracked Blok down to the Puppet Planetoid and carried out his mission with ruthless efficiency, delivering Blok's dismembered corpse to the ranch home of <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning_Lad_003b.html" title="Lightning Lad">Garth</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_Girl_d876.html" title="Saturn Girl">Imra Ranzz</a> on <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winath.html" title="Winath">Winath</a>. Far from demoralizing the other Legionnaires, however, Roxxas's act galvanized them into action, and it was directly following their discovery of Blok's murder than the Legion of Super-Heroes was officially refounded.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blok_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: Powers and Unusual Traits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Powers and Unusual Traits</span></h2>
<p>Blok's abilities fluctuated during his career. Though his enormous size and rocky form suggested super-human strength and nigh-invulnerability, he did not demonstrate such abilities during his first appearance. Rather, he seemed able to absorb various sorts of energy attacks, being specifically immune to <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightning_Lass_222a.html" title="Lightning Lass">Light Lass's</a> anti-gravity powers. (The strongman role among the Super-Assassins was filled by Titania.) In his second appearance, this was specifically stated to be an ability to increase his own mass. This power seemed not entirely under his control; when he joined the Legion, it was stated that three Legion flight-rings were required to lift him. (Why his teammate <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossal_Boy_ede0.html" title="Colossal Boy">Colossal Boy</a>, who could also increase his mass (and size) could make do with a single flight ring, but Blok could not, was never explained.)</p>
<p>During Blok's Legion tenure, it was stated definitely that he had massive super-human strength. Its relative limits were never made clear; he could not match the levels of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">pre-Crisis</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Kryptonians</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lar_Gand_67d3.html" title="Lar Gand">Daxamites</a> or <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Boy_cd4e.html" title="Ultra Boy">Ultra Boy</a>, but seemed stronger than <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timber_Wolf_670a.html" title="Timber Wolf">Timber Wolf</a> and, possibly, Colossal Boy. Contrariwise, his durability was greater than that of the latter two heroes, though still not quite on Kryptonian levels. His recuperative abilities were likewise vague. In his earliest experiences, his body included a collar-like formation around his neck; this was destroyed during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Darkness_Saga_eaab.html" title="Great Darkness Saga">Great Darkness Saga</a> and never regrew, but he seemed unharmed by its lack. Over time, his earlier abilities to change his mass and absorb energy were de-emphasized in favor of his purely physical power. Towards the end of his life he began to mutate into a different form, larger than before and possessed of several protuberances which expelled energetic plasma from time to time. It was speculated that Blok's earlier form had been an immature, possibly larval state, and the changes in his body were actually a metamorphosis like that of a butterfly. Another supposition was that he was reaching maturity and beginning to show signs of that race's indication that he was male. A 20th century Dryandian, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strata_%28comics%29.html" title="Strata (comics)">Strata</a> of <a href="../../../l/2E/e/L.E.G.I.O.N._278d.html" title="L.E.G.I.O.N.">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a>, metamorphosed into a diamond-like version. When asked about the metamorphosis, she replied, "I guess that means I'm female."</p>
<p><a name="Post-Zero_Hour" id="Post-Zero_Hour"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blok_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: Post-Zero Hour">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Zero Hour</span></h2>
<p>Blok did not appear in the post <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Hour_%28comics%29_4444.html" title="Zero Hour (comics)">Zero Hour</a> Legion. A female (presumably immature) Dryadian named <b>Brika</b> was introduced in <i>Legionnaires</i> #71 (May 1999), protesting a group of colonists who intend to re-settle her hibernating clan. She was then possessed by a stone elemental named <b>Rrox</b>, who destroyed the planet, thinking "No-one will ever colonise Dryad now."</p>
<p>Blok, or any other Dryadian, has yet to appear in the current 're-imagining' of the Legion.</p>
