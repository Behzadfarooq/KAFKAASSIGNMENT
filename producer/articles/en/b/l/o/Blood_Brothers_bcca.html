<p>The original production by Willy Russell was written as a school play and presented in 1981. Russell then developed the work into a full blown musical, which opened in the Liverpool Playhouse in 1983, starring <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Dickson_2554.html" title="Barbara Dickson">Barbara Dickson</a>. It was only a modest success. The show transferred to London where it played for only six months or so before closing. Then Bill Kenwright took over the show and following a year long national tour it reopened in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albery_Theatre_9b52.html" title="Albery Theatre">Albery Theatre</a> in London in 1988 before transferring it to the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Theatre_758a.html" title="Phoenix Theatre">Phoenix Theatre</a>, where it has been running since. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Con_O%27Neill_%28actor%29_2843.html" title="Con O'Neill (actor)">Con O'Neill</a>, who played Mickey, was awarded the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award in 1989 (1988 season) for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance.</p>
<p>The production has now passed its 20th year and has developed a cult following.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Brothers_bcca.html" title="Edit section: General">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">General</span></h3>
<p>Willy Russell's tragic tale of a pair of Liverpudlian twins who were separated at birth, who inadvertently and overcoming class differences, become best friends as youngsters. But, after time, their different backgrounds took them to the opposite ends of the social spectrum. Edward became an <a href="../../../o/x/b/Oxbridge.html" title="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> graduated councilor and Mickey ended up both on the dole and in prison for a short while. Both fall in love with the same girl, their childhood friend Linda, which leads them to the fatal conclusion.</p>
<p>The central character of the show was neither of the twins, but really their mother (Mrs Johnstone). It is because of her that they were separated at birth. The twins tragically end up dying at the same time (Eddie accidentally being shot by Mickey in the show whereas in the written play he is accidentally shot by Mrs Lyons as he dives infront of Mickey before Mrs. Lyons shoots him, and Mickey being shot by policemen immediately following this, whereas again in the written play he is then shot by Mrs. Lyons after she realises that she has shot her own "son" ) because at the conclusion of the play, Mrs. Johnstone tells them they were twins, fulfilling the prophecy made by Mrs. Lyons in the first part that twins separated at birth will die when they learn of their brother.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Brothers_bcca.html" title="Edit section: Act 1">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Act 1</span></h3>
<p>The Overture begins, and after a few bars the fire curtain rises to reveal a darkened empty street in Liverpool. Slowly various characters walk on, although at this time we do not know who they are. Two of these figures lay down on red stretchers and are later carried off. A woman (Mrs. Johnstone). sings, "Tell me it's not true, say it's just a story" The narrator then does his narration and says“…lets see how she came to play this part,” The woman turns around and begins to sing “Marilyn Monroe”. We are now about 25 years earlier in the late 1950’s or early 1960’s and the story is told as a flashback. Mrs Johnstone sings of her life beforehand. We learn she was once married but is now a single parent with lots of children. She is pregnant at present but feels she can just about cope with one more child.</p>
<p>In the next scene we see Mrs Johnstone at her workplace. She is a cleaner for an upper class couple, Mr and Mrs Lyons. In a conversation we learn of Mrs Johnstone’s superstition as she tells Mrs Lyons not to put new shoes on the table (this is important as some of the songs are linked to this idea of shoes upon the table). We are also informed that Mrs Lyons is desperate for a baby but is unable to have one, and her husband, who is away working at the moment, does not want to adopt. Mrs Johnstone then finds out she is going to have twins and the next day at her work she is very upset. When questioned by Mrs Lyons she explains that she can't cope financially with two babies and the ‘social’ have been onto her about the ones she's already got. Mrs Lyons then suggests that Mrs Johnstone gives one of the babies to her and the song “My Child” begins. Mrs Johnstone agrees and is made to swear on the bible to keep to the deal. Mrs Johnstone has the twins, but then regrets having agreed to give one away through the song “Easy Terms”. During this song Mrs Lyons appears to collect her baby.</p>
<p>Mrs Johnstone continues to work for Mrs Lyons, however, with Mrs Johnstone's constant attention of her baby, eventually Mrs Lyons feels that Mrs Johnstone is a threat, and she no longer wants her around. When Mrs Lyons fires her Mrs Johnstone decides she will take the baby with her despite having sworn on the bible. In order to stop her Mrs Lyons tells Mrs Johnstone of a superstition that “if twins separated at birth learn that they were once one of a pair they will both immediately die”. The song “Shoes Upon the Table”, sung by the narrator, begins. Mrs Johnstone feels she cant take the baby as she doesn’t want to be a murderer and leaves.</p>
<p>The story then moves on seven years and we meet Mickey, the son Mrs Johnstone kept. Through chance he meets Eddie, the other twin, and after learning they share the same birthday decide to become blood brothers. Mrs Johnstone finds them and sends Eddie away, telling him not to come round again. Later in the day Mickey goes to Eddie's house and Mrs Lyons throws him out. She and Eddie argue on the subject, Eddie swears at her with a word Mickey taught him and Mrs Lyons slaps him, immediately regretting it. The song “Kids Game” follows. Mickey is playing with some neighbourhood children including his friend Linda. Afterwards he takes her to see Eddie and the three of them sneak off to play. The Narrator sings a reprise of “Shoes Upon the Table” as Mrs Lyons tries to find Eddie. Mrs Lyons becomes so worried about the fact that he is mixing with Mickey that she decides to move house and persuades her husband by pretending to be ill. When Eddie says goodbye Mrs Johnstone gives him a locket with a picture of herself and Mickey. Mickey and Eddie then sing the song “Long Sunday Afternoon/My Friend” which segues into “Oh Bright New Day”. The reason it is a bright new day is that Mrs Johnstone and her family are being re-housed in the countryside and during this song they move into their new house. After this the curtain closes on Act 1.</p>
<p><a name="Act_2" id="Act_2"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Brothers_bcca.html" title="Edit section: Act 2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Act 2</span></h3>
<p>The Curtain rises on Act 2 after a reprise of “Bright New Day” acts as en entr’acte which segues into “Marilyn Monroe (Part 2)”. This fills us in on the past 7 years (Eddie and Mickey are now 14). Mrs Johnstone and her family's lives are much improved since moving and they haven’t seen Eddie at all. Mickey has a crush on Linda who is being very obvious in her advances, but Mickey doesn't know how to act with her. Both of them are suspended after mouthing off to their teacher. We then see Eddie’s boarding school and a scene in which he too is suspened, for refusing to give up Mrs Johnstone's locket to a teacher. When he reaches home his mother asks him about it and he wont tell her. The Narrator then sings a reprise of “Shoes Upon the Table”. Later by chance Eddie and Mickey bump into each other in a field, but don’t realise who they are. They sing “That Guy” which shows how they so much want to be like each other.</p>
<p>After the song they realise who the other is and meet up with Linda. The song “Summer Sequence” moves the action to when they are 18 years old. Eddie then sings “I’m not saying a word” which shows that he has feelings for Linda but won’t say anything as he knows Mickey likes her too. After this Eddie leaves for university but not before encouraging Mickey to ask Linda out. During Eddie’s absence a lot happens to Mickey. He discovers Linda is pregnant and they decide to get married; however before this happens he is fired from his job in a factory, which not only forces him onto the dole, but it sends him into depression. Eddie returns at Christmas ready to party and have fun, but Mickey realises that they are now very different and after a small fight with Eddie they part. In order to get money he assists his brother Sammy in a robbery, becomes an accessory to murder, is caught and sentenced to 7 years in prison as Mrs Johnstone sings "Marilyn Monroe (Part 3)".</p>
<p>In prison he becomes chronically depressed and dependent on anti-depressant drugs. When released early for good behaviour, he is still dependent on the drugs, and his relationship with Linda is not going very well. She tries her best to help him but fails. She contacts Eddie, who is now a councillor. Mrs Johnstone sings “Light Romance” as Eddie and Linda have a romantic fling in a park. Mrs Lyons (Eddies "mother") see's them together and tells Mickey. “Light Romance” segues into “Madman” sung by the Narrator. In this song Mickey, distraught over Eddie and Linda's affair, goes ‘mad’ and grabs a gun before storming down to the council offices to confront Eddie.</p>
<p>The final scene is set in the council offices. Eddie is giving a speech when Mickey storms in with the gun. Mickey ponders outloud why, even though they were friends, Eddie has everything and Mickey has nothing, and that the one good thing Mickey had (Linda), Eddie now has the audacity to try and take away. Eddie denies this, trying to calm Mickey down, and the police enter. They tell Mickey that they are armed and to put the gun down. Mrs Johnstone runs onto the stage and, in an attempt to stop Mickey shooting Eddie, tells the two brothers the truth. Mickey despairs that he wasn't the one given away, because then he could have been like, or even with, Eddie. He waves the gun in Eddie's direction in his anger and accidentally sets it off, which shoots and instantly kills Eddie. The police shoot Mickey at almost the exact same moment, even though Mickey attempts to shout that it was an accident. (But in the script book, available in book stores, there is an alternative ending, in which Mrs Lyons bursts in and shoots both brothers.). This means Mrs Lyons's superstitious idea has come true, although the Narrator comments that class was more to blame than superstition. The final song is “Tell Me It’s Not True”, during which the entire cast come onstage and sing the final chorus. The curtain then falls.</p>
