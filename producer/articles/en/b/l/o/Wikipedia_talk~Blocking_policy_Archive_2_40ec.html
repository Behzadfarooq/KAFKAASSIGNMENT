<h2><span class="mw-headline">Placing users in danger</span></h2>
<p>I recently blocked a new user account indefinitely under this section of the policy: <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Personal_attacks_which_place_users_in_danger" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking_policy#Personal_attacks_which_place_users_in_danger</a>. There has been some discussion on the mailing list about whether the block was justified, and someone suggested starting a discussion on a talk page instead. Rather than talking in detail about this particular user, it might be more beneficial to look at what kinds of situations this part of the policy covers. The case in point involved an editor, who arrived on Aug 17, posting a list of Wikipedians he believed were Jews to an anti-Semitic website. I felt this potentially exposed the people on the list to religious or ethnic persecution because of the nature of the website, and the fact that some of the user names were real names. Homeontherange blocked the user on Aug 19 indefinitely; <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">Matt Crypto</a> unblocked him on Aug 23; I reblocked him on Aug 23, because Matt hadn't discussed unblocking with the blocking admin. I felt the indefinite block was justified because the user had been here only two days before posting the list, which showed extreme bad faith in my view.

<dd>People have posted to stormfront and vnn calling for the murder of Jews. Thus, posting a list of the "chief Jews" at Wikipedia, as part of a series of postings calling for "recapturing" Wikipedia from the Jews, amounts to putting these people in danger. Blocking is <i>the least</i> we should consider. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 03:17, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading the thread that started this (<a href="http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php?t=225536" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php?t=225536" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, warning: neo-Nazi site) sends shivers down my spine; the cold-hearted rhetoric against "the enemy" leaves no room for doubt that these people exemplify the worst humanity has to offer when it comes to rational cooperation. Yet, if they <i>hadn't</i> been neo-Nazis, but any other extremist POV posting a list and calling for an edit spree on Wikipedia to stamp out some other extremist POV, would the account have been banned on this "endangering Wikipedians" provision? I doubt it. I'm sure calling for the death of your opponents is not an uncommon theme.</dd>
<dd>That said, there is no doubt in my mind that the block was a good idea. People with such POVs aren't capable of cooperating towards NPOV to begin with; they're naked POV pushers, and not ashamed to admit it, though they'll do their best to hide it. We're under no obligation to play good hosts until they abuse our trust. They set out to do that from the beginning. So, ignoring whether policy does or doesn't apply, I say the encyclopedia's better off. If you're not here to cooperate with others in writing an encyclopedia, "regardless of race, color or creed", you should go.</dd>
<dd>One thing I definitely do agree with is Matt's comment on the mailinglist: "I would argue that the blocking admin(s) would have done well to document exactly why this user was banned, complete with URLs, because it's darn hard to find the evidence." Only <i>you</i> can prevent blocking wars. Document why you do what you do before you do it, or people are going to undo it. "I'll take your word for it" doesn't work if the supporting material is all external to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 03:44, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shivers down your spine? I think we should all point and laugh, especially at the following:
<dl>
<dd><i>Many of these articles are quite polished and have a tone of neutral objectivity and an air of authority (they are from an encyclopedia, after all, and everything written has "citations", so it must all be true!). That makes for *very* persuasive propaganda, in much the same way that the most effective indoctrination takes place under the guise of "education" in our schools and universities.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Pot, meet kettle. Perhaps they should follow their own advise (cf <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a>)?</dd>
<dd>I do notice there is a fair amount of whinging that their marginal views (which are easily disproven, and fail to stand under scrutiny) do not seem to get a fair hearing (it's a Jewish plot I tell you!) yet at the same time they would like to game the system themselves. If you notice that someone is adding neo-nazi propaganda in Wikipedia: demand sources, then refute as quickly as possible. It shouldn't be hard. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 09:23, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're only here to write an encyclopedia. People who come here with other agendas are not needed as editors. In this instance, the editor made a very clear announcement that he intended to target certain users, and invited others on a violence-glorifying webforum to do the same. The only possible reason that I can see for not blocking this account is that it is now well-known and therefore easily checked. However that is a very small benefit when compared to the strongly implied threat. In reading over other posting to that forum, I see many users complain about how unwelcome they have felt here, and how quickly their edits are reverted. That is a reputation that I think we should uphold. The good editors of Wikipedia are capable of writing NPOV articles on Nazis. We don't need actual Nazis on staff in order to do so.

<dl>
<dd>Where did Amalekite make this very clear announcement that he intended to target certain users, and invited others to do the same? On StormFront, I see him listing people that he believed to be part of a "Zionist cabal", but I don't see him saying that he intended to target people, nor encouraging others to do so. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 09:00, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

</dd>
<dd>This was absolutely the right call. The simple fact, outside of all policy concerns, is that when somebody wants to overthrow the Zionist cabal running Wikipedia and lists the Elders of Wikipedia on a neo-Nazi site, and this is, I think, not a hard concept to grasp, we do not need them here. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:32, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

They're the ones who want to <b>murder</b> people who don't look like them, talk like them, those who aren't as stupid as them. Look, there is NPOV...and then there is agreeing that normal, intelligent, civilized members of the human race need not give any consideration to these vile children of hatred. I will block anyone who uses outright hate speech, anyone who advocates "race" violence, and I will sure as hell block anyone who represents a threat to the life and safety of Wikipedians. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">@</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a>) 04:44, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>User:Amalekite aka <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Linder_e7a0.html" title="Alex Linder">Alex Linder</a>'s advice on the Stormfront site encouraging editors to violate policy by using anonymous proxies, and bragging of doing the same himself, is evidence enough of his intent to disrupt Wikipedia. However, when he put a list of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> on the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> website and encouraged <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">Neo-nazis</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacism.html" title="White supremacism">White supremacists</a> to target them, he was obviously (as outlined in the blocking policy) taking "actions outside the Wikipedia site which expose other Wikipedia editors to political, religious or other persecution by government, their employer or any others". Look at the responses to his post<a href="http://www.vnnforum.com/showthread.php?t=22047&amp;highlight=wikipedia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vnnforum.com/showthread.php?t=22047&amp;highlight=wikipedia" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> on his <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanguard_News_Network_b657.html" title="Vanguard News Network">Vanguard News Network</a>, which also mentions Wikipedia editors by name: <i>"DEATH TO THE JEWS." - Alex Linder</i> and <i>I think it's time for the white man to use a different strategy against these semitic jew mongrels, the days of talking are over, it is time to use physical force against the jewish population</i>. It seems a pretty clear to me that the blocking policy applies here. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:07, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He specifically encouraged people to get a user name and follow the rules, believing that to be the best way to avoid being blocked. I do appreciate the irony of someone declaring that "the days of talking are over" on a friggin' <i>Internet forum</i>.

<dd>I think Chupacupcake's idea was that the person who called our notice to the posts on Stormfront/VNN effectively "outed" Linder on Wikipedia. Since this outing occurred Alex Linder has been the subject of some remarks which might be understood as personal attacks, or even threats against his person. One could then try to draw an analogy between Linder's "outing" on Wikipedia and Linder's posting of Wikipedia user pages on other fora. Then one could try to argue that the "Personal attacks which place users in danger" policy should either be applied to both cases or neither case. At least that's what I thought Chupacupcake was getting at. The reasoning is, of course, somewhat forced and the two cases are not close analogues. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 16:55, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if I'm allowed to post here, but I just wanted to say I'm absolutely with Func. Actually, <b>I'm shocked that we're actually having this discussion</b>. SlimVirgin absolutely did the right thing. In fact, it bothers me that this is possibly all we can do — this user sounds like a hateful, bigoted violence-mongerer. The thing is, a lot of WPns use their real names, identities, contact info etc on this site. Bringing this info specifically to the attention of a bunch of psycho neonazi assholes is absolutely not something WP should condone — which is what it does if it does not immediately and completely revoke membership to our site.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 23:24:06, 2005-08-26 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Stormfront post in question did not call for violence against anyone. This is what it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The following is an incomplete list of those suspected to be members of, or to be the "useful idiots" of, the so-called "Elders of Wikipedia" (the Zionist cabal which has Wikipedia in its grip). Those at the top of the list are definite members and are the most ruthless and vicious of the bunch; those at the bottom I'm less sure about. Monitor the activities of the first 5 on the list (watch their user contribution pages and their user talk pages) and you'll have a good idea of what the entire gang is up to.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is not a threat. Nor is it, I believe, an action exposing any Wikipedian to danger. For one thing no information is made public that isn't already public. But even if this policy did apply, and I can accept that reasonable people can hold that opinion, it calls for a block "for a period of time", not an indefinite block.

<dd>On these facts, the block under the endangerment rule was correct. Although the information was public knowledge, in that it was out there somewhere on the Web, specifically bringing it to the attention of the neo-Nazi crowd significantly increased the chance of harassment or worse. The tougher question arises from the hypothetical example given by JRM. I'd like it to be easier for us to get rid of people like this (Nazi or otherwise) even if they don't go so far as to violate the endangerment rule. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 05:46, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Haukurth, I don't mean to insult you, but your commentary strikes me as being rather naive, and I'm fairly certain that your opinion in the matter would be quite different if <b>your</b> name had been posted to a hate group that would rather see you dead. To spell it out: it is a <i>disruption to Wikipedia</i> because it discourages the targeted editors from making contributions to the project, because, you know, we are talking about friggin <b>nazis</b> here. Placing a Jewish name onto such a hate group's mailing list is tantamount to inciting an act of violence. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">Func</a>( <a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Func_dbc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Func">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Func_6e40.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Func">@</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;user=Func" rel="nofollow">&#160;</a>) 06:32, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think blocking someone for posting an information widely available in a site outside Wikipedia, is a good idea. I don't consider the list a threat, I consider it childish, from an immature person. What should be done though, is to have fixed rules on the purposes of talk pages here in Wikipedia. If talk pages are used for what they really meant for, such people could not come here and dump their materials and hateful messages. I've said it for some time now, talk pages should not be used to “prove” or establish a debated truth(I should know, I fell in the trap myself in various occasion). If there is rules for this, and that someone can be banned temporarily or permanently for not respecting such rules, it will leave talk pages clean. Talk pages of articles should be restricted to the subject contained in the article. The debates in the talk page should be about how to present the different positions and not “proving” which one is true. The debates is about the spaces left in the article for each position based on the proportion of people in the Academia(when it applies) that support that position against another etc. And also, when posting materials, those materials should be useful for the subject at hand. For instance, in the entry regarding the Holocaust, a material about the Israelo-Palestinian subject is unwelcome and should be followed by a warning. Fadix 17:48, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm shocked and appalled by these whackos, but I welcome their challenge. They think they're above intelligence, and I submit that they're far below. Let them bring it... As Jimbo says, the "rules" can be changed as needed to deal with these morons. If Jimbo chooses tomorrow to give me admin powers, I'll ban them on sight. Wikipedia will be better off without anyone in the real world hearing a word they have to say. Anyone who says "but wikipedia has credibility problems", I submit to them that it's because Jimbo's been far too lenient in allowing everyone to have a say that has led to the credibility problems. If whacko neonazis hold WP in low regard, I think Jimbo will sleep <i>better</i>, not <i>worse</i>. Time to pull out the blind bully ban stick and send these whack forx back to the hell whence they came. "Die, Nazi Pigs, Die", I say.

<dd>Haukurth, I agree with Func. You don't need to actually call for violence against people when you list them as Jews on a mailing list in which people have called for the extermination of Jews. The participants in the forum already understand what they are "supposed" to do to Jews (and other non-whites). Look at the forums, if you can stomach it.

<dd>I don't believe this user was blocked fairly. First, the obvious stuff: being a Nazi is not a sufficient criterion for an indefinite block. We don't block someone because of what they <i>are</i>, but what they <i>do</i>. Please, let's move past the unhelpful "Nazis are incapable of NPOV" and "Nazi pigs die" and "permablock the bastards for ever" stuff.</dd>
<dd>Initially, the reason given that Amalekite was blocked was that he was trolling and seeking to disrupt Wikipedia; the blocking admin gave this reason: "<i>neo-nazi Troll soliciting other trolls off of Stormfront</i>". However, the admin did not provide any evidence. I've looked, but I have not seen evidence that he incited disruption of Wikipedia before he was blocked, nor do his Wikipedia contributions contain anything that merit an indefinite ban. In his first StormFront post about Wikipedia, he exhorted others to follow NPOV, avoid insults and personal attacks, and otherwise follow Wikipedia rules. From the reason given, it would seem that the initial block was simple anti-Nazism.</dd>
<dd>More recently, the reasoning behind the block has been focused on a list of the "elders" of a hypothetical Wikipedia "Zionist cabal", posted by Amalekite on StormFront. He insulted them a little ("ruthless", "vicious" and "stupid"), but he did not call them Jews (they could either be Jews or "liberal-gentile useful idiots"), nor did he call for them to be attacked or persecuted in any fashion, or at least, not that I can see. It's quite reasonable to argue that he was just showing people evidence for what he believed to be a cabal that was running Wikipedia, so that they would go and correct what they saw as anti-Nazi bias. I'm sorry, but to say that this is a call for violence is just wishful thinking.</dd>
<dd>My personal view is that people's intense feelings about Nazis have coloured their judgment here, and that we're perpetuating a block that has no basis. Frustratingly, this gives weight to Amalekite's otherwise incoherent witterings about anti-Nazi cabalism. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 08:23, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>...or it could just be that Nazism is such an dangerous, offensive, stupid, destructive, vile, unintelligent position to hold that it is not a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">cabal</a> who opposes Nazi, but it is in fact opposed by almost every sane, intelligent and non-racist person who contributes to Wikipedia. I have noticed from my perusal of the StormFront website that the members are outraged when they are forced from a discussion because of their views, and then they focus their outrage on a percieved "cabal" of Jews and their supporters. Yet, I am living proof that this is not the case. I am neither a Jew supporter nor a Jew detractor. I have heard of Jews doing some terrible things in Israel, but I have also heard of terrible things that happened to the Jews by others. I don't think that as a religion/race they are perfect, but on the other hand I don't think they are the scum of the earth either. I submit to the wider community that Nazis are forced from discussions because they contribute nothing to most debates, merely muddying the waters and causing a lot of hatred and consternation among others. I believe that Nazis don't get listened to because their views are not, in fact, worth anything. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 01:38, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rules, precedents and assuming good faith be dammed! SV's actions were the correct, indeed the only correct, possibility. Even if there was no implicit threat, these were POV pushers who were taking matters in an unacceptable personal direction. Does anyone think a remedial short block or a little reason would have changed that? Get real. My only concern would be that this type of common sense measure should not be deployed only in anti-semitic cases (TINC). We've had self-confessed paedophiles here, pushing dangerous agendas and self-promoting. The response from the community was 'freedom of speech is absolute’ – ‘words can't hurt’. But, as I think, as this case demonstrates, at the extremes, common sense has to place some limits on that. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 08:31, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, how about people who, say, think homosexuals should burn in hell? (e.g. religious fundamentalists). Should we ban those preemptively, too? When we start banning people for what they believe, rather than what they do, we've lost the moral high ground. If Amalekite had started expressing hate speech on Wikipedia, or pushing a Nazi POV everywhere, then he should have been banned, no question, everyone agrees with that. If people are willing to follow our rules, then they should be allowed to edit here. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 09:00, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Look at it in context. I must ask why the fundamentalist is saying this - I personally believe 1 Corinthinans 6:9-10 where it says "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God." (NIV). However, if a fundamentalist quoted this out of its context, focussed merely on homosexuality, didn't mention the next version "And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." then I would fully support banning them for offensiveness and stupidity. How, precisely, would it have been out of love that they said this unless they fully talk about the passage? If they used the words that gays would "burn in hell" then I would consider banning them also.</dd>
<dd>BTW, I know that some of you are going to be upset that I agree with 1 Corinthians. To those people I say: I am a Christian and my views do form from the Bible. I would <i>never</i> persecute anyone who is gay, I would never insult them and I would never refuse to be friends with them merely because they <i>are</i> gay. As with any other non-Christian I meet, I feel sad that unless the non-Christian accepts Jesus then they won't make it into the Kingdom of God. I can't think of anything worse. But does this make me stop loving others and being friends with non-Christians? Of course not. That's why I get really angry when I see signs like "God hates fags" - what I believe God hates are the actions of those who stand in the way of his Gospel and who spout out hatred.</dd>
<dd>Sorry for the sermon, but I felt that I had to make this point. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 02:03, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hum, Ok, I probably overstated to make a case. But there are valid questions here. People who say folk should 'burn in hell' don't really trouble me, as they have little control over that matter. But what about people who just say 'homosexuals/blacks/Jews should burn, period? The 'judge on what they do not what they say' distinction never quite works here - most civilized societies recognise 'incitement'. Although, I'll grant whether the case in question constitutes that is doubtful. My first point stands though, this <i>behaviour</i> indicates POV pushing, personal attacks, and is frankly disruptive. That was never going to change, and they were never going to make a constructive contribution to an encyclopedia. A ban, then, is not so much censorship (I wouldn't ban anyone just for <i>being</i> a neo-nazi - if they showed a willingness to try to write NPOV), as it is protecting the smooth running of the project. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 09:28, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to say, I'm not sure that said posting even remotely "puts users in danger". Actually putting a user in danger would require something rather more (such as "James F. goes for a coffee at 10:15 every day from the Café Nero on Tothill Street; kill him!", or reporting someone under a dictatorial regime to the authorities to get them tortured). Certainly, that's how I would read it. Maybe my parsing of English differs from the rest of you, however.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>FWIW, I get death threats semi-occasionally (and general violence threats much more commonly); it's just par for the course of being a sysop (well, certainly, an Arbitrator), and I don't take them that seriously. Whether the nutters want me dead personally, or for being Jewish, an atheist, a monarchist, or whatever, is mildly irrelevent.</dd>

<p>I've read the discussion about this on the mailing list and I find it totally preposterous. You're not supposed to ban someone for what they say on a website unrelated to WP (the only exception I can think of that would be justified would be to abort a planned vandal attack by blocking the user name that was intended to perpetrate it). You're not even supposed to ban someone for what they say on the WP IRC channel. Political views can't be allowed to factor into this (note that, although currently this business about threats is being played up, originally the block was pretty transparently just about getting rid of a Nazi—that was only changed when that justification met substantial opposition). You <i>absolutely cannot</i> ban someone just for being a Nazi. The ArbCom could ban someone for aggressive and persistent Nazi POV pushing, conceivably. But an admin cannot make that decision unilaterally, <i>especially</i> when the user has apparently <i>not</i> been doing anything particularly objectionable on Wikipedia. The logical leaps I have to make to deem this block reasonable are like clearing the Grand Canyon a couple times over. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:24, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems clear that neither side in this debate is arguing in bad faith, out of sympathy with racists, or from a knee-jerk reaction to Nazis. Nevertheless, I find it difficult to see how the actions for which the block was applied can be excused, or seen as anything other than deeply anti-Wikipedian. Even setting aside the moral evil involved (and there's surely no doubt of that evil; NPoV doesn't demand that we give up out moral sense before editing, it concerns only what we write), drawing the attention of the members of an avowedly violent racist organisation to a set of Wikipedia editors in this way is unacceptable. Even if the intention wasn't to incite violence against them, it was certainly to incite opposition to them — and opposition from people whose combined intelligence, sophistication, and sense of fair play wouldn't boil a small kettle. In other words, the intention was to subject the people on that list to pressure from outside; surely we don't tolerate that from a Wikipedia editor? (Unsigned) (Not unsigned — it's just that other editors inderted comments in between my two paragraphs. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a>)

<dd>I can certainly get behind this view, though Im sure you can see the other side of this, that it at least appears to bend the rules to single out whole group based on a supposition of threat. Its hard to argue against that claim on anything but idealistic grounds. But weve tolerated disruptive editors before and found the normal channels suitable for handling them, so being pre-judgemental toward any group seems to be at best practical rather than principled. "Anti-Wikipedian" is vague--just say "POV-pusher" instead. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">St</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">eve</a> 19:09, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, supposing you're correct, we don't block people because they've asked certain Wikipedians to be opposed. The blocking provision that <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> argues above is for actions which put users in personal danger.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I don't agree with your analysis of his intention. It's hazardous to second-guess someone's intention, particularly if you've already decided that they're "evil" to start with (I do believe Nazism is evil, by the way). People have proposed that the motivation behind Amalekite posting this list was to issue a call to violence. I think that's reaching, but it's possible. You could also argue that Amalekite was only seeking to expose (as he sees it) a biased cabal running Wikipedia. That's also possible. But this is the problem: we haven't blocked him because of his actions on Wikipedia; we've blocked him because of how we've interpreted some of his comments on another website. I think this is unsafe. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 09:57, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With regard to Matt Crypto's point: if someone were to put me on a list of people destined to burn in hell, I'd not care; such a list would be an attempt to state an opinion, to describe my future (even if he were to include me in his prayers, begging his god to send me to hell, I'd be no more worried than if he'd sent a letter asking Santa not to bring me any presents). This case is clearly completely different.

<p>Mel puts it rightly here. This must be about disruptive and anti-Wikipedian behaviour and not beliefs. No we don't know the motives - but that goes for any common or garden troll or vandal - we have to judge the likely effect of the behaviour. Frankly, differentiating between what is done inside or outside wikipedia is just wikilawyering. Most organisations recognise 'behaviour which brings the organisation into disrepute', or is 'incompatible with participation' - even if done 'off duty'. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 10:39, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We do normally differentiate between actions separate from Wikipedia and actions that involve Wikipedia. I don't think any sysop would have banned this user if he'd just posted anti-semitic rants on StormFront without mentioning Wikipedia. And I don't think anyone would have had any objection to banning him if he'd have plainly said on StormFront, "let's attack Wikipedia with an army of sockpuppets and bias it towards Nazism. And by the way, here's a list of Wikipedian Jews to do violence on". But the situation is not so straightforward with Amalekite. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 11:19, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stormfront is openly anti-Semitic; Stormfront is violent; posting a list of Jews and "fellow-travellers" to the Stormfront web-site can be nothing other than threatening. The very best that one could say about Amalekite is that he's too stupid or naive to know what he was doing — but no-one has suggested that. it's true that it could have been more straightforward, but the amount of inference needed here is very small (not much more than is needed to infer from someone shouting to a bunch of Klansman: "Hey, that nigger raped my sister!" to the conclusion that he intended harm to the black man at whom he was pointing). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 23:06, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Folks need to consider that in recent years there has been a pattern in the extreme right in the United States of posting names or targeted groups on the Internet followed by physical attacks, arson, and murders. In the case of abortion-providers, a very rare court decision was to block a website that listed the names, addresses, and photographs of doctors, and as they were killed, their photographs were "X"d out. This was found to be outside the protection of the First Amendment. But even if the only outcome would be that "Jews" on Wikipedia were attacked by spamming, or edit wars, it seems to me that the principles of collective morality would demand that we stand up for our product and participants against such attacks.--<a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a> 13:23, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

And if people really are concerned that the Stormfront postings constitute an incitement to attack then banning User:Amalekite does, as far as I can see, nothing to remedy that situation. If anything it would be more likely to aggravate it. Writing to the webmaster of the site, asking him or her to remove the post in question might be a more constructive step.

<dd>Well, before you bluntly stated one could be blocked for <i>any</i> reason or for <i>no</i> reason, so you had me worried. I agree that if someone is doing more harm than good, consistently, then they need to go. However, this is within the context of two other beliefs: 1) Permanent or long-term blocks should be done through a process, which currently exists as the ArbCom; 2) <i>if</i> an admin wishes to make such a block without going through the formal process, it is at least necessary to state one's opinion in advance, that the user needs to go, and try to reach a general community approval of the block. If you can rationally expect anything to be controversial, you need to discuss it before you act. So my thinking is: ideally this should have been taken to the ArbCom, if those advocating a block wanted to pursue it, but barring that, there would at least need to be a general community consensus reached <i>prior</i> to taking this move. It's bad to do something you know will be controversial without putting it to the community for discussion and agreement first. That's inappropriate admin conduct. If it is directly contrary to existing policy, as in this case, then <i>especially</i> so. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:25, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Because of the discussion on the mailing list, I've read every edit of Amalekite on Wikipedia, and every edit as "Frank Sinatra" on Stormfront. I've even read more of VNN than I care to stomach. I've seen the watchlist of Wikipedia members who Amalekite thinks are editing with a POV. I've found evidence of Amalekite thinking Jews control the media, and that Amalekite wants to remove the "Jewish POV" that he sees. I've found evidence of hatred, bigotry, and even a desire to kill Jews in general. I've found a lot of very distateful and disgusting statements. I've found no evidence of real threats, or of placing users in danger. We cannot protect Wikipedia users from every minor fear they ever feel. Life sucks that way sometimes.</p>
<p>Amalekite was clearly blocked for what he believes and his POV, not for what he has done. Fighting bigotry, prejudice and hatred with more bigotry, prejudice and hatred is a poor solution that only leads to moral bankruptcy. This is a moral decision; that our principles apply to everyone equally, even those we dislike the most. Matt Crypto was correct to unblock the account, and he and Haukurth have stated correct views of this.</p>
<p>Had we given this user enough rope, he probably would have hung himself anyway.

If you look at the people who were on the list, you will see thousands of hours of contribution to Wikipedia. In essence, thousands of hours of volunteer work. Having your name put up on Stormfront makes you a target. It doesn't matter whether Linder asks for, or even desires violence against these people. It's a neo-Nazi board where there are people who believe that Jews are a virus that should be destroyed. Some are crazier than others, I suspect.

<dd>The only solution to Guettarda's proposed level of risk is to require everyone to contribute anonymously at all times. It is simply an extreme case of <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wishful_thinking.html" title="Wishful thinking">wishful thinking</a>. Amalekite's list was a list of Wikipedia user names, nothing more. If you read the list and what Amalekite specifically proposed that people do with it, you will see that it was specifically to edit Wikipedia in the name of eliminating the POV bias that Amalekite perceives. Not once did he propose anything other than following behind those editors to review their postings for bias. Not once did he provide any detail of who the people on the list really are, or did he even suggest that it was even possible to find out. If people want to feel safer regarding the information about themselves they've posted online, they should be posting less personal information online. It is not a reasonable to preemptively ban someone based on crimes that they've not only not committed, but have given no reasonable indication that they would ever commit. Hate itself, although distasteful and wrong, is not a crime. But it is equally distasteful no matter which side of the fence you're on. This is a moral and ethical test that I fear most here are failing. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 19:00, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Like any good bleeding heart liberal, I figure there must be some good in them, something worth saving. I don't see much value in hate. I tried hating once upon a time.

But I realised that it cost me too much to hate.</dd>
<dd>I disagree with Unfocused. This is not a pre-emptive ban. It is, like someone said higher up the page, analogous to the situation of abortion doctors. You don't need to say "kill Dr. So-and-So". You just need to post his name to the appropriate forum. Even if I had posted zero personal information about myself here, it would be apparent that I am a Trinidadian, and I am a biologist. My IP address resolves back to my employer. My edit history would make me easy to find. You cannot take Amalekite/Linder's comments without context. It isn't like he posted them to a Society of Friends forum. He posted them to a "white nationalist" forum. These aren't people who get accused on racism and deny it - these are people who embrace the idea. It isn't like neo-Nazis are just boy scouts who like to get together and swap stories. There are people among them who murder judge's families. Wikipedia forbids putting editors in danger. A/L's actions put editors in danger. Thus, they are bannable. I can't fathom why you would defend these actions. Page 1, "death to the Jews". Page 2 "here are some Jews you should keep an eye on". Whether Linder intends it or not, it's easy enough for people to read 2 + 2 as 4. But intent isn't the issue here, since we have no way to speak to intent. But the actions still have the possibility of putting users in danger. In addition to any other actions, someone speaking on behalf of the Foundation should ask Stormfront to remove the postings. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 20:56, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Banning should be for the best of Wikipedia. I don't see how this banning will stop the idiot from talking about Wikipedians in forums. The guy now will get more supports and play the poor victim that was silenced and who was banned because others were “unable” to counter his so-called “arguments.” Wikipedia should not be part of this stupid game. On the other hand, after reviewing the link where the guy posted the information, I find, that his other posts were much worst, and would much more justify a banning than posting a list that isn't much difficult to get. His other posts indicate that the guy is perturbed, and makes us question, if we really need such a member here. But still, this beg to question, how far ones participation in other Internet medium could have repercussions here in Wikipedia. For example, I did myself receive death threats(some of them, from Jew hater disturbed “adult” kids) from some in the past, from forums, and other times I was defamed, from moderators of a forum, they've posted pornography to then accuse me to ban me and kill my credibility. Suppose now that some of those peoples come here in Wikipedia, would they be banned? I mean, Fadi, Fadix etc. are my long used alias back then, the same as the one I use here in Wikipedia. Also, there is a member here, with whom I had “debated” who is the author of a racist site, which slander authors, people and who consider Armenians as cockroaches..., how is the fact that a racist, who is known to own a racist site, will influence the way he will be handled here. I think all this isn't clear, and should be sorted out. Fadix 19:11, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see a consensus forming here. The provision in question stipulates that the Arbitration Committee and Jimbo should be contacted. Presumably the idea is that it's their job to sort things like this out. I would be fine with having them do that. I've personally said just about everything I have to say about this and I'd rather spend time on other editing than repeat myself. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 20:35, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Certainly, it would be nice for Jimbo to come down from his spaceship and make it all better, but that would mean that we've failed in our job to find consensus. Sarah's (new) explanation goes a long way toward justifying the block in my view, but that doesnt change the fact that it needs Arbcom review, which I dont think anyone reasonable should be opposed to. In fact it should be in the block policy! IAC, Sarah shouldnt be made to feel as if she did something wrong, and oversight by both community and Arbcom vote are a normal part of any "provision [that] is rarely used." Those with a bias seem to claim "its a no-brainer -- these are Nazis," but those with more sense can all agree that "this is a no-brainer --nothing special, follow procedure, submit controversial blocks to Arbcom." Many of those in "support" seem to only care more about the results, while those opposed seem to care more about the integrity of the process. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">St</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">eve</a> 21:00, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. I'm certain that Sarah acted in good faith with the aim of benefiting the encyclopedia and the community. I'm also sure she acted in accordance with her understanding of policy. I also agree that the discussion is clearer now that it revolves around the "personal attacks which put users in danger" policy. I still don't think the block is warranted according to that provision but I can accept that reasonable people may disagree. In any case I think the relevant provision should be followed to the letter, insofar as is still possible. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 21:30, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thats not in question, though going by talk pages isnt even a poll, less a vote. And community vote isnt the issue. The issue is proper process for a long-term block. Homey and Sarah were right to act, but then so was Matt. Who reviews? Jimbo? Arbcom needs to review the blocking policy as well as the blocks themselves. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">St</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">eve</a> 21:16, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There has been no vote and this is (fortunately) not VfD.&#160;:) I wouldn't be surprised if you're right, though, that there could be something like a two-thirds majority in favor of the block. I have not, however, tried to categorize and count the opinions of the various people that have expressed themselves on the subject and I don't feel that would be fruitful at this stage. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 21:30, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just want to make clear again that Amalekite was not blocked for his beliefs. There are other (apparent) neo-Nazis editing Wikipedia, and I know who they are. At least one of them has also posted on Stormfront about Wikipedia, and has asked other members of Stormfront to start editing here, and he hasn't been blocked. It's therefore demonstrably false that Amalekite was blocked either for his beliefs, or for asking others who share his beliefs to start editing.</dd>

<dd>Thanks Sarah. You were right to act and now its in the hands of the Arbcom (or according to Kim Bruning, "someone (anyone)") to review your reasons and formalize your decision. They have to determine a) <i>if that list in that context constituted a threat to persons,</i> and b) <i>if disseminating information regarding sockpuppets and circumvention of protections was actually disruptive to Wikipedia (is mere intent enough?)</i> Formal confirmation could be done by the Arbcom on a casepage, rather than on private mail. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">St</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">eve</a> 23:06, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Arbcom formalise? Errr, ok, new task for the arbcom I hear, they'll be so pleased.

<dd>Yes, indeed.&#160;;-) Just to clarify, the blocking policy says that Jimbo and the arbcom must be informed about blocks under the personal-danger provision, but it doesn't say anything about a formal review.

<dd>My psychic between-the-lines translation of the above is&#160;: "They all backed me up privately"&#160;:-\ Doesnt it seem valid to have a <i>public</i> stamp-validation formality anytime when mere sysop blocks become community "bans?" There are a lot of admins these days, and any "bans" we impose should have some formal review which doesnt have to impugn the sysop for the block, but allows for formal correction and validation of any "ban." There are still those two reasons for your block, (<i>points a and b</i> above) but because those are open to some subjective interpretation, a permanent ban is in the realm of the Arbcom and should formally deal with those reasons you gave. Shouldnt it? Or is tacit agreement good enough? -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">St</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">eve</a> 07:23, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>I didn't realize that this whole this is part of the threaded discussion, so I'll just put my 2c here. I just want to say I'm absolutely with Func et al. <b>I'm shocked that we're actually having this discussion</b>. SlimVirgin absolutely did the right thing. In fact, it bothers me that this is possibly all we can do — this user sounds like a hateful, bigoted violence-mongerer. The thing is, a lot of WPns use their real names, identities, contact info etc on this site. Bringing this info specifically to the attention of a bunch of psycho neonazi assholes is absolutely not something WP should condone — which is what it does if it does not immediately, completely and permanently revoke membership to our site.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 23:28:45, 2005-08-26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's Amalekite that is now doing in his pents of laughter. He achieved what any hate mongering would have dreamed of. He got all the attention around him, more so than he could have hopped. Ignoring idiots is the worst thing for them, those sort of people are attention sicking, they starve of attention, and he has obtained what he wanted; bunch of people rounded around this talk page talking about him. When the guy posted the list, the harm was done, and the right thing was to ask gently to the moderators there to delete the thing; but banning him and engaging in a discussion about him has only profited him, nothing positive was obtained from this whole process.

<dd>Thank you for responding so quickly. Various people have expressed their opinion on whether nazis should be pre-emptively banned. Some are in favor, some are not. Sarah, who is the blocking admin, has stated that she is not in favor. I agree and I don't regard it as the reason for User:Amalekite's ban. But it's an interesting discussion in its own right and I'm glad we've had it. As for the reasons Sarah has given for the block I have addressed each of them in detail on the mailing list. I remain of the opinion that the ban should be lifted but I accept that reasonable people can have another opinion. The people you list below have expressed a variety of opinions on this subject and I have read all their contributions here and on the mailing list with interest. Many of them have made good points I had not considered before. I will make every effort to take their views, as well as those of other people participating in the discussion, into account. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 14:05, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find it pecuiliar you feel you can exhibit such a committment while, at the same time, begin that very comment with the very same un-focusing, offtopic preamble I alluded to above. An interesting discussion <i>when</i>? As extended toward what? Interwoven with this specific case in order to make a generalized point? Serving in the interests of clarity as per methodically reviewing and evaluating the pertinent evidence in <i>this specific case</i>? These are the questions that come to my mind, having read closely (as well as posted in) that entire thread on WikiEn-l, and now, here. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 14:55, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was trying to clarify that I consider the discussion on pre-emptively banning nazis and the discussion on whether User:Amalekite's ban is justified to be two separate worthwhile topics. A number of people, however, have expressed the opinion that the fact that User:Amalekite is a nazi is relevant to whether he should have been blocked. That is how the two discussion are interrelated. There is no malicious reason. No-one is trying to derail the discussion. No-one is trying to unfocus the discussion. No-one is trying to disrupt Wikipedia to make a point. No-one has a malicious agenda. I'm sorry that my opinions revolt you but please assume good faith. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 16:31, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I always appreciate good advice. It did occur to me that you were accusing me, in a roundabout way, of not being sensitive to other editors' views and feelings, using circularities, plays on semantics, innuendo, less than goodfaith insinuations and absolutist declarations but assuming good faith I take it you're simply offering some general advice, good to keep in mind in an extended discussion like this. - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukurth</a> 00:29, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I did not intend for that statement to be read in a roundabout way. I think your assumption of what constitutes expressions goodfaith or lack thereof is misdirected in this (and other) intance(s); distortions which are a product of an initial false premise. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 01:23, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've told me I've been trying to unfocus and derail the discussion by making it be about whether Nazis should be banned in general rather than the particular reasons for this ban. This is not so. In fact I have specifically called on people to clearly distinguish these two subjects and not attribute anything to Sarah which she didn't say. See this letter: <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-August/027695.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-August/027695.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> (where I, like an idiot, referred to Sarah as "Rachel").</dd>

<dd>El C -- I presume you would add me to your list, because I've also opposed the blocking of Amalekite. My motivation for doing so is not to make a clever point, or stir, or whatever. Honestly, I oppose this block on the same principles that I oppose Nazism itself; that is, I think the ban was unfair, and perhaps coloured by anti-Nazi prejudice, at least originally. Believe me, I certainly don't enjoy arguing for an individual with such obnoxious views, but I believe that we've made a mistake and done the Wrong Thing(tm). You might disagree, as have many others, but I don't think it's fair to attack those who are arguing on behalf of Amalekite. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 11:45, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Likewise. Next time, please aim towards seeking clarifications rather than entering into blocking war. But I suppose you don't view that, nor the Hit List as an attack and rather you opt to entrench yourself in your position.

<dd>I do regret entering into a blocking war with SlimVirgin (which was brief and quickly apologised for). I don't understand your hostility here, and I think it's not warranted. Please, let's not make this debate any more poisonous than it has to be.

<dd>Sorry, but I am far from satisfied with that response, since it (as well as hitherto elaborations on that position) lacks substantive and concrete qualifications, and instead is expressed mostly through rhetoric, impertinent generalizations and juxtapositions, thereby is seen as acting insensitively to those editors targetted by the list. I have no intention to retract, but I'm willing to withdraw, if how I nuance my position here is being read as inappropriate. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 12:43, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, yes, that's part of the problem. Nazis should be opposed vigorously, but in doing so we should avoid succumbing to what makes Nazism evil in the first place: prejudice and hate. It's argued that Amalekite was blocked because he posted a "Hit List". I'd argue that it's quite a stretch to interpret that list as any sort of call to violence, but that people interpret it that way because of their prejudice. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 12:03, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, that's a simplistic and rigid interpertation which views causality through an unscientific, linear prism. But even without the possibility of <i>physical</i> violence against those on the list, it is demorilizing and despriting for them to be treated this way. Not to mention his call to violate policy through proxy, and the other misconduct.

<p>Oh, come on. Posting a list of supposed Jews on a neo-Nazi site? Perhaps it isn't an explicit 'call to violence', but it is threatening, intimidating and quite unacceptable behaviour (and yes, that is a pre-judgement about the nature of neo-Nazism, if it had been the 'fluffy bunny forum' we'd respond differently). You have concerns about the editing 'rights' of the neo-Nazi, but what about the rights of those on the list to edit here without such intimidation or harassment? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 12:27, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I am really concerned that we are getting too personally involved with the blockee Amalekite here...</li>
<li>The user was not banned for being a neo-nazi. Nor was the block for being a "bad person". Sarah said the block was for "personal attacks which place users in danger" (even though this didn't happen on Wikipedia). So I am not interested in any proof that Amalekite is a neo-nazi or a "bad person". This has nothing to do with the block.</li>
<li>If I write something stupid, opinionated, or non-mainstream on another site I don't want it to affect my "user ban case" on Wikipedia!). Despite the unsavouriness of what was written on the StormFront bulletin board, I think it is healthy for us to have people criticising us off site and if my user name was on this list I would simply feel proud that I was such a prominent contributor to Wikipedia. Perhaps we can try to ignore silly comments like this and develop some resilience.</li>
<li>I think I made it clear I don't care a scrap for a user who would post such hateful stuff, but I'm very afraid of setting a precedent here. This is not about one particular user, it's about how we deal with all cases like this. I don't care that User:Amalekite is apparently a neo-nazi. This is just a label and is unhelpful. A user's actions, ie. edits, are the important thing here.</li>
<li>Also, assuming the block holds, does anyone know what the process would be to get unblocked or is it permanent? If this user was to write on the Stormfront noticeboard "Sorry guys I've changed my mind. Let's edit our own encyclopaedia and leave Wikipedia alone." would the block be lifted?</li>

<p>I haven't added to this conversation because I've said my piece elsewhere, &amp; I'm not sure if repeating it here would be a useful contribution. But reading all of these comments I have noticed something -- an unexpected silence from one specific group. Has anyone heard from Amalekite about this ban? Has anyone significantly involved in this been the target of attacks because of this? SlimVirgin? Jayjg? Anyone mentioned in the infamous "Elders of Wikipedia" list at Stormfront?</p>
<p>If there has been no response, then that would make a large part of this conversation moot, since that would suggest Amalekite isn't as concerned withWikipedia as much as we are about him. If he has approached someone about the ban in a courteous manner, then it might indicate that banning him was an overreaction. If anyone has experienced suspicious activity (e.g., being subscribed to gay porn mailling lists, an old Usenet tactic), then that would be justification for SlimVirgin's block.</p>

<p>He specifically a advised them not to violate our policies, so why would you expect vandalism or gay porn?

<dl>
<dd>Sam, Just because he advised his peers <i>not</i> to act in a harmful way does not mean they would do so, especially as they might think that they have nothing to lose. My example about gay porn is based from personal experience, &amp; was only meant as an example of one possible form of retribution; please note I also asked if anyone had received a more polite contact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And while I deplore web site vandalism, &amp; believe that it was wrong to do this to the "nazipedia" site, I find it hard to feel much outrage over the fact. After all, they reused our material without following the guidelines of the GFDL, failed to remove questionable material like user pages &amp; talk pages, &amp; appeared to overlook the fact that <b>all</b> Wikis attract a certain amount of vandalism. Maybe they'll learn from this experience &amp; their next attempt will be more successful.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Thoughts for next time</span></h3>
<p>Personally, I have very little energy left for defending Amalekite, an individual for whom I have zero sympathy, but whom I think was blocked unfairly. After reading the arguments, I'm afraid I still don't think that posting a list of supposed "Zionist cabal" members is really putting people in personal danger, even if it was posted on StormFront. There appears to be no evidence so far that the users listed were even harassed over the Internet, let alone in real life.</p>
<p>But in practical terms this matters little, I suppose. It's likely (although not certain) that Amalekite would have found himself blocked in the course of things anyway. I would argue that this would have been a better outcome — to let this user "hang himself" by his own actions on Wikipedia. If he was, as people argued, only out to disrupt and troll Wikipedia, this would have rapidly become evident through his edits, and I'm sure nobody would have objected to an immediate ban at that point. And we could have avoided this rather protracted and occasionally poisonous debate. So that's my first thought for next time we have an extremist user arrive: let things run their course, and everyone will be happier about the legitimacy of the (probable) ban.</p>
<p>My second thought is that, in cases like this, it would have been enormously helpful if the block had been documented better, for reasons of transparency and accountability. When this user was first blocked on the 19th of August by Homeontherange, the reason given was "neo-nazi Troll soliciting other trolls off of Stormfront". It was only a week later the "personal attacks putting users in danger" clause emerged explicitly as the solid justification for the block; this reason should have been given straight away. Moreover, it would have helped to provide links to, or better still, quotes from Amalekite's statements on StormFront. To an admin reviewing the block, it's not immediately obvious even that, say, Amalekite and Alex Linder and Frank Sinatra are the same person. It's easy to review contributions to Wikipedia, but off-site is a different matter; I believe some of the StormFront postings were deleted or modified during the course of this debate, so quotes are a good idea.</p>
<p>Some people have questioned the right to even debate this block, and have attacked those who have opposed it. This is unhealthy, and I ask that people avoid doing that.</p>
<p>I apologise once more for unblocking this user without consulting with the blocking admin. Moreover, I realise that I've insinuated a couple of times that this "list of cabalists" reason was only a flimsy pretext for blocking this user, and that the real reason was bare prejudice against Nazis. That was hasty: I have no evidence that this is true, and I'm happy to assume good faith, so I'm sorry about that. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 00:40, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I second your comments and proposals. In particular I hope everyone can get on board with better documentation of blocks. Hopefully we'll all be a bit more careful next time. I've certainly learned a lot about the way Wikipedia works. I wasn't even aware of the "personal attacks which put users in danger" policy until well into this discussion.

<p>Thought for next time: Maybe next time some other Wikipedian will have posted Amalekite's name to a site where neo-Nazis are listed. And then we can ban that other Wikipedian just like we have banned Amalekite. On the same grounds: Some people dislike neo-Nazis so much that neo-Nazis and those identified as neo-Nazis do and should fear assault and battery. Hmmm! But wait a sec! We have identified Amalekite here as a neo-Nazi! So we have already placed him in danger! I have given this careful consideration and reckon anyone who does not agree with the Chomskian point [that one should defend another's right to say what he wants even if the view is not shared] should be taken outside and shot.

<p>I do no such thing. I am not theorising, my argument is practical. You plainly are wrong to identify everyone as agreeing with the banning. There is a majority opinion, but no consensus. But why don't you address the point I make? We only ban those who place others in danger if we agree with the POV of the endangered? Surely not! Not that that is really my point. I just want everyone to be heard, even those I disagree with. Even you, Mr Armchair. It seems you will not pay me the same courtesy.

<dd>I had a problem with the banning based on the list posted, but after reviewing the forum where it was posted, I found out that the other stuff he has posted were much worst, and then, we find out that the guy is really a neo-NAZI(Linder). Let me ask you something. Would you permit someone who screams death to the Jews without even managing himself, participate in Wikipedia? This is not about him thinking Jews or Blacks as inferiors, for all I care what his belief might be... but when it is an idiot that is perturbed enough to make statements asking for war or destruction of a people, I ask myself, why would this guy even want to participate in Wikipedia, a community, whos members he hate? While the first motivation for his banning may be questioned by some; knowing who is hidden under his alias, I don't think this individual should be protected by any members. There is various members debating here about the banning, of who afteral? A hate mongering person that should have no place in here? Just read the other forum, even a moderator from that racist forum questioned his conduct, why should we not? This guy is undesirable, and it was a good riddance, after knowing who he is, the discussion should have ended on this. Fadix 16:31, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm biased, but I strongly support the indefinite blocking/banning of this user. He has stated his intent to push his POV and disrupt Wikipedia. This kind of user should be blocked pre-emptively. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) 18:29, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you read his original, pre-infinite block statements, the motivation he cites is to <i>remove</i> bias, and specifically requested that those who joined him in his mission take care NOT to disrupt Wikipedia. We must recognize that <u>everyone</u> has a POV that they advance, intentionally or not, and that those who participate fairly and within the rules should be welcomed. Then we can address the only possibly legitimate reason for this ban; whether he made any significant threats against anyone or placed anyone in danger, or if indirectly scaring someone is enough to ban him. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 02:39, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've looked through his edits, and, at least to me, they seem to be an attempt at removing bias. He wasn't always very good at this, but I don't think it's fair to say that he was clearly trying to push a POV into articles, rather than bring about NPOV. Before his ban, he wasn't asking people to disrupt Wikipedia. In fact, he explicitly told others on Stormfront to follow Wikipedia rules, write from the NPOV, and avoid insults and personal attacks. His reasoning was that, if they broke the rules, then they'd be giving anti-Nazis an excuse to ban them. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 08:03, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The assertion that he was not asking people to disrupt WP prior to his ban is patently false. In point of fact, since his ban from WP, he's been incredibly quiet on the subject of WP, on both the Stormfront and VNN fora.

<dd>Ouch, please lay off the personal attacks. Back up what you say if what I say is "patently false". Where, before he was banned, was he asking people to disrupt Wikipedia?

<dd>I thought that when you said my claims were disingenuous and "bordered on outright lies", that that was a personal attack. I wouldn't have minded if you'd just stuck to saying they were patently false, but you questioned my integrity, which I think is unfair. But a flame war doesn't serve any purpose here. Honestly, I have looked at what Amalekite wrote on StormFront, and I've tried to keep an open mind. In his delusion, Amalekite imagined a "Zionist cabal" controlling Wikipedia and ensuring it reflected their paricular bias. Certainly, his mindless anti-Semitic witterings were both obnoxious and laughable, but he seemed to be calling for people with similar opinions to go and oppose this purpoted "cabal", but to do so within the rules of the system ("follow the rules of the place", "try to keep a Neutral Point-of-View"). At least, that's how I read it, and I tried to stay open-minded, despite the abhorrence I feel towards Nazism. I think the argument that he made "personal attacks that place users in danger" is much stronger than the argument that he was trying to disrupt Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 09:56, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The passage in question: <i>However, if you're going to join in on editing the Mullins article (which I hope you do), follow the rules of the place - no insults or personal attacks, no Jew-bashing (though they so richly deserve it), try to keep a Neutral Point-of-View (NPOV), and stay cool, no matter how hard they push your buttons. Otherwise, you'll blow your lid and they'll just resort to the classic trick of labelling you an "anti-Semite" or a "neo-Nazi" and using that as a pretext for censoring everything you say.</i> This reminds me of a spy film, in which our heroes, the white supremacists, are undercover in the dangerous Jew-infested Wikipedia: "follow NPOV or you'll blow our cover!" I think it's clear that Frank Sinatra is saying that they should go through all the motions of following the rules, while sneakily countering the so-called Jewish influence on articles. (Also, I'm somewhat disappointed I didn't make the list of elders.) Aside from that, I think it's also possible that Mr. Sinatra is a troll, and not a white supremacist at all. I am led to believe this by the following snippet from the thread: <i>Maybe it's the same thing as when niggers call each other "nigger" (of course, calling each other "nigger" doesn't change the fact that they're, well, niggers, and as such, are about 10 times more likely than a white person to commit a violent criminal offense). Maybe we should start calling each "honkey" and "gringo"?

<p>The block against the above user was valid. A "ban" however was not, as it was imposed only by a sysop action, based on reasons which are debatable. An Arbcom review should be normal procedure, and could either transform the block to a ban, or overturn the block.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Indefinitely Blocking a Troll?</span></h2>
<p>This is a request for a clarification of this policy from someone who is more familiar with its intent than I am. Should an admin be allowed to block permanently or indefinitely a user whom two admins agree is a troll? This user in question is currently the subject of a user conduct RfC. I consider the user to be bizarre. Other editors have characterized him as a troll. However, I disagree with the idea that an admin should be able to block him indefinitely. I see that admins may block named users or IP addresses for vandalism, 3RR, personal attacks, or threats. I do not see "being a troll" as a reason for an admin to block a user indefinitely. If the troll engages in vandalism or personal attacks, the troll can be blocked for that purpose. It was my understanding that the ArbCom was the primary means to deal with trolls. If that is an admin function, then perhaps we can discuss whether that gives 500 admins too much power. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_McClenon_acae.html" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> 19:10, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What policy? My browser tells me that the word "troll" does not appear anywhere on this page (Wikipedia:Blocking policy) and I can't find anything relevant except for disruptive behaviour. The disruptive behaviour provision requires the disruptive behaviour to be objectively defined by other policies. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_troll_2a9e.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a troll">Wikipedia:What is a troll</a> says:</dd>

<p>Indeed, there is no provision for blocking a user simply because he is a troll. However, disruption and vandalism are valid block reasons (though blocks under the former are often disputed); it is the responsibility of the <a href="../../../a/c/_/WP%7EAC_3d3c.html" title="WP:AC">arbcom</a> to deal with more subtle trolling. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 06:48, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>We have never been able to agree on what a "troll" is. Therefore, we have never been able to agree on blocking policies related to "trolls" and "trolling." Many "trolling" behaviors are policy violations and, particularly when a user has made no constructive edits, a case for a block can be made based on this. Less clear cases go to the AC. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 10:49, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
