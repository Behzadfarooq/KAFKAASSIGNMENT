<p>What's this? <i>by a simple <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> test. A <a href="../../../p/h/l/Phlebotomist.html" title="Phlebotomist">phlebotomist</a> pricks the donor's finger and elicits a small drop of blood. This blood is placed into a chemical solution — if the blood is <a href="../../../d/e/n/Density.html" title="Density">dense</a> enough to sink in the solution, there is sufficient iron in the blood to donate.</i> I have never seen this or heard of it. Standard procedure is probably a hemoglobin quickcheck with a hemoglobin photometer. <a href="../../../k/o/s/User%7EKosebamse_5238.html" title="User:Kosebamse">Kosebamse</a> 19:45, 10 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They did it to me. I can't say for sure if the person who pricked my finger was a phlebotomist (I have no idea what it means), or if they were really testing my iron levels, but it appears as though the finger-prick-sink-or-float is one standard way of doing it. I know for sure that different places bandage you differently after the donation, so they aren't absolutely uniform. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaullusmagnus_2744.html" title="User:Paullusmagnus">Paullusmagnus</a> 22:56, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure what a "hemoglobin quickcheck" and "hemoglobin photometer" are. The process described here is how it was done for me the three times I've donated blood (Western <a href="../../../n/y/_/NY_93a2.html" title="NY">NY</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>). It seems very likely to me that different methods are used in different regions of the world, or with different administering agencies. Unfortunately neither the <a href="http://www.givelife2.org/donor/process.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.givelife2.org/donor/process.asp" rel="nofollow">Red Cross page</a> nor <a href="http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/step3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/step3.html" rel="nofollow">Britain's National Blood Service</a> give further details, only saying that "iron content will be checked," so we can't reference it well.

<dd>Watch your US-centricism. Obviously people who have been to Africa can donate blood in Africa, for instance, and the USA is the only place I know that has an outright ban on blood donation from any man who has had sexual contact with another man. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 20:13, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The ban for gay men applies in the UK too. You are tested and may be asked to come back if you've been in a malarial country with in the last 6 months or if you've been in the USA (yes, believe it!) in the last 28 days due to a mosquito that is around during the summer and autumn months. DavidBoden 21:36, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, the public policy justification for these bans is very weak. For instance, the "sexual contact, even once" standard for man-on-man relations excludes even someone who had one gay blowjob with a condom in 1978 and has been tested for AIDS many times, whereas if you had unprotected sex with a prostitute 13 months ago that's fine. Or if you've had unprotected sex with an unlimited number of women of unknown status at any time. The ban on people who have lived in Africa or even had sex with someone who lived in Africa is equally indiscriminate. And it can't be justified on the grounds of simplicity, because the donation questionaires have almost 100 questions, and are extremely detailed. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 20:18, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<p><i>Burns 650 calories</i> may well be true but is hardly a benefit as donors need to eat extra to make up for the lost calories and in my view is an unhelpful way of looking at donation.--<a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJBellis_bd93.html" title="User:JBellis">JBellis</a> 11:32, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I usually feel very tired, sometimes depressed after giving blood. It lasts 1-2 days. I think the feeling you get after donation is very subjective and may also depend on many factors (what you eat, physical activity, etc). In Quebec, you have to wait 56 days before giving blood again. Hopefully! <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugo_Dufort_c2ee.html" title="User:Hugo Dufort">Hugo Dufort</a> 22:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree, and believe the caloric debt should be corrected and restored. First for the correction: if the pint of blood is equivalenced to a literal pound of flesh, that is worth at least 1000 Kcalories based on the equivalent amount of grilled marbled steak. But even that is an underestimate. The most efficient feed-lot animals (chicken or farmed fish) convert feed into flesh with less than 3o% caloric efficiency (just imagine the elaborate biochemistry involved in breaking down foodstuffs and resynthesizing more of yourself.) Thus the caloric debt is plausibly in excess of 3500 Kcal, the very amount which must be lost to shed a pound of weight. Sure the Red Cross gives you a donut or two, but few people treat themselves to the equivalent of a glutton's feast after a blood donation. The relevance of all this in my opinion is that donation at the maximum rate of 6X per year can easily offset the couple of pound upward drift that is common in middle age and beyond. To be sure, so could leaches!</p>

<dd>Blood is a good deal thicker than water! The packed red cell volume in males is 55% and the remaining plasma is 20% protein. By comparison, raw meat has 70% water by volume. I still hold that a pint of blood is a pound of flesh!</dd>

<dd>Where does that 55% figure come from? The article on <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hematocrit.html" title="Hematocrit">hematocrit</a> indicates typical values of 42-52%, and in my (admittedly scanty) experience it's usually towards the low end of that range.

<dd>I'm new to contributing to Wikipedia and won't try to reinsert the line I wrote about calories burned from donating blood without support from others. However, I searched blood donating on Wikipedia specifically for this information and I do think it is a helpful fact to know. While it is true that blood donated must be replenished by eating more, those whose bodies are less sensitive to blood donation may be able to consume additional nutrients more slowly than others, thereby achieving some minor weight loss advantage. More importantly, people on strict diets who count calories and still want to donate blood would find such information useful to know how much they should supplement their diets to compensate for nutrients lost during donation. Am I the only one with this opinion? JBellis, I'd appreciate your response.--<a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimeral_703b.html" title="User:Gimeral">Gimeral</a> 21:26, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I hear that in some countries (e.g. Italy) the session must happen in the morning and the donor is required not to have eaten anything for 12 hours before the donation, supposedly to get "purer" blood.

<dd>... yes in the US they do advise one to arrive on a full stomach&#160;:) so to avoid fainting afterwards maybe -- the donors are generally supposed to be able to drive themselves home after all! and by the way, they also require not to take any caffeine.

<dd>I have donated blood almost every two months in the United States for the past several years, first with the Red Cross and more recently with the NY Blood Center. They definitely do encourage you to eat before donating; the last time I donated they specifically asked about it during the screening. I have <i>never</i> been told to avoid fatty foods and definitely not to avoid caffeine; strange that you mention that, because I have become a coffee addict and definitely had a good bit of caffeine in my system the last time I donated. In fact in all the literature I have read I have not even found any proscriptions against drinking alcohol beforehand either, obviously they are not going to let someone stumble in drunk and donate, but it seems that even if someone had a drink or two beforehand that is acceptable, given the fact that they ask fifty different questions, including if you have taken aspirin in the past two days, they certainly aren't neglecting to ask about fatty foods, caffeine, or alcohol. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 12:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In response to the "{{unreferenced|date=August 2006}}" tag on this section, I took the liberty of rewriting this section. I moved the "check with your local blood bank" sentence to the top of the paragraph to emphasize its importance. I rewrote the description of the requirements a bit, relying specifically on the web sites for several countries' blood banks. If other countries have substantially different requirements from the sources I used, please make the appropriate edits (like you need me to tell you that). I left the "some countries require a fast" sentence in place, even though none of the countries I cited to impose that requirement; I added the "{{citeneeded}}" tag to that sentence. I see that there's a possible cite earlier in this discussion, but I didn't want to add that cite myself since I can't verify the translation. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 22:02, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been trying to find more information about complications and so far the internet has not turned up anything other then bruising. No time duration for bruising or other symptoms are discussed. I also have a hard time believing 1% of people get bruises as for me personally it's more like 25% of the time. Regardless a week ago I gave blood and the last few nights I've been waking up with my arm really hurting. The bruise is also showing a bit of a direction towards my wrist. A slightly injured shoulder above the arm is really starting to hurt in concert with the arm during the night... Could laying down cause an increase in the pain compared to standing? Should I seek medical attention? Has there been anyone else have these kind of symptoms? It would be nice to have more information or a link to more in-depth complication studies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by GeorgeHorlacher (<a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeHorlacher_cc69.html" title="User talk:GeorgeHorlacher">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeorgeHorlacher_b6c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeorgeHorlacher">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I have donated blood a total of six times. Around the fourth time I got mildly light headed and needed to lay down. Now I gave for the 6th time today and I nearly passed out. I was at the point where my hands and feet felt like they were asleep (pins and needles.) While recovering one of the phlebotomists(?) mentioned that some people, once they start getting light headed from donating, actually have a higher chance in the future of passing out and will actually experience a worsening of that complication on subsequent donations. I don’t want to stop donating (as was suggested) so I was looking for information on this. Does anyone know if this is true, and if so maybe it should be included in this section of the article? I'm looking for any research or information on that now and if I find any I'll post it here. --Jeremyh113 19:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A national blood bank is a significant part of a nation's health system, and has to deal with some fairly controversial issues - while things like Hep C and CJD affect every blood service, each organisation deals with those issues in its own ways, and that tends to provide enough of interest to make them notable.

<dd>Yes, I agree with your point that there must be a fair balance, and that flooding with generic external links never seems too good an idea... but, there must be sources cited too, isn't that what wikipedia is about? The solution seems to be, not to just add links to those sites relevant yet only providing some general info, or exacting from the readers lots of extra movements in search of the information, but to cite as precisely as possible only those pages, which corroborate (if not expand upon) the information presented in the article.

<p>When I donated in the USA in 1997, I was given two bar-code stickers and left in privacy to stick the appropriate one on the blood bag (or maybe it was on the paperwork, I don't now recall). The idea was to deal with the danger of at-risk people giving blood just to get a free HIV test - one sticker meant the blood would be tested but not given to patients, the other meant it was OK to use (pending the usual testing). Anybody more familiar with the US donation process feel like mentioning this in the article? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 03:24, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Part of the problem here is that the US has no one standard set of blood procedures. The American Red Cross is a nationwide provider with standardized procedures, so that's a good reference point, but there are regional blood centers where different procedures are used. For example, at the center where I currently donate, patients are not given barcodes in this way. Instead, they are given a phone number that they can call after the donation if the blood should not be used (and several questions asked during the screening procedure emphasize that blood donation is not an appropriate way to get an HIV test). <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 16:20, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just donated today actually. Here in Canada, they have this. After the nurse checks your blood pressure, heart rate, checks your arms for needle marks, asks all the high risk questions etc. etc. they leave the little cubicle and there are two stickers that say "Use my blood" and "Do not use my blood". It's basically just because they know that there will be people who will use blood donation as a means of having themselves tested for STD's and there's really nothing they can do about it. This is just because the tests are not 100% accurate and a person will be able to get themselves tested still but they can anonymously have their blood discarded rather than used, they still get tested but hopefully have the sense to keep others away from such a risk. In Canada all blood donation is handled by Canadian Blood Services, a government organization so everything is standard.</p>

<p>I noticed the article make no mention of fainting, perhaps that should be added.</p>

Agreed, I fainted today too, and I think it is a part of blood donation and should be included. Also, my blood was taken with a bloodmobile, maybe those should be mentioned too.</p>

<dd>The 'Complications' section says: "During or shortly after the donation, hypovolemia may occasionally lead to a drop in blood pressure with some donors experiencing light-headedness or fainting." --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 00:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sure it should be in there. It isn't overly common in healthy individuals, but the lowered blood sugar levels can cause lightheadedness, dizzyness, fainting etc. etc. That's what the cookies and sugar juice are for.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We had a blood drive at my school that I decided to take part in. My blood pressure is already fairly low - it's between 90-120 / 50-60 most days. Before I gave blood, it was 118/56. About five minutes into the procedure, I began feeling light-headed and started to see stars, so I decided I'd ask the nurse "About how light-headed should I feel?" just to double-check. She then told me that I shouldn't be at all, so she quickly disconnected the needle, elevated my legs, and laid my head down flat. Then she gave me cool, damp rags for my head and stomach as well as a can of soda. It was somewhat alarming, but it happened to several other people that day - I noticed one of my friends in the same position as I was leaving the donation area, and before I donated I watched as a nurse laid a girl on the floor and put her feet up on a chair, also placing damp towels on her head and stomach.</p>

<p>I am curious about this topic too. I donate blood regularly, but often I wonder why I should go through this expense of time and discomfort without compensation on the behalf of someone getting a surgery--maybe even a cosmetic surgery--if the person undergoing the surgery has the ability to compensate me for my efforts. I am happy to donate blood to the poor who can't afford it, but why the charity for the rich? I live in the U.S. and most people in this country have more money than I do. There are clearly no widespread ideas that "blood should be free for everyone," because the blood donation agency and the hospital both charge the patient for my blood. --L. Bartlett 03:39, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also think this is an important subject to include (or link to a new article). IMO the selling of blood has played a role in spreading blood born diseases such as HIV (eg injection drug users selling blood to get a fix). It was also an impetus in the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_Management_Associates_Scandal_4acf.html" title="Health Management Associates Scandal">Health_Management_Associates_Scandal</a>. --Mm1972 20:12, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Paying money for blood donations is plain and simple a bad idea. It's unfortunate, but the bottom line is that when you have a process by which people can make money quickly, easily, and without having to sacrifice anything tangible they're going to miss, it attracts a certain demographic. Such a program is more likely to attract members of the lower economic group of society. Statistically, the least well off members of society are far more likely to carry transmitable diseases such as hepatitis, HIV, etc. etc. It isn't unfair or prejudiced anymore than insurance companies charging higher premiums for younger drivers is. It's merely a statistical truth. Plasma donation, at least in Canada whose system I'm familiar with, is a more involved process than blood donation. Under certain circumstances, those who wish to donate must have a physical examination and are put through more rigorous screening than blood donars are.</p>
<p>Here in Canada I think this is solid and sale of blood isn't something up for debate. Due to the private nature of American health care though, I can see it being a different story. But even still, though the testing methods for blood are extremely accurate, as we know, mistakes can always be made. The costs of compensation of patients who have been exposed to tainted blood is absolutely enormous in some cases. So they have to take any possible precaution they can do ensure their sources are safe. That's why they ask all those ultra personal questions ie. "Have you paid for sex.... Have you had sex with another man.... etc. etc." It's all risk assessment.</p>

<p>In Quebec (where I live), we have to wait at least 56 days between two donations <a href="http://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca/anglais/dondesang/qualifidonneurs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca/anglais/dondesang/qualifidonneurs.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Maybe it would be nice to include similar figures for the Rest of Canada, the US, and other countries. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugo_Dufort_c2ee.html" title="User:Hugo Dufort">Hugo Dufort</a> 22:18, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The waiting period is noted in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_donation.html#Recovery" title="Blood donation">Recovery</a> section, although not stating the exact number of days as it may be different depending on the country, blood bank rulings, etc. Such kind of generalized phrasing I think is quite correct here because I don't believe that over-detailing with all the rules from all over would be justified but at the same time, only stating some particular rules from some particular country or place would be a bias that better be avoided. I hope my answer satisfies you but please post further if I missed the point or if you think you disagree.

<dd>Yeah, I think we're better off giving an approximate figure and referring people to their local blood banks for country-specific info. Occasionally it's useful to give a specific country as an example, but we shouldn't expect this article to be exhaustive in detailing every country's requirements. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalair_420b.html" title="User:Calair">Calair</a> 06:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to the cool video here: <a href="http://www.bloodservices.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/E_Discovery?OpenDocument" class="external free" title="http://www.bloodservices.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/E_Discovery?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloodservices.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/E_Discovery?OpenDocument</a></dd>
<dd>Red Cells can be stored refrigerated for 42 days, plasma can be frozen and kept for 1 year, and platelets are kept at room temperature for up to 5 days. It doesn't mention whole blood. Hmm.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, a different page on the same site says 35 days for whole blood. <a href="http://www.bloodservices.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/Blood%20Shelf%20Life?OpenDocument" class="external free" title="http://www.bloodservices.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/Blood%20Shelf%20Life?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloodservices.ca/CentreApps/Internet/UW_V502_MainEngine.nsf/page/Blood%20Shelf%20Life?OpenDocument</a></dd>

<dd>That's in Canada, but it is probably similar in most other countries. 207.81.137.81 21:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They should mail it to you a few weeks after your first donation. If it has been more than a month you might want to call them and find out what's up. 207.81.137.81 19:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
