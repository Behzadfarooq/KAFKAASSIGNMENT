	    <p>The religious concept of <b>blood atonement</b> has different meanings depending on the context of how the term is used. Its symbolism with the law of sacrifice is implied in the Old Testament, Exodus 30:10 and Leviticus 17:11, and with Christ through His suffering and death is stated in the New Testament, Hebrews 9:22 &amp; 13:12 and 1 John 1:7, also Revelation 1:5.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a>, many passages in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a> explain the need for the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the world. For example, in Alma 34:11-17 is written:</p>
<p>"Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay. But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world....</p>
<p>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal. And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance. And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption."</p>

<p>Another use of the term <b>blood atonement</b> is attributed to a controversial understanding of the words of some early <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter-day_Saint_0bda.html" title="Latter-day Saint">Latter-day Saint</a> ("LDS") leaders, particularly <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a>, that the crime of premeditated <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> by one with full gospel knowledge was not atoned for fully by the suffering of Jesus Christ, and that this is why the prophet Noah was commanded, "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man." (Genesis 9:6) Young was quoted as saying that murderers should voluntarily "have their blood spilt upon the ground, that the smoke thereof might ascend to heaven as an offering for their sins."<a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mountainmeadows/atonement.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mountainmeadows/atonement.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The misunderstood concept that was cited as "blood atonement" of murderers was repudiated as never having been an official Church doctrine of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> ("LDS Church"). This concept still has some adherents by other religious groups. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement saying that it neither supports nor opposes capital punishment, and that it is a matter to be decided entirely by civil law.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Those critical of Mormonism suggest that this concept formed the basis for inciting the murders of some early Latter-day Saint apostates, dissenters, and critics. There is evidence that some early members may have used the idea of a blood atonement to justify these murders, but no evidence exists to suggest that Brigham Young even tacitly sanctioned such behavior.</p>

<p>The LDS Topical Guide to the church's standard scriptural works has an entry for "Blood Atonement," which states: "<i>see Jesus Christ, Atonement through.</i>"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Mormon doctrine views the atonement of Jesus Christ as having both a physical and a spiritual aspect.</p>
<ol>
<li>The atonement of Jesus Christ unconditionally saves everyone from physical death, as accomplished by Christ’s death on the cross and his subsequent resurrection. This reverses the death brought into the world through Adam’s transgression. The LDS church teaches that this is a gift given to all men unconditionally: That <i>all</i> men and women will be resurrected.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>The atonement of Jesus Christ saves a person from spiritual death, which is described as a separation from God’s presence, if that individual repents of their sins and keeps God’s commandments. It is this second aspect of Christ’s atonement that is associated with the doctrine of “blood atonement,” which claims that man has the ability to commit some sins “so heinous that Christ's sacrifice is unavailing, but the offender himself may partially atone for his sin by sacrificing his life in a way which literally sheds his blood. The spilling of blood is required because blood is viewed as possessing symbolic religious significance.”<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>

<p>Latter-day Saints view the "unpardonable sin" as a denial of the Holy Ghost after an individual has received a perfect knowledge of God's existence. It is generally accepted that it is not even possible for members to commit such a sin, since they do not posess this level of knowledge. Joseph Smith described this “unpardonable sin” during the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Follett_Discourse_acb6.html" title="King Follett Discourse">King Follett Discourse</a> on April 7, 1844.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All sins, and all blasphemies, and every transgression, except one, that man can be guilty of, may be forgiven; and there is a salvation for all men, either in this world or the world to come, who have not committed the unpardonable sin...What must a man do to commit the unpardonable sin? He must receive the Holy Ghost, have the heavens opened unto him, and know God, and then sin against him. After a man has sinned against the Holy Ghost, there is no repentance for him.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

During this period, church leaders were sent to preach to the people in Utah and surrounding Mormon communities in order to inspire them to reject sin and turn once again towards spiritual things. A number of strongly worded sermons were recorded in which church members were chastised and encouraged to turn back to the proper path. A symbol of this recommitment was for each member to be re<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptized.html" title="Baptized">baptized</a> in order to renew their baptismal covenants.

I do know that there are sins committed, of such a nature that if the people did understand the doctrine of salvation, they would tremble because of their situation. And furthermore, I know that there are transgressors, who, if they knew themselves, and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke thereof might ascend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course. I will say further; I have had men come to me and offer their lives to atone for their sins. It is true that the blood of the Son of God was shed for sins through the fall and those committed by men, yet men can commit sins which it can never remit. As it was in ancient days, so it is in our day."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Now take a person in this congregation who has knowledge with regard to being saved in the kingdom of our God and our Father and being exalted, one who knows and understands the principles of eternal life, and sees the beauty and excellency of the eternities before him compared with the vain and foolish things of the world, and suppose that he is taken in a gross fault, that he has committed a sin he knows will deprive him of the exaltation he desires, and that he cannot attain to it without the shedding of his blood, and also knows that by having his blood shed he will atone for that sin, and be saved and exalted with the Gods, is there a man or woman in this house but would say, 'shed my blood that I might be saved and exalted with the Gods?' All mankind love themselves, and let these principles be known by an individual and he would be glad to have his blood shed. That would be loving themselves, even unto an eternal exaltation. Will you love your brothers or sisters likewise, when they have committed a sin that cannot be atoned for without the shedding of their blood? Will you love that man or woman well enough to shed their blood?...I have known a great many men who have left this Church for whom there is no chance whatever for exaltation, but if their blood had been spilled, it would have been better for them. The wickedness and ignorance of the nations forbid this principle's being in full force, but the time will come when the law of God will be in full force."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>LDS General Authority <a href="../../../b/2E/h/B.H._Roberts_9c18.html" title="B.H. Roberts">B.H. Roberts</a> responded to Young’s statements, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The doctrine of "blood atonement," then, is based upon the scriptural laws considered in the foregoing paragraphs. The only point at which complaint may be justly laid in the teaching of the "Reformation" period is in the unfortunate implication that the Church of the Latter-day Saints, or individuals in that church, may execute this law of retribution. Fortunately, however, the suggestions seemingly made in the overzealous words of some of these leading elders were never acted upon. The church never incorporated them into her polity. Indeed, it would have been a violation of divine instruction given in the New Dispensation had the church attempted to establish such procedure. As early as 1831 the law of the Lord was given to the church as follows: "And now, behold, I speak unto the church: Thou shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come.”<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

We have those amongst us that are full of all manner of abominations, those who need to have their bloodshed, for water will not do, their sins are too deep a dye. You may think that I am not teaching you Bible doctrine, but what says the apostle Paul? I would ask how many covenant breakers there are in this city and in this kingdom. I believe that there are a great many; and if they are covenant breakers we need a place designated, where we can shed their blood. Talk about old clay; I would rather have clay from a new bank than some that we have had clogging the wheels for the last nineteen years. They are a perfect nuisance, and I want them cut off, and the sooner it is done the better... Brethren and sisters, we want you to repent and forsake your sins. And you who have committed sins that cannot be forgiven through baptism, let your blood be shed, and let the smoke ascend, that the incense thereof may come up before God as an atonement for your sins, and that the sinners in Zion may be afraid.

<p>The remarks of Young and other church leaders led to speculation that the doctrine of "blood atonement" had been put into practice. Many of these rumors were centered around a group called the <i><a href="../../../d/a/n/Danites.html" title="Danites">Danites</a></i>. The Danites were a fraternal organization founded by Latter Day Saints in June of 1838, at Far West in Caldwell County, Missouri. The Danites operated as a vigilante group and took a central role in the events of the Mormon War. Joseph Smith eventually condemned the organization, and its leader, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampson_Avard_f085.html" title="Sampson Avard">Sampson Avard</a> was excommunicated from the church. Although the organization ceased to formally exist in Missouri, rumors of its continued existence as a "secret society" continued to surface over the years. Any Mormon militarism or unexplained murder was attributed to the mysterious "Danites," who were said to practice "blood atonement." Brigham Young commented on these rumors in a sermon given on April 7, 1867:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there war in our religion? No; neither war nor bloodshed. Yet our enemies cry out "bloodshed," and "oh, what dreadful men these Mormons are, and those Danites! how they slay and kill!" Such is all nonsense and folly in the extreme. The wicked slay the wicked, and they will lay it on the Saints.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MANIFESTO OF THE PRESIDENCY AND APOSTLES "SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 12th, 1889. To Whom It May Concern: In consequence of gross misrepresentations of the doctrines, aims and practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly called the 'Mormon' church, which have been promulgated for years, and have recently been revived for political purposes and to prevent all aliens, otherwise qualified, who are members of the 'Mormon' church from acquiring citizenship, we deem it proper on behalf of said church to publicly deny these calumnies and enter our protest against them. We solemnly make the following declarations, viz.: That this church views the shedding of human blood with the utmost abhorrence. That we regard the killing of a human being, except in conformity with the civil law, as a capital crime, which should be punished by shedding the blood of the criminal after a public trial before a legally constituted court of the land. We denounce as entirely untrue the allegation which has been made, that our church favors or believes in the killing of persons who leave the church or apostatize from its doctrines. We would view a punishment of this character for such an act with the utmost horror; it is abhorrent to us and is in direct opposition to the fundamental principles of our creed. The revelations of God to this church make death the penalty of capital crime, and require that offenders against life and property shall be delivered up and tried by the laws of the land.’’ We declare that no bishop's or other court in this church claims or exercises civil or judicial functions, or the right to supersede, annul or modify a judgment of any civil court. Such courts, while established to regulate Christian conduct, are purely ecclesiastical, and their punitive powers go no further than the suspension or excommunication of members from church fellowship.

Church historian and later President <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Fielding_Smith_2ffa.html" title="Joseph Fielding Smith">Joseph Fielding Smith</a> taught the following about blood atonement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man may commit certain grievous sins—according to his light and knowledge—that will place him beyond the reach of the atoning blood of Christ. If then he would be saved, he must make sacrifice of his Own life to atone—so far as in his power lies—for that sin, for the blood of Christ alone under certain circumstances will not avail.... Joseph Smith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man may commit, that they will place the transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of Christ. If these offenses are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent.

<p>Joseph Fielding Smith stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he founders of Utah incorporated in the laws of the Territory provisions for the capital punishment of those who wil[l]fully shed the blood of their fellow men. This law, which is now the law of the State, granted unto the condemned murderer the privilege of choosing for himself whether he die by hanging, or whether he be shot, and thus have his blood shed in harmony with the law of God; and thus atone, so far as it is in his power to atone, for the death of his victim. Almost without exception the condemned party chooses the latter death.

</blockquote>
<p>In addition, in his first edition of the book <i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, McConkie opined that because blood atonement requires the "spilling of blood upon the ground", <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_by_firing_squad.html" title="Execution by firing squad">execution by firing squad</a> was superior to execution by <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanging.html" title="Hanging">hanging</a>, which would not suffice to create a blood atonement. At the request of church president <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_W._Kimball_229e.html" title="Spencer W. Kimball">Spencer W. Kimball</a>, this statement was deleted from McConkie's second edition of the book. Regarding this, McConkie commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I can see there is no difference between a firing squad, an electric chair, a gas chamber, or hanging. Death is death and I would interpret the shedding of man's blood in legal executions as a figurative expression which means the taking of life. There seems to me to be no present significance as to whether an execution is by a firing squad or in some other way. I, of course, deleted my article on "hanging" from the Second Edition of Mormon Doctrine because of the reasoning here mentioned.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doctrine was seen by some commentators as one of the reasons why Utah was one of the last three U.S. states to continue the practice of execution by firing squad.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> This was discontinued on March 15, 2004. While the decision for this law was being made, the Church was consulted and stated that they had nothing against the discontinuation of this practice.</p>
<p>In an interesting contradiction, author Sally Denton in her book <i>American Massacre</i>, states that execution by firing squad was <i>not</i> considered a valid method for performing “blood atonement,” claiming instead that “beheading was the preferred method.” Denton recounts the execution of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._Lee_68a1.html" title="John D.

<p>There simply is no such thing among us as a doctrine of blood atonement that grants a remission of sins or confers any other benefit upon a person because his own blood is shed for sins.

<p>Regarding "blood atonement" in a theocracy, the <i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several early Church leaders, most notably Brigham Young, taught that in a complete theocracy the Lord could require the voluntary shedding of a murderer´s blood-presumably by capital punishment-as part of the process of Atonement for such grievous sin. This was referred to as "blood Atonement." Since such a theocracy has not been operative in modern times, the practical effect of the idea was its use as a rhetorical device to heighten the awareness of Latter-day Saints of the seriousness of murder and other major sins.

<p>Critics of the doctrine argue that Young's statements encouraged Mormons to murder apostates.

<p>An example used by some to illustrate the alleged practice blood atonement is the 1866 murder of the former-slave, Thomas Coleman (or Colburn), who was in good standing as a member of the LDS Church. As Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn has documented, Coleman was apparently secretly courting a white Mormon woman, contrary to both territorial law and Mormon doctrine at the time.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> At one of their clandestine meetings behind the old Arsenal (on what is now Capitol Hill in Salt Lake) on December 11, Coleman was discovered by "friends" of the woman. The group of vigilantes hit Coleman with a large rock. Using his own bowie knife, his attackers slit his throat so deeply from ear to ear that he was nearly decapitated, as well as slicing open his right breast, in what some believe was a mimicry of penalties illustrated in the temple ritual. Not all of Coleman's wounds correlated with the temple ritual, however, since he was also castrated. A pre-penciled placard was then pinned to his corpse stating, "NOTICE TO ALL NIGGERS - TAKE WARNING - LEAVE WHITE WOMEN ALONE." Even though it was the middle of winter, a grave was dug and Coleman's body disposed of in less than three hours after its discovery. Less than twelve hours after that, Judge Elias Smith, first cousin of Joseph Smith, appointed George Stringham (a Mormon ruffian and vigilante with ties to Porter Rockwell, Jason Luce, and William Hickman) as the foreman of the Coroner's Jury; they briefly met and summarily dismissed the case as committed by person or persons unknown to the jury, abruptly ending all official enquiry into the bizarre murder.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>It has been suggested that the ritualistic elements involved in the execution of Coleman’s murder may have been in response to a public sermon made three years earlier by Brigham Young on March 3, 1863. In this sermon, Young states, “I am a human being, and I have the care of human beings. I wish to save life, and have no desire to destroy life. If I had my wish, I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.”<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so." Young continues his sermon by condemning whites for their abuse of slaves with the proclamation, “for their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.”<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>With regard to Coleman's murder, LDS apologetics point out that the practice of "blood atonement" is said to apply to <i>endowed Mormons who apostatized</i>. Coleman was a member in good standing and was not endowed, suggesting that his death may have actually been the result of racism.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

Judge Elias Smith stated in regard to the case: "We have carefully examined all the evidence furnished by a remarkably accurate stenographic reporter, and can only conclude that evidence before the court goes to show' that Durfee, Potter and two of the Parrishes got into a row about matters best, if not only, known to themselves, and for that Potter and two Parrishes were killed." -- Records published in the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Deseret_News_60a2.html" title="Deseret News">Deseret News</a>, April 6th, 1859.</p>

<p>Although “blood atonement” is supposedly associated specifically with the shedding of blood of apostates, critics of Mormonism sometimes associate “blood atonement” with a much wider variety of sins such as thievery and adultery.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> These claims are based upon certain statements of early church leaders, usually taken from the <i><a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Discourses_b0c1.html" title="Journal of Discourses">Journal of Discourses</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup> One example is a comment made by Brigham Young regarding thievery given during a sermon on May 8, 1853. Young states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you want to know what to do with a thief that you may find stealing, I say kill him on the spot, and never suffer him to commit another iniquity. That is what I expect I shall do, though never, in the days of my life, have I hurt a man with the palm of my hand. I never have hurt any person any other way except with this unruly member, my tongue."<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following quote made by Heber C. Kimball in 1857 is sometimes used by critics to suggest that “blood atonement” was to be applied to apostates who break their covenants:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have not a doubt but there will be hundreds who will leave us and go away to our enemies. I wish they would go this fall: it might relieve us from much trouble; for if men turn traitors to God and His servants, their blood will surely be shed, or else they will be damned, and that too according to their covenants.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 16, 1856 Brigham Young gave a sermon in which he stated that one needed to be "careful lest in judging you will be judged." A portion of this sermon has been used to suggest that Young advocated that "blood atonement" should be applied to adulterers. The quote in its full context is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, "That man ought to die for transgressing the law of God." Let me suppose a case. Suppose you found your brother in bed with your wife, and put a javelin through both of them, you would be justified, and they would atone for their sins, and be received into the kingdom of God. I would at once do so in such a case; and under such circumstances, I have no wife whom I love so well that I would not put a javelin through her heart, and I would do it with clean hands. But you who trifle with your covenants, be careful lest in judging you will be judged. Every man and women has got to have clean hands and a pure heart, to execute judgment, else they had better let the matter alone. Again, suppose the parties are not caught in their iniquity, and it passes along unnoticed, shall I have compassion on them? Yes, I will have compassion on them, for transgressions of the nature already named, or for those of any other description. If the Lord so order it that they are not caught in the act of their iniquity, it is pretty good proof that He is willing for them to live; and I say let them live and suffer in the flesh for their sins, for they will have it to do.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p>In modern times, the concept of "blood atonement" has been used by a number of fundamentalist splinter groups as an excuse to justify murdering those who disagree with their leaders or attempt to leave their church. These groups all claim to follow the "original" teachings of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and claim that the LDS church has strayed from the proper path by banning these practices.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup> This practice is attributed to a tendency toward extreme "literalism" in the interpretation of early doctrines.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

Before his death in prison, LeBaron wrote a document which he called <i>The Book of the New Covenants</i>. This document listed a number of people who had been disloyal and "deserved to die." Copies of this list fell into the hands of LeBaron's followers, who proceeded to administer what they called "blood atonement" to the individuals listed.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of LeBaron's daughters, Lillian, relates an account of some of these killings in the film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Makers_II_%28Film%29_00c3.html" title="The God Makers II (Film)">The God Makers II</a></i>.

She states that their names were “on the list to be atoned for” because her father believed that they were “traitors to God’s cause.” Not explicitly named in the film, the list that Chynoweth referred to was called ‘’The Book of the New Covenants’’, and was written by Ervil LeBaron before his death in prison. The document contained a list of individuals that LeBaron believed deserved to die.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_atonement.html" title="Edit section: References to &quot;blood atonement&quot; in modern works">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">References to "blood atonement" in modern works</span></h3>
<p>A number of modern authors refer to "blood atonement," usually in association with "Danites." These references often appear in works critical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and rumors of "Danites" practicing some form of "blood atonement" often plays a significant role in these accounts.</p>
<p>In her book <i>Leaving the Saints</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martha_Beck_9bf5.html" title="Martha Beck">Martha Beck</a> postulates the existence of a "Danite" band "disposing" of people who opposed Brigham Young:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brigham Young formalized and anointed these assassins as the Danites, whose mission included espionage, suppression of information, and quietly, permanently disposing of people who threatened the Mormon prophet or the Latter-day Saint organization. Again, not many Mormons know this detail of Church history, but every now and then, Utah papers record murders with uniquely Mormon flavoring (death by temple-sanctioned methods, for example), and the word that goes out on the Latter-day grapevine is <i>Danite</i>.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sally Denton, in her book <i>American Massacre</i>, claims that the Danites and "blood atonement" had a prominent role in 19th century Utah society. Denton attributes the creation of the Danites to Joseph Smith as his “secret group of loyalists” and suggests that they became “one of the most legendarily feared bands in frontier America.” According to Denton, this “consecrated, clandestine unit of divinely inspired assassins” introduced “the ritualized form of murder called blood atonement-providing the victim with eternal salvation by slitting his throat.”<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[42]</a></sup> Denton claims that “blood atonement” was one of the doctrines which Mormons held “most sacred” and that “[t]hose who dared to flee Zion were hunted down and killed.” <sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> Denton implies that large numbers of such “atonements” occurred during the Mormon reformation of 1856, although “none of the crimes were ever reported in the Deseret News," and that the “bloody regime…ended with [Jedediah] Grant’s sudden death, on December 1, 1856.” <sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
