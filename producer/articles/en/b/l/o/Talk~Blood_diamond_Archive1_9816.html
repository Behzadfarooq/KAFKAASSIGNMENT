<p>The Kimberley Process described in this article is intended in part to help sustain the De Beers monopoly in the diamond trade, by supressing diamonds which are not controlled by De Beers. The main reason that diamonds have such a high price is because of an artificial limit on the supply, maintained by De Beers. The Kimberly Process helps keep the supply low, and helps keep the price high, which in turn helps keep the conflict diamond prices high.</p>
<p>A much more effective way to take the profits out of conflict diamonds would be to break up De Beers into about ten competing companies, and divide their reserve diamonds among them. If the break up was properly structured, the resulting companies would need to compete with each other. They would need to sell a much larger volume of diamonds each year, the price would plunge, many more people could enjoy wearing diamonds, and there would be much less money going to bloody conflicts in Africa.</p>
<p>Okay, great. Are you suggesting adding this to the article, or are you just soapboxing? <a href="../../../y/e/v/User%7EYEvb0_4bff.html" title="User:YEvb0">yEvb0</a> 02:30, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Okay.. the whole "blood diamonds used in Sept 11th attacks" sounds like total propaganda used as an argument against the industry. Its not verifiable and does not belong in a Wikipedia entry describing conflict diamonds. By extension, you could say "the airplane industry was a key participant in permitting the sept 11th incident to occur." Delete. --TheGhost</p>

<p>The article contains the phrase "In some cases, the United Nations has sanctioned the export of conflict diamonds, arguing that their trade finances armies in fighting against legitimate governments and perpetrating human rights abuses, and prolongs devastating wars." Do you mean they have sanctioned i.e. affirm the validity of the export of said diamonds or have applied sanctions to i.e. restrictions on their export?</p>

<p>Article name should be "<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_diamond.html" title="Blood diamond">blood diamond</a>" because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It gets 40 times as many Google hits</li>
<li>It conveys the connotation that the blood of innocent non-combatants is shed during the battles financed by the gems.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to discover and write about the motives of people trying to ban or curtail sales of these diamonds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The two groups mentioned in the intro: are they anti-Communist? So do we only care about blood diamonds when the rebels who sell them oppose Communism?</li>
<li>Diamond sellers, particularly in the West (e.g., the U.S. and Europe), don't want <b>all</b> diamonds tarred with the same brush. I read just today about PR efforts to distance themselves from West African wars.

</ul>
<p>How much influence does the UN have in this matter?</p>

<li>Do they have legal authority to ban blood diamond exports?

<li>If so, what treaty gives them this authority, and what countries are bound by this treaty?</li>

I honestly think that the title "Blood Diamond" is a very emotionally-charged phrase with many connotations, and thus not NPOV. The term "Conflict Diamond" seems much more impartial. Granted, I'm not advocating the sale of conflict diamonds, but I do think that the current title is leaning a little too far to one side. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArius_Maximus_b0f7.html" title="User:Arius Maximus">Arius Maximus</a> 04:51, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with the notion that the term <i>Blood Diamond</i> is a POV name. In all the industry references the term used is conflict diamond. <i>Blood Diamond</i> I believe has received recognition from the movie. Properly termed however, it should be <i>conflict diamond</i>. A move back to conflict diamond would be beneficial. <a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESauliH_feee.html" title="User:SauliH">SauliH</a> 05:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are incorrect in this. Yes De Beers has a vested interest in the WDC, but IT is NOT De Beers. Look at the membership of the WDC, and you will see that it it is beyond them.

<p>WDC is De Beers and De Beers partner companies WDC funds diamondfacts.org which is the top sponsored site on google adsense for the keyword blood diamonds. Check RealDiamonfacts.org for the truth behind diamonds.

<p>You cannot make this assertion. The World Diamond Council is made up primarily of the world diamond bourses which are independant of De Beers.

<p>What does this paragraph mean or relate to? I removed it because it didn't make sense in the context of the article.</p>
<dl>

<p>Also this paragraph -</p>
<dl>
<dd>The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in September 2006 that conflict diamonds are still entering the United States.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>I searched the report and could not find a reference which specified actual conflict diamonds entering the US. If you can find where please cite (and if you would, please include a direct quote here), and feel free to place this back into the article. Oh, and if you mean that not all diamonds that entered the US were KPCS certified, then forget it, it does not mean they WERE confict diamonds. adding it back in for this reason is hard to justify. <a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESauliH_feee.html" title="User:SauliH">SauliH</a> 07:31, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also this paragraph -</p>
<dl>
<dd>Conflict diamonds may also be becoming less traceable.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If this can be built up great, add back in. I believe it may have been in context with the al-Qaeda mention, but did not make sense with it. 'May also be becoming' sounds weasel word to me, and what is meant by less traceable. With the KPCS how does less traceable happen? It sounds like supposition to me. But prove me wrong please. <a href="../../../s/a/u/User%7ESauliH_feee.html" title="User:SauliH">SauliH</a> 07:36, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the context of marketing using conflict diamonds, I searched for verification that Gemesis and Apollo used the conflict diamond subject as a part of their marketing to no avail.

<dd>I find it highly unlikely they would. They sell both synthetic diamonds and their competitive edge does not lie so much in the fact their diamonds are not blood diamonds, but that they are cheaper and equally good as a natural diamond. (Take cultured and natural pearls as an example). Moreover they can provide colored diamonds which are particularly expensive. Finally, although I see on Apollo's website they will sell diamonds for jewelry purposes as well their main focus has always been industrial diamonds (but correct me if I am wrong; I am not 100 % certain). That would make a comparison with blood diamonds totally useless. I for one would be curious to see where in their campaign they had specifically used it.</dd>

<p>The recent addition of the reference to <i>Canada: A Diamond-Producing Nation</i> by the National Conference Board of Canada is better than no ref at all, but we still need a ref to the country using their position as a promotional tool. This ref still lacks the required 'promotional' aspect.

<dd>I have added a source which seems to indicate Canada's marketing is somewhat more subtle than saying "our diamonds are conflict-free". This is the best source I was able to find since it extensively discusses a national Canadian strategy of 2003 in a law journal. Strategy looks fairly straightforward: 1) be active in Kimberley and related legislation to combat blood diamonds. 2) brand your own diamonds as "from Canada" (which obviously cannot be blood diamonds).</dd>

<p>What pupose does the Bush quote serve? I am of the feeling that we should turn this into prose, with a ref to the quote. It is long, and does not flow well with the article.

<dd>Agree, we could perhaps summarize in one sentence the paragraph which I had to read 3 times to begin to understand it anyway&#160;! (but then again I am not a native speaker). I think the article could probably gain some debt, in describing how the trade of blood diamonds works or pinpointing the loopholes in Kimberley etc (Nat. Geo had a very good documentary a few years ago).</dd>
