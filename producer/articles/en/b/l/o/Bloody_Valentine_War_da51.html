<p>Heavy space fighters called "Mobile Armors" had been in use by the Atlantic Federation since the early fifties CE (Cosmic Era), but they had many limitations in capabilities. Their small size meant they were tough targets to hit, but they were also difficult to armor adequately. A larger machine, PLANT strategists theorized, could do more than a Mobile Armor could for relatively little more costs and would be able to carry more armor as well. To give these new mecha the best multi-environment combat capacity, a humanoid shape was chosen - an enlargement and upgrade of heavy industrial exoskeletons that had been in use since the closing years of the AD calendar. Because of the humanoid shape, they were dubbed "Mobile Suits", and the first mobile suit, the YMF-01A "Proto GINN", was rolled out in CE 65. The first combat mobile suit, the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-1017_GINN_ca8a.html" title="ZGMF-1017 GINN">ZGMF-1017 GINN</a>, was rolled out two years later. In CE 69, the Atlantic Federation's Captain Halberton publishes a paper, "The Combat Effectiveness and Applications of Mobile Suits", which prompts the Atlantic Federation to begin development of its own mobile suits, the GAT-X series. After a short development period, the Earth Alliance rolls out its own first mass-production mobile suit, the <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-01_Strike_Dagger_944f.html" title="GAT-01 Strike Dagger">GAT-01 Strike Dagger</a>, in late May of CE 71.</p>
<p>January, CE 71 marked the rollout of the Alliance's first mobile suits (or "<a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundams</a>" as pilot Kira Yamato would later call them): the base unit <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X102_Duel_Gundam_c166.html" title="GAT-X102 Duel Gundam">GAT-X102 Duel</a>, the heavy assault unit <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X103_Buster_Gundam_b27f.html" title="GAT-X103 Buster Gundam">GAT-X103 Buster</a>, the stealth unit <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X207_Blitz_Gundam_21c6.html" title="GAT-X207 Blitz Gundam">GAT-X207 Blitz</a>, the high-powered commander unit <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X303_Aegis_Gundam_10fa.html" title="GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam">GAT-X303 Aegis</a> and most famous of the five, the multi-mode <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X105_Strike_Gundam_2ff3.html" title="GAT-X105 Strike Gundam">GAT-X105 Strike</a>. The Strike combined aspects of all four of the other units, and was able to change configurations with ease using bolt-on weapon systems called <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striker_Pack_2e9f.html" title="Striker Pack">Striker Packs</a>.

<p>Three days later, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_14.html" title="February 14">February 14</a>, the Earth Alliance, specifically the Atlantic Federation, sent the <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agamemnon_class_carrier.html" title="Agamemnon class carrier"><i>Agamemnon</i>-class carrier</a> <i>Roosevelt</i> and escorts to the Junius City region of plants, for a "show of force". However, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> members decided to change its mission to starving off PLANTs' food supplies, as Junius was an agricultural city.

<p>In response to the direct nuclear attack, ZAFT modified <a href="../../../n/-/j/N-Jammer_d0f8.html" title="N-Jammer">N-Jammer</a> technology, initially intended to be used against Earth, as a countermeasure against nuclear weaponry in space. With the modified production schedule, the N-Jammers were not dropped on Earth until <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a>, as the first phase of their <i>Operation Uroboros</i>.</p>
<p>The use of N-Jammers on Earth and the subsequent energy crisis, <i>April Fool Crisis</i>, provoked mass starvation due to how heavily people relied on nuclear energy.</p>
<p>The second phase of <i>Operation Uroboros</i> was the actual offensive on Earth surface, that took under ZAFT control most of Africa, all of Australia and many Asian regions, including three of Earth's five major spaceports (locations of a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_driver.html" title="Mass driver">Mass driver</a>): Victoria (Africa), Gibraltar (Europe), and Kaohsiung (Taiwan), leaving Porta Panama (Central America) in Alliance hands and Kaguya at Onogoro Island in the <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orb_Union_048a.html" title="Orb Union">Orb Union</a>'s control. (A sixth spaceport, the mobile Giga-Float under the auspices of the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junk_Guild_d1a0.html" title="Junk Guild">Junk Guild</a>, did not become functional until late in the war.)</p>

<p>One of ZAFT's earliest landings took place in the friendly Oceania Union territory. The Earth Alliance Pacific Fleet attacked ZAFT's forces. After two days the <i>Battle of Carpentaria</i> ended in victory for ZAFT, who immediately afterwards began the construction of Carpentaria base.</p>

<p>The Battle of Endymion Crater took place at Endymion Crater on the Moon.

Considered a ZAFT victory due to the elimination of all Alliance forces (except for the sole survivor, L.T.J.G. <a href="../../../m/u/_/Mu_La_Flaga_9378.html" title="Mu La Flaga">Mu La Flaga</a>) in the Endymion Crater, some claim it was an Alliance conspiracy that activated the Cylcops system in order to deal heavy damages to ZAFT forces.</p>
<p>It is often believed that the origin of DRAGOON technology came from the Endymion Crator where Earth Alliance successfully created primitive version of DRAGOON system. Notice that TS-MA2mod.00 Moebius Zero, mass-produced by Earth Alliance, was first discovered by ZAFT forces in the Endymion Crater.</p>

<p>ZAFT forces launch a drawn out series of raids against the Earth Alliance resource satellite of Nova at Lagrange Point 4. Skirmishes between the two sides last for nearly a month, with neither side ever decisively defeating the other. Ultimately, the Alliance abandons the satellite and ZAFT begins to move the station towards the PLANTs. Despite minor raids by Alliance forces, Nova reaches L5, where ZAFT converts it into Space Fortress Boaz.</p>

<p>To put an end to Earth Alliance mobile suit development plans, ZAFT planned an operation to seize the mobile suit prototypes secretly developed on the neutral colony <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_locations_c655.html#Heliopolis_colony" title="Cosmic Era locations">Heliopolis</a>, which was owned by Orb; and to destroy their carrier prototype ship <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archangel_class_assault_ship.html" title="Archangel class assault ship"><i>Archangel</i></a>.</p>
<p>Although ZAFT was able to capture four out of five units and heavily damage the colony's harbour, the fifth unit, the <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X105_Strike_Gundam_2ff3.html" title="GAT-X105 Strike Gundam">GAT-X105 Strike</a>, remained in Alliance hands, was activated and engaged them in battle.

<p>The <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archangel_class_assault_ship.html" title="Archangel class assault ship"><i>Archangel</i></a>, pursued by the <i>Le Creuset Team</i>, docked at the Eurasian Federation base <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_locations_c655.html" title="Cosmic Era locations">Artemis</a>. Here the <i>Archangel</i> was taken into custody because of the lack of a friendly ID code on the ship and partly due to the Eurasian Federation's rivalry with the Atlantic Federation, who built the <i>Archangel</i> and the GAT mobile suits.

<p>After a long pursuit by the <i>Le Creuset Team</i>, the <i>Archangel</i> finally received reinforcements from the Earth Alliance's 8th Fleet. The Archangel was then ordered to bring the <i>GAT-X105 Strike</i> to OMNI headquarters at JOSH-A. The 'Le Creuset team' attacked just before reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Earth Alliance Rear Admiral Lewis Halberton ordered the entire 8th Fleet to defend Archangel at all costs. Though the 8th Fleet was numerically superior to the ZAFT forces, its Drake-class escort ships and TS-MA2 Moebius Mobile Armors were no match for the stolen units and ZAFT's GINNs as well as their heavily-armed Laurasia class and Nazca class warships. Admiral Halberton lost the entire fleet and his own life, but achieved his goal, as the Archangel successfully completed reentry.</p>

<p>After descending to Earth the <i>Archangel</i> took part in the <i>Desert Dawn</i> resistance movement's battle with ZAFT. She continued to operate with Desert Dawn until they defeated <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Waltfeld_2add.html" title="Andrew Waltfeld">Andrew Waltfeld</a> in the end of February.</p>
<p>Severely damaged, the ship then went to Orb via the Red Sea, while attempting to avoid any confrontation with ZAFT.

While Morrassim's forces were defeated, the ship barely managed to enter Orb territory by early April, especially after another encounter with the members of the Le Creuset team, now lead by Athrun Zala.</p>
<p>Thanks to Cagalli Yula Athha, the daughter of Orb's Chief Representative, Uzumi Nara Athha, the <i>Archangel</i> was permitted to secretly enter the neutral Orb.

<p>The Battle of JOSH-A (<i>Operation Spitbreak</i>) was ZAFT's plan to take <a href="../../../j/o/s/JOSH-A_6a4a.html" title="JOSH-A">JOSH-A</a>, the Earth Alliance's Atlantic Federation HQ, which failed.</p>
<p>ZAFT counterintelligence officers allowed the majority of both ZAFT and Earth forces to believe that ZAFT's next target was Porta Panama and its mass driver. Thus, a large amount of the Earth Alliance forces were transferred to Panama to defend the base. However, this was to leave JOSH-A open to attack, which was the original plan of Chairman Patrick Zala. However, through the betrayal of rogue ZAFT commander Rau Le Creuset, the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> group came to know beforehand about the operation's actual target and set a trap for both ZAFT and the Eurasian Federation. The base was primarily staffed and defended by Eurasian Federation personnel while the Atlantic Federation quietly transferred its own personnel elsewhere. When ZAFT attacked, the Eurasian defenders resisted but were effectively wiped out in the face of overwhelming enemy numbers. ZAFT's attack force was then lured into the central bay of JOSH-A when the base's Cyclops System was activated, killing most of the ZAFT attack force as well as what was left of the Eurasian defenders in addition to destroying the installation and everything else within a 10 mile radius of the base in the process. During this battle, Kira Yamato, with the stolen <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X10A_Freedom_fbce.html" title="ZGMF-X10A Freedom">ZGMF-X10A Freedom</a> reappeared and saved the <i>Archangel</i> from the brink of destruction, and due to his intervention, the ship survived the ordeal along with other ZAFT and Earth forces who heeded Kira's warning to escape the Cyclops blast. Several ZAFT submarines and pilots with mobile suits fast enough to outrun the Cyclops shockwave managed to escape as well.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> orchestrated the destruction of enough of the Eurasian Federation's forces at <a href="../../../j/o/s/JOSH-A_6a4a.html" title="JOSH-A">JOSH-A</a> to alter the balance of power in the Earth Alliance so that the Atlantic Federation (which <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> controlled) was able to take control of the Alliance by default. The Eurasian Federation were the voices of reason in the Earth Alliance, ensuring that the purpose of the war was simply the defeat of PLANT. With the Atlantic Federation now mostly in control of the Earth Alliance and its military, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> were able to ensure that the focus of the war changed to the extermination of all Coordinators, their stated goal.</p>
<p>According to Athrun in the manga series "Gundam Seed Destiny: The Edge", many official documents after this operation were lost due to confusion in the chain of command (presumably referring to the purge of the moderates by Patrick Zala), resulting in the truth of the final days of the war being hidden from the public.</p>

<p>A few days later, ZAFT retaliated by attacking the Panama mass-driver base with a heavy force. While the Alliance forces introduced their mass-produced <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-01_Strike_Dagger_944f.html" title="GAT-01 Strike Dagger">GAT-01 Strike Dagger</a>, ZAFT deployed the <b>Gungnir</b> EMP weapon, disabling all Alliance military equipment in the area and resulting in an overwhelming victory for ZAFT. Porta Panama, the last mass driver in Alliance hands, was thereby destroyed, cutting off the Alliance space forces from Earth-based resources. Following the battle, a number of GINN pilots slaughtered the surrendering Alliance soldiers in an act of revenge for the ZAFT personnel that died at JOSH-A.

<p>With the destruction of their last mass driver in Porta Panama, the Atlantic Federation turned its interest to the <i>Kaguya</i> mass driver in the neutral <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orb_Union_048a.html" title="Orb Union">Orb Union</a>, one of the last mass drivers operating on Earth.</p>
<p>The Earth Alliance's chief "negotiator", Murata Azrael (Leader of the extremist group <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a>), delivered a ultimatum demanding that Orb either join the war effort against "humanity's evil enemy, the Coordinators" or be declared a supporter of PLANT and face military takeover. With both sides knowing from the start that the terms are totally unacceptable, Orb deployed their recently completed <a href="../../../m/b/f/MBF-M1_Astray_d076.html" title="MBF-M1 Astray">MBF-M1 Astray</a> units and the Atlantic Federation deployed massive numbers of their new <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-01_Strike_Dagger_944f.html" title="GAT-01 Strike Dagger">GAT-01 Strike Daggers</a> for the certainly unavoidable battle. According to <a href="../../../r/a/u/Rau_Le_Creuset_cd78.html" title="Rau Le Creuset">Rau Le Creuset</a>, ZAFT did offer military assistance but the Orb government declined their offer (of help).</p>
<p>In the first phases of the battle, Orb held their own against the Alliance with their Astray's superior performance over the Strike Dagger, as well as with the help from the rogue Alliance ship <i>Archangel</i> and its mobile suit complement. In fact, the late entry of Athrun Zala and Dearka Elsman with the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X09A_Justice_Gundam_c12f.html" title="ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam">ZGMF-X09A Justice</a> and the <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X103_Buster_Gundam_b27f.html" title="GAT-X103 Buster Gundam">GAT-X103 Buster</a> proved to be pivotal to the outcome of this phase of the battle and the two would play a key role in Orb's forces for the rest of the war. But the Atlantic Federation forces push the Orb forces to the breaking point in the process as Orb couldn't replace their lost units faster than the Atlantic Federation, essentially meaning Orb's defeat was only a matter or time. After retreating and reorganizing, the EA forces ultimately manage to overcome the Orb forces, mainly due to the overwhelming numbers of Strike Daggers deployed and three newly completed Gundam units, the <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X252_Forbidden_Gundam_522e.html" title="GAT-X252 Forbidden Gundam">GAT-X252 Forbidden</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X131_Calamity_Gundam_9d2b.html" title="GAT-X131 Calamity Gundam">GAT-X131 Calamity</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/t/GAT-X370_Raider_Gundam_8b2c.html" title="GAT-X370 Raider Gundam">GAT-X370 Raider</a>. However, the withdrawal of Azrael's three gundams from drained power after a prolonged fight with the Freedom and the Justice prompts a short halt in the EA's advance.</p>
<p>In the final phase of the battle, Orb's Representative Athha ordered the evacuation of the remaining Orb Astray force on the battleship <a href="../../../i/z/u/Izumo_class_battleship.html" title="Izumo class battleship"><i>Kusanagi</i></a>. The <i>Kusanagi</i> was launched into space via the <i>Kaguya</i> mass driver, while the <i>Archangel</i> used the <i>Kusanagi'</i>s spare boosters. Immediately after the launch, Athha activated the <i>Morgenroete</i> factory's self-destruct mechanism, completely destroying both the factory and the mass driver. Representative Athha and the other representatives of Orb were killed in the blast. From the opening shot of the battle to the mass driver's destruction, Orb fell in less than 24 hours of combat.</p>

<p>Despite the determined efforts of ZAFT forces, the Alliance managed to recapture the Victoria mass-driver in equatorial Africa with a massive deployment of the Strike Dagger and other prototype units. After the battle, a scene in that episode showed an Alliance soldier killing a wounded DINN pilot. It is unknown whether he was ordered to do so or was violating regulations and doing it for personal reasons. It is also unknown if other Alliance personnel did the same to other surviving ZAFT pilots and personnel. This scene, along with the massacre of Alliance soldiers at Panama, underlines a mental shift of how the war was now conducted by Earth and PLANT as this shows that this war wasn't a war of conquest anymore: It was now a war of extermination.</p>
<p>It was also rumored that ZAFT planned to self-destruct the mass driver during the battle but was stopped in time by an Alliance commando team.</p>

The Earth Alliance's objectives were the capture of either the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X10A_Freedom_Gundam_1926.html" title="ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam">ZGMF-X10A Freedom</a> or the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X09A_Justice_Gundam_c12f.html" title="ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam">ZGMF-X09A Justice</a> as well as the destruction of the <i>Archangel</i>. ZAFT's objective was to retake or destroy the <i>Eternal</i>, although ZAFT commander Rau Le Creuset's hidden agenda included delivering ZAFT's data on the N-Jammer Canceller to the Earth Alliance.</p>
<p>In the ensuing battle both the EA and ZAFT had to witness the increased battle capabilities of the TSA forces. The Three Ships Alliance repelled both forces, and destroyed Le Creuset's command ship <i>Vesalius</i> while losing only a few of their M1 Astrays in return.</p>
<p>During the battle, the N-Jammer Canceller intelligence was successfully passed to the Earth Alliance forces, as Le Creuset planned. This battle also saw the first deployment of the <i>Dominion</i>, the Earth Alliance's second <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archangel_class_assault_ship.html" title="Archangel class assault ship">Archangel</a> class battleship and captained by former <i>Archangel</i> <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_officer.html" title="Executive officer">XO</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natarle_Badgiruel_e7ef.html" title="Natarle Badgiruel">Natarle Badgiruel</a>.</p>

<p>After recovering N-Jammer Canceller technology in July during the Battle of Mendel, the Alliance originally planned to use the technology to solve Earth's energy crisis but under Blue Cosmos' influence, they mass-produced and mounted them on nuclear weapons instead, launching <i>Operation Peacemaker</i>: a gambit to quickly end the war by destroying all the PLANTs with nuclear missiles. They started their operation by destroying the ZAFT space fortress <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_locations_c655.html" title="Cosmic Era locations">Boaz</a> with an all-out nuclear missile strike.</p>

GENESIS attacks the EA forces</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>Second Battle of Jachin Due</i> was both the apex of the <i>Operation Peacemaker</i> and the decisive battle of the Bloody Valentine War.</p>
<p>As the Earth Alliance prepared to attack the PLANTs with nuclear missiles, the ZAFT superweapon <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_Superweapons_de3a.html#GENESIS" title="Cosmic Era Superweapons">GENESIS</a> was entering its final stages and was ready to fire. Both factions were strongly determined not only to eliminate all enemy forces, but also to completely wipe out the opposing side's civilian population. Going into the battle, <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a>'s main objective was destroying the PLANTs with nuclear missiles. Similarly, ZAFT Chairman Patrick Zala intended to fire GENESIS not only at the Alliance's Ptolemaeus lunar base but also directly at Earth, which would not only have cataclysmic consequences on the climate, but would also wipe out most if not all biological lifeforms. Additionally, Rau Le Creuset, whose twisted logic wanted both Coordinators and Naturals to perish and was responsible for the escalation of hostilities to this level, secretly rigged GENESIS to fire when the ZAFT fortress <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_locations_c655.html" title="Cosmic Era locations">Jachin Due</a> self-destructed.</p>
<p>Between the two warring factions there was the Three Ships Alliance, whose main purpose was to thwart any attack on either side's civilian population, and end all hostilities if possible.</p>
<p>During the battle, the strike force carrying the EA's nuclear missiles managed to bypass all of ZAFT's defenses. With no ZAFT forces standing between them and the PLANTs, an easy EA victory seemed inevitable. However, the missiles fired at the PLANTs were all intercepted by the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X10A_Freedom_fbce.html" title="ZGMF-X10A Freedom">ZGMF-X10A Freedom</a> and the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X09A_Justice_Gundam_c12f.html" title="ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam">ZGMF-X09A Justice</a> with their METEOR units, and thus no PLANT was destroyed. The GENESIS weapon would be fired twice. The first shot decimated the main Earth Alliance fleets attacking the PLANTs while the second shot hit both the reinforcements being sent from the Alliance's Ptolemaeus Base on the Moon and the base itself. Half of the remaining fleet was wiped out, and the base completely vaporized. Athrun Zala then managed to detonate his nuclear-powered Justice unit inside GENESIS, completely destroying it before it fired on Earth.</p>
<p>The Earth Alliance fleet, after being heavily-damaged by GENESIS (the fleet lost 1/2 of its strength counting the losses on Ptolemaeus and the losses from GENESIS), lost its flagship <i>Dominion</i>, which was destroyed in battle by the <i>Archangel</i>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> leader Murata Azrael perished in the ship's explosion.</p>
<p>The ZAFT fleet seemed to suffer slightly less losses, though they did lose both GENESIS, their main military base, Jachin Due and much of their forces. PLANT Chairman and ZAFT Commander-in-Chief Patrick Zala was killed by ZAFT officer Ray Yuki, and soon after the moderate faction took control of both militaries, ceasing all hostilities as the crippled Earth Alliance and ZAFT fleets retired.</p>

<p>By the start of Cosmic Era year 72, the Alliance's nuclear stockpile was destroyed, as was the ZAFT superweapon <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_Superweapons_de3a.html#GENESIS" title="Cosmic Era Superweapons">GENESIS</a>. More importantly, the instigators of the war - <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> leader <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murata_Azrael_3664.html" title="Murata Azrael">Murata Azrael</a>, ZAFT Supreme Council Chairman <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Zala_781d.html" title="Patrick Zala">Patrick Zala</a>, and rogue ZAFT commander <a href="../../../r/a/u/Rau_Le_Creuset_cd78.html" title="Rau Le Creuset">Rau Le Creuset</a> - were all killed in action. Parties amendable to peace were now in control of the major factions. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a>, CE 72, their representatives met at the ruins of <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junius_Seven_3373.html" title="Junius Seven">Junius Seven</a> and signed a formal treaty, ending the Bloody Valentine War. The plan came from Prime Minister Lindemann of the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factions_of_the_Cosmic_Era_5003.html#Kingdom_of_Scandinavia" title="Factions of the Cosmic Era">Kingdom of Scandinavia</a> and was accepted by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The <b>Treaty of Junius Seven</b> specifically outlined several points:</p>
<ul>
<li>All national boundaries on Earth had to be restored to <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_quo_ante_bellum.html" title="Status quo ante bellum">status quo ante bellum</a></i>. Thus both the <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orb_Union_048a.html" title="Orb Union">Orb Union</a> and the United States of South America, which were seized by the Alliance, became independent nations again. Also ZAFT had to leave the areas they conquered during the war. However, they were allowed to still run the Gibraltar and the Carpentaria Base on Earth, as well as establish facilities where allowed by the nations of Earth, including the Atlantic Federation (an example would be a ZAFT base in San Diego, which was attacked by Blue Cosmos-affiliated group "Holy Land", shortly before Armory One incident).</li>
<li>Orb was forbidden to transfer any military technology (either in weapon shipments or aid) to either the Alliance or ZAFT, though either side could apparently use any Orb technology acquired before the treaty.</li>
<li>Nuclear technologies (<a href="../../../n/-/j/N-Jammer_d0f8.html" title="N-Jammer">N-Jammer</a> and <a href="../../../n/-/j/N-Jammer_Canceller_907f.html" title="N-Jammer Canceller">N-Jammer Canceller</a>, as well as <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirage_Colloid_7906.html" title="Mirage Colloid">Mirage Colloid</a> technology) were prohibited from military use, including a specific clause regarding their use on mobile suits.</li>
<li>There would be a limit as to how many mobile suits could be built and maintained by both sides.</li>
</ul>
<p>A black marble monument was placed upon the ruins of Junius Seven on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_10.html" title="March 10">March 10</a>, to both honor those who perished in the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junius_Seven_3373.html" title="Junius Seven">Bloody Valentine Incident</a> and as a pledge by the signatories of the treaty to protect peace.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants on Earth were fitted with N-Jammer Cancellers to restore their operation and satisfy the power needs of the severely crippled terrestrial economy. The long and costly process of digging out the hundreds of N-Jammers dropped on Earth during the war began.</p>
<p><a name="Aftermath" id="Aftermath"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Valentine_War_da51.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>The Treaty of Junius's main shortcoming was the failure in dismantling the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Cosmos_559b.html" title="Blue Cosmos">Blue Cosmos</a> organization.</p>
<p>Two years after the war, in CE 73, the Blue Cosmos had already rebuilt their power base in the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Federation_552b.html" title="Atlantic Federation">Atlantic Federation</a>, and reorganized under the leadership of Lord Djibril. As before, Blue Cosmos had major influence on the Earth's political elite, and was still driven by racial hate towards Coordinators.</p>
<p>The "Armory One incident" and soon later the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_locations_c655.html#Junius_Seven_colony" title="Cosmic Era locations">Junius 7 colony drop incident</a>, known as Operation "Break the World", led again to open conflict between the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_Alliance_%28Gundam%29_b7f6.html" title="Earth Alliance (Gundam)">Earth Alliance</a> and <a href="../../../z/a/f/ZAFT_7dae.html" title="ZAFT">ZAFT</a>, eventually leading to the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Bloody_Valentine_War_e906.html" title="Second Bloody Valentine War">Second Bloody Valentine War</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Treaty of Junius failed in all its objectives. Both factions secretly continued their development of nuclear and stealth weapons, and the Earth Alliance deployed them again in the first day of the second war. Orb allied with the Alliance shortly thereafter, rendering the ban on technology sharing a moot point.</p>
