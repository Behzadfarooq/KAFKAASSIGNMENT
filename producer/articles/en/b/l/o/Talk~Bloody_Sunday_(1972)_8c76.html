<p>The Fianna are/were not a "Junior IRA brigade," rather they were and are a Republican scouting movement. Many members would go on to join the IRA but I can't recall any Fianna bombings or shootings.</p>
<p>If I recall it was precisely on this point that on July 31 1997 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proinsias_de_Rossa_5a36.html" title="Proinsias de Rossa">Proinsias de Rossa</a> won £300,000 from the Sunday Independent which, through an article by Éamon Dunphy, alleged he had been a member of the IRA when he had, in fact, only been a member of Fianna Éireann. Check The Irish Independent July 31 1999, for a background to that case. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_Gringo_4363.html" title="User:El Gringo">El Gringo</a> 18:32, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't this be organized under Northern_Ireland/History or something? I see that there's quite a bit of information spread around, under <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">The Troubles</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland_History_944e.html" title="Ireland/History">Ireland/History</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html" title="Irish Republican Army">IRA</a>, etc, but the history of Northern Ireland is so unique that it deserves a seperate page, in my opinion. -<a href="../../../g/u/p/User%7EGuppie_bc0a.html" title="User:Guppie">Guppie</a></p>
<p>If you had a special page on Northern Ireland history all brought together, it would take up half of Wikipedia. Encyclopedias operate on the basis of enquiring about a specific event, person or organisation. It wouldn't work if to find out about Bloody Sunday you had to go in though a detailed category list: Northern Ireland/history/troubles/Bloody Sunday. It should have links to all of those, but not be buried on one. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a></p>
<p>Jtdirl, your rewrite of this page was excellent. Keep it up on Wikipedia! - <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa_Winstanley_5d6b.html" title="User:Asa Winstanley">AW</a></p>
<p>This article is extremely partisan and missrepresentative. -- MartinSpamer</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow! Such insight! Could you perhaps give some specifics or edit out the POV in the article yourself? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Ive tried but each time I try to improve it Jtdirl makes it worse. -- MartinSpamer</p>
<hr />
<p>Why does this article hav such a specific title? Was there another event called Bloody Sunday that also happened in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>? --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>
<p>There was another Bloody Sunday in 1920. I don't know who put this name on this file (I don't <i>think</i> it was me!) but I suppose it makes sense to link it to its two distinguishing characteristics, Northern Ireland and 1972. The other is <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Sunday_%28Ireland_1920%29_63eb.html" title="Bloody Sunday (Ireland 1920)">Bloody Sunday (Ireland 1920)</a>, when British military Auxilaries massacred people attending a gaelic football match in Dublin during the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_War_3972.html" title="Anglo-Irish War">War of Independence</a>. It is quite possible that the term 'Bloody Sunday' is also used somewhere else in the world. I suppose some unionists might be annoyed if this one here was down as Bloody Sunday (Ireland) and some people may know <i>about</i> Bloody Sunday and where it happened but not the date, or the date but not where it happened. Who knows, in years to come, Wiki may be teeming with 'Bloody Sundays', Amritsar 1924, Oklahoma 1948, Outer Mongolia 1971, the Orkney Islands 1982, etc. (these are all fictional, BTW.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 04:45 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added the fact that the British never claimed any soldier was hit by a bullet, nor was any bullet recovered afterward (except those shot by the British soldiers). I also added claims by people in the crowd that no shots were ever fired on the British soldiers, that these people claim that the British soldiers were the only ones who did any shooting.</p>
<p>I removed the word "riot" from the first paragraph. I do not feel this is NPOV. The march was to the city square, but the British soldiers decided to block it (I guess the British have the right to determine where Irish people are allowed to go in their own city). Some of the marchers began arguing with the soldiers who were blocking their route, while the majority decided to go by an alternate route which was not blocked. Anyone who wants to use the word riot should point out why here. I think it would be less controversial if you two or three paragraphs in gave a description of the progress of the march, so that people could decide for themselves what kind of riot there supposedly was. An unqualified description of riot in the first paragraph is in my opinion, not NPOV.</p>
<p>To term this march a Civil Rights Association march as a riot is unfair and unjust. Differences must be made between the Civil Rights Association and the I.R.A. While Martin McGuiness second in command of the Derry brigade was in the march the claims of IRA sniper fire have never been proven.</p>
<p>Perhaps some context might be given somewhere in the article. That is</p>
<p>1. We have had very recently in Iraq examples of what happens when a armed and nervous set of soldiers is confronted by a large crowd in a hostile atmosphere.</p>
<p>2. The IRA deliberately killed civilians on several occasions. This doesn't excuse the British actions on that day, but the idea that the republican movement was peaceful on the model of Gandhi or Martin Luther King is a false one.</p>
<p><br />
Keeping my head down now</p>
<p>This was not an I.R.A sponsered march while members where among the marchers (unquestionsbly) this was a Civil Rights Association march the I.R.A council had little or no authority over these marches to suggest that protesters in Derry were all active I.R.A members is absurd. Bloody sunday is considered in Republican Circles as the I.R.A s greatest advertisment for recruitment. The I.R.A as an organisation was not as powerful in 1972 as it had been previously in 1916 or as it became. The Civil Rights Association basic demands were 1. An end to Gerrymandering (Particularly evident in Derry where the city with an evident Catholic majoraty in 1972 anywhere from 75-80%) Was governed though Republicans claim ruled by a Protestant council. 2. equal oppertunties for All not just Catholics. The Derry Bogside was the most economically blighted area of Derry which did not have the same heavy industry as Belfast had throughout the 20th century. 3. In all the basic demand was "One Man One Vote"</p>
<p>I don't think the article requires editing it is not particularly biased to one side it sticks to both sides of what is a disputed event he does not call the Widgery report straight out a Whitewash which it is considered in Irish circles. Exonerating British Soldiers from any wrongdoing and calling the firing of over 100 live rounds into a built up area of apartment blocks 'At worst possibly wreckless' the authuor of the article makes an account of the 'Bloody Sunday Guns' some of which turned up in Little Rock, Beiruit and Sierra Leone and the guns which were destroyed in the Donnington Armoury in the midlands of England. A fair article and in no way Partisan</p>
<p>Exile</p>
<p>They are perfectly fair points. And please don't keep your head down. Keep editing! (But then I have been accused on wikipedia of being a right wing tory, an apologist for the IRA, anti-Irish, anti-British, anti-Catholic, a catholic church spy here pushing a Catholic agenda, a homophobe, an outrageous pusher of the gay agenda, an Australian monarchist, an Australian republican etc etc etc. Your points are perfectly valid.

<p>The present Inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday has nearly 2,500 statements from people involved, which seem to answer many of the questions raised here, and are all available on the Inquiry's website. It is acknowledged by the authorities that it's suspicious that no British soldiers were shot that day. It seems that the crowd were 'unarmed' in that they were not carrying firearms, but those who were rioting (acknowledging that many at the riot were in the wrong place at the wrong time) were throwing rocks. The witness statements are adamant that some of the people shot at were throwing nail bombs, and that some were in buildings with firearms. An MI5 agent has provided evidence that Martin McGuinness has claimed to have fired the first shot; he denies this and in fact claims that he was nowhere near the shooting. No soliders admit to having fired into the crowd, only to having fired at those with firearms and nail bombs, and to have shot into the air above the rioters heads to attempt to disperse them. But the critical question remains whether these actions can account for all the deaths (and I agree, that it should be known as 14 rather than 13 as that's the number who died as a direct result of the shooting that day).</p>

<p><i>"It should be noted that Bono, a native Dubliner, was brought up as a Protestant though he later converted to Catholicism."</i> Really? I don't think this is correct! As far as I know he went from being a Protestant to simply describing himself as a Christian. His mum Protestant and his dad was Catholic, but his father is said to have believed that children should not be so seperated from their mother by faith, so he opted to have both his sons (Norman and Paul-Paul is Bono's real name) raised as Protestants. His wife, the georgeous Ali, is the daughter of a Protestant clergyman. So, could someone get this right? <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> (who is neither prod nor taig).</p>
<p>Actually I think the Catholic parent was the mother not the father who was a Protestant (Ronan)</p>
<p>I added it. AFAIK Bono is somewhat close to organisations like Opus Dei.

<p>At a certain point, reports of an IRA sniper were heard in the British command center. The order to fire live rounds was given and one young man was shot and killed. The aggression against the British troops escalated, and eventually the order was given to move the troops out to chase the tail of the main group of marchers to the edge of the field by Free Derry Corner.</p>
<p>Despite a cease-fire order from command, several hundred rounds were fired directly into the fleeing crowds. 12 more were shot dead, many of them killed while tending the wounds of the fallen.</p>
<p>Instead of arresting those involved, the British paratroopers proceded in "chasing" innocent civilians women and children with armed weapons and shot dead <b>13</b> innocent civil right marchers.</p>

<dd>In a city like Derry, <i>of course</i> some of those involved would have been members of the IRA. There also were members of the Nationalist Party, church leaders (Protestant and Roman Catholic), etc. Members of the IRA were as entitled as anyone else to march, once they were not breaking the law.</dd>

<dd>As to the supposed sightings, they weren't as far as the evidence that has been presented goes, among the crowd. The crowd was unarmed. It was fired on. That is the issue.

<p>Yes, but can it be <b>proven</b> definitely as to whether they were armed or not? If not, then I think "unarmed" should be removed if there is no concrete evidence; perhaps replaced with a term such as "thought to be unarmed" or "believed to be unarmed", rather than stating it as an outright fact.<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonto_238a.html" title="User:Jonto">Jonto</a> 20:53, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The fact that not a single shot was fired at the paratroopers seems to substantiate the word "unarmed", I think.

<p>The Events of the day section is seriously lacking. As someone that doesn't know very much about the event I'm left with very little information about the actual event rather then the politics after it. It would be great with a more detailed timeline as well as more details about where and when the different events occured. Some suggestions for additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people attended the march? Over 50,000</li>
<li>Who were they? The majority was working class Catholics but also has some Protestants in attendance.</li>
<li>Why did they march? In protest against the descrimation of Roman Catholics by the British.</li>
<li>Why were there barricades? They did not get permission to March so the barricaded were put in place to stop the marches.</li>
<li>Did the group of teenagers manage to break through the barricade at Guildhall? NO - The Guidhall was not the scene of where this happened, altough the plan was for the march to end at the Guidhall the marchers did not make it past William Street the first barricade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did more people follow them? How big was the group? Nobody followed, a group of 20-30 youths protested at the barricades where water cannons had been used against them</p>
<ul>
<li>If they did manage to break the barricade, what happened then? Did the police let the march go on peacefully at first and not until later start firing? NO again they did not get through the barricades.</li>
<li>Where was the first boy shot? Around the Guildhall barricades? Was there any reason he was signled out? Again the Guidhall barricades were not insight, all shootings took place in the Bogside.</li>
<li>When and where did the rest of the firing take place? The text only mentions that orders were given to stop firing, not that firing started. There are several statements made that firing was taking place from the city walls over looking the bogside, beside the flats in the Bogside and within Glenfada Park.</li>
<li>When did the cease-fire order happen in relation to the firing? As soon as it started? Before it started? After it had been going on for a while? The shooting had been going on for some time and continued after the cease fire order was given</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize this is a contagious issue, but it's better to put in some uncertain information that then can be discussed and tweaked, then to put in nothing at all. <a href="../../../s/i/c/User%7ESicking_83ad.html" title="User:Sicking">Sicking</a> 23:51, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, is there any possibility to have access to other version of this event like, of people who claim that there are evidence of the precense of a sniper or that some bullets were shot not only by the army&#160;?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I know some of these things you want clarified, which i will now add to the article, namely about the first killed - my uncle Jackie Duddy, and the situation surrounding his shooting. I also altered his name, as you had him listed as John...I also know for a fact that one single soldier was injured on the day itself - but that was an accident before the paras even left their barracks that morning, when he shot himself in the foot while cleaning his gun. Interesting?</li>

<p>Well done on this entire article, it provides invaluable insight into what is still a very important and, as yet, unresolved event in our lives. (JC, Derry. November 2005)</p>
<p><br />
The fact that no weapons were found on the dead and wounded does not mean that there were no 'Weapons' used at this particular incident. bottles filled with nails, bricks and other assorted projectiles were found at the site and in it's immediate surroundings. having served in Ireland as a paratrooper myself, I have experienced being on the receiving end of this type of weapon myself, they are just as deadly as a ballistic weapon. The scene was tampered with before any investigations could be carried out. The comment that no armed IRA men would flee like rabbits while their bretheren were being fired upon is complete nonsense.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>No, its not complete nonsene. Sure not all IRA men would have taken a stand, but some would have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An IRA gunman is not a Hero, or have any hero like qualities. If they were why would they attack 2 british soldiers as part of a large group&#160;? bomb innocent civilians? wear balaclavas?</p>
<ul>
<li>So because some members of the IRA did wrong, all of them do? By the same logic, I can "prove" you would shoot an innocent civilian, because at least some Paras did on 30.01.72.</li>
</ul>
<p>I served in Ireland as a member of the Parachute Regiment and have seen first hand how cowardly these so called "Hero's" are. When British soldiers are attacked should they just stand by and not defend themselves?</p>
<ul>
<li>This question is kinda rhetorical, because thats not the way I believe it happened. Even if the soldiers took fire, they didnt respond to the attackers, but attacked civilians in at least a few of cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>NO&#160;!!!!!!</p>
<p>I think really we need to wait until the new inquiry into what happened gives it's version of events. At least then it will be a half decent account of what happened on that day, unless of course its a £155 Million cover up (which if it is accused to be it'd be a pretty poor attempt, why waste £155 Million when you have a perfectly good Widgery cover up?).</p>
<p>In the section about the Saville inquiry, an Australian judge is mentioned. Later on it states that he only arrived in 2000. I propose that this section be rephrased to make it clear and easy to understand. At present the impression is given that he was there from the start.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day thats all we are looking for. The truth. Simply yelling and accusing each other and arguing the toss isn't going to solve anything. I'm the son of a Para who served in NI during the 70s and one of my good freinds is a senior member of Fianna Fail's youth wing (and he isn't exactly brimming with praise for Sinn Fein/IRA either to put it lightly) so <b>seriously chaps</b> it can be done!

<p>Can someone please tell me why its says 13 people were shot dead instead of 14 just because one guy took longer to die? If someone dies directly because of something you do, even if its a long time after, its still considered murder. Or should we change it to 12 because one guy might have taken a full minute to die.

<hr />
<p>By saying shot dead means they were killed in the spot they stood - one person died at a later date from the shootings.</p>
<p>The claim that the crowd was armed is in fact just a claim. The people who have made this claim have provided no evidence, other than the fact that I.R.A members were in the march. Now,hopefully we can leave behind this ridiculous debate about I.R.A members courage behind. If these men were armed the situation would have almost certainly degenerated into the sort of gun battle that was happening basically everyday in West Belfast at that time. The fact is that British soldiers killed 14 innocent, unarmed civilians. In my view, that amounts to cold blooded murder no different than any I.R.A atrocity. Bloody Sunday should be regarded by all right minded people as what it was, one of the worst atrocities of the troubles. how courageous of you to remain anonymous;)Samgb 15:10, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since the tests carried out were negative - and so would not have been "prosecution evidence" - it is irrelevant to cite cases where <i>positive</i> results secured convictions. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 13:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm curious to see the evidence behind the claim that 'one man was witnessed by Father Edward Daly and others haphazardly firing a revolver in the direction of the paratroopers'. I'm writing a paper on Bloody Sunday, and have found no reference to this alleged OIRA gunman in any of the sources I've examined - where did this come from? (I am not disputing the claim; rather, I would like to examine the evidence supporting it, to determine if this is something I should discuss in my paper.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.82.98.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.82.98.151_4782.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.82.98.151">contribs</a>) 23:38, 4 January 2007.</small></p>

<dd>Bishop Daly has spoken about this on a number of occasions, notably in the 05 Dec 1991 <i>Secret History</i> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> TV documentary, which also showed the photographs (now apparently "lost") of the gunman. He naturally also covered it in his statement to the BSI <a href="http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/reports/kstatments/Archive/H5.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/reports/kstatments/Archive/H5.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (paragraph 24). He mentions having previously referred to the incident in a contemporary statement, which may be in <i>Eyewitness Bloody Sunday</i>, but I don't have my copy to hand to check at the moment. If you Google on the phrase "Daly's guman" it comes up with numerous hits on both the BSI site and BIRW's one covering references by both Bishop Daly and other witnesses. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 11:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks very much for the help there - now that you mention it, I do recall reading something about that in Eyewitness Bloody Sunday. I'll have to get the book out again to look it up. Thanks again.</p>

<dd>If such pictures of a gunman did exist wouldn't they be splashed around every newspaper in the North?

<dd>Funny that Father Daly freely refers to the man in question, then. And that <i>Secret History</i> managed to include the photographs in their documentary. And that they were discussed at the Saville Inquiry. And that both Jimmy McGovern and Peter Greengrass included the incident in their separate films. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 18:32, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the word of a member of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy in Ireland isn't going to convince me. However, I accept such photos may have existed though I find it odd they've simply been "lost".<a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrish_Republican_1600.html" title="User:Irish Republican">Irish Republican</a> 03:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Fr Daly was one example; there are other witnesses who testified at Saville to having seen the man in question. In any case, the photograph still "exists" in the <i>Secret History</i> documentary (24m 54s in on my recording), even if the originals have been lost. On the programme it's somewhat dark, but the man is obviously holding a semi-automatic pistol similar to a <a href="../../../m/1/9/M1911_Colt_pistol_11ef.html" title="M1911 Colt pistol">M911 Colt</a> or a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browning_Hi-Power_ecdc.html" title="Browning Hi-Power">Browning Hi-Power</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Cooper_8c36.html" title="User:Nick Cooper">Nick Cooper</a> 08:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Republican, I read your comment and was pretty appalled. The implication that Edward Daly, a priest, would lie over something as serious this is pretty ridiculous when you consider he was there on the day and guided the injured out at his own risk. If there was anyone there on that day that could convince me there was a gunman present, it's Daly. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Smith%27s_0cbe.html" title="User:John Smith's">John Smith's</a> 15:19, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've often heard it said that Bloody Sunday marked the end of the Civil Rights movement in the north can anyone offer any fact of this and should it be added to the article (14:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC))</p>
