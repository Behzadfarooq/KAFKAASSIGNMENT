<p>Thanks for reworking this page Martin. The new version's great. The only problem is that <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_for_speedy_deletion_c969.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion</a> still states that "pages created and edited solely by a banned user..." may be deleted instantly. Is the disappearance of this from the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocking policy</a> today meant to suggest that sysops may not delete such pages? Is it also the case that reverts of potentially valid edits by banned users may no longer occur? I can see advantages for both allowing this and not allowing it, but the banning and deletion policies should at least be consistent with each other. Perhaps different policies for different banned users would be appropriate. Edits by Michael, for example, are allowed to be reverted without consideration as to their validity, whereas edits by DW should not be?</p>
<p>Other than that, the only changes I would suggest are re-adding the link to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia%7EDealing_with_vandalism_a5a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Dealing with vandalism">dealing with vandalism</a>, and having a new section on how to unblock a user (a question that gets asked quite a lot). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:50, Apr 4, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">distinction?</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>Is there a need to distinguish between banning and blocking? They have always been the same in my mind. If a sysop blocks a user, they have also banned that user, whether that is for 24 hours or indefinite, and the block log shows that reincarnations of "blocked" users are re-blocked when they appear, making it seem more like a ban than a block. Calling it blocking instead of banning just makes it sound more circumventable. I can see that it is possible to ban without blocking, but the opposite is not true as a block is also a ban. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 13:18, Apr 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think there is a distinction. Obviously, we block anon proxies, open proxies, bots, without banning the users behind those proxies. And we range block whole ISPs sometimes, but that's without banning every person with that ISP.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd also say that anti-vandal blocks aren't really bans (though persistant vandalism is grounds for banning, eg Michael). If a random vandal circumvents a block and starts contributing sensibly, nobody cares. This, even though their original account might have been banned for a period of months or longer. Does that make sense? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 13:34, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like to point out that giving extra powers to any subgroup of wikipedians needs appropriate checks and balances to sustain the open and democratic culture of WP. When you give easy banning to admins, you need to simplify the revocation (suspension) of admin privileges. Alternatively, the banning should not block the user from editing/posting, but rather mark his edits as <i>questionable</i>. The biggest threat to Wikipedia are not the trolls (they are dealt easily with and are nothing but a mere annoyance), but limitations to freedom and superfluous privileges for admins (even though it might not look this way right now).<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 22:40, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guanaco made this "official" today - I just thought I'd put a note of this date of change, because it might confuse ongoing discussion of the point.

<p><a name="Email_proposal" id="Email_proposal"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Email proposal</span></h2>
<p>I propose that the blocking policy should state that any sysop who chooses to block users must have an email address set in their preferences. This policy has been in effect for some time at the <a href="../../../../simple/b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBans_and_blocks_702a.html" class="extiw" title="simple:Wikipedia:Bans_and_blocks">Simple English Wikipedia</a> without objection from the sysops there. This prevents the problem of someone being affected by a block but not able to contact the person who blocked them. The "<a href="../../../b/l/o/MediaWiki%7EBlockedtext_22db.html" title="MediaWiki:Blockedtext">You have been blocked</a>" message has always suggested that the blocked user contact the sysop who blocked them. Until now, there has been a link to that sysop's user page, but this is fairly pointless when the blocked user can't edit. The only way to contact someone when you are blocked is via email, so sysops should be contactable by email, and a link to <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_sysopname_d2b0.html" title="Special:Emailuser/sysopname">Special:Emailuser/sysopname</a> should be included in the block message. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 14:30, Apr 24, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would support that. I guess I'll go re-enable my "Email this user" to compensate... <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 14:48, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It certainly seems reasonable to expect a sysop blocking a user to be contactable by that user. If this is the only way to ensure that, then fair enough. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Support. However, the message should also link to board.wikipedia.org and the wikien-l mailing list. <a href="../../../j/r/r/User%7EJRR_Trollkien_70d5.html" title="User:JRR Trollkien">JRR</a> <a href="../../../j/r/r/User_talk%7EJRR_Trollkien_5e90.html" title="User talk:JRR Trollkien">Trollkien</a> <a href="../../../j/r/r/User%7EJRR_Trollkien_warning_1358.html" title="User:JRR Trollkien/warning">(see warning)</a> 15:56, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On second thoughts, I'm not sure how useful such a policy would be. There's no way of ensuring the sysop really uses that email account, so emails to it might be ignored, which is probably worse than not having the email address available in the first place. Maybe a separate mailing list or <a href="http://boards.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://boards.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">message board</a> would be more useful than emailing an individual sysop. It would keep them off Wikien-l, which is not an appropriate place for it, and also means the list could be one that doesn't require registration, allowing blocked users to send to it immediately. Accidentally blocked users would get a faster response than if they emailed one sysop, and it also gives them a place to complain if they don't feel they should have been blocked. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 15:47, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why isn't wikien-l suitable? It'd get a prompt reply (better than a board, which I expect nobody would bother reading. Lists that don't require registration get swamped with spam, so that's not really an option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regards enforcability, well there's the honour system (we're meant to trust sysops, right?), and any user who gets no response from the blocking sysop can easily escalate it to wikien-l. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 17:08, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocking by Non Admins and Non Arbitrators: Good or not?</span></h2>
<p>Why can't ANYONE be the judge? "Independent contributors OUGHT TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO BAN OR BLOCK!" I complained to an Arbitrator recently over the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Paul_Vogel_Evidence_0a4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Paul Vogel/Evidence">Paul Vogel</a> issue. However, I was upset at the time because said Arbitrator removed my "vote" on some issues on account of my not being an arbitrator. However, perhaps there are misgivings: would you really want the banned user <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichael_ban_4185.html" title="User talk:Michael/ban">Michael</a> voting to block an enemy while in disguise? Would you want a deadlock to occur over a ban? On the other hand, everything is out in the OPEN when one holds a vote, and people's comments on bans ought to be heard on the <i>same</i> page as other people, whether they are sysops, admins, arbitrators, or not. To not do so, in my eyes, smacks of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elitism.html" title="Elitism">elitism</a>, as folks might ignore any non-arbitrator or non-admin opinion. Your call. I mainly asked for commoner <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffrage.html" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a> because I feel non-arbitrators and non-admins should have some say in deciding whether to ban someone, even if they have a little less weight than arbitrators, or admins. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> 21:21, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Everyone does have a say - via the quickpolls page (where appropriate), the request for comment page, and of course in the matter of setting Wikipedia policy in the first place, and by means of the more usual methods of enforcing rules and guidelines: bold editing, peer pressure, persuasion, discussion. Even for cases in arbitration, there is the talk page of the arbitration page in question, the mailing list, IRC, the evidence page, etc. If you want to influence the arbitration decision, I suggest providing evidence as the best way to do that. If you want to influence community opinion, there are loads of ways to do that, some subtle, some blatant, but the arbitration page for a case is not one of them. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 21:45, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, you are right, you have a say, but it won't be listened too unless you are part of the governing cabal. There is a rapid and disturbing trend to centralize decision making in the hands of Administrators, who used to be simply that, people who <i>administered</i> the community's decisions. They are now setting themselves up as judge, jurry and executioner on just about every issue that matters - who to exclude being perhaps the most important one.

<dd>Together with <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_committee_19e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation committee">mediation</a>, arbitration has been set up to do the job that previously was done by <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> alone (it's been set up with Jimbo's support and blessing, in case that's not clear). Whereas before he alone had the final say on whether a user was banned or not, now a group decides this. If you want to call that a "cabal", that's your privilege, but we are to a large degree trying to follow the wishes of the community, and the current system is surely less elitist than the old.

<dd>Troll Silent's comments are, I think, somewhat wide of the mark. Administrators have no more power now than they have had in a long time; the arbitration committee is not "little known", it has been widely advertised; the committee's power stems not from the declarations of its own members (what sort of power would that be?) but from Jimbo and from the ratification vote mentioned above; and everybody, part of the "governing cabal" (whatever that is) or not, will be listened to, and I see no reason to believe that they won't. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<p>No, the new system radically changes the role of 'administrators' who, under the old system administer the decisions of the community. Under the new system they get to decide who can and can't edit Wikipedia based on their (not the community's) view of behavior and name. There is no history of the Cabal listening to people. The current closed vote by four Cabalist on whether they can immediately block anyone they like is a good example. Yes, we have a voice, no, we will not be listened to. I challenge them to put it to a community vote. I know they will not. Troll Silent, Troll Deep 15:32, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A proposed restriction on sysop/admin privs</span></h2>
<p>The use of the special rights, that sysops/admins have, should be restricted (by rule or by convention as this could not be automated) to disputes in which they have no other part. Wikipedians get upset when, in a dispute, one of the participants in the dispute uses their special powers to enforce their point of view. A fairly recent example: A user (not me) was blocked for 24hrs by the same sysop at whom the user swore. That is an abuse of privelege. In the UK, when a neighbour throws rubbish into a policeman's garden the policeman is supposed to call the police, he is discouraged from arresting the culprit himself. This is probably not a new suggestion. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 15:42, 16 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

See <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">wikipedia:protection policy</a>. I'm not sure it's necessarily a good idea to apply the same principle to blocking though. Often the people most likely to be blocking an IP are the same admins who have been attacked by that user, simply due to the number of times a blocked user will return to retaliate against those sysops. It's not always going to be clear in such cases whether a particular admin would be considered too involved in the issue to block the IP. When your user page is being vandalised every few days, it's hard to keep track of which IPs have attacked you in order to know that you shouldn't block them in future. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 07:42, May 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Angela points out, there is already a policy for page protection, and there is already an extensive policy for deletions. The trouble with blocking is that "official" policy is so much at odds with what is actually going on that it is not always followed.

<p>There should be no personal involvement the <b>FIRST</b> time a sysop blocks a user. The return of the user, with accompanying abuse directed at the sysop, should not knock the sysop out of action, after all, they are the one who noticed the problem that resulted in the block.

<p>I think you will always be able to devise circumstances which would require a different approach BUT sysops/admins should <i>usually</i> refrain from using their special powers in a dispute to which they are a party: They should be admonished that they should not ordinarily use their special powers in such a situation.

<dd>Yes, but how do you define "a dispute to which they are a party"? Does vandalism of pages they have edited make them a party to the dispute?

<p>Sometimes you will not be able to decide that issue for sure. And other times you will. Vandalism of a page that a sysop has edited is obviously not usually a "dispute to which they <i>[the sysop/admin]</i> are a party". But where there is a dispute especially of a personal nature it is often (or usually) inappropriate for a sysop/admin to ban the user with whom the sysop/admin is having a dispute. A sysop/admin should be admonished to use his/her special powers where he/she is sure it will <i>appear</i> to all reasonable fellow Wikipedians that they are doing so impartially. I am not suggesting a rule, necessarily, but a sentence in a code of practice.

<p>Paul - given the particular instance you cite (and without knowing the details), it seems to me that merely swearing at another user, while inappropriate, does not warrant a sysop deciding to block that user. Certainly I can see nothing in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">wikipedia:blocking policy</a> to support such a block, unless there were other circumstances you've not mentioned. If so, this block is <i>already</i> against our policies, and I see no benefit in adding another policy for it to be against. Why add more rules when "vigilant" sysops don't even follow the existing ones? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 01:01, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we decide to extend current policy to allow sysops to unilaterally block for making personal attacks, then a rule that such blocks may only be applied by sysops not involved in the dispute might make sense. I'm not convinced that allowing sysops to block in such cases is terribly useful (just <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">remove personal attacks</a> already). <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 01:15, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sure, but I don't think it's a good policy. What I'm trying to do is understand why you've proposed the policy, and work out a better solution. In your example, it seems that you descibe an admin going against existing blocking policy. It seems to me that the best solution to this is to have a word with the admin and get them to follow policy over that sort of thing.

<p>Martin, in <i>another</i> example I was recently witness to a dispute where one party backed down stating that the person he was arguing with was using his sysop status to give his argument (which had nothing to do with the duties, priveleges or powers of a sysop) extra weight. The sysop was not actually doing that but he had just said that his decision was "final" as if he had that right and he wasn't correcting the misapprehension either so I intervened to press the sysop to acknowledge that his sysop status gave him no special status in the dispute and relucatantly he did so. The argument then proceded on its merits. My point is that the role / power / privelege of the sysop is misunderstood by many sysops and non-sysops. I really cannot see why you and Angela are against having as a policy something with which most reasonable wikipedians would agree: That a sysop should not use his/her special powers or his/her heightened status to hold sway or to lay down the law in an argument about content: There all wikipedians are equal. When a wikipedian does not act in the accepted fashion <b>then</b> a sysop should intervene. <b>But</b> what superhuman gift accrues a wikipedian when he is annointed sysop that (s)he can fairly judge in a dispute in which (s)/he is embroiled?

<dd>"<i>A sysop should not use his/her special powers or his/her heightened status in a dispute in which they are involved</i>". Without a doubt this is reasonable.

<p>No. Sysops don't have heightened status, and the powers aren't special. Wording aside, existing policy pages are already clear on this as it stands, and I have seen few situations where an actual misuse of admin capabilities occurred. Consider that the most frequent use of admin capabilities is deletion and the second most frequent page protection and editing of protected pages. Policies are extremely clear in these cases. For quite some time we have suffered a surfeit of unfounded complaints about admin behavior.

<dd>There's nothing wrong with opening jail cells if the inmates have already escaped through the window. Their IP addresses were auto-unblocked, so they were already free to come back and cause more problems. Since we're opening the jail cells and repairing the windows, we can deal with more vandals without building more jails (having a cluttered IP block list). Also, as <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> said, if they're still wearing their jail suits (keeping the same username), they'll be easier to catch and reblock. <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuanaco_98c8.html" title="User:Guanaco">Guan</a><a href="../../../g/u/a/User_talk%7EGuanaco_7540.html" title="User talk:Guanaco">aco</a> 01:29, 24 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand the poll. It refers to "Sockpuppets of banned users", but the people you are unblocking are not just the sockpuppets, but the actual banned users themselves, such as the stick. There is already confusion between bans and blocks, and I'm concerned that un<i>blocking</i> these accounts will make people think they are un<i>banned</i>, as there is no longer a record of the fact they were banned, meaning sysops have no right to reblock the account if it is used again. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angel</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">a.</a> 01:08, May 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>TheStick was never actually <i>banned</i>. He was just blocked indefinitely. Sysops always have the right to block user accounts that do nothing but vandalism. However, I realize now that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheStick_1bf3.html" title="User:TheStick">User:TheStick</a> should not have been unblocked. I will reblock <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheStick_1bf3.html" title="User:TheStick">User:TheStick</a> and leave the rest unblocked.</p>
<p>The poll only pertains to <i>sockpuppets,</i> and the main usernames will be left blocked. <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuanaco_98c8.html" title="User:Guanaco">Guan</a><a href="../../../g/u/a/User_talk%7EGuanaco_7540.html" title="User talk:Guanaco">aco</a> 02:19, 25 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your belief that this user was never banned is what worries about sysops unblocking users that they know nothing about. This problem occurred recently on another Wikimedia wiki where a new sysop made a large number of unblocks, all of which had to be remade, because he was not aware of the reasons for the initial ban and/or block. <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-May/003444.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-May/003444.html" rel="nofollow">Erik's email</a> to the mailing list about TheStick stated he had banned the user. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:TheStick&amp;diff=1090335&amp;oldid=1090325" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:TheStick&amp;diff=1090335&amp;oldid=1090325" rel="nofollow">Martin's post</a> to his user page suggested he was banned, and the current notice on <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheStick_1bf3.html" title="User:TheStick">user:TheStick</a>, which states he would need to appeal to Jimbo, certainly seem to suggest he was banned as simply "blocked" users have never had to do this. The danger in unblocking sockpuppets, which is what the poll below claims to be about, overlooks the fact that not all sysops are going to know which account was the "banned" one, and which were sockpuppets. Unblocking random accounts without an awareness of what they were blocked for does not sound a sensible idea. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 03:19, May 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>A potential complication, I think, is that some usernames blocked as sockpuppets might not actually be sockpuppets. At the moment, if somebody comes along and acts like BannedUserX, we block them on the assumption they're a sockpuppet. But it might not actually be the same person behind that username - it could just be somebody getting their kicks by imitating them. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with such blocks (there's no way to be sure if it really is a sockpuppet or somebody else, and in any case, somebody imitating a banned user is being a massive tit and deserving of all they get), but it does mean that if you later unblock those not-actually-sockpuppets, you might not be doing what you think you're doing.</p>
<p>Whether this is an argument in favour of unblocking these users or against it, I'm not sure, but I thought I'd mention it, because I didn't want to be the only person getting confused by it.</p>
<p>That slightly nebulous point aside, it seems to me that if the only benefit of this is to have a shorter block list, that's not a very great benefit for something so controversial. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dd>It's a good policy, and I agree in particular with Cheney's note about priviledge visa-vis responsibility.

<dd>I don't believe that <i>anyone</i> should be blocked or allowed to self-block for a wikiholiday. Blocking is a tool of last resort - it's the single most drastic sanction that we can impose, when no other choice presents itself. It shouldn't be cheapened by sysops using it for what are frankly trivial reasons, particularly as there are other ways of achieving the same goal. For instance, users could use blocking software at the client end or even (is this really so hard?) not visiting Wikipedia. Any action at the user's end is not going to affect anyone else. Any action at the Wikipedia end, such as a block, has a real chance of affecting many innocent bystanders.</dd>

<dd>This problem came to my notice when I found that my entire ISP - or at least its proxy servers - had been blocked by a newbie sysop, whom I won't name here. It's not the first time that I've accidentally been blocked, but every other occasion has involved vandalism. Blocking an entire ISP in order for one user to have a self-imposed wikiholiday seemed to be totally pointless, and not a little selfish. (I should add that I don't think the sysop in question was being selfish - he simply didn't realise that he was blocking his ISP's proxy, not his personal IP address, which would have been a dynamic one anyway). So I had a look at the blocking policy page, which already disallowed blocking for wikiholidays: "The situations when sysops are permitted to block users are given below. Blocks should not be used in other cases." The non-permitted "other cases" thus included wikiholidays, but this was not clearly spelled out. Hence the addition of the policy.</dd>

<dd>This should have been more widely advertised as it is quite a major change to the policy. You could say that Wikibreak blocks were never allowed, but the precedent would suggest otherwise and there will now be many sysops unaware of this. As this page has had over 180 edits in the last month, it is unlikely many have followed each change. There have been dozens of sysops who have blocked themselves so it's surprising to see none of them commenting here. Other than the danger of blocking people with the same IP, how is self-blocking any different to protecting your own user page? Protection is supposed to be used as a last resort as well, but sysops regularly protect their own pages without reason. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 02:18, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Angela. I don't support self-blocking, nor do I support protection of one's own user pages without compelling reason. Both actions have been <i>tolerated</i> in the past -- there just hasn't been any community objection because these are actions that don't require consensus to take and because, until recently, there haven't been any practical problems created as a result of them (As you may be aware a recent self-block resulted in inadvertent autoblocking of another user). Perhaps the discussion should be more widely publicised. I consider self-blocking and protection of one's own user page to be rather self-aggrandizing which is contrary to the spirit of <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a>, which implies that administrators should maintain a low profile ("no big deal"). <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">UninvitedCompany</a> 16:07, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the input, Angela. I'm afraid it simply isn't true to say that "it is quite a major change to the policy". The policy <i>already</i> said that blocking for any reason other than the ones listed was not permitted. This disallows self-blocking. If self-blocking is to be permitted, that <b>would</b> constitute a change to the policy. Saying that it is not permitted is merely reiterating the existing policy more clearly. If some sysops haven't followed the policy in the past it doesn't follow that a change of policy has taken place - it certainly hasn't been discussed! -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 16:37, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It still seems like a change to me. People doing something and everyone accepting that would imply that it is allowed, regardless of what some policy page might say. If this does go in the policy, what's going to happen when a sysop breaks it? If the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">Protection policy</a> and the frequent protection of sysops' user pages in violation of that is anything to go by, nothing - so what's the point of a non-enforced policy? Or maybe people feel more strongly about this and will unblock self-blocking sysops and list them at <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">RFC</a> etc? Anyway, I'm not opposing it as such, but for consistency, the same sort of thing should be applied to protection and deletion if this does stay in the policy. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 06:08, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is really an issue between two ways of policy formation - existing practice and written codification. In this case they appeared to conflict, so we had to have a discussion to resolve the issue. I think we have at this point, we'll just need to work on changing people's habits to match. I don't think that should require anything more than pointing out the current policy to someone who self-blocks, and asking them not to do it again. It might not necessarily apply to protection and deletion, because those don't have the same effect on other users as self-blocking does. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 15:46, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'll drop a note on the relevant talk pages, asking them to come here and look at the reasons we've given here for preferring that admins do not use self-blocks. Hopefully they will be persuaded that what we've said is reasonable. If not, I hope they will at least explain why they feel they require the ability to self-block. I'd also be interested to know why admins require the ability to self-block and non-admins do not. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 21:32, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't really have a strong opinion on this, but I agree with Angela that disallowing self-blocks is a major policy change. If we want to make such a change, we should more widely advertise it.

I repeat, <b>self-blocking is already disallowed</b>. It isn't among the valid reasons for blocking listed by the existing policy. The policy hasn't changed by virtue of it not being followed by a few people.

<p>I think the justifications for this policy are reasonable and outweigh the only reason (raging addiction) for these self-blocks. I have no objections; indeed, my main reason for objecting was the complete lack of discussion which preceded the addition of this section. (Whether users should be able to request their own blocking is another question, which may need further examination.) <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a> 23:48, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ChrisO drew my attention to the repercussions for other users sharing the same IP range. Until the software supports the blocking of a username without blocking the IP range concomitantly, I think self-blocks should not be allowed (regret causing trouble, e.g. to ChrisO himself). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 14:00, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks to the three of your for commenting. Guanaco - is it OK if we just draw the attention of sysops to this as and when they use self-blocks in this manner? It affects such a tiny proportion of Wikipedia, it doesn't seem (to me) worth bothering everyone with. *shrug*.

<dd>I think Martin has the right idea. It's not like we're going to de-sysop the next person who self-blocks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">mix of vandalism and productive edits</span></h2>
<p>HCheney suggested that "a mixture of vandalism and productive edits" implies that only one productive edit is necessary. I feel that "a mixture" implies a decent proportion and intermixing of both (and reverted accordingly).</p>
<p>HCheney apparently desires some way to block users that perform such a mixture, and I don't have an objection to that. The safeguard that blocks should not be used against isolated incidents seems to me to be a sufficient guard - looking at past incidents where this would apply.</p>

In fact since Lir is currently being investigated by the AC it seems to me that S/he should certainly <i>not</i> be blocked unless s/he went on some mad vandalism spree, that reverting/page protection could not sort out.

<p>I'm musing here, but could the section of the page on disruption be modified in some way to allow short term (1-3 days... a week at most) blocks for repeated personal attacks on the part of any user? I think that such "cool down" periods would be very useful in ending edit wars and reducing the number of pages that seem to exist chronically protected. Obviously this would have to be a heavily limited right, but I feel as though personal attacks are, quite frankly, just as bad and destructive as vandalism, except that they require months to deal with because currently the only means of blocking due to personal attacks comes via the arbcom. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 03:52, Aug 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

The other sysop can then either (i) block as requested or (ii) reply, "No, you misinterprete that as vandalism, possibly because you are being criticised personally and criticism of the type you are experiencing does not seem to warrant blocking.

If the vandalism is a pretext for blocking when the real reason is a personal attack, that's another matter entirely. But there's no good way to rule on that, and so my inclination would be to err on the side of giving sysops authority but trusting them not to misuse it.

<dd>I cannot block someone should they deface my user page, why should a Sysop be able to block someone should the Sysop's user page be defaced? Each of us should have to appeal to a(nother) Sysop. What is all too often being forgotten is that Sysops have no special priveleges: They have powers which they are allowed to exercise only to the common good. A Sysop should always be in a position to say: "Like it or not, what I did I did in the honest belief it was in the common good." When a Sysop acts in a dispute to which (s)he is a party this "honest belief" is always going to be in doubt. A good Sysop will always NOT act as a sysop where they have an interest <b>or where it might be thought</b> they have an interest. And anybody with the necessary judgement to be a good Sysop should also be able to see the logic of this argument.

<dd>You also cannot protect pages (such as your own user page) or delete pages (such as your own user page or sub-pages). By electing users to admin positions we entrust them to act appropriately and if they do not they can be censored, punished, or have the admin privileges removed. No one is above public review. If a vandal defaces several user pages and the admin blocks them it is not uncommon for the same vandal to log in with a new IP in order to vandalize the admin's user page. In this case there is no disagreement or fight between vandal and admin so there is no conflict of interest and the admin should be allowed to block this new IP for the same vandal. (Just one example of why it should be allowed.) The idea is to trust the admins are not abusing and if they do bring it up for public review.

<p>I agree that admins shouldn't protect their own user pages and would like to point out to Paul that to my knowledge at least one admin has been censured for deleting thier own user page. In fact admins are routinly <i>advised</i> by the community. Well at least I am anyway, and in return I've contacted loads of other admins with comments on their behaviour, I'm pretty sure everyone does it from time to time. Of course you don't get to see these mild rebukes because they are done on talk pages or by email, but that doesn't mean they are not effective. Most admins take advise on board and never need to be publically censured. Having said that, I don't have a problem with codifying good behaviour as long as it is done well.

<p>I think that good behavior <i>is</i> codified. Policies are in place that define what an admin should and should not do and how they should do it. The email discussion list and many talk pages are full of refinements and discussions about how to make those policies better. (I haven't found the reference to a policy saying that admins cannot delete their own unused subpages but I'm looking for it. I don't think I've ever been contrary to it if it exists but I'd like to locate the directive. I've been aware of the self-block advisory but never do that anyway.) Many admins have protected their own user page from vandals and I see no problem with that. I have received comments on my own actions and I try to take that into account. It makes me a better admin. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 23:23, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, <i>some</i> good behaviour is codified. The user page issue is nothing but a red herring. Surely everyone agrees with the assertion that using one's sysops priv when one's impartiality could be regarded as being in doubt is a bad thing. Sysops should be in no doubt about this but some evidently are from this discussion. Also I have previously given two examples where it would have been useful to point at just such an assertion in the guidelines. I simply want to have in the blocking guidelines text something like:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is inadvisable to block a user where your objectivity is likely to be regarded as being in doubt. This perception is likely to be the case where you have been party to the dispute leading to the block. Vandalism of a Sysop's user page or a bad edit of an article must be handled by that Sysop in the same way that every other Wikipedian must cope with such issues. Possibly this may culiminate in an appeal to a(nother) Sysop for assistance.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>One of my goals here is to keep a rein on the <i>natural</i> tendency of <i>anybody</i> with authority to end up abusing that. Another goal is to ensure that Sysops identify fully with other Wikipedians by having to cope with issues in the exactly the same way as other Wikipedians. The customs etc of Wikipedia must be to the benefit of all editors, not just an exalted minority. When a group of Sysops say they are happy with a feature or a custom or a rule of Wikipedia then this carries extra weight if the Wikipedia they experience is the same as that experienced by non-sysops.</p>

<dd>Among other things, I believe he provides all of Wikipedia's bandwidth. I'm certainly not entirely comfortable with one individual having a lot of power over this sort of project, but he seems to be using it reasonably. I would imagine that he mostly only needs to make unilateral decisions on large policy matters and time-critical things. I would also imagine that in a project like this, the number of unilateral decisions that need to be made goes down with time, as there are more sysops and more precedent.</dd>
<dd>If you're going to have sysops at all, though, you have to think about things like "If a sysop abuses their power, what do we do about it?". It might not be better, but it's a lot more <i>simple</i> to implement, if there's one individual who can deal with things like that. Otherwise, you either need infinite ever-shrinking levels of higher and higher bureaucracy, or you need the code itself to handle things like "sysops voting to remove other sysops".</dd>
<dd>I don't think that Jimbo is beyond criticism by any means; I imagine that if he were consistently making arbitrary or poor decisions, people would talk about it, and eventually there would be some sort of fight. I haven't had any personal interaction with him, but given what I've seen of this site, I'm sure he'd be more than willing to listen to disagreement on a specific decision.</dd>
<dd>Basically, I think that Jimbo Wales is very similar to Linus Torvalds: he has a position of power, based on communal respect. People are comfortable with this, because they know that if he ever begins to unilaterally abuse his power, there's nothing preventing us from starting a project of our own, with all the same material. — <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 20:57, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In theory, the community might decide that they wish Jimbo to lose some of his existing powers to ban users. If this becomes community policy, then as an arbitrator I'll be entirely happy to apply that policy, and I imagine most sysops will be similarly happy to enforce community decisions on the matter. So in that sense, the community has some power over Jimbo. Additionally, the Wikimedia board, which is partially elected by the community, has power over Jimbo. However, this is all very theoretical - as folks have said, everyone's pretty comfortable with the role Jimbo plays on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 17:50, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Grap (I've taken the liberty of signing for you, you can do it yourself by typing four tildes ~~~~) I don't <i>think</i> we have a formal policy as such, but general practice is to warn vandals a couple of times before blocking in case they are newbies test out the software. There are exceptions though - if vandalism is very clear and deliberate, we recently had someone vandal out recent changes page by putting a "you have new messages box" on that page and then directing people offsite to an abusive page. He was blocked without warning as there is no way he could have been just trying things out.Other examples is if someone vandalizes, gets blocked and then comes back with a different IP and vandalizes again. They usually don't get a warning and the block is usually for longer. As for the second part of your question. It depends. If the IP is static (they have broadband) then no a second warning is not usually given for a second block. If the IP is an ISP's proxy then yes, we have no reason to suspect that a second lot of vandalism is the same person, so we warn again. Also we don't extend the block past 24 hours because it will affect too many innocents. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">(taketh no rest)</a> 23:58, 12 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>If a user is blocked for 24 hours for violating the 3RR, and the user continues to make edits while under the block (by not logging in, but making it clear that it is the same person), what should be done? Should the IP he is using be blocked for 24 hours? Should the user's account be blocked for 24 hours past the last illegal edit made? What is the standard procedure? (This is, of course, not hypothetical.) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"></a> – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell"><b>Q</b>uadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_Request_for_assistance_8d8c.html" title="User:Quadell/Request for assistance">help</a>)</sup>[[]] 19:53, Dec 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I continue to believe that blocking people for 3rr violations is problematic because of problems with sockpuppetry and ban evasion.</p>
<p>The usual procedure regarding blocks in general in the past, has been that evading the block results in: the time period for the block beginning anew, any contributions made in evasion of the block being reverted, blocking any IPs used to evade the block, blocking any new identities used to evade the block. However, these policies have never been followed consistently. I suppose we could do the same thing with 3rr blocks, since without doing so, the effectiveness of blocks as a tool to affect user behavior is lost.</p>

<p>This applies to 3RR violations as well.

<p>Blocks are supposed to be short term to produce a change in behavior or provide temporary relief, so if the 3RR rule is not being followed, it's better to escalate to the community or the arbcom and have a ban of some sort considered.

<dd>Then you need to make WP policies known upfront. The way that WP is promoted, and most definitively the way that it works, gives a misleading sense that this is a project owned by the people that contribute to it, and the extraordinary level of discussion on controversial subjects makes is by default a public forum. Add to it the fact that WP works by consensus. Is there a consensus on blocking anonymized IP addresses? Don't think so. The decision was taken after a short conversation on the mailing list. Where is the line between "driven consensus" and "driven by WP policy"? IMO, as WP becomes more known and more popular with users and readers alike, WP needs to be much more upfront and public about what this project is, what are the guidelines for users and maintainers and make clear distinctions between "policy" and "consensus".--38.119.107.72 16:55, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Thank you Martin, Theresa, RikK, and Charles, for your useful comments. In summary, this is what I have learned in this exchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, WP is owned by a company (Wikimedia Foundation);</li>
<li>The work that we do as editors is a privilege bestowed on us by the Foundation, and it can be revoked at their will;</li>
<li>The Wikimedia Foundation has not published guidelines (terms &amp; conditions) for these privileges;</li>
<li>There are a lot of gray areas regarding consensus policy set by editors and policy set by the Wikimedia Foundation;</li>
<li>Privacy policy (e.g. disclosure of user's IP addresses to third parties) is non existent;</li>
<li>Sysops cannot see the IP address of a user, only developers can. The ArbCom may request that the developers lookup a specific user IP to check for sockpuppets. This seems to be a "consensus decision", rather that written policy;</li>
</ul>
<p>The need for privacy and respecting anonymity is and will continue to be crucial aspect in the development of the societal aspects of the Internet. That is why projects like <a href="http://tor.eff.org/" class="external text" title="http://tor.eff.org/" rel="nofollow">Tor</a> (supported by the EFF) will continue to evolve and provide ways to browse, comment, and contribute to projects like WP while protecting an individual's right for anonymous free speech. -- 38.119.107.72 03:47, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>WP content is owned by its contributors and licensed under the GFDL.</li>
<li>WP brand, servers, server logs, GFDL "publisher" rights, donations, grants, etc are owned by the charitable Wikimedia Foundation.</li>
<li>Typically, the community decides whose editing rights to revoke, not the foundation.</li>
<li>Wikipedia policy is one big grey area. Very little policy is set by the foundation.</li>
<li>Wikipedia privacy policy is a similar grey area. Like many Wikipedia policies, it is in perpetual draft.</li>
<li>Almost all written policies are the result of consensus decision.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am glad you are passionate about anonymous free speech. On Wikipedia we are passionate about writing an encyclopedia. If you wish to gather support for a change in policy regarding anonymous proxies that are not open proxies, you would more likely succeed if you concentrated on the benefits to the encyclopedia, rather than the benefit to the societal aspects of the internet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you wish us to have a formal privacy policy, I would recommend hiring a lawyer to review our situation and draft a formal privacy policy that takes into account our particular situation and needs. One of our major needs is easy understanding by non-lawyers, as the community is hostile to legalese that is too long or complex for it to understand. This draft can then be submitted to the Wikipedia community for review and modification. The drafting lawyer would probably need to be involved in this discussion. The modified draft could then become part of our written policy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hiring a lawyer might take some money, but I'm sure someone as dedicated as yourself to the cause of online freedom will be happy to cover the necessary expenses.</dd>

<dd>What this means is that indeed there is a gray area in respect to policies. The issue is that sooner or later, Wikimedia and the community of editors (to which, FYI, I belong as well) will have to make an effort to remove some of these gray areas and provide some clarity. It was all great when WP was a small little project. Not anymore.</dd>
<dd>Your bullet points above, present a situation that is not sustainable. The lack of policy will sooner or later become a liability and jeopardize the whole project. I am surprised no one is seeing this. --38.119.107.72 18:37, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont think so. Many people like public accounts, lets say cheesedreams for example. Anyway, lets see if there is rough consensus, please vote in the poll.

<p>Aeropus, thanks for your reply. It is true that CheeseDreams posted her password, although I don't think that she intended hers to be a public account the way you seem to. But in any case, if you look at the addition, it is merely describing <i>convention</i>, not what must be followed—and it is true that convention is to block public accounts. You yourself have mentioned this, as numerous of your previous accounts have been blocked and it occurred on the bugmenot accounts before you joined Wikipedia. Could you explain what benefit you feel public accounts give that Wikipedia's current scheme doesn't offer? I've asked you this question numerous times, both on your accounts here and on meta. It's currently sitting on your talk page as well. The rest of us only see disadvantages—perhaps if you could show us why they are helpful, we could do things differently. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 08:33, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ArbCom injunctions/resolutions</span></h2>
<p>Would it be a good idea to have an addition to this policy so we are explicit on whether sockpuppets created to get around injunctions/resolutions should be blocked or not, and if so for how long? I propose: <i>Users believed to be sockpuppets created to get around an injunction or ruling by the Arbitration Committee should be blocked for 24 hours per offence pending confirmation of identity. If it is confirmed, or is blatently obvious, they are a sockpuppet of a user subject to an Arbitration Committee injunction or ruling they should be blocked indefinitely</i> If the "blatently obivous" is disputed then confirmation should be sought and a different administrator can remove/shorten the block as apropriate. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 02:19, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support this. A number of Islam-related talk pages have been reduced to chaos recently by anon IPs, sockpuppets, and some regular users making personal attacks. We can block the ones who've made no useful contributions for disruption, but we can't block editors who've contributed properly in the past.

<p>I recently blocked a user for disruption to Wikipedia. Soon after I blocked him, he email-bombed me about 120 times with the term "FUCKER". Now, I know that it was from him and I know that he did this in direct retaliation for me blocking him. I <b>strongly</b> believe that there needs to be a new addition to this policy concerning blocked users and the admins. Because this is extra-Wikipedia, I can not block him for that reason. However, what does one do when this happens? It's obviously in direct retaliation for a direct Wikipedia action. Such activity should NOT be taken lightly (in fact, such activity is illegal).</p>

<dd>I have to say, wikipedia provides plenty of options for protecting your identity. There's no real need for the email link to be enabled, or you could point it at an email address that requires a particular subject to allow email through. (I might add, back in the day when I was an IRCop on DALnet, we had no user cloaks, and our IP addresses were in full view of everyone, including all the crazy users we autokilled/klined. We managed to survive, through a combination of protection software and reporting the most serious offenses to the user's ISP.) I'm not really sure what you're asking for, but if you're saying that admins should be allowed to block (or extend a current block of) users who harass admins off wikipedia, I don't think that's a good idea. One amazing aspect of Wikipedia is its transparent process. It's very difficult to hide actions on Wikipedia. If there's a question of why a user was banned, an admin can point to an edit or an action. Blocking for non-project issues loses that transparency, and I think that would be an unfortunate loss.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A possible inconsisency in the policies and practice: 3RR blocks are not bans</span></h2>
<p>I think I found an inconsistency in the text of this policy and the way it is used in practice.</p>
<p>Before coming here I asked <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Clarification:_Banning_vs._Blocking_and_3RR" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">at the village pump</a> and at <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EThree-revert_rule_d7c8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Three-revert rule">3RR</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how I understand the text of the policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>extending a block timer is only applicable if the user has been <b>banned</b> See <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html#Penalty_for_evasion" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">Wikipedia:Banning policy#Penalty for evasion</a></li>
<li>blocking a known sock is only applicable if the user has been <b>banned</b></li>
<li>an admin cannot ban a user on his own. Either a vote, the ArbCom or Jimbo is needed for a ban. See <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html#Decision_to_ban" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">Wikipedia:Banning policy#Decision to ban</a></li>
<li>when a user violates the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> the admin can decide to <b>block</b> the user, but that is <b>not a ban</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore (if I understand correctly):</p>
<ul>
<li>the block after a 3RR violation cannot be extended (since it's not a ban)</li>
<li>the known sock of a banned user after a 3RR violation block cannot be blocked (since it's not a ban)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is an inconsistency and probably an oversight on the part of those who created these policies.</p>
<p>Other users told me that the policies are not interpreted this way, and admins <i>do</i> extend blocks and <i>do</i> block known socks of 3RR violators even though the blocking policy doesn't give them an option to do this.</p>
<p>Of course, I might have misundersood something. Could you help me clarify this?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocks of administrators</span></h2>
<p>Recently there has been controversy involving blocks of administrators.</p>
<p>Blocking an administrator accomplishes little, since administrators can unblock themselves. Blocking an administrator does send a message, but that message can often be better sent by leaving a note on the administrator's talk page.</p>
<p>I propose the following policy change:</p>
<ul>
<li>That administrators, being highly respected Wikipedians, should hold themselves to a high standard, and never engage in behavior that would merit blocking.</li>
<li>In the rare instance when an administrator inadvertently violates policy in such a way that a block would otherwise be called for, a talk page message stating the nature of the problem <i>may</i> be left in lieu of a block. The {{lieuofblock}} template can be used to make sure that the serious nature of the message is clear:</li>

<dd>I see arguments over what counts as "controversial edits". Ultimately it is an issue of treating everyone equaly. An editor would be blocked so an admin must also be blocked for the same actions. Most admins do not unblock themselves and I can only recall two block wars caused by admins unblocking themselves. Unfortuently due this being a new experence to most of those involved they tend to be messy.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 00:11, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe that we have a <i>de facto</i> situation where admins cannot be blocked effectively. I believe that it is better to acknowwledge that and deal with its ramifications though a mechanism such as this than to try to make blocks that are technologically ineffective. If we really are going to go around blocking admins, we should probably fix the mediawiki bug that permits self-unblocking. Since mediawiki never really contemplated the idea that admins could be blocked, things like deletion and protection should be checked as well since they are likely still available to blocked admins. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 22:26, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I don't see the same problem that you are trying to solve. No admin should unblock themselves. If they do, they should be de-adminned. Nevertheless, a comment in the blocking policy to the effect that warning clearly good-faith users is better than blocking them would be a good idea. I have done this myself in the past. It is far better for the community and for individuals. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 23:10, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe the blocking rules for admins ought to be any different from regular users. Yes, we should first attempt to establish communication and assume the user is acting in good faith. We should do that for any user; perhaps we give a little more opportunity for explanation from someone who has a history of good judgment, admin or not. Not actually blocking, as mentioned by Michael Snow, does give the appearance of cabalism. And the problem of some people being too quick to block in lieu of communication for <i>any user</i> is a nasty one, but not solved by making special rules for admins.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Should it be necessary to block an admin becasue s/he has been engaging in behavior destructive to the wiki, then we should block — and despite it being technically possible for an admin to ignore the block, it's completely inexcusable for that person to do so. Someone to whom we have given adminship because s/he has been deemed trustworthy ought to know and respect soft security <i>better</i> than the average user. Not only that, an admin would certainly know where to seek other opinions if a block has been imposed unfairly. Someone who cannot respect a block and go through the proper channels to lift it — even if it seems to have been placed unfairly — is not suited to be in a position of trust. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindspillage_87a5.html" title="User:Mindspillage">Mindspillage</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindspillage_c644.html" title="User talk:Mindspillage">(spill yours?)</a> 05:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm, well, not a lot of support for this one. My main reasoning, from a FairProcess perspective, is the prinicple that the presence of power should be made explicit. If admins have the power to de-admin themselves but are expected to respect the block voluntarily, how is that any different than admins having the power to disregard a talk page message but be expect to respect it anyway? I see little difference. Part of the problem is that we have been suffering a plague of punitive blocks against good users, admin and non-admin alike. Perhaps that problem should be solved directly since this proposal lacks support. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 07:06, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see the idea has already been shot down, but I'd like to kick it while it's lying on the floor, bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>What you want is the strongest possible proposal for admins <i>never ever ever ever</i> to unblock themselves <i>no matter what</i>. You've been blocked by someone who's <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">being a dick</a>? Too bad. Mail the other administrators, whine on your talk page, prepare an RfC while you're offline, but <i>do not unblock yourself</i>. I would even support altering the software to make it impossible for any user to unblock themselves. Heck, I would support <i>removing adminship</i> from anyone who lifts a block on themselves, instantly, as part of normal procedure, regardless of mitigating circumstances. If administrators can ignore blocks, they cease being contributors to Wikipedia, for all contributors can be blocked if they are disrupting Wikipedia's functioning. Administrators are trusted to know what is and isn't disruptive, but administrators are human, and make mistakes. If being an administrator is no big deal, then blocking one shouldn't be, either.</p>
<p>You don't want people to treat administrators specially, you want them to treat all editors who are not acting in bad faith equally. What Uninvited's proposal would do is record a <i>de facto</i> situation as <i>de iure</i>. Bad. The status quo needs changing, not justifying. Be conservative with blocks. Be extremely unwilling to hand out blocks to people who are acting in good faith but being damn fools. Be more than happy to lift blocks from people who promise to not do whatever they were doing again. Don't be afraid to finally block someone if there's no other way, but don't take the easy way out and block someone for not respecting your authoratay. Mind you, Uninvited's proposal isn't actually bad. All that needs to be done is remove the part where it says this is special procedure for administrators. If you want this, apply it to everyone. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 12:21, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
