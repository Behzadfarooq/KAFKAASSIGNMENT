<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Block_E_284c.html" title="Edit section: 2001 - Present">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2001 - Present</span></h2>
<p>The entire block is curretly occupied by an enclosed shopping and entertainment mall of the same name, Block E, which was constructed in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. The mall houses such establishments as a <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hooters.html" title="Hooters">Hooters</a>, an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applebee%27s.html" title="Applebee's">Applebee's</a> restaurant, a few nightclubs, a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Cafe_d94d.html" title="Hard Rock Cafe">Hard Rock Cafe</a>, a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borders_Group_eb88.html" title="Borders Group">Borders</a> book store, and a Crown movie theater megaplex. The five-star Graves 601 luxury hotel occupies a majority of the block's frontage on First Avenue, and is 22 stories high (1).</p>
<p>The new Block E is approacable from the street level, and loosely models itself after buildings which previously existed on the site (specifically on Hennepin). The development also serves as an important link in Minneapolis's <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyway.html" title="Skyway">skyway</a> system, connecting <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Center_f4fe.html" title="Target Center">Target Center</a> to City Center and to a majority of the skyway system.</p>
<p>Supporters of the project expect that the new Block E will bring back retail that has historically left Hennepin Avenue for other enclosed malls clustered on the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicollet_Mall_f259.html" title="Nicollet Mall">Nicollet Mall</a> as well as in suburban malls. In re-etablishing the "character" of Hennepin as a Theater District, the new block E also attempts to promote itself as "Block Entertainment".</p>
<p>Critics of the project claim that it is another step in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentrification.html" title="Gentrification">gentrification</a> process of downtown, and that the new Block E is little different than a suburban shopping mall. Others have pointed out that crime has increased on downtown streets since the project was completed. The underground parking ramp has also experienced a few design issues.</p>

<p>For over a decade, the block was a surface-level <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parking_lot.html" title="Parking lot">parking lot</a>. The only structures on the entire block were the Shubert Theater and a two-story Billboard Advertisement. Many plans and discussions were held over the development of the land (which had a high value), but it was not until the late 1990s that a plan was actually carried out. The Shubert was moved next to the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hennepin_Center_for_the_Arts_ee38.html" title="Hennepin Center for the Arts">Hennepin Center for the Arts</a> by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Shubert_Performing_Arts_and_Education_Center_213d.html" title="Minnesota Shubert Performing Arts and Education Center">Minnesota Shubert Performing Arts and Education Center</a>, and the Billboard was removed to make way for development.</p>

<p>The impact of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobiles.html" title="Automobiles">automobiles</a>, whose effect began to be felt seriously in the 1950s, became apparent in this time period. Parking lots began to demolish and replace the two to five-story buildings from the turn of the century, especially at the intersection of 1st Avenue North and 6th Street. These buildings did not survive because they were small (see external link #1 ) and were not a part of the historic <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warehouse_district.html" title="Warehouse district">Warehouse district</a>, which began further east by the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>.</p>
<p>The entire block became known as a place for drunks, crime, and prostitution by the 1960s, especially on Hennepin Avenue. One of the most famous bars, Moby Dicks, was known for its "Whale of a Drink". "Unsavory" establishments, mostly bars and stores for <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">pornography</a>, replaced former retail stores. However, this block was one of choice places for <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punks.html" title="Punks">punks</a> and became a breeding ground for <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_music.html" title="Punk music">punk music</a>, and was also known for its cheap rent, drawing such establishments as <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle_Sport_Gallery_6601.html" title="Rifle Sport Gallery">Rifle Sport Gallery</a>. Operators of Shinders, the famous Twin Cities newsstand and book store chain that began at Sixth Street and Hennepin Avenue early in the 1920s, split into two companies and locations, each one framing the Hennepin façade of the block as bookends might at opposite corners.</p>

<p>The block was crowded by builidings built at the turn of the century and during the roaring twenties, the only survivor being the Shubert Theater (now on Hennepin between 5th and 6th streets). Arcade galleries, pool halls, ice cream stores, credit agencies, and theaters were common establishments that served both the high-end retail workers to the south on <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicollet_Avenue_25dd.html" title="Nicollet Avenue">Nicollet Avenue</a> (now the Nicollet Mall) as well as rail and industry workers to the north.</p>

<p>In its early days, Block E was part of an early suburb of mansions and the Jefferson School, one of Minneapolis's early elementary schools, was located at First Avenue North and Seventh Street, across from the present day music club <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Avenue_db93.html" title="First Avenue">First Avenue</a>. In this time the commercial and political hub of Minneapolis, known as Bridge Square was small and centered around the convergence of Hennepin and Nicollet Avenue. The mansions at the corner of Hennepin and Sixth were visible in postcards up to the 1920s when small commercial buildings completely replaces the old houses.</p>
<p>Many builidngs were built to replace the mansions and school around the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turn_of_the_century.html" title="Turn of the century">turn of the century</a>. The Jeweler's Exchange Building, located near the intersection of First Avenue North and Seventh Street, was built in 1913 (it was six stories high). To its left was the Shubert theater (the Alvin Theater for a time and The Academy after that), built in 1910.</p>
