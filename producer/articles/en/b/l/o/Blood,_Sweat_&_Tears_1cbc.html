<p><b>Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears</b> was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> music group, formed in 1967 in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. It fused jazz, rock and pop music into a hybrid that came to be known as "<a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz-rock.html" title="Jazz-rock">jazz-rock</a>". Unlike "<a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz_fusion.html" title="Jazz fusion">jazz fusion</a>" or simply "fusion", which tended toward virtuostic displays of electronic experimentation and amodal music, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears' sound merged the varied stylings of <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a> and <a href="../../../r/%26/b/R%26B_2a8f.html" title="R&amp;B">R&amp;B</a>/<a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_music.html" title="Soul music">soul music</a> with <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_band.html" title="Big band">big band</a> or combo jazz.</p>

The band's name was purportedly a name chosen by Al Kooper after seeing a 1963 album of this name by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_1edc.html" title="Johnny Cash">Johnny Cash</a>. Kooper was bandleader, having insisted on that position based on his experiences with <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blues_Project_9009.html" title="Blues Project">The Blues Project</a>, his previous band, which had been organized as an <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarianism.html" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collectivism.html" title="Collectivism">collective</a> and fallen apart (the Blues Project had also featured Katz).</p>
<p>The group debuted at <a href="../../../c/a/f/Cafe_Au_Go_Go_abce.html" title="Cafe Au Go Go">Cafe Au Go Go</a> in New York City in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, opening for <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby_Grape_023d.html" title="Moby Grape">Moby Grape</a>; the band was a hit with the audience, who liked the innovative fusion of <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> with <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic_rock.html" title="Psychedelic rock">psychedelic rock</a> and pop. After signing to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia Records</a>, the group released one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_Is_Father_to_the_Man_f930.html" title="Child Is Father to the Man">Child Is Father to the Man</a></i>. Without any <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop-oriented hit singles</a>, though, the album's sales were sluggish. While sales slowly picked up, personality conflicts started tearing apart the band. Colomby and Katz wanted to move Kooper to the organ exclusively and hire a vocalist for the group. With the debut album slowly achieving critical mass, Kooper left the group to become a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a> for Columbia. Randy Brecker and Jerry Weiss also quit, joining <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horace_Silver_c72f.html" title="Horace Silver">Horace Silver</a>'s band and <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambergris.html" title="Ambergris">Ambergris</a>, respectively.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood%2C_Sweat_%26_Tears_1cbc.html" title="Edit section: David Clayton-Thomas era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">David Clayton-Thomas era</span></h2>
<p>Colomby and Katz started recruiting singers, considering the still unknown <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Stills_d61d.html" title="Stephen Stills">Stephen Stills</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laura_Nyro_84ff.html" title="Laura Nyro">Laura Nyro</a> before settling on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Clayton-Thomas_cebc.html" title="David Clayton-Thomas">David Clayton-Thomas</a>, a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> singer. Reportedly, folk singer <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Collins_b7d3.html" title="Judy Collins">Judy Collins</a> had seen him perform at a New York City club and was so taken and moved by his performance that she told her friends Bobby Colomby and Steve Katz about him (knowing that they were looking for a new lead singer to front the band). With her prodding, they came to see him perform and were so impressed with him that Clayton-Thomas was offered to be lead singer of a re-constituted Blood Sweat &amp; Tears. Chuck Winfield, <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Soloff_895f.html" title="Lew Soloff">Lew Soloff</a> and Jerry Hyman joined soon after to bring the band up to nine total members. <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood%2C_Sweat_%26_Tears_%28album%29_a573.html" title="Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (album)">Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears</a></i>, the group's second, self-titled album, was produced by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_William_Guercio_0cd2.html" title="James William Guercio">James William Guercio</a> and released in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>. The album was much more pop-oriented, featuring decidedly fewer compositions from within the band. It quickly hit the top of the charts and won <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year_fd9e.html" title="Grammy Award for Album of the Year">Album of the Year</a> at the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Awards</a>. It spawned three major hit singles: a cover of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brenda_Holloway_fc5c.html" title="Brenda Holloway">Brenda Holloway</a>'s "You've Made Me So Very Happy", Clayton-Thomas' "Spinning Wheel", and a version of Laura Nyro's "And When I Die".</p>
<p>Because of the presence of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horn_section.html" title="Horn section">horns</a> and the lack of Al Kooper, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears had trouble holding onto any sort of countercultural hipness at a time when this was very important. This was compounded by a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_State_cf5a.html" title="United States Department of State">United States Department of State</a>-sponsored tour of Eastern Europe. Any voluntary association with the government was extremely unpopular at the time, and the band was ridiculed for it. In retrospect, it is now known that the State Department subtly requested the tour in exchange for more amicability on the issue of Clayton-Thomas' visa.</p>
<p>After returning to the U.S., the group released <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood%2C_Sweat_%26_Tears_3_d9a2.html" title="Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 3">Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 3</a></i>; though it was a popular success, spawning hit singles with a cover of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carole_King_e70e.html" title="Carole King">Carole King</a>'s "Hi-De-Ho" and "Lucretia MacEvil", another Clayton-Thomas composition, it was a critical failure. While this was partially due to the fact that the album was a less-successful attempt to re-create the success of the previous album, leaning almost exclusively (again) on cover material, sometimes to disastrous results, a lot of journalists also felt the need to slag the band over the State-Department tour (in fact, many reviews would focus solely upon that, without even bothering to talk about the album). Compounding the image problems was a decision to play at <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesar%27s_Palace_ce80.html" title="Caesar's Palace">Caesar's Palace</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, a notoriously unhip place in an unhip city. In 1970, the band provided music for the soundtrack of the film comedy <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Owl_and_the_Pussycat_%28film%29_75d3.html" title="The Owl and the Pussycat (film)">The Owl and the Pussycat</a>.</i></p>
<p>Following all of this turmoil, the group re-convened with jazz writer Don Heckman serving as their producer and with <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Bargeron_d35e.html" title="Dave Bargeron">Dave Bargeron</a> replacing Jerry Hyman, recording material that would comprise their fourth album, <i><a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood%2C_Sweat_%26_Tears_4_1789.html" title="Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 4">Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 4</a></i>. For the first time since <i>Child Is Father to the Man</i>, almost all of the material came from within the group, and the group even included a cover of Al Kooper's "Holy John (John The Baptist)" (the only tune not associated with the group was a cover of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Isley_Brothers_bbcb.html" title="The Isley Brothers">The Isley Brothers</a>' "Take Me In Your Arms"). Though the album did make the top ten and go gold, it generally marked the end of the group's commercial heyday.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood%2C_Sweat_%26_Tears_1cbc.html" title="Edit section: Further personnel changes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Further personnel changes</span></h2>
<p>Personality difficulties had split the group in rock and jazz factions, with Clayton-Thomas in the middle; he chose to quit to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by Bobby Doyle, then Jerry Fisher. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Lipsius_17ce.html" title="Fred Lipsius">Fred Lipsius</a> quit and was replaced by jazz legend <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Henderson_1166.html" title="Joe Henderson">Joe Henderson</a>, before <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Marini_abda.html" title="Lou Marini">Lou Marini</a> settled into the lineup. Dick Halligan was replaced by another jazz legend, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Willis_6e58.html" title="Larry Willis">Larry Willis</a>, while <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> guitarist Georg Wadenius joined as a second guitarist. Amidst the personnel changes, a <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_Hits_%28Blood%2C_Sweat_%26_Tears_album%29_d6cc.html" title="Greatest Hits (Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album)">Greatest Hits</a></i> album was released, which hit the top 20 and eventually went gold. It would be their last gold album.</p>
<p>The new group eventually released <i>New Blood</i>, which found the group moving into more overtly jazzy music than on their earlier albums. The album did make the top 40 (their last to do so) and spawn a single that just missed the top 40 ("So Long Dixie", chart peak: 44), but it suffered from disappointing sales. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Katz_437e.html" title="Steve Katz">Steve Katz</a> quit the group following this album. Their next albums, <i>No Sweat</i> and <i><a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirror_Image_%28album%29_c036.html" title="Mirror Image (album)">Mirror Image</a></i>, sold progressively fewer copies than their previous albums (the latter album, in an attempt to shift the group's sound, saw the addition of vocalist Jerry LaCroix, horn player Bill Tillman, and the adoption of a sound pitched somewhere between <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_soul.html" title="Philadelphia soul">Philly Soul</a> and the mid-1970s albums by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbie_Hancock_e7fa.html" title="Herbie Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>).</p>
<p>Personnel changes continued at a breakneck pace, culminating in the return of David Clayton-Thomas and the release of an attempted comeback album called <i>New City</i>. Though this album did chart higher than anything since <i>New Blood</i> and managed to spawn a minor entry on the singles chart with a cover of the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatles.html" title="Beatles">Beatles</a> song "<a href="../../../g/o/t/Got_To_Get_You_Into_My_Life_2988.html" title="Got To Get You Into My Life">Got To Get You Into My Life</a>", it still didn't sell very well. They released one final album through Columbia Records, the poor-selling <i>More Than Ever</i>, before they were finally dropped. The last original band member, Bobby Colomby, left in 1976, though when the band signed a new deal with <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Records_f642.html" title="ABC Records">ABC Records</a>, he served as executive producer. Their sole album for that label, <i>Brand New Day</i>, was their first album to completely miss the charts. Following a disastrous European tour in 1978 to support the album, the group disbanded.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood%2C_Sweat_%26_Tears_1cbc.html" title="Edit section: Reformations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reformations</span></h2>
<p>However, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Clayton-Thomas_cebc.html" title="David Clayton-Thomas">David Clayton-Thomas</a> decided to re-form the group in 1980, with a band of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> musicians. They signed to Avenue Records subsidiary LAX, and with legendary producer Jerry Goldstein, recorded the album <i>Nuclear Blues</i>. Despite the title, the album was a last-ditch attempt to reinvent the group, showing the group adopting a <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funk.html" title="Funk">funk</a> sound. The album was a complete commercial failure, and is regarded by many fans as being the worst album that the group ever released (though this is considerably debated by others), and uncharacteristic of both the group and Goldstein's best work. Following a brief tour, the group disbanded again.</p>
<p>Clayton-Thomas attempted to re-start his solo career after the album, since he didn't own the rights to the Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears name, but during a few dismal months on the road, he would find that promoters would book his group and instead use the famous name on the marquee anyway. Due to this, he negotiated a yearly licensing deal with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Colomby_5a5e.html" title="Bobby Colomby">Bobby Colomby</a> for rights to tour using the name. For almost 20 years afterwards, he toured the oldies circuit in this manner. Among the venues where he performed was Gulfstream Racetrack in Florida in the late 1990s. A receptive Gulfstream crowd cheered for an extended encore, but Clayton-Thomas said "who's going to feed my dogs?" (Gulfstream offered free concerts to the public to boost weekend attendance at the track.)</p>
<p>In 2004, Clayton-Thomas announced his intentions to formally pursue his solo career again, and most assumed that the group was finished.</p>
