<p>I removed this:</p>
<p>The Bloc holds the balance of power after the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2006">2006 election</a>. Therefore it will be able to co-operate with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Harper_d9dd.html" title="Stephen Harper">Stephen Harper</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_de3b.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada">Conservative Party</a> on the issues of resolving the fiscal gap between Ottawa and the provinces, especially Quebec, and on matters of <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meech_Lake_Accord_6d9a.html" title="Meech Lake Accord">Meech Lake Accord</a>-style decentralization and power shift from Ottawa to the provinces.</p>
<p>Why? Well, first off, the above sentences make predictions about the Bloq's activities in the house. They _also_ make predictions about the Conservative Party. Will they actually co-operate on the above issues? What other issues will the Bloq and Conservatives co-operate in? There are dozens, or even hundreds. This is a future prediciton, and has no basis in an encyclopedia. However, re-wording it _might_ work, in a section under "campaign promises - 2006" or some such.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I removed the sentence that said 'bloquiste' comes from analogy to 'pequiste.' Both are in reality just the standard french form for denoting a supporter or adherent of a group, so neither form can be said to have 'inspired' the other. A minor change that I hope everyone will accept. **</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the addition of remarks made in a 1997 election campaign is completely anecdotic (and is therefore bias-by-content). It defies all definition of "encyclopedic" - that is even before considering the fact that it takes up a third of an article on a topic that could see so much more relevant statements added to it. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> 22:44, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is evidence of the political position of a prominent member of the party and an elected member of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a>. In describing the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> party, we most certainly refer to the speeches, claims, policies etc. of its members. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique the brainwashed moron</a></p>
<p>Yes, it might be evidence of <b>a person's</b> political position. So why is it not in an article devoted to <b>this person's</b> political stance instead of being in an article about a political party? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> 23:25, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I've pointed out in response to <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> both on her user page and mine, if Suzanne Tremblay's comment is expounded on in such length in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a>, then by extension we have to add long passages on <i>every</i> controversial comment ever made by any Canadian politician whatsoever. <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a> would have to include "back of the shop", "Asian invasion", "No more Prime Ministers from Quebec", etc. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservative Party of Canada</a> would have to include an extensive analysis of the long-term political fallout of "Tequila Sheila", "Sambo", "I don't speak Chinese or German, either", "Riel will hang...", "let the Eastern bastards freeze in the dark", and on and so forth. Tremblay's comment is no more or less relevant than any of those. So, Angelique, tell me: why are you so much more offended by anti-English sentiment in the BQ than by anti-French sentiment in the Alliance? <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:15, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a copy of what I posted to <a href="../../../b/e/a/User_talk%7EBearcat_0ba9.html" title="User talk:Bearcat">Bearcat</a>.</p>
<p>It's sometimes a matter of opinion, however I think you would agree that any such issue would have encyclopedic merit based on its national media coverage which in the Suzanne Tremblay racist statement issue, was not only substantial, but sustained. Publicity wise, it ranks second only to Paizeau's racism for which he resigned. And, by all means include any racist (or extreme right wing economic policies (please)) into the Canadian Alliance article. The collective thinking, or intolerate views of party members, is extremely relevant in writing an encyclopedic article. After all, a political party is created because its beliefs are different, therefore Wikipedia's job is to inform readers about what specific things make them different. Note, in the Bloc Quebecois case, that the leader only "distanced" himself from Ms. Tremblay, he did not condem her or discipline her. And, it is racism throughout the separatist movement, that scares English Quebeckers --- and Wall Street. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 13:08, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>And, Bearcat said: <i>why are you so much more offended by anti-English sentiment in the BQ</i> - "<i>Sentiment</i>"&#160;! I am offended and disgusted by <b>racism</b>, and Ms. Tremblay's remarks were pure racism. Also, far too many articles in Wikipedia contain "some think that etc. etc." Giving exact, precise, substantiated examples of conduct, is far more encyclopedic than "some believe the party has racist etc.". <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 13:19, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>And by the way, the "Riel will hang" matter you raised, relates to a deliberate misquoting a Prime Minister to make his words appear to say something completely different than the real words. Too, in dealing with racism, it is essential to spell it out so that readers can judge for themselves, in particular those from countries beyond Canada. As to how Wikipedia has dealt with racism, check out <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>. And this is one businessman, not the Official Opposition Party of the GOvernment of Canada.

<dd>Still today, no one <b>actually knows</b> the problem you have with MacDonald's quote. Just that you continuously remove it. I'm not going to get involved in your new "forum on alleged racism".. but I'll point out that <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a> are articles about <b>people</b> not political parties, corporations or religious institutions. It supports the point I'd stated earlier: the Suzanne Tremblay event (which, from what I can tell, was mostly publicized in the "usual suspects" media) is relevant in her own article, possibly in <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charest_9dec.html" title="Jean Charest">Jean Charest</a>'s article, but it's not encyclopedic in the Bloc Québécois article. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> 15:56, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>First, go and see <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> so you understand what you are talking about. Are you saying that Canadians are a race? If that is the case, the only racist person I know is you. Being a Canadian is something that every human can be by becoming a citizen of Canada. In order to feel Canadian, identify as Canadian though, a person needs to adopt the Canadian culture and values. One requirement for this is a knowledge of the English language in order to communicate with the other Canadians. This doesn't mean they should completely abandon their own language, but it means that they will not be using it in every aspect of their lives anymore. That's how a nation composed of individual from all over keeps its unity.</dd>
<dd>Did it ever occur to you that Quebecers were maybe hoping to build such a society for themselves and the next generations, using the language and culture that unites the majority of them? I think you should stop using words you do not understand and learn the meaning of the words <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/v/Diversity.html" title="Diversity">diversity</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanity.html" title="Humanity">humanity</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 14:00, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Certainly. The individuals that I called "brainwashed morons" where human beings self-identifying as Canadians, of the kind that believe all the anti-Quebec junk they read in the right-wing Ontarian press. The kind that denies that something like the people of Quebec event exists and that Quebecers have their own culture because they have their own <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social.html" title="Social">social</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political.html" title="Political">political</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural.html" title="Cultural">cultural</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic.html" title="Economic">economic</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National.html" title="National">national</a> <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institution.html" title="Institution">institutions</a>, some which are older than the Canadian federal State itself.

<p>Re Suzanne Tremblay Stating facts is NPOV. Changing something to make it sound totally harmless is the hallmark of Mathieugp/Tremblay. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 23:48, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Angelique, I strongly suggest you peruse Wikipedia's guides to writing with a NPOV - it will cut down on your reverting-quota. In it you'll see that very debatable adjectives must be avoided (for example "major controversy" becomes "controversy"). Also, statements such as 'racist' and "really bad guy" must be avoided. Because if it is evident that a particular event was caracterized by quote-unquote <i>pure racism</i>, readers will be able to come to that conclusion without the slightest bit of difficulty. Furthermore, in your version it only states that some "racist statements" were made about Jean Charest; no details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is the definition of <i>anecdote</i> for your benefit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>anecdote</b>: <i>a usually short narrative of an interesting, amusing, or biographical incident.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I stand by my earlier statement. Biographical incidents belong to biographical articles, otherwise it's not encyclopedic. What do you think about this? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> who is still (hopelessly?) trying to have a discussion instead of a string of reverts.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Perhaps now that DW's new incarnation is gone we'll be able to discuss parts of this item.</p>
<p>I still think the Suzanne Tremblay anecdote should be kept on her own page. Otherwise it paves the way to the addition of all sorts of similar "subjective" anecdotes (i.e. Bloquiste Oswaldo Nunez being called an ungrateful immigrant for being a sovereigntist by Liberal minister Doug Young). Also, the general idea behind the Suzanne Tremblay anecdote is explained in an encyclopedic manner under "internal division". Any objections to removing the anecdote? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETremblay_07cc.html" title="User:Tremblay">Tremblay</a> 00:02, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should be moved under the "Internal division" heading - it seems very out of place currently.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to the longstanding tension between those who define their nationalism ethnically vs. those who reject this view, there seems to be a new division arising between those who think sovereignty should/can be acheived and those who have given up hope (...which should be explored in the article). For example it should be noted that a number of sitting Bloc MPs have left the party for the Liberals in the last while, and several look set to do the same. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStewacide_4b83.html" title="User:Stewacide">stewacide</a> 12:10, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>In the 1997 election, a controversy erupted when, at a Quebec rally, Bloc MP Suzanne Tremblay implied that Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leader Jean Charest was not a real francophone Québécois because his legal first name is "John".</i></p>
<p>I don't think <i>francophone Québécois</i> conveys the correct meaning either, since someone of (for example) Hatian heritage whose first language is French and who lives in Quebec could correctly be called a <i>francophone Québécois</i> - but that's clearly not what Suzanne Tremblay meant (Charest in fact is clearly both a francophone and a resident of Quebec). What I'm trying to indicate is that she was refering to his not being of Québécois ethnicity (not simply of Quebec civil nationality). -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStewacide_4b83.html" title="User:Stewacide">stewacide</a> 06:48, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>However, things progressively changed starting from the winter of 2003, partly because of the Charest government rapidly became quite unpopular and of the <b>support for independence in Quebec</b> rising again. The tide took its sharp turn when, in February 2004, the sponsorship scandal (uncovered in considerable part by the Bloc) hit the liberal federal government.</i></p>
<p>Is this true? The only poll I've seen has independence and constitutional at the very bottom of Quebecker's concerns. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStewacide_4b83.html" title="User:Stewacide">stewacide</a> 16:11, Jun 11, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is quite true and thank you for asking your question. I will present some facts to back it up. A biased campaign by the media is in course to show the opposite, but the facts are that the support for sovereignty has been rising from 39%-41% upward since the 2002 Déclaration de Gatineau, where PQ leader Bernard Landry laid out a new plan and determination for attainment of independence. Please refer to <a href="http://www.vigile.net/ds-actu/docs4/4-1.html#lpdl2" class="external text" title="http://www.vigile.net/ds-actu/docs4/4-1.html#lpdl2" rel="nofollow">this article</a> ("<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Charest_9dec.html" title="Jean Charest">Charest</a> would be sent back to opposition"), if you can read French. It mentions the poll taken between the 18th and 29th of March where the support for national independence beats the support for the NO side before repartition (OUI: 46%; NO:45%). After repartition, the YES side is at 49% (since, according to statistics, the pollsters give more votes from the indecisive to the federalist side). I believe such numbers in history have been yet seen only around 1995 to 1997 and at the death of the <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meech_Lake_Accord_6d9a.html" title="Meech Lake Accord">Meech Lake Accord</a> (when it rose as high up to the 70 percents). Also, minorities are more and more open to associate themselves with the Quebecois identity and even the sovereignist project. A poll made by "Generation Quebec" found out that 40% of young people from minority groups are sovereignist. With all this said, one must objectively conclude that this statement (in the article) is vital to the understanding of the new Bloc phenomenon and that sovereignty is seeing a third wave of high popularity. -- <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a></dd>

<dd>You're right. I just dug up some polls and support for "sovereignty" has gone up ~5% (to high-40s), but is still very soft (it drops to high-20s for full seperation). This seems to be directly related to dislike of the Charest government, as is the rise in Bloc support, so I'm not sure if sepratism is a cause or just an indicator. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStewacide_4b83.html" title="User:Stewacide">stewacide</a></dd>

<p>Although I find it interesting for it contains numerous facts, I am not certain this belongs in the article on the Bloc Québécois. Maybe somewhere in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_nationalism.html" title="Quebec nationalism">Quebec nationalism</a>? Or maybe in a new article on Quebec in federal politics? The facts are that the current Bloc is sovereignist and progressive, and has very little to do with the other Blocs.</p>
<p>In any case, here are some points that need to be fixed:</p>
<p>1. <i>where an article calls for a party of Quebecers defending the Quebec nationality in Ottawa.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The Action nationale article does not say that. It says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>À la Chambre des communes, il faut des députés canadiens-français capables, à l’occasion, de maintenir l’esprit de la Confédération… basée sur l’existence de deux éléments ethniques, les Canadiens français et les Anglo-Canadiens…</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which means: <i>In the House of Commons, there must be French Canadian MPs capable, sometimes, to maintain the spirit of the Confederation... based on the existence of two ethnic elements, the French Canadians and the Anglo-Canadians...</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would have been anachronic (or revolutionary) to speak of a Quebec nationality in 1926.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2. There are two L'Action française magazines&#160;: the French one, which turned fascist, and the Quebec one which was renamed l'Action nationale when the editor wished not be associated with the fascism of the French magazine. The name change occured in 1926 if I am correct.</p>

<p>An edit war is brewing over whether or not the Bloc is social democratic. I started to read the 2000 platform, but got tired and quit. I may take another look at this if I have the time. Maybe someone else for whom reading French is less of an effort could review this. It is posted on the party's website. In the interim, let's stop the edit war and have a discussion here about whether "social democratic" is a correct descriptor for the Bloc. And by discussion, I mean examples from their platform, not just assertions of personal belief. Comments? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 14:27, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The BQ is not a social democratic party. They have social democrats in it but they also have conservatives. They are not a member of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_International_2aa7.html" title="Socialist International">Socialist International</a> and do not declare themselves to be social democrats in their constitution or election literature. AndyL 21:14, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Their platform and goals are social democratic but AndyL is correct to say that there are some conservatives in the party. They are united by their desire for Quebec soverignty not by a common set of policies. I think it would be fair to call them social democratic as that is the position their platform espouses, however they are not explicitly as such. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 22:11, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>While the party is not offically social democratic, many of its members and supporters are social democrats, and party policy often promotes the goals of social democracy.

<p>The CAW don't just support the NDP thay also support the Bloc ther is a sorce to prove it <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/News/2004/08/28/605590.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/News/2004/08/28/605590.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. - michaelm</p>
<p>This is a good reference -- labour movements in Quebec clearly support the Bloc. But does that mean that it is exclusively a social democratic party, or that it is a 'big tent' that includes social democrats as well as other Quebec nationalists? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 21:38, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above compromise is <b>very</b> good. Kudos to Kevintoronto on it. The Bloc (largely because its ties to the PQ) are support by labour but neither are officially linked to labour like the NDP is. The Bloc is clearly to the left of the Liberals in their positions and those two parties or the only viable ones in federal Quebec politics, thus it is a very wise, pragmatic position for unions to support the BQ if they want to promote their agenda in parliament. At the end of the day, an analysis of the Bloc platform would lead to a political scientist labelling them social democratic. That said, many of its core supporters (its 30ish% floor of support) are seperatists who don't give a damn what it's other policies aren't and don't necessarily agree with them. How about this, based on Kevintorontos bit: <i>The Bloc is a broad coalition of those who want Quebec to obtain sovereignty. Though a majority of its members, as reflected in its platform, are social democratic, it is not a homogeneous party which can be easily labelled with a specific ideology. In fact a minorty of the Bloc's caucus is socially conservative.</i> - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 15:59, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know if a majority of its members are social democrats or not though I think it's fair to describe Duceppe as one. I think it's fair to say that the BQ advocates a number of social democratic policies but I don't think the party itself should be described as social democratic since they do not describe themselves as such in their platform, constitution or "mission statement" where the NDP does use the phrase "democratic socialist" or "social democratic" (don't remember which one off hand), if only sparingly, in its mission statement and some of its central documents and is a member of the Socialist International. I know the PQ at one time described itself as social democratic (don't know if they still do, we should check that out) and I think they at least applied for membership in the Socialist International (can't remember if they were vetoed by the NDP or given some sort of associate status). Unless a party officially describes itself as social democratic or democratic socialist for us to call a party that would be POV. Anyway, I think the aforementioned compromise is sound. As far as the actual sidebar is concerned, though, the BQ should not be described as "social democratic" but simply nationalist/sovereigntist. The only thing I'd be comfortable saying beyond that is "centre-left" since that would seem to be a fair description of them at present and there seems to be consensus about that in the media and among other observers (ie I can think of no reference to the BQ as "right wing" or "centre-right", at least not since Duceppe became leader). AndyL 17:06, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I propose the following lines then, better combining the points in my line and that of Kevintoronto and noting AndyL's remarks:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Bloc is a broad coalition of those who want Quebec to obtain sovereignty. Though its leader, and its platform, espouse social democratic principles, it is not a homogeneous party which can be easily labelled with a specific ideology. In fact, many of its members and supporters came from both the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties, and the party attempts to attract sovereigntist voters from across the political spectrum.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that that should suit everone. Any objections? - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 16:44, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've done a general clean-up of this article to:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce some of the duplication,</li>
<li>clear out the repeated wikilinks to the same articles, as per the convention that an article should be linked generally only at the first instance, and</li>
<li>clear out some of the dead wikilinks, although I have left them in where they involve a person.</li>
</ul>
<p>More importantly, I have erased the anonymous editor's changes from last night indicating that it is a social democratic party, and put in the compromise that <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> outlined above. There is no point in just re-inserting "social democratic" into the article without stating the case for doing so here. It will just be revertedIf, on the other hand, someone can provide <b>on this Talk page</b> a reference from the BQ's constitution or its campaign platform, for example, indicating that it is a social democratic party, then of course the article should be changed to reflect that. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 16:08, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that the Bloc Québécois, like the Parti Québécois, can be counted as genuine social democratic parties, at the left of the political spectrum. I also disagree with the said "Jord compromise". Just so people have proof *once and for all* about the Bloc, I am transcribing (and very lightly adapting) a research text I wrote at Image talk:Canadapoliticalchart.PNG. If someone can still challenge my assertion, I'll love to hear it.&#160;;)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I will study in this intervention the Social Democracy in the Bloc Québécois</b>. I believe that <b>understanding the BQ as a simple "open bar" (in left and right matters) sovereigntist coalition is a false perception</b>. This spirit might have been partly present in the very beginning, but, if so, it is much less now. An example might be the Ghislain Lebel affair(s) (his traditional stance on nationalism, seen when he endorsed a document made by right-wing sovereigntist Mathieu Bock-Côté and, later, his less open approach to First Nations claims expressed in his denunciation of the PQ deal with Côte-Nord aboriginals resulted in important internal criticism and final expulsion). Please allow me to <b>point out apparent proofs</b> and, afterwards <b>support them with concrete quotes</b> directly from the horse's mouth (or rather, the horse's official documents and platform).</li>
<li>The Bloc has, in recent years, supported a plethora of <b>typically left-wing causes</b>. It has strongly supported <b>marijuana decriminalization</b> and <b>gay marriage</b>, as well as <b>opposed the war in Iraq, the anti-missile defense shield and health care privatization</b> (on the health care subject, let me salute the great Mr. Tommy Douglas). It criticized Paul Martin's Canadian Steamship Lines fiscal escapes and <b>the surplus building in Ottawa that could go into social intervention</b> (some centrist and center-right people would demand to lower the debt first or keep a large and stable safety surplus). It also heavily <b>criticized the use of the employment insurance program money</b> to achieve such a surplus. As the platform says, <b>they "are seeking more open immigration policies"</b> (a fact some ultra-federalist opponents somehow prefer to keep quiet). <b>Despite the possible theoretical temptation of wholly denouncing the fire arms control program</b> since its scandalous cost is a Liberal responsibility, <b>it remains firmly committed to keeping it in place</b> while finding ways to never again fall in such a fiscal disaster. Duceppe and his party were <b>especially hard on the new Young Offenders Act</b>. I have heard Duceppe make numerous speeches underlining that a sovereign Quebec would, as opposed to the way the federal government chose, treat its young offenders "in a progressive way, in conformity with the common values of the <i>Québécoises et Québécois</i>". In 2004, it received the <b>support of Steven Guilbault, from Greenpeace</b>, and the Bloc has the <b>strongest relations with labour unions in Quebec</b>. <b>Proposing an anti-scab law</b> (like the one put in place by René Lévesque in Quebec; the first in Quebec and Canada) has recently been an important cause of the Bloc. Duceppe has also stated his opposition to the ADQ right-wing ideas. The Bloc has quite often participated in (and organized) common fronts with the NDP. Even <b>Jack Layton said in an SRC</b> (French language CBC) interview, on the show "Maisonneuve en direct", that <b>the opinions the Bloc and the NDP have defended in parliament are "very often the same"</b> (I last heard the show a year ago so a word might not be the exact one, but this was the exact idea of his statement).</li>
<li>These ideals and other equally progressive ideals are <b>clearly displayed in the platforms and documents of the Bloc</b>. For example, the official 2004 platform summary states that "the Bloc Québécois is committed" to the following (...and this is but a part of their progressive stances). Those are all direct, word for word quotes from the <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/fr/elections_2004/images/PDF/platform_24-05_en.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.blocquebecois.org/fr/elections_2004/images/PDF/platform_24-05_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">English 2004 platform summary</a>.
<ul>
<li>Proposing the <b>implementation of the Kyoto Protocol</b> so that it is fair for Quebec and <b>based on the principle of polluter-pays</b>.</li>
<li>Proposing an <b>investment plan for the wind turbine energy</b> industry that will lead to the creation of thousands of jobs that will be <b>environmentally friendly</b>.</li>
<li>Firmly <b>opposing the expansion of the Saint-Laurent seaway</b>.</li>
<li>Demanding a <b>surtax on the profits of large oil companies</b>.</li>
<li><b>Opposing the relocation of jobs and unfair business practices</b>.</li>
<li>Drafting an <b>anti-strike breaking bill</b> and engaging in a proper follow up if it is not adopted.</li>
<li>Proposing a <b>tax credit that is refundable for all families that have children</b> under the age of 18.</li>
<li>Proposing that the federal government <b>set aside 1 % of its expenses, or $2 billion per year, for the development of social housing</b>.</li>
<li>Ensuring that <b>eligible senior citizens receive guaranteed income supplements</b> and that the government refunds the $3.2 billion in funds they should have received.</li>
<li>Fighting with determination <b>alongside the aboriginal population</b> in order to encourage their <b>achievement of self-government</b>.</li>
<li>Proposing <b>maintaining peace-keeping missions as the primary role</b> of Canadian military forces.</li>
<li>Proposing that the federal government <b>introduce a plan to fight poverty in the world</b> by <b>increasing the levels of its international aid</b> and respecting its dialogue concerning the <b>debt reduction of the world’ s poorest nations</b>.</li>
<li>Demanding that the government <b>submit to Parliament, before ratification, all proposed agreements of the North American Free Trade Agreement</b>.</li>
<li>Demanding that the federal government <b>end the use of tax shelters</b> and flags of convenience <b>that allow businesses to avoid having to pay taxes and honouring their social and environmental responsibilities</b>.</li>
<li>Supporting <b>positive practices of globalization</b> such as responsible investment and fair business practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'll conclude the quotes with these excerpts from another document that can be found (in French, this time) <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/archivage/proposition_adoptee_finale.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.blocquebecois.org/archivage/proposition_adoptee_finale.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. "It is <b>more profitable, economically, to preserve the environment</b> than to degrade it.", "<b>The common good must <big>absolutely come before individual interests</big></b>.", and "We have known for long that <b>the societies with the most inequalities are often the most violent societies</b>. The Bloc Québécois <b>will intervene in order to diminish the gap between the richest and the poorest</b>. When, in a society, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, insecurity grows." The text sends us to a bottom-page reference stating that "<b>[t]he Bloc Québécois remains, in this sense, <big>a political party attached to Social Democracy</big></b>".</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>So, there you have it. I think <b>practically none of these stances would feel out of place in the NDP or other authentic social democratic parties</b>. <b>The Bloc Québécois is genuinely social democratic</b>.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Never mind. I found it at the bottom of Page 23. I would add to the above, also, a line from page 21 of the same document, "Le développement durable implique un rôle prépondérant de l’État.", which I would translate as "Sustainable development implies a significant role for the State." Sounds pretty social democratic to me. I tink we have a fist-full of smoking guns, here.</dd>
<dd>I wonder, though, to what extent this solidly soc-dem stance is a product of recent times and the leadership of M. Duceppe. When Lucien Bouchard was leader, was the party more of a "big tent" without economic ideology? It is certainly fair to say, based on its 2003 policy statement, that it <i>is</i> a social democratic party. Should we also say that when it was founded that it <i>was not</i>? Again, we'd need more evidence than I can provide to say that. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 19:00, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Ground Zero, you're too good to me.&#160;:-P Like Ground Zero says, I think we should hold any elaborate speculation about the Bloc's initial economic beliefs or "umbrella" nature before getting more solid evidence. Furthermore, in light of the arguments above, the whole "can't be easily labelled with a specific ideology" straying, in the article intro, should be cut I believe. I can try asking people I know involved in politics if getting a hand on older Bloc platforms is possible. That study should also be quite interesting; thanks for bringing this up, Ground Zero. Since you mention Mr. Bouchard, I will quickly state that I don't think his presence alone at the leadership would legitimize any more the "Umbrella" or "Big Tent Theory". One can read about Mr. Bouchard's progressive values in Jean-François Lisée's article <a href="http://www.vigile.net/01-1/demission-lisee-star.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vigile.net/01-1/demission-lisee-star.html" rel="nofollow">"Our debt to Lucien Bouchard"</a> (in English). So, I'll try to get more info on the first days of the BQ. I might also try to do a similar research job on the Parti Québécois (which could be beneficial), once its National Congress of June is over and the new platform is adopted.

<p>User:24.205.72.87 "switched" the way "Quebec(k)ers" is written, in this article. This was surely done with good intentions but, while both are generally acceptable, the standard spelling on Wikipedia is "Quebecers", not "Quebec<i>k</i>ers", right? And, if so, does anyone object to restoring the former spelling? --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 02:50, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quebecois is the French word for Quebecer, not the correct English word. BTW, shouldn't the ideology be Quebecois or Quebecer nationalism, not Quebec nationalism? Kind of like saying Corsica nationalism rather than Corsican. Is Quebec an adjective in this case or not? <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomagetocatalonia_4ee6.html" title="User:Homagetocatalonia">Homagetocatalonia</a> 19:04, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Quebec nationalism" (rather than *"Quebecer nationalism") is just part of the Canadian English <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiom</a>. The "adjective" form of provinces (Manitoban, Ontarian, and so on) are used as nouns for the residents of those provinces, but are rarely used as "attributive adjectives" modifying nouns. Phrases like "Albertan government" and "Ontarian culture" sound really odd to Canadian ears. (Note that the word <i>Canadian</i> is used as an adjective, as my preceding sentence demonstrates.) There's no good explanation for it; that's just how it works. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndefatigable_4173.html" title="User:Indefatigable">Indefatigable</a> 20:43, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the question, <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomagetocatalonia_4ee6.html" title="User:Homagetocatalonia">Homagetocatalonia</a>. I think one should not limit oneself to Canadian English for the explanation. Quebec is a society of the world, watched by the world. So, why "Quebec nationalism"? Well, I think that the word given to Quebec's inhabitans, "Quebecer", simply (and sadly, sort of) is not convertable into an adjective in the English language. Is there any similar denomination of a nationality or collective belonging ending with -er that is widly accepted as an adjective in English? It can be bothersome when one tries to show how that society holds qualities that make her more than any "subnational" region. But for now, that's the way you have to go with it. "Quebecois" has been accepted in the English language. It is, for example, in the Webster dictionnary <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=Quebecois" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=Quebecois" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Being able to use "Quebecois" in English can sometimes be practical, even if it sometimes makes things less... seamless. But sometimes more poetic. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 01:04, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>False, rambling rubbish. The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other former British dominions are ironic but blatant examples since the people responsible for the Statute of Westminster have not been thrown in jail like in the falangist dictatorship you seem to envision. In the British Isles themselves, of course, many independence parties also exist under the principle of democracy (the Scottish National Party for example). Many other democratic parties devoted to similar ideals exist in numerous other places across the world, like Catalonia or Puerto Rico. Canada, like the Netherlands, France, Sweden, and dozen others, through their whole populations, exercise every day what a party like the Bloc Québécois or the Scottish National Party advocate: self-determination. You are calling treason a high international principle of the UN, the right to self-determination. That might be the treason, this treason to democracy.

<p>Since the BQ only runs candidates in Quebec, the most seats they could win (in the House of Commons) is 75. This is far short of a majority of 155.

<p>Can you please tell me how the BQ can form a minority government? There are 233 seats in the House of Commons outside Quebec, so if those 233 seats are equally divided among the 3 other parties represented in the HC, then the party with the most seats would get 77 seats, which is still greater than the number of ridings in Quebec.</p>
<p>So unless there's another political party represented in the HC (possibly the Green Party), I don't see how the BQ can form any kind of government. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBourquie_6e9c.html" title="User:Bourquie">Bourquie</a> 8:41 utc, 17 Jan 2006</p>

<p>Why does there need to be more than 4 parties? Say the Conservatives won the most seats but all the other parties ruled out working with it, but would go with the Bloc. Then, if the Bloc had the second highest amount of seats, it could form the Government. -Nichlemn 09:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The idea of a <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> nationalist party with candidates running for seats in the House of Commons is not new. The term <i>Bloc Québécois</i> was seen as early as 1926 in <i>L'Action Française</i> magazine in which an article called for a party of Quebecers defending Quebec's interests in <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa.html" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>From March to May 1941 <i>L'Action Nationale</i> magazine renewed its calls for such a party, especially to oppose plans for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription_Crisis_of_1944_4427.html" title="Conscription Crisis of 1944">conscription</a>. In October 1941, the Bloc populaire Canadien was created with those very objectives.</p>
<p>In September 1971, there was a similar plea in <i>L'Action Nationale</i>, this time with a view to countering the federalism of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Canada_02d6.html" title="Prime Minister of Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a>. One year after the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_Crisis_1375.html" title="October Crisis">October Crisis</a>, a desire to express frustration through democratic means was visible in the magazine: "The time has come to play hard; and it is necessary that it happens at the parliamentary stage to avoid other forms of violence." <a href="http://www.action-nationale.qc.ca/editorial/98.4.htm#References" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.action-nationale.qc.ca/editorial/98.4.htm#References" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralliement_des_cr%C3%A9ditistes.html" title="Ralliement des créditistes">Ralliement des créditistes</a> was a rural Quebec-only federal party in the 1960s. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_credit.html" title="Social credit">Social credit</a> ideology was based on the ideas of the British engineer, <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._H._Douglas_6665.html" title="C.

The Créditistes took over the remnants of the federal <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Credit_Party_of_Canada_349d.html" title="Social Credit Party of Canada">Social Credit Party of Canada</a> and had members elected to the House of Commons until 1979. While right-wing in approach, as opposed to the nominally more leftist Bloc, this party carried the torch of Quebec nationalism and separatism for decades.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Populaire_5075.html" title="Union Populaire">Union Populaire</a> was a minor party that tried to build on the success of the Parti Québécois at the provincial level by nominating candidates in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1979.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1979">1979</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1980.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1980">1980 federal elections</a> on a sovereigntist platform. The PQ, however, had rejected participation in federal elections and provided no support to the party, which achieved little success.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parti_nationaliste_du_Qu%C3%A9bec_c592.html" title="Parti nationaliste du Québec">Parti nationaliste du Québec</a> was founded in the 1980s as an alternative to federalist parties (those opposed to independence for Quebec) and can be seen as a modest predecessor. It annoyed many anglophones.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhinoceros_Party_of_Canada_dc88.html" title="Rhinoceros Party of Canada">Rhinoceros Party</a>, founded in 1968 by Doctor <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Ferron_b2cc.html" title="Jacques Ferron">Jacques Ferron</a>, a renowned Quebec writer, won many votes from people who disapproved of federalist politicians.

<p>The Bloc is not a party that runs candidates in all federal ridings. It wasn't until a Prime Minister from "Quebec" changed the rules that the Bloc was able to come into existence. Mainly from running candidates in all Provinces to running in a specific number of ridings (IE 75). Now that a Provincial party can run in a Federal Election,(thus undermining the will of the Canadian People as a whole) and forward a treasonous separatist agenda.</p>
<p><br />
I don't have a problem with it, and it is important to note that they do not run in the entirety of canada, a part of what sets them apart. The treason bit is a little unwarrented, however. 27/03/2007</p>

<p>Excellent discussion above, guys, but I think the article still needs improvement, and can be fixed based on several of the suggestions above.</p>
<p>More <b>historical background</b> would help flesh out the article. Elements of the section above that details earlier Quebec nationalist politics on a federal level would be useful. Most useful would be a more in-depth look at the origins of the Bloc itself, especially in relation to Trudeau leaving Quebec out of the constitution, and Mulroney subsequently bringing Quebec nationalists into the Progressive Conservative party with the promise of "power to the provinces."</p>
<p>A section that deals specifically with their <b>ideological leanings</b> is badly needed. A reader of this article would come away with the mistaken impression that sovereignty, as expressed in the Meech Lake split and the 1995 referendum, is all that the party is about. It completely ignores their conservative roots and, as people pointed out in previous discussion, their social democratic leanings. This is important, especially as they were once the party of the Official Opposition, and because we are in an era of minority government. The Bloc has had a tremendous influence on Canadian politics, and have directly influenced policy decisions that affect all Canadians. Hipsterlady 22:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
