<p>This section is not newbie friendly - I have a vandal to report but cant find how to "Whois" or "reverse-dns" from the linked pages. If you want beginners to help with vandals then this needs to be easier.

<dd>I'm currently working on a rewrite of the blocking policy, and the main thing I want to do is separate the "how-to" stuff like this from the "when-to" stuff, which is all that really should be in the policy. I've started to create a detailed help page on blocking and unblocking, it hasn't been copied across here locally yet (<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G%27s_%27bot_00ba.html" title="User:Uncle G's 'bot">Uncle G's 'bot</a> does that every few months) but it's at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Block_and_unblock" class="extiw" title="m:Help:Block_and_unblock">m:Help:Block and unblock</a> if you would like to help with it, or make suggestions for how it could be improved. Ultimately I think that all of the technical and instructional material should be moved there.</dd>
<dd>In addition, explanations of these sorts of things could be added to the pages where the reporting takes place, at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> for example. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 11:13, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>sorry, I apologize in advance because I'm not a huge wiki-editor (barely any of one at all!)and my not be posting this in the right place. However I just wanted to say that I was disappointed that school IP addresses are always blocked. I have my computer at home log me in to all websites automatically so I never remember my passwords, so when I find mistakes on Wikipedia, I could do nothing to change them. I never have time when I am home. Isn't there something we can do to help school IPs? <a href="../../../b/f/i/User%7EBfissa_c22d.html" title="User:Bfissa">Bfissa</a> 23:58, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest that the blocking policy be updated to prohibit admins from blocking users that have been harassing them, stalking them, engaged in a content dispute with them or in any other way involved in a fight or disagreement. Even when the behavior clearly warrants a block in the eyes of any reasonable admin, I think that a neutral admin should block the user to avoid even the appearance of abuse. The blocked user or an observer may have a different standard for what warrants a block and it may appear to them that the admin is abusing his or her authority. In addition, these situations can cloud an admin's judgment and lead to a truly unjustified block. I think that blocking users that you have had heated confrontations with in the past should be discouraged, but ultimately left to the admin's discretion. In the rare case of a user doing extreme damage, like using a bot to vandalize a large number of articles in a short time or doing something that may crash the site, a non-neutral admin would be allowed to block the user for a short period, no more than 24 hours. Afterwards, he or she would have to put a notice about the block on the Administrators' Noticeboard. A neutral admin could then extend the block, if necessary. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that if an admin believes that a user has been stalking or harassing him/her, there is no reason for the admin not to block the user immediately for some duration. At that point, the user may instantly appeal the block to other admins, and the other admins, upon proper consultation with the blocking admin, plus others if necessary on AN/I, may reverse the block. In general, I think that stalking/harassing is such a serious offense that it must be stopped immediately, regardless by whom, and investigated further once stopped. As someone who was wrongly blocked for 'disruption' I know well that being blocked is no fun, and at the time that block made me (briefly) re-think my committment to this project - getting turned down on appeal did not help either. But despite that, things were properly sorted out later, with no lasting damage. I cannot see how stopping what appears to at least one admin as harassing/stalking will cause permanent damage to the project, given the near immediate review by others. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 11:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I spotted a few grammatical inconsistencies in the article. Most of the article has correct use of the singular/plural. eg "if a user does something bad then HE/SHE can be blocked" (emphasis added) is correct. Or "then THAT USER can be blocked" is also correct. But "if a user does something bad then THEY can be blocked" is incorrect. MIxing singular with plural. The fact that it is widely used colloquially doesn't validate it. Especially since the rest of the article has correct usage. So I have corrected a couple of those. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpatrick_be70.html" title="User:Davidpatrick">Davidpatrick</a> 14:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed some admins disclose the duration of a block and some do not. Is there a policy on this? I can see where disclosing the block duration is appropriate for a non-anonymous user, but in the case of an IP vandal it almost invites them to come back at time T + epsilon for continued foolishness.

<p>I've noticed a tendency on the part of many admins not to leave a notice on Uses' and IPs' Talk pages when they block someone. This can mean that other editors leave pointless warning notices, not realising that a block has already been imposed, and other admins can pointlessly go through the beginning of the blocking process before discovering that they're wasting their time.</p>
<p>I've been leaving friendly requests on the admins' Talk pages, and so far everyone seemed to have seen my point. Today, though, for the first time an admin has responded by insisting that there's no point leaving a notice. Aside from the fact that it seems to me to be a matter of courtesy, is there any guideline or policy on this? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 22:23, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ive always known it to be a courtesy. The only time I dont is when I indef block a sock or block evader. Then, (and this may be wrong.

I have seen a lot of other admins blocking IP's/throw away attacker accounts with 20 attack/vandalism only edits *not* posting messages on their talk. Now, Mel Etitis requests me to always post on talk pages to notify "users". --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 23:01, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"The blocking process": The block log is right on the blocking page, at the bottom. So for me the "blocking process" is hitting the block link and there you are. On talk pages, I would have to wade through the history of the talk page to check if a user has removed a post from their talk page. A user's talk page is not a block history. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 23:05, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For your information: If you dig into my block log, you will notice that I've only blocked IP's and vandalism/attack only accounts <i>without notifying the user</i>. As I noted on my talk, I haven't and I do not intend to *not* notify users I block that do have some minimally reasonable edit history (I have never block a user of this kind so far). I really fail to see why I should notify a throw-away vandalism only account like User:Chrissu1989. BTW these kind of users regularly remove block messages from their talk pages. So what does that mean if you don't find a "blocked" message on these kind of talk pages? --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELigulem_20b6.html" title="User:Ligulem">Ligulem</a> 00:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must say that I don't really understand "should" except as pointing out that it's mandatory; is there another meaning besides the prescriptive?</p>
<p>Could it be done automagically? The problem would be that there are different reasons for (and different periods of) block. Perhaps there could be a default message that could be overriden when the block is applied?</p>
<p>I see this as just one example of the general lowering of courtesy levels here; increasing numbers of editors fail to use edit summaries, for example, and it's surprising how many tag all their edits, no matter how extensive, as minor.

<li>I frequently don't bother, as commented above for throwaway accounts which are blocked within 10 minutes of being created it seems wasted effort (Or IPs which has a talk page full on warnings and block messages). I check their other contribs and tend to sort those out, so I can't imagine why anyone else would be coming along significantly later to leave them a message or warning. There is a possibility that someone will be looking at the user concurrently and that's where the collisions occur, however in the short timescale around the events it seems a good possibility that crossover will occur anyway. I often go to a page and find someone has just warned them for something I reverted, it's not a problem just a wasted trip. Similarly I get collisions where blocking, or get to the block page and see they have just been blocked (since it shows the log at the bottom of the block page, can't say I go back and look for a block notice). As above I can't say either of those is a big deal and when many people working on things, such crossovers are a good probability. i.e. I think people are going to get wasted trips to pages or post redundant messages regardless. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>But there's a difference between shrugging off a wasted trip for yourself, and editing so as to cause wasted trips for others. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 17:13, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As above I if someone does say 5 edits in a 10 minute time frame after creating an account and then gets blocked indefinitely as a vandalism only account, it seems most unlikely that someone will be coming along later to post a message. Have you had cases where you've gone to post a message on such an account a significant amount of time after the event? And if so how frequently does this occur? If all their edits have been rolled back I'm not sure what purpose anyone has in deciding to visit their talk page, I would see this as a rare occurance.</dd>
<dd>If the visits occur at roughly the same time as the block, there is a good chance that there will be some crossover and one or other of those involved will have a wasted trip, this seems particularly the case at the moment where I often see contrib histories etc. lagging quite significantly, I can't see how that can be eliminated.</dd>
<dd>This isn't some new phenomena, I certainly haven't changed by behaviour in this regard for quite some time and you are the first and only person to mention the issue. Don't get me wrong on this I'm not saying the situation absolutely never occurs, I just wonder how significant an issue it is and if the amount of effort expended "solving" it outweighs the detriment. My own observation and cynicism suggests it's something we are very good at on wiki, spending huge amounts of time solving problems which don't "really" exist. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 18:38, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to add a data point, I've noticed the lack of block messages as well and have found it can result in wasted effort when vandalfighting.

<dd>Thanks for the further evidence of the issue. Can you give a bit more background. Are the users blocked in the few minutes before or is this a significant amount of time after the blocking? I ask this since as with many I use multiple browser tabs when doing this, so If I'm going to warn or leave a block message I can be that I open talk pages in a fresh tab and carry on with other things coming back a short time later, this is the crossover I mention and indeed does happen to me quite frequently. I'm not sure why we would give those doing anti-vandal work any more or less consideration than others, but from a anti-vandalism point of view which is more preferrable to you, that vandals get blocked promptly or that you save a few seconds not warning someone who just got blocked? (The two needn't be mutually exclusive, but there are going to be trade offs at times.) --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 20:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many editors revert vandalism and don't bother to follow up on the vandal's Talk page, nor check all the vandal's other contributions; I often – especially when it's a vandal on whom I'm keeping an eye – follow up for them, adding warnings or blocks. It's impossible to tell without actually starting the blocking process whether someone has blocked or not. I've often come across cases in which other editors have left warnings after blocks have been placed but not mentioned, and even more often I find myself wasting time on the start of the blocking process only to discover that someone else has already done it.</p>
<p>In short, not taking the few seconds to place a block notice can cause other editors inconvenience and irritation, and the instructions to admins say that it should be done (which, <i>pace</i> Irishguy, in normal English is a prescription, not the expression of a mild preference). Sorry if I sound tetchy, but once admins have been alerted to the fact that this causes inconvenience to others, I'm a bit surprised at the continuing argument. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 23:06, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Consideration of inconvenience to others cuts both ways. If I raise that it is an inconvenient for me to add the block notice in certain circumstances then you of course should be bending to me, so not as to inconvenience me? As I say above the number of people raising this has been very small and hence trying to scope this issue doesn't seem unreasonable. If you believe that your inconvenience outweighs the interests of everyone else concerned, then I think there is little more to discuss here. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 13:15, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean by "scope this issue", but the rest of your comments are surely mistaken. Consideration for others should trump self-interest.

<dd>Scope, i.e. when does the problem occur. Does it occur for every block done, or is it a specific circumstance.

<dd>I can give an example which just occurred of the issues of crossover and scoping. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreek_eek_f4f6.html" title="User:Creek eek">User:Creek eek</a>, placing {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblockeduser_10ad.html" title="Template:Indefblockeduser">indefblockeduser</a>}} on a range of user pages, this is an ongoing troll if you look at the histories of the pages involved. Started at 13:52, blocked at 13:53 (UTC), after blocking I looked at other contribs and rolled back (in multiple tabs). I then went to the user talk page to add an {{<a href="../../../i/n/d/Template%7EIndefblockeduser_10ad.html" title="Template:Indefblockeduser">indefblockeduser</a>}} tag to that user. Edit conflict with someone adding a warning, redo - edit conflict with the user blanking that warning. Finally place the tag, within a minute or two someone else added to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Now this is obviously frustrating because multiple people are picking up on the same thing, there isn't much which can be done about that. At the same time I can't imagine why anyone would be going back later to look at this page, the user in question is in no doubt about what they are doing, the block notice isn't useful to them. All the edits were rolled back quickly. Was going through those two edit conflicts to the place the message a complete waste of time? To me yes, is not doing it likely to be inconvenien to others? --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 14:15, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I were watching one of the articles involved, I'd see activity, check, and discover reverted vandalism. I might then go to the vandal's Talk page to see whether a warning was left (as I've already pointed out, that's often not done), and see no new warning, but a string of previous ones. I'd then decide either to give a warning (which would, unknown to me, be pointless), or to apply a block (only to discover that one had aleady been applied). This has happened to me on a number of occasions.</dd>
<dd>But there's no point my going on; you've decided that the slight convenience of your not having the courtesy to say what you've done outweighs the inconvenience that you cause to others, and evidently nothing that I say is going to change that. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 16:58, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why not change the system so that a block notice goes on the talk page automagically when the block is made? Such a thing ought to be possible, what with this being the computer age and all.

<dd>And you've decided the slight inconvenience to you outweighs the inconvenience to the many admins who do this. However as I have already said, my intent was to discuss the matter and scope the issue - how broadly it is felt an issue and in what circumstances is it an issue. That's the way things work around here, when there is a disagreement we discuss and try to find a compromise/consensus to the way forward. Your declaration above that you merely stating you felt inconvenienced by it should mean everyone would run off and do as you asked, is what started this part of the thread. Clearly if 100 admins don't warn for 10 blocks each and yet only you have a problem, and it occurs for 10 of those 1000 blocks, the cost benefit seems quite simply not in your favour. OTOH it maybe that those 10 are pretty specific circumstances, or it may come out in the discussion that many people find this an issue. From your description above it seems that you don't trust others reverting to consistently warn properly and that is the real root of this problem. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 17:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Reading back I guess some of the basics aren't clear either, the real point here is that either side declaring the other is being "selfish" and not considering the inconvenience of the other party(ies) is not really helpful, as it is of course a matter of perspective. Hence the need for some discussion to work out minimising the impact on everyone. The automatic message is a reasonable idea, though perhaps a simple marker which will tell people at a glance of the current blocked status, whilst still encouraging more comprehensive messages where appropriate. --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk">pgk</a> 18:17, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find it useful when the "blocked" messages are left and almost always post a note or template myself, with one important exception: when the username itself is harassing (e.g. User:JohnSmithIsABadPerson (bowlerized example)).

<dd>I think that is far too bold. Decisions from the Arbitration Committee do not make policy. The decision was made in a very specific context. There is a difference between the ArbCom or the Wikipedia community deciding to block, and a single administrator doing the same. The other entries in the list cover blocks which are regularly made and broadly supported. On the other hand, somebody who closes a discussion inappropriately is likely to be a regular editor, probably an administrator, and such a block will always attract drama (like the cool-down blocks mentioned further down). Changes to policy, and this one in particular, should be discussed for some time and not made in reaction to a highly charged case. For all these reasons, I reverted the addition. If you want to discuss this, by all means do so on this talk page or the Village Pump, but I don't think there is a consensus for the point you added. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 01:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that it is in general up to the discretion of the blocking admin. Often the warnings are issued by other editors, not necessarily admins. In the case of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> for example, we encourage a warning to be issued to new editors who may not be familiar with the policy.

<dd>I guess my point is, where is in any guidelines or policies does it say that editors should be warned about their behaivor? Or, where does it say it up to the discretion of the admin? Reading the policy there is clearly an implication that warning is the standard and the X, Y, and Z are exceptions that do not need warning. But I looked at a bunch of policies and guidelines and I cannot not find any general dissucsion of the principle of warning.

<p>Is it acceptable to block without warning? If so, under what circumstances? Is a single vandalism edit enough? Does it depend on the severity of that vandalism? What is a "severe" single vandalism edit? If a single vandalism edit isn't enough, how much vandalism needs to occur? If it isn't acceptable to block without warning, how much warning needs to be given? Should we require at least a single "final warning, block imminent" before blocking? How long of a block is acceptable for an unknown IP? How long is acceptable for a known educational institution? Should a registered user whose only contributions have been vandalism be blocked indefinitely? If so, should it be without warning? If so, how much vandalism should occur before blocking a registered user indefinitely without warning?

<dd>IMO we have to give admins a wide leeway, and expect them to use common sense. Trying to tie their hands in red tape and bureaucracy will be counter-productive. Admins have to primarily ensure a comfortable working environment for collaborative and productive editors. At the same time, they should not be too harsh on new users, who could potentially contribute in the future, and they must also beware of blocking innocent users via IP blocks. So the bottom line is that admins must have discretion and follow common sense. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 15:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My general view is that we can, and should, be tolerant, up to a point, when somebody is just "testing", which might mean things like adding the Wikipedia logo image, "hello", "test" or "YIPPPEEE!!" to articles. These things are done in good faith, and we will just have to accept that newbies, unfamiliar with what is and what is not appropriate, will do such things.</dd>
<dd>When it comes to clear and indisputable <i>vandalism</i> though, things like replacing articles with profanity, or adding images of genitalia in articles, we should be strict. Indeed, I would not object to having "one strike and you're out for 2 hours" be the standard treatment on such issues, even for a first time offense. I cannot imagine a person on the receiving end of such a block being particularily surprised at getting blocked over a thing like that. If the block is reasonably short, there is not much damage either. (This is the practice at the Norwegian Wikipedia, and it works pretty well.)</dd>
<dd>Also, sometimes there are tell-tale signs that an IPvandal is a returning vandal with a new IP. I remember from the days I was an admin, a vandal who did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Montenegrin_independence_referendum%2C_2006&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54509731" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Montenegrin_independence_referendum%2C_2006&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54509731" rel="nofollow">this</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54509733" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Serbia_and_Montenegro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54509733" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Montenegro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54510353" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Montenegro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54510353" rel="nofollow">this</a> before I caught him and gave him a pretty quick and harsh {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4im_97f8.html" title="Template:Test4im">test4im</a>}} warning. When he proceeded to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:172.200.186.203&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54510521" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:172.200.186.203&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54510521" rel="nofollow">replace</a> that with a tier-1 {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} message, as if having a new IP <i>entitled</i> him to make four vandal edits, I blocked immediately. There is no need to have people here who think they have a right to vandalize. If they complain, we will just have to accept that we are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:172.200.186.203&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54511245" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:172.200.186.203&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=54511245" rel="nofollow">iron fisted, poor excuses for admins</a>.</dd>
<dd>One note is that I think it might be a good idea to deliberately keep the formal <i>wording</i> of the blocking policy a bit more conservative than what we <i>actually</i> do in practice. People in general, not just admins, have a tendency to bend the rules a little, so if we make the formal wording slightly over-conservative, I think we will get pretty much the treatment of vandals that we should. If we <i>then</i> bend the rules a little and a blocked vandal complains that he didn't get the "last warning" which the vandal is "entitled" to before getting blocked, well then let's just say that vandals don't have rights. And then bending the rules a bit to keep those who <i>blatantly</i> and <i>indisputably</i> seek to cause harm to Wikipedia off the site should be a tolerated practice, even if we don't boast about it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 15:57, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I asked all those questions, I really should try to answer them myself. I believe that blocking without warning can be justified, in a case where the vandalism is blatant and overwhelming. If I saw an IP replace a dozen pages with profanity in as many minutes, I'd be willing to block that IP without warning to stop harm to the encyclopedia. However, I don't think that there is <i>any</i> single, isolated edit that can possibly be made by an anon vandal that justifies immediate block without warning, especially for 31 hours, as Naconkantari commonly does. I fully support the warning system. If someone makes a single, blatant act of vandalism, I have no problem with leaving a "this is your first and only warning" message and blocking upon further vandalism, but I would prefer at least two warnings, with one containing "final warning, block imminent" language. If you try to give out a full set of warnings you'll find that most vandalism stops when the vandal realizes "Wow, I'm being watched." I know, I know, it takes less time to just block the account, but I view that as <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">biting</a>.</dd>
<dd>As far as blocking of IPs known to be shared by many different people, such as those of libraries, any block longer than a few hours is blatant overkill. You're trying to stop someone who's in the library for an hour or less. Blocking for a day or more is harmful to legitimate users of the library. If you run into a kid who's coming into the library for an hour each day to vandalize, I can see applying longer blocks, but for an educational IP with sporadic vandalism over the course of many months, each individual burst of vandalism should be considered as a brand new individual, because it probably is. I also think that blocks of shared IPs should be "soft"; it should be possible for a user to create an account. We are an educational resource. We should not shut out educational institutions, even if they are the source of much vandalism.</dd>
<dd>I also think that indefinite blocking of a registered user whose only contributions have been vandalism hurts the encyclopedia more than it helps. It makes it far less likely that such people will turn around and make positive contributions to the encyclopedia. An immediate, indefinite block of a registered user that has made only one vandalism edit is definitely entirely too far.</dd>
<dd>I understand the need for admins to have discretion in these matters, but it's also necessary to have limits. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:33, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I disagree with the change that was just made about indefinitely blocking accounts that have not made productive edits. In the above example of Donorman, I might not have indefinitely blocked myself, but I would not object to such a block because of the volume of vandalism and because he had received many warnings. I'm not opposed to language allowing indefinite blocks for such users.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, in my opinion, an account that has only made a small number of unproductive edits should not be blocked indefinitely without warning. There is a good chance that such an editor can become a positive contributor, as soon as they realize that Wikipedia is not a joke, and people see what you do and care about it. They need to be warned and given a chance. An indefinite block almost certainly loses that user forever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I really don't think indefinite blocks without warning are acceptable except in cases of severe vandalism. I think it'd take a dozen vandalism edits to justify an indefinite block without warning. An account with fewer edits should be warned at least once, and if the vandalism continues then a block could be applied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I can accept some negotiation on how much vandalism should justify a block without warning, but I think that an indefinite block without warning for one edit, as happened to Chyeahitsdiana in response to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indian_American&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115141818" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indian_American&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=115141818" rel="nofollow">this</a>, is way too severe. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 20:41, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I believe that for the most part the admins can be trusted to make level headed decisions and do what needs to be done to maintain the integrity of Wikipedia. That said, there is a valid concern about gray areas, and some valid examples are brought up. Perhaps there is the need to establish some <i>minimal</i> guidelines as far as these questions are concerned. I agree that applying an indefinite block, sans warning, based on someone's first edit is just a little on the harsh side. If an adjustment to the policy is going to be made then there needs to be consensus on what defines <i>obvious</i> and <i>severe</i> vandalism. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 21:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I do understand the arguments that it's important not to tie admins' hands with a restrictive blocking policy, I think we should have a statement that, though the recommended blocking justifications and durations are <i>guidelines</i> and should be applied on a case-by-case basis, admins should not <i>consistently</i> apply blocks outside of the guidelines. I believe such a statement would solve the problem of unnecessarily tying admins' hands while also forcing admins to obey this policy.</dd>
<dd>For example, currently the guidelines state that blocks should not be applied to isolated incidents of vandalism. If an admin runs into an isolated incident of vandalism that, in their judgement, is severe, they could apply a block, but an admin should not consistently block isolated incidents of vandalism.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, the guidelines state that logged-in users should be blocked for 24 hours for the first block and each successive block should be longer. An admin could decide that in a particular case, like that of Donorman, the vandalism is severe enough and enough warning has been given to justify a lengthy or indefinite block. However, an admin should not consistently block user accounts indefinitely for one or a handful of vandalism edits.</dd>
<dd>We don't need to objectively define "obvious" or "severe." We just need to say "Use your judgement, but on average, follow the guidelines." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:26, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd like to expand a little on what I've just said. I think we should tailor the guidelines on this page to deal with your average, run-of-the-mill vandal, who blanks a page or two or inserts a couple of words of profanity. If you're doing RC patrol, and you run into an anon vandal who's making a dozen edits a minute, throw the guidelines out the window and block that IP on sight. However, nine time out of ten, you're dealing with people who put "hi" at the top of various pages, and in that case, you should be following the guideline to the letter.</dd>
<dd>If you're an admin who spends most of their time on CFD or something, and you only pull out the banhammer to deal with severe problems, you shouldn't feel bad that the majority of your blocks are more severe than the guideline. That guy who's put porn onto ten major pages so far probably shouldn't be given a full set of warnings before a block.</dd>
<dd>You shouldn't ever have to feel "Gosh, this vandalism is <i>terrible</i>, but my hands are tied by WP:BLOCK!" However, you should usually feel "Man, this vandalism is <i>average</i>. I am going to follow WP:BLOCK, because that's exactly what it's there for." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(mec)Policy and guidelines exist to further the building of an encyclopedia; we therefore, in (s)electing out admins, choose people with commonsense who will use the block function in a number of ways for a number of reasons to further that ultimate goal. "Use your judgement but on average follow guidelines" is exactly what the vast majority of admins do, Naconkantari in particular. Each block is open to appeal, to review by others admins and to community input. We encourage this, despite the fact that those questioning a block are rarely aware of the full facts.</dd>

<dd>Naconkantari absolutely <i>does not</i> follow guidelines on average. He has <i>said himself</i> that he blocks for isolated incidents of vandalism. He did so for 31 hours in the majority of cases until I confronted him, and has on average reduced this to 3 hours since then, which still violates policy. He consistently blocks user accounts indefinitely for making as few as one vandalism edit. To say that he on average follows guidelines is absurd; he openly admits to not following them. I absolutely agree that admins require leeway and have said so, but Naconkantari consistently blocks outside of the guidelines.</dd>
<dd>As far as presenting a big pile of admin actions goes, I did so because I did not know how else to communicate the problem. I did not cherry-pick what I felt were the worst, most indefensible blocks. Maybe I should have. Instead, I listed sixteen blocks that violated WP:BLOCK that were given out over <i>one hour</i>. That was the vast majority of the blocks Naconkantari gave out over that hour. When Naconkantari claimed that one block of a single-edit IP address for 31 hours was an exception and possibly too long, I had no trouble finding six blocks of single-edit IP addresses for 31 hours that he handed out in a <i>half hour period</i> the previous day.</dd>
<dd>I have said that admins need leeway. However, we also need <i>limits</i>. If you have a reason to block an IP address for 31 hours for a single edit, do so. However, if you RC patrol and block nearly every single isolated act of vandalism you see without warning for lengths of time greater than policy guidelines, you are <i>breaking policy</i>. To be clear about that, you are doing <i>exactly what the vandals are doing</i>. WP:BLOCK is just as important as WP:VAND. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 22:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The policy should provide general information and guidelines about blocking, which it does. But the actual implementation, as Redvers noted above, is up to the common sense and discretion of the admins, who were elected as trusted members of the community to ensure a comfortable and safe editing environment for productive editors. We want the admins to have maximum flexibility, and each of their actions is subject to review. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, so how is providing guidelines that people don't follow, and have no reason to follow, productive? An appeals/review process for anons and new users who are blocked out of process <i>exists</i>, but it's not going to be <i>used</i>, because they don't know how. They're just going to leave forever.

<dl>
<dd>Each block is subject to scrutiny, by the blockee and others. Many blockees do complain, quite loudly in fact, to multiple parties in multiple channels, even about the most simple straightforward blocks. Adding more red tape will not make it easier for the admin. Some admins may decide to just ignore the situation and/or let someone else do it. I believe that discretion and flexibility are critically needed here. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have not, at any point, suggested more red tape. I have only said that admins should generally try to follow blocking policy, as right now it seems to be meaningless. I believe I explained my problem below: it is not with admins who apply blocks more harshly than guidelines if they feel it's needed, even when those blocks are harsher than I'd apply myself. It is with admins who apply blocks more harsh that the guidelines consistently, with no justification. I am <i>not</i> trying to force admins to follow guideline at WP:BLOCK all the time. I just think that admins should follow WP:BLOCK <i>unless they have a reason not to</i>. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 00:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Let me give you a scenario. Say you notice a block. It is longer than the guidelines here suggest, and/or it was given for less reason. You contact the admin who placed the block, and say "This block doesn't follow the guidelines over at WP:BLOCK, and I was wondering why."</dd>
<dd>Now, certainly if the admin says "Oh, that was a sockpuppet I was dealing with," you're going to say "Oh! Good work there."</dd>
<dd>What if the admin says "Oh, that's just what I do." What then?</dd>
<dd>This is a serious question, because it's exactly what I've run into and it's why I'm so frustrated. I am not suggesting that an admin must have an ironclad, defensible reason for every block that deviates from the guidelines. I'm asking what to do if an admin has <i>no reason at all</i> to deviate from them, but does so constantly. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 23:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You can always decide, and it often happens, that the original blocking admin was too harsh, and unblock. Or you may decide to mentor the offender and assume responsibility. Most admins would gladly accept someone else's input and would rarely object. If they do, there is always AN/I, for the longer blocks anyway. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:46, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That really looks like a path straight to wheel war land. Let's put an extension on the scenario. Say the admin in question applies blocks that exceed guidelines 10-20 times per hour, and has stated that they have no reason for the deviation. What do you do then? I'm pretty sure unblocking everybody would be a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Thing_c3ab.html" title="Bad Thing">Bad Thing</a>. I discussed the issue with the admin <a href="../../../n/a/c/User_talk%7ENaconkantari_6fb8.html#Recent_school_blocks" title="User talk:Naconkantari">here</a>, and posted to ANI <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#Excessive_blocking_by_Naconkantari" title="WP:AN/I">here</a>, noting sixteen times in one hour when blocking guidelines were exceeded. The majority of admins endorsed the blocks, which brought me here, trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Is WP:BLOCK broken? Is ANI?</dd>
<dd>Is the problem with me? Am I seriously wrong in thinking that admins should follow blocking policy unless there's a reason not to? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 00:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Would I be taken more seriously if I went out and found other blocks that are much harsher than guidelines for no reason? I realize that this is coming off as just an attack on Naconkantari, but I had never encountered Naconkantari before running into one of his blocks. When I was looking at <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">Special:Ipblocklist</a> I saw many blocks that were harsher than guidelines. If I talk to the admins involved, and if they tell me that they did not have any particular reason for the harsh blocks, would it help? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 00:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Speaking generally to the blocking system rather than speficically to any one admin or block or anything else; the system in general works as well as it can. If it is an imperfect system, it is only because it is an imperfect world. As someone who considers himself a fairly active vandal hunter, I have never considered it my job to ensure that a certain result is gotten against a vandal. I have always felt that my job it to make the admins aware of the problem, and let them deal with the problem as they see fit. In a few cases, I may have felt that the admin who dealt with the problem misunderstood the nature of the problem; and I will go to an admins talk page when I feel this has happend. But, I have never felt that I was seeking a certain result from a listing at AIV or ANI. I generally trust admins to use good judgement, and to dicker about whether a 2 hour block or a 6 hour block or a 24 hour block is appropriate in a certain case is moot. It is not my intention to get admins to do my bidding, or to punish bad users, or anything else like that. It is to make admins aware of a problem that may need addressing. Thats it. I could care less how much of the blocking policy is written, how slavishly the admins follow it, or even if they fix my problem at all. I trust them to fix the problem in a reasonable way, and they <b>always</b> do. Might I consider some of their blocks too harsh? I might. Might I consider that they don't block an IP I would have? I might. However, my opinion is largely irrelevant and I realize that. My time is better spent improving articles and preventing damage to other articles, not hunting down a specific vandal and seeing to it that they are punished, or railing against a specific admin who doesn't enforce the blocking policy as I would. I'd much rather work with the admins to make wikipedia better rather than set up an adversarial role against them... In conclusion, no, the system is not broken. Yes, it works fine as is. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 04:42, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I can see that from your perspective the system works fine as it is, because when you report vandalism, someone stops it. However, overly harsh blocks chase away new users, and you will never hear them complain. The complaints you do hear are from repeat vandals who have learned enough to try to game the system. The people who are actually hurt by harsh blocks are voiceless; they are chased away from Wikipedia forever before they can learn to contribute.</dd>
<dd>The guidelines exist to strike a balance between protecting Wikipedia from vandalism and remaining accessible to new users. I can agree that we may need to tweak the guidelines to figure out exactly where that balance is, but I'm really shocked that so many people seem to feel that there's no need for admins to follow guidelines at all. I sort of doubt that if someone went up for RFA right now, and their answer to "What sysop chores do you anticipate helping with?" was "I will block users who make unproductive edits immediately, on sight, without warning, temporarily for IPs and permanently for registered users," their request would be all that successful.</dd>
<dd>Part of your post seems to be from a "Calm down, Tom, and leave the admins to their business" perspective, so I'd like to point out that I am an admin, and how we operate <i>is</i> my business. Frankly, it's yours as well. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 05:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not an admin, but I am an experienced editor, and I do care to see that admins execute their job fairly and equitibly. I can only say that based on my experience, <b>they do</b>. If there is a systemic problem, then it would show up all the time. The fact that you constantly cite a single admin in your criticisms would seem to indicate to me that it is a problem with one admin, and as such should be redressed on a personal level. To propose wholesale changes to a system merely to correct the behavior of a rogue seems excessive and unneccesary. I agree, scareing of a potential good editor should be avoided at all cost. However, I rarely see an admin acting in a way that I think will cause that to happen. Do some of the thousands of admins do that. I am certain they do. Should they be disuaded from doing so? They should. Are the <b>vast</b> majority of admins exercising their judgement in appropriate ways. Yes they are. Thus, we shouldn't change the system merely to stop the few problematic admins. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 05:59, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, what wholesale changes to the system have I suggested? I want to add a sentence or two to the policy, stating that the exact details of blocking are up to the discretion of the blocking admin, but admins should follow the guidelines unless they have a reason not to.</dd>
<dd>If there is consensus among admins that the blocking policy is too lenient, then maybe the block length guidelines should be adjusted, but I see no need to touch them.</dd>
<dd>I just think that the policy needs language that says "Yes, you need to follow these guidelines unless you have a reason not to," and then I think admins need to follow the guidelines. I am not suggesting a vast bureaucracy which records the reason admins give, and I am not suggesting we set up a special cabal to review every block and make sure the reasons are good enough. However, I'm saying that if you're blocking some run-of-the-mill blanking vandal, you should follow the guidelines, and if you block someone for a length outside the guidelines and someone asks you why, you should have a reason. Because you've been dealing with this same vandalism in this IP block all week? Sounds good. Because it's a sockpuppet of so-and-so? Keep up the good work. Because you have your <i>own</i> blocking policy? No, sorry.</dd>
<dd>Tomorrow I will take some time to find other cases of the guidelines being violated for no reason so that this stops looking like a problem with one admin. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 06:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>(reduce indent) without reading prior discussion, my opinion on the matter is this: if administrators across the wiki are found blocking with little or no warnings posted, then the relevant policies should be adapted. We are not here to restrain our administrator's block buttons with red tape - <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en:paramount" class="extiw" title="wikt:en:paramount">paramount</a> for an efficient system for dealing with vandals, and it allows administrators to <i>use their own common sense</i> - which is by far the play-safe option: a situation-by-situation decision, guided but not controlled by policy .. as oppose to blocks where they are inappropiate or vice versa. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_cfc_934f.html" title="User:Anthony cfc"><span style="color:black;font-weight:bold;">anthony</span><span style="color:#ff5b00;font-weight:bold;">cfc</span></a> <sup>[<a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAnthony_cfc_db71.html" title="User talk:Anthony cfc"><b>talk</b></a>]</sup></span> 05:06, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Blocks are not the appropriate response on a first offense; they're there to stop someone who's causing harm and continues to do so after weaker measures have been tried, such as a warning. I've given indef blocks to users who have not received the full range of warnings, because they make it clear that they know what they're doing and would vandalize after warnings, but those are exception and should not be codified as a rule. <i>Policy</i> is not there to reflect practice. We wouldn't change NPOV because people really felt like editorializing, and we shouldn't compromise the policies that embody the assumption of good faith just so some admins can feel justified in handing out excessive blocks. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 21:41, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, it certainly is acceptable to block without warning if it's clear the blockee is malicious, and yes, it's also acceptable to permablock vandal-only accounts, and we've been doing that for years now. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've got no problem accepting either of those, but is it acceptable to block without warning, or permablock an account, for <i>one edit</i>? If so, what kind of single edit, with no other history of vandalism, would you have to see in order to block it without warning, permanently if it's a registered user? Assume that you're not dealing with sockpuppetry here; if you're dealing with sockpuppetry, then it's not actually one isolated edit and you can certainly block the hell out of them. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can top you on that by claiming it's acceptable to permablock (without warning) an account that has zero edits, as is commonly done for impersonator accounts or anyone with "on wheels" in their username. Note that sockpuppetry cannot generally be easily seen. Note also that permablocking a registered account is less bad than permablocking an IP (which we generally don't do anyway). Of course these are the exceptions rather than the rule. Three examples that come to mind would be (1) posting personal information on any user, regardless of whether or not it's true; (2) legal or physical threats; and (3) replacing any template with an image of genitalia. I'm sure there are others. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it's an impersonator account or an account that otherwise violates user name policies it's a completely different matter. So let's say you don't suspect sockpuppetry. The above are three cases where you'd be willing to block without warning for one edit? I can accept those; they're quite severe. How about if someone replaces a page with random characters, or some nonsense like the word "hi"? Again, you don't suspect sockpuppetry, you don't suspect any connection to any prior vandalism, and the IP has never edited Wikipedia before. There are no special circumstances whatsoever. Is it acceptable to block without warning for that one edit? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 14:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Response to something up there^ (quote for reference) TomTheHand said: "I was not actually able to find anyone else consistently applying blocks outside guidelines for no reason.". Well??? So you found one admin who you feel misapplied the rules? Doesn't sound like there is a real problem then. What seems to be missed by most of this discussion is that policies are largely being followed except when unique circumstances present themselves. To ask a question like TomTheHand did: "Is it acceptable to block without warning for that one edit?" seems to be reaching for a definitive statement like "It is never OK..." or "It is OK..." The truth is, for normal garden-variety vandalism, this isn't OK, but we don't need to address it, because it isn't being done. There will be unique cases that require unique responses. Several people have already provided reasonable situations where a one-edit vandal (or even a no-edit vandal) can be blocked. However, to say something like "Other than these already itemized exceptions, we should never block someone for only one edit" and making that policy uneccessarily ties the hands of admins, since situations will inevitibly arise for which such a block will be justified, and for which no one now is even imagining. Avoiding <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">instruction creep</a> is about not creating rules to fix problems that don't exist. The existing block policy seems to be adequate. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 06:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is in response to both Jayron32 and Radiant, as they've both brought up the same point. I am not trying to propose that we come up with an formal list of exceptions. I agree that that would tie the hands of the admins too much. I have no problem with the exceptions being in the mind of the admin and being entirely up to their discretion. I have a problem with if an admin has <i>no reason</i>, even in his or her own mind, for making the exception. There is no need for a codified list of rules, and such a thing would be harmful. However, an admin should be able to say <i>why</i> they applied a harsher block if someone happens to ask.</dd>
<dd>I'm not saying you should be able to ask me about a block I applied four months ago that I don't even remember, but if you ask me about a 31 hour block I applied to an IP yesterday which had replaced a page with "hi", I should be able to tell you why. I don't want a codified list of "good enough" reasons to apply a harsher block; if you don't think my reason is acceptable, you can use the appeals process already in place, but if I didn't have a reason, I think it's <i>always</i> unacceptable.</dd>
<dd>I want to explain how this started, because I admit that my original point is completely gone. I ran into an admin who consistently applied harsh blocks for no reason (I am not making an assumption here; I asked, and he said that that's simply how he deals with vandalism: any unproductive edit equals a block). I posted to ANI, and the consensus was largely "I don't see a problem with it."</dd>
<dd>My thoughts at that point were "If it's acceptable to apply harsher blocks than the guidelines state for no reason, we need to amend the blocking policy, because the blocking guidelines should tell you what blocks should be applied when there are no special circumstances involved." I came over here because I wanted to argue my side of the case, that the existing blocking guidelines are fine and strike a good balance between stopping vandalism and protecting newbies.</dd>
<dd>When I came over here, I found that nobody agrees with my entire premise: that the blocking policy should be followed unless the admin has a reason not to. I am <i>not</i> proposing instruction creep. I am <i>not</i> proposing that there be a list of acceptable reasons for harsh blocks. However, I do feel strongly that admins should follow blocking policy, and if they have to apply a harsher block, they should be able to explain why if asked, and if they <i>didn't have a reason</i> why, it's unacceptable. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I for one completely agree with the idea that, where there are conventions about block reasons and lengths, and an admin chooses to depart from those, that admin should be able to explain why they are doing do. The policy currently hints towards that already, at least with reasons for blocking, with the text at the top of that section. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebainer_6e44.html" title="User:Thebainer">bainer</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebainer_f593.html" title="User talk:Thebainer">talk</a>) 13:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Reply to TomTheHand: You say "I do feel strongly that admins should follow blocking policy, and if they have to apply a harsher block, they should be able to explain why if asked, and if they <i>didn't have a reason</i> why, it's unacceptable." And yet, with a single event notwithstanding, by your own admission, all admins always do this all the time, again, with a single exception. So what is the purpose of the whole discussion we are having. You propose no changes to the policy, you note that of the well over 1000 admins we have, a total of 1 is behaving in a way that runs counter to your idea of how blocking should work? From what I can see:
<ol>
<li>You propose a reasonable standard of behavior when admins block someone. Everyone agrees with you on this point.</li>
<li>With a total of <i>n</i> admins, <i>n-1</i> admins already meet this standard of behavior.</li>
<li>What is the big deal?</li>
</ol>

<dd>Until just now, with Thebainer's post and yours, nobody has agreed with me on that point.

<dd>OK. So we have establish that you call for a standard of behavior, and we also accept that that standard <b>is being followed</b> by every single admin save one.

<dd>Honestly... I've got no clue any more. After the discussion at ANI, where the blocks were endorsed, I got the impression that this kind of blocking was common. I thought that meant either blocking policy needed to change to reflect blocking practice, or blocking practice needed to change to reflect blocking policy, but it seems that blocking practice <i>is</i> in line with policy and nothing actually needed to change here.</dd>
<dd>I still don't really understand why ANI endorsed the blocks, assuming that they do agree, in principle, that admins should follow guidelines unless they have a reason not to. I think there might be a strong tendency to give the benefit of the doubt to blocking admins. Naconkantari continues to block in excess of guidelines. However, the solution doesn't seem to be here, in making any change to blocking policy.</dd>
<dd>I do have some ideas for some things I'd like to see in the policy. I don't want to propose new rules or regulations or anything, but I feel like currently the page lacks information on "soft" blocks. I'd like to write a little more about what they are, their advantages, and their disadvantages, but I will not try to say "in this situation, give a soft block, and in that situation, give a hard one." Before anyone rips me a new one, please let me think about it and come up with a proposal; I'll post a new thread for it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 13:58, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
