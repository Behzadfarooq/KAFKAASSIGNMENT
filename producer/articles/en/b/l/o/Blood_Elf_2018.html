<p>The Blood Elves, or Sin'Dorei (Children of The Blood), are a fraction of the remnants of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Elves_%28Warcraft%29_7773.html" title="High Elves (Warcraft)">High Elves</a> who survived the destruction of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quel%27Thalas_cdfa.html" title="Quel'Thalas">Quel'Thalas</a> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scourge_%28Warcraft%29_b6a4.html" title="The Scourge (Warcraft)">The Scourge</a>. They style themselves as Blood Elves in remembrance of their slaughtered brethren. At first they remained loyal to the failing Alliance in Lordaeron and its racist human commander in the region, Grand Marshal Garithos, who despised all non-human races. Despite the obvious talent of their leader, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Kael%27thas_1b42.html" title="Prince Kael'thas">Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider</a>, Garithos saw the Blood Elves as expendable and repeatedly assigned them impossible missions, ordering them to hold off major Undead assaults without any support from Human or Dwarven troops. Garithos hoped to use these battles as a way to gradually kill off the Blood Elves while also taking care of the main threat posed by The Scourge.</p>
<p>During one such hopeless battle against the Undead near <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalaran.html" title="Dalaran">Dalaran</a>, a desperate Kael was approached by a contingent of <a href="../../../n/a/g/Naga_%28Warcraft%29_9034.html" title="Naga (Warcraft)">Naga</a>, a serpentine race descended from the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Elves_32ca.html" title="Night Elves">Night Elves</a>, and their general, the Sea Witch <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Vashj_a1b3.html" title="Lady Vashj">Lady Vashj</a>. Vashj offered Kael the assistance of her forces and advised him to abandon the failing Alliance. Kael refused at first but was eventually forced to accept Vashj's offer in order to win the battle and save his people.</p>
<p>Garithos discovered this ruse and used the event as an excuse to exterminate the Blood Elves. Along with his brethren, Kael was thrown into the underground dungeons of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalaran.html" title="Dalaran">Dalaran</a> to await execution. The night before the execution, however, Kael was rescued by Vashj, who had snuck into the dungeons through the sewers. Together, they freed Kael's people, overcame the jailors, and escaped through the same magical portal Kel'Thuzad used to summon <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimonde.html" title="Archimonde">Archimonde</a> to Azeroth. And there they came to land on the shattered world called Outland, formerly the Orcish homeworld of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draenor.html" title="Draenor">Draenor</a>.</p>
<p>Here, Vashj revealed to Kael a startling truth: like the Naga, he and his people were terminally addicted to the magic that they had once wielded so effortlessly. The High Elves had drawn their power from the mystical Sunwell in Quel'Thalas for centuries. But once it was consumed by the Scourge, they had been left with nothing to sate their thirst for the arcane. Vashj promised him a solution if they could find her master, the renegade demon hunter, now part demon himself, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illidan_Stormrage_7239.html" title="Illidan Stormrage">Illidan Stormrage</a>.</p>
<p>Three days into their march through Outland and other places, they came across a Night Elven stronghold and discovered that Illidan had been captured by the Barrow Deeps Warden, <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maiev_Shadowsong_a04a.html" title="Maiev Shadowsong">Maiev Shadowsong</a>, who had been hunting him relentlessly since his escape from Kalimdor. The Blood Elf and Naga forces rescued Illidan from the Night Elves who had taken him captive.</p>
<p>Once free, Illidan told Kael that his people's addiction could not be cured but it could be fed and promised the Blood Elves enough magic — from demonic sources — to satisfy them if they would help him conquer Outland. The shattered world would serve as a new home for the Blood Elves and a refuge for Illidan and his Naga after failing to destroy the Frozen Throne. Ironically, the Blood Elves had contributed greatly to this failure, when earlier, at Dalaran, they had helped the Night Elves under Maiev and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malfurion_Stormrage_e534.html" title="Malfurion Stormrage">Malfurion Stormrage</a> disrupt a spell that Illidan was casting to melt the glaciers of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northrend.html" title="Northrend">Northrend</a>, the arctic stronghold of the Scourge. With no choice, Kael and his people pledged their loyalty to Illidan in the hopes of their survival.</p>
<p>Illidan taught Kael and the Blood Elves how to draw magic from demons to satisfy their addiction. Illidan, the Blood Elves, and the Naga, then liberated "the Broken" of the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draenei.html" title="Draenei">Draenei</a>, exiled remnants of the Eredar race who had been twisted by demons and hunted almost to extinction by the Fel Orcs under the rule of Magtheridon, a Pit Lord who had ruled Outland since the closing of the Dark Portal. After closing the dimensional gates from which Magtheridon summoned demons from the Twisting Nether to bolster his forces, the three commanders, assisted by Draenei under the elder seer Akama, stormed Magtheridon's stronghold in the Black Citadel and took it by force.</p>
<p>Moments after the citadel fell, <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kil%27jaeden.html" title="Kil'jaeden">Kil'jaeden</a>, the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Legion_39ca.html" title="Burning Legion">Burning Legion</a>'s last great demonlord and Illidan's new master, appeared. Furious over Illidan's earlier failure to destroy the Frozen Throne, <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kil%27jaeden.html" title="Kil'jaeden">Kil'jaeden</a> was bemused that Illidan was foolish enough to try and hide from him in Outland. Illidan claimed he came to Outland to bolster his forces. Kil'Jaeden saw promise in Illidan's new followers and decided to give him one last chance.</p>
<p>Under Illidan's leadership, the Blood Elves and Naga then travelled to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northrend.html" title="Northrend">Northrend</a>, where they ultimately failed in their mission to destroy the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frozen_Throne_dcb4.html" title="Frozen Throne">Frozen Throne</a> and were defeated by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthas.html" title="Arthas">Arthas</a> and the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scourge_%28Warcraft%29_b6a4.html" title="The Scourge (Warcraft)">Undead Scourge</a>. The Blood Elves and Vashj's Naga retreated back to Outland with Illidan where they established permanent settlements.</p>
<p>The remaining Blood Elves on Azeroth have reconstructed much of the forests of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quel%27Thalas_cdfa.html" title="Quel'Thalas">Quel'Thalas</a>. They have turned to the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horde_%28Warcraft%29_1c9d.html" title="Horde (Warcraft)">Horde</a> to help them find their way to Outland where they can once again be united with their leader Prince Kael'thas and receive the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Dream_c980.html" title="Golden Dream">Golden Dream</a> he has promised them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Elf_2018.html" title="Edit section: Culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
<p>Of the High Elves who survived the Scourge attack on Quel'Thalas, the majority became Blood Elves. The Blood Elves dress in red and black garments and have hairstyles that are taboo to the High Elves. They paint magical runes and tattoos on their bodies to ward off enemies or merely for appearance. Many have abandoned traditional magic, and instead siphon dark magic from beyond the realm. Some Blood Elves are Spell Breakers, who control the magic of other spellcasters, while others have become Demon Hunters. Blood Elves revel in their magic and show little regard for other things aside from their beautiful homeland. Some Blood Elves still maintain the ways of their ancestors as Rangers or Rogues, but these are few. Most have accepted more powerful magics such as manipulating the Holy Light of creation and wielding it as a tool for vengeance. Blood Elves are "addicted" to magic; a primary aspect of Blood Elven culture is for Elves to master their addiction before it consumes them. The unlucky elves who succumb to this addiction are known as "The Wretched."</p>
<p>Though the Blood Elves and the former High elves were of the same race, there are differences between the two. The Blood Elves have glowing green eyes. It has been speculated that the Blood Elves will further physically change as a result of their reckless use of magic, similarly to how the <a href="../../../n/a/g/Naga_%28Warcraft%29_9034.html" title="Naga (Warcraft)">Naga</a> and the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Races_in_the_Warcraft_universe#Satyrs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Races_in_the_Warcraft_universe#Satyrs" rel="nofollow">Satyr</a>] were corrupted by their use of fel energies. Unfortunately, many of the remaining High Elves who did not become Blood Elves will eventually undergo mental and/or physical degeneration of varying degrees without a dependable source of magic. Indeed, beings addicted to magic cannot be severed from their sources of power and hope to be spared some level of pain and irrevocable injury. It should be noted, however, that many High Elves apparently do have some source of magic and are fully fit and healthy, possibly thanks to some means of tapping into the ley lines of the world.</p>
<p><a name="Magical_Addiction" id="Magical_Addiction"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Elf_2018.html" title="Edit section: Magical Addiction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Magical Addiction</span></h2>
<p>Due to the reckless channelling of the vast arcane magic the High elves wielded during the pinnacle of their empire, the High elves developed an insatiable thirst for magic; this addiction, if not fed, will eventually result in insanity, then death. Previously the source from which this thirst was fed was from their beloved <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunwell.html" title="Sunwell">Sunwell</a>; a vast magical fountain constructed on an underlying node of power. The Sunwell was one of the most powerful magical artifacts in all of Azeroth. Radiant with magical power, this artifact fed the former High elves with unimaginable magic powers. One dreadful day, however, the High elves were severed from the source of their arcane power and as a result, they suffered indignities and fell into darkness. In the High elves' darkest moment, <a href="../../../k/a/e/Kael%27thas_Sunstrider_d1bc.html" title="Kael'thas Sunstrider">Kael'thas Sunstrider</a>, the last of the Royal bloodline gathered the last of the remaining High elves, renaming them Blood elves in honor to their fallen brethren. He then proceeded to teach them how to tap into other ambient magical sources, feeding upon it to sustain themselves temporarily.</p>
<p>After the Blood elves joined Illidan and the Naga, they were granted powerful demonic magic that did not only sustain them, but strengthened them as well. They now revel in the source of their dark powers and have regained much of their former strength. More reckless then ever before these Blood Elves will stop at nothing to gain power, regardless of the costs. While the dark magic they now wield are enough to sustain them, the Blood Elves always look for more ways to boost their own power and do not hesitate to ruthlessly exploit any magic wielding creature, feeding upon its essence until only a shell remains, devoid of all life.</p>
<p>Their 'thirst' for magic may be noticed in The Burning Crusade game, which allows Blood Elf players to play as nearly all of the mana-based classes: Warlock, Paladin, Priest, Mage and Hunter. The Druid and the Shaman are absent from this list, as the Blood Elves long turned away from the naturalist ways of their <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Elf_f132.html" title="Night Elf">Night Elf</a> kin, and want nothing to do with the shamanistic culture, believing only in their race's fortitude.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Elf_2018.html" title="Edit section: In Azeroth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In Azeroth</span></h3>
<p>The Blood Elves are not necessarily evil, though they may seem hateful, reckless, and arrogant. Much like the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forsaken_%28Warcraft%29_f52a.html" title="Forsaken (Warcraft)">Forsaken</a>, they are a race that has endured many accumulated tragedies in recent times and are trying, if by desperate measures, to find their place in the order of things once more. Their unorthodox practices, however, have earned them several enemies and many more critics.</p>
<p>The Blood Elves are at the very least cordial with the Forsaken, as a former <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_elf_%28Warcraft%29_4d7b.html" title="High elf (Warcraft)">High elf</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvanas_Windrunner_ae4c.html" title="Sylvanas Windrunner">Sylvanas Windrunner</a>, leads the sentient undead and likewise strives to attain a place for her people in Azeroth. The <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orc_%28Warcraft%29_1381.html" title="Orc (Warcraft)">Orcs</a>, having been slaves to warlock magic and demonic corruption themselves, are wary of their new allies but will give them the benefit of the doubt with hopes for their redemption (this is the same reason Thrall allowed the Forsaken to join the Horde). The <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tauren_%28Warcraft%29_67cc.html" title="Tauren (Warcraft)">Tauren</a>, though appalled by the Blood Elves' magical addiction, share the Orcs' viewpoint. The <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll_%28Warcraft%29_73fc.html" title="Troll (Warcraft)">Darkspear Trolls</a>, despite their hatred of elves, remain loyal to Thrall - and it would seem the two races share a common loathing of the Amani trolls, whom the elves of Quel'thalas have fought against for generations. The playable Blood Elves in the expansion have no affiliation with the Broken or the Naga, as they are those who have not yet joined Kael'thas's forces in Outland; Instead, they have remained behind, to show others the way to their beloved leader, Kael'thas Sunstrider. In addition they seek to rebuild their former seat of power; their ancient capital; Quel'thalas.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horde_%28Warcraft%29_1c9d.html" title="Horde (Warcraft)">Horde</a>'s hesitant reception of the Blood Elves pales in comparison to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_%28Warcraft%29_a43f.html" title="Alliance (Warcraft)">Alliance</a>'s outright rejection of them. The <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_%28Warcraft%29_b397.html" title="Human (Warcraft)">Humans</a>, <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf_%28Warcraft%29_34a4.html" title="Dwarf (Warcraft)">Dwarves</a>, and <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnome_%28Warcraft%29_fdc0.html" title="Gnome (Warcraft)">Gnomes</a> spurn their former allies as traitors to their cause, while the few remaining <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Elves_%28Warcraft%29_7773.html" title="High Elves (Warcraft)">High Elves</a> view them with both abhorrence and pity. The worst treatment of all, however, comes from the <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Elf_f132.html" title="Night Elf">Night Elves</a>, who are disgusted by the Blood Elves and view them as too dangerous to be left alive. The blood elves, having lost their Sunwell, now resort to demonic magics to achieve power.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Elf_2018.html" title="Edit section: Golden Dream">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Golden Dream</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Dream_c980.html" title="Golden Dream">Golden Dream</a> is the dream that Blood Elves in the Warcraft fantasy universe have. They wish the Sunwell to be reborn or for a new source of magic to forever settle their undying thirst. Illidan Stormrage has given them just that; by feeding their addiction and making them powerful demonic entities, he has secured himself loyal minions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_Elf_2018.html" title="Edit section: The Holy Light and the Blood Elves">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Holy Light and the Blood Elves</span></h3>
<p>The Holy Light is not only a gift for dedication to the defense of Life, Justice, Truth, and Righteousness; it is a magical power, and as such, it can be stolen, harnessed and used as weapon for malicious purposes. Despite the fact that the majority of the Blood Elves lost their faith in the Light after the destruction of Quel'Thalas, they have found new ways to harness the divine power without the need for the years of rigorous study and faith in the light normally associated with the divine arts. Usually this divine power is only granted to the most devoted followers of the light who wish to heal, save, and sacrifice themselves for the innocent lives of others. However, Blood Elves despise such teachings, which they regard as weakness, and instead now channel this stolen magic for their own twisted ends.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>They manage use of The Light by siphoning the energies of a captured <a href="../../../n/a/a/Naaru.html" title="Naaru">Naaru</a> known as M'uru, a being that can best be described as The Light incarnate. Using their dark powers, the Blood Elves are able to bless their people with the power taken from the Naaru. This gives them the ability to become paladins. While these Blood Elf paladins, known to their people as Blood Knights, have nearly all the same abilities as those of the Alliance, their darker ties cause them to have unique skills.<sup id="_ref-hard_inf_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hard_inf" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Blood elf characters can play as the following classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunter</li>
<li>Mage</li>
<li>Paladin</li>
<li>Priest</li>
<li>Rogue</li>
<li>Warlock</li>
</ul>
<p>Though the Warrior class is available to all other races, the Blood Elves never recieved this, instead getting the Paladin class. Blizzard made this hard-to-decide change just before the release of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Burning_Crusade_75f9.html" title="The Burning Crusade">The Burning Crusade</a>. They chose to "balance out the draenei Shaman class, in exchange for a few other changes."</p>

<div style="margin-left:3%;">
<p><b>Priests</b> receive the racial ability Consume Magic. Consume Magic dispels one beneficial Magic effect from the caster and gives them 120 to 154 mana. (453 to 488 mana at level 70) - instant cast, two-minute cooldown.</p>
<p><b>Paladins</b> receive Seal of Blood. Enables all melee attacks to deal additional Holy damage equal to 40% normal weapon damage, but the Paladin loses health equal to 10% of the total damage inflicted. Unleashing the Seal's energy will judge an enemy, instantly causing 295 to 325 Holy damage at the cost of health equal to 33% of the damage caused. (210 mana at level 64) - instant cast.</p>

<div style="margin-left:3%;">The elves have long dived into the magic and arcane as evident by their cultural centerpiece, the Sunwell. Thus, they have developed a natural <b>Arcane Affinity</b> as a result of the well's magical presence, making the blood elves naturally skilled with arcane arts such as Enchanting. The elves' constant exposure to the Sunwell also gave them a natural defense against many kinds of magical manipulation, granting them a natural <b>Magical Resistance</b>. After the destruction of the Sunwell during the Third War, the remaining blood elves developed the skill of <b>Mana Tapping</b> to feed their magical addiction, allowing them to tap into the arcane energies of other beings. <b>Arcane Torrent</b> comes as a natural manipulation of these consumed energies and allows the elves to absorb and unleash the energies gathered.</div>
