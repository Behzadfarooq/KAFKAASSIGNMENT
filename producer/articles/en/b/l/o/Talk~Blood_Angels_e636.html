<p>I have proposed a guideline for character notablity within <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> articles which I believe may effect the listings on this page. Please see the proposal at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Warhammer_40%2C000_Notability_966b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Warhammer 40,000/Notability">Wikipedia:WikiProject Warhammer 40,000/Notability</a> and comment. Cheers --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 10:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We have now agreed some guidelines, and I believe that Rafen, Arkio, Leonatos, and Holst, Cleon and Theolus do not meet any of the criteria specified. If you believe any of them do, please give the reasons here. (If you wish to discuss changes to the guidelines, please do this at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Warhammer_40%2C000_Notability_f4b1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Warhammer 40,000/Notability">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Warhammer 40,000/Notability</a>).

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In order to be metioned they must meet one of the criteria - Leonatos has a special model and rules produced for him by Games Workshop not to mention starring in the blood quest series which surely means he meets two of them? Rafen and Arkio are major characters in the biggest (only) Blood Angels series which surely means they can stay - Holst, Cleon and Theolus you could be right, i put them there as they seem to be quite well known due to the figuirines produced of them but as they are not part of the Warhammer 40k game/dont have their own rules they dont really apply? - I think Leonatos, Rafen and Arkio all have good cases to stay mentioned though <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 19:23, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Leonatos definitely stays, with his starring role in the three BloodQuest comics and a limited edition miniature. Uncertain about the rest -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 19:52, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It comes down to then the definition of a major series? Im actually on a split mind, I know there were only 2 books but they remain the only Blood Angel Novels (and they were quite good) - also, does Arkio merit a mention, most of what made him famous was acting outside of the Chapter - he was made famous for defying it as a member of his seperate army? Just a thought <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 22:43, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Using the definition of a major series a triology or more I think then Rafen and Arkio should go... <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 12:17, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, i was jus wondering upon an issue, as the Black Rage Article expands it almost seems that slowly the Black Rage is being controlled... I mean compared to how things used to be within the chapter surely there can be seen as hope</p>
<ul>
<li>Mephiston is of course the first glimmer of hope, Sanguinius even said he must show his brother it could be conquered</li>
<li>Brother Rafens overcoming of the curse and the using of the Spear of Telesto to help the others overcome it</li>
<li>Lemarte's ability to channel the Black Rage and while not overcome it to some extent control it</li>
</ul>
<p>This might not be amazingly relevant but its just something i was pondering on, i guess the release of the new codex could possibly bring a new light on the matter? <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 19:12, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In relevance to that article was it actually Rafens power that saved them or was the it the Spear of Telesto? I didnt read it as rafen being blessed, he has resived a vision but i thought the reason he could save them was because he had simply figured out how to use the Spear of Telesto? <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 17:02, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reread the Blood Angels Novels and im not sure about the Blood Angels who overthrew the Black Rage article anymore - Rafen never actually really suffered from it from what I could see - The Red Thirst claimed him at one point but that was to fight of Steele mind witchery - at the battle of Sabien the Black Rage didnt really affect him due to the power of Telesto - Mephiston broke it through strength of will but in the novel no1 overcame it, the spear of telesto was just able to neutrilise its affects...? Has anyone else a view on this? <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 12:08, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Can anyone give a different view on this - i dont think rafen and the other troops defeated the curse, it was just lifted from them - im not 100% sure but im pretty certain Mephiston is the only person who has defeated the curse, i think the other points should be deleted? <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 22:04, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont think so, from what I read in Deus Sanguinius, Steele opens the flood gates to Rafen's dark memeories and he becomes crazy, running in a frenized rage until he falls into the make shift shrine he set up for the Emperor and that saves him(Emperor's statue not Sanguinius's intervention).By the way Lowris, you should know that the Black Rage is virtually incurable so when any Blood Angel is afflicted by it and then regains control of himself then they have defeated the Black Rage<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhammer_Expert_a869.html" title="User:Warhammer Expert">Warhammer Expert</a> 01:07, 31 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nope, it never said he fell to the Black Rage, the red thrist maybe - he used the rage of the Black Thirst to throw off the mind witchery - i know its virtualy incurable but the spear kinda did? to say they defeated it is misleading, The Spear of Telesto's power lifted it from them</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I re-read both books and Steele caused Rafen to almost fall into the Black Rage because there arent any symptoms for the Red Thirst that say the person will run haphazardly through a crowded city with a foaming mouth and bewildered mind, I believe that Rafen simply had a nervous breakdown rather than any gene curses<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhammer_Expert_a869.html" title="User:Warhammer Expert">Warhammer Expert</a> 17:30, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I changed the title to Blood Angels who have overcome the curse will that make you happy? Also, New Blood arent just the Shenlongi rebels, they included Blood Angels loyal to Arkio<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhammer_Expert_a869.html" title="User:Warhammer Expert">Warhammer Expert</a> 17:34, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>LOL there is still sumfn about it that bugs me, i guess the question will be answered in the new codex, if it still says mephiston is the only one to overcome it we have our answer - ok, then the use of New Blood is wrong because at that stage the troops who where loyal to Arkio where fighting along side mephistons and they were also swept away in the Black Rage</dd>

<dd>I was searching amazon.com for WH40K books when i found this book(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844162478/sr=8-5/qid=1143938078/ref=pd_bbs_5/104-8654421-7295950?%5Fencoding=UTF8" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844162478/sr=8-5/qid=1143938078/ref=pd_bbs_5/104-8654421-7295950?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844162478/sr=8-5/qid=1143938078/ref=pd_bbs_5/104-8654421-7295950?%5Fencoding=UTF8</a>)</dd>

<p>which shows Sanguinius(i presume) with a red dragon. Does anyone know about this dragon or its connection to Sanguinius?<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhammer_Expert_a869.html" title="User:Warhammer Expert">Warhammer Expert</a> 00:37, 2 April 2006 (UTC) Update: I suspect this creature to be the Bloodthirster of Khorne but I doubt that because Sanguinius is looking at the dragon with seeming admiration, then again...Sangiunius looks like he is ready to strike the creature because his sword is out and he has one hand firmly on the dragon's horn</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>it kinda looks the head has been cut off and he is holding it...? it could have just be a deamon? Sanguinius killed the bloodthirster by breaking its back... honestly not sure what it is... i think it has to be Sanguinius but its probably just a deamon? <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowris_8a7d.html" title="User:Lowris">Lowris</a> 11:08, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I still dont understand why Sanguinius would look at the daemon(or its head) in admiration when its very existence is an insult to the Emperor, plus I dont think he had enough time during the battle of terra to stop and admire his own work( the same cant be said for Rogal Dorn)<a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarhammer_Expert_a869.html" title="User:Warhammer Expert">Warhammer Expert</a> 14:02, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! I was wondering what the policy was on highlight changes in information between revisions of 40K, as I had been planning to add a note that in earlier versions the exact source of the Black Rage differed slightly. <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamboo_marimba_7094.html" title="User:Bamboo marimba">Bamboo marimba</a> 11:00, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
