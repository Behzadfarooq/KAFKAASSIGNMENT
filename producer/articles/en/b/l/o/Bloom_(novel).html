<p>Bloom is set in the year <a href="../../../2/1/0/2106.html" title="2106">2106</a>, in a world where <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_goo.html" title="Grey goo">self-replicating nanomachines</a> called "Mycora" have consumed <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> and other planets of the inner solar system, forcing mankind to eke out a bleak living in the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroids.html" title="Asteroids">asteroids</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galilean_moons.html" title="Galilean moons">Galilean moons</a>. The story begins on <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganymede_%28moon%29.html" title="Ganymede (moon)">Ganymede</a> with an article about a “bloom”, or outbreak of Mycora, that serves to emphasize the danger and horror of this technogenic life (TGL). The author of said story, Strasheim, is also the main character. He is first seen in the office of Lottick, a major public figure, who has called him there for an unknown purpose.</p>
<p>Lottick tells Strasheim that the mycora have appareantly been stealing gene sequences, which has worried people. As a result, a mission to drop some TGL detectors onto the Earth’s polar icecaps has been approved and Lottick asks Strasheim to go along as a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reporter.html" title="Reporter">reporter</a>.</p>
<p>Strasheim agrees and soon after goes to meet the other crewmembers, and inspect the ship, which is called the Louis Pasteur and is technologically camouflaged to protect the crew against mycora. Unfortunately, an unnamed man releases a mycora bloom in the hanger, killing one crewmember and forcing the others to launch the Pasteur three weeks earlier than planned and without adequate supplies.</p>
<p>Because of their forced launch, the Pasteur docks at Saint Helier, a medium-sized Floral <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a> to pick up supplies. While there, they are surprised multiple times, but what shocks them most is that the asteroid's inhabitants have apparently discovered human life on Venus and Earth, co-existing with the mycora.</p>
<p>Shaken, the crew continues on their journey, but become aware that one of the crew is sabotaging the mission. The saboteur turns out to be a woman named Bacum, whom Strasheim had fallen in love with. She is secretly a member of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, a spiritual group that invests large sums of money into researching Mycora. After being found out, Baucum ruptures a storage bag inside herself that had been carrying spores of Mycora. Terrified, the crew shoves her out of an airlock before the Mycora can devour them too.</p>
<p>Later, it is revealed that the mission has a somewhat more violent purpose than the crew was led to believe. The detectors that they are supposed to drop on the Earth’s surface are designed in such a way that they can generate enough heat to rid the Earth of all Mycora.</p>
<p>But the true purpose of the mission to Earth isn’t all the Temples were right about, as at the climax, the Mycora is discovered to be <a href="../../../s/a/p/Sapient.html" title="Sapient">sapient</a> and without ill-will toward humans. It briefly explains that it just realized people were there, gives some guidelines on how to mark areas as off-limits to the Mycora and then leaves.</p>
<p>The book ends almost thirteen years later. The captain of the Pasteur has been diagnosed with a terminal disease. He requests that Strasheim (now a successful media magnate) be his witness as he joins the Mycora.</p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloom_%28novel%29.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h1>
<p><b>John Strasheim</b> – The main character. Works as a <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobbler.html" title="Cobbler">cobbler</a> on Ganymede, but is also an amateur journalist. It is the latter skill which causes him to be selected for the journey to the earth.</p>
<p><b>Vaclav Lottick</b> – Introduced as the most powerful man in the solar system, he is the head of research for the Immunity and the man who invites Strasheim on the mission to earth.</p>
<p><b>Darren Wallich</b> - Captain of the Louis Pasteur, has had a “tickle capacitor” implant, which makes his personality seem more likable.</p>
<p><b>Tosca Lehne</b> – Another crewmember. One of the inventors of the t-balance, which coats the outside of the Pasteur with the purpose of making it appear to be part of the Mycosystem.</p>
<p><b>Jenna Davenroy</b> – A nuclear engineer in her 40s. She is the ladderdown expert on the Pasteur and also its chief propulsion monitor.</p>
<p><b>Tug Jinacio</b> – A Response lieutenant, responsible for handling emergencies on the Pasteur (ex. Fire, bloom, etc.) Killed in the hangar bloom.</p>
<p><b>Renata Baucum</b> – Bioanalyst on the Pasteur, who turns out to be a traitor. Killed when she ruptures the Mycora hidden within her.</p>
<p><b>Sudhir Rapisardi</b> – Coordinated the design of the TGL (technogenic life) detectors that the Pasteur will place on the earth to monitor the Mycora. Is the biophysicist on the Pasteur.</p>
<p><b>Chris Dibrin</b> – sent by the Governor to show the Pasteur crew around Saint Helier. He has an artificial intelligence implanted into his brain that enables him to think faster.</p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloom_%28novel%29.html" title="Edit section: The Louis Pasteur Spaceship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Louis Pasteur Spaceship</span></h1>
<p>Obviously named after <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Pasteur_5462.html" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> the French microbioligist and chemist, the ship is described as being very small and having an unusual external covering invented by Lehne called the t-balance.</p>
<p>According to Strasheim, the Pasteur is "like a bathroom with seven shower stalls and a streetcar cockpit wedged incongruously at one end, a utility closet wedged in the other." Rather cramped quarters for a crew of seven going on a voyage that will take about two years</p>
<p>The purpose of the t-balance is to convince the Mycora that the ship is part of it by means of tactile camouflage. It is described as a gleaming rainbow gray colored coating that appeared to be made up of millions of miniscule dots, each of which also appears to be made up of millions of tiny dots, and so on. The t-balance also gives off the illusion that the dots are moving. Unfortunately for the Pasteur's crew, although the t-balance should work in theory, it has not yet been tested because the only way to do so is by surrounding it with Mycora.</p>

<p><b>Immunity</b>: A defensive system used by the people on Ganymede (as well as those on the other outer planets) to keep spores of Mycora from invading. Also a term used by people under its protection to refer to themselves.</p>
<p><b>Ladderdown</b>: System of converting elements into other elements further down the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_Table_ffc2.html" title="Periodic Table">Periodic Table</a>. As a result of using this system, the inhabitants of the Immunity have a plethora of low-numbered elements lying around. For example, they have so much gold they use it to weigh down their shoes and pave the streets.</p>
<p><b>Mycora</b>: A substance that appears to be grey goo, but is in actuality a type of technogenic life form created by humans that escaped their control and began consuming everything around it. It has also evolved from its original state and adapted to an environment where there isn't anything left to consume. Throughout the book, Conway's Game of Life is used as an imperfect example of how the Mycora operates.</p>
<p><b>Temples of Transcendent Evolution</b>: Originally formed on <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callisto_%28moon%29.html" title="Callisto (moon)">Callisto</a> (one of Jupiter's moons) it is an organization that invests large sums of money into research about the Mycora. They are spiritually inclined and believe that the Mycora is "a presence greater than themselves".</p>
