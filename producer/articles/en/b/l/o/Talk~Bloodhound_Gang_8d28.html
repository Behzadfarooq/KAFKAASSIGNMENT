<dd>Firstly, nothing is sourced on this page, perhaps we should removed the whole page? Secondly, all statements in this section relate to the lyrics of Yellow Fever, which are quoted. No one could seriously suggest the rest of the section is untrue based on these lyrics. The lyrics are so clear cut that the burden of proof now rests on others to provide evidence that dispite the lyrics in this song the band are not racist.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 08:20, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hahaha. You do realize Bloodhound Gang is a JOKE BAND? I assume you think <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_Cunt_72bf.html" title="Anal Cunt">Anal Cunt</a> is racist too. In fact, if I say "I hate mexicans" as a joke, I am now racist by your logic? --<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiface_de15.html" title="User:Liface">Liface</a> 17:36, 1 June 2006 (UTC) Okay, I've sourced everything in the article, and flagged some things with a citationneeded tag.

<dd>Seriously, if you could find a credible source confirming that the band are a "joke band" and that all their racist and homophobic lyrics are ironic etc... I would consider moderating, perhaps even removing the section on racism ( I would also sleep better). Still a racist joke is still racist and racist comments made in an ironic fashion need to have some kind of redeeming punch line. In this case, by most people's standards, the level and consistency of racism in their material leaves the burden of proof firmly with them. We both agree that the song "Yellow Fever" is by the band. I don't need to cite any of the remaining statements in the section. You can't seriously argue that given the lyrics in question that no one in the US and no one in the UK has accused the band of racism. In addition if you want to remove the final statement, please find any credible source concerning the band making any kind of denial that they are racist. By the way if you say "I hate Mexicans", in the absence of any other evidence, a lot of people are going to assume you're racist, you can't assume everyone else is going to be able to mind read you, loose remarks like that can, in some instances, get people killed (or least hurt someone's feelings) whether they were meant as a joke or not. So my advice would be to think before you speak.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 23:18, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Found it. And it's pretty obvious they're a joke band, if you would listen to their music, look at their website and see their radio and TV appearances. Almost everything they do is in a tongue-in-cheek manner. --<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiface_de15.html" title="User:Liface">Liface</a> 00:01, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I've seen that quote before. I agree it does raise a question as to how the lyrics are intended to be received. The problem is that the lyrics in yellow fever for example go beyond reproducing common stereotypes and slurs and manufactuer a whole array of new ones. In addition you can't write lyrics like that and then say you weren't out to shock anyone and just because they laugh at it on the bus doesn't mean it's not racist. Ultimately the material is still going to upset people and you can see why. Even if they don't take it seriously/tongue-in-cheek, some of their fans will and they oviously aren't making enough effort to make it clear that the lyrics are ironic or whatever.</dd>
<dd>With regards to this section in the article, it looks fairly balanced to me, are you happy with it as it stands?--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHontogaichiban_dc96.html" title="User:Hontogaichiban">Hontogaichiban</a> 09:53, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yep, very happy. The one thing that usually gets me when things like this are first posted (and I'm guilty of this too), is that people include things like "has been criticized by x and x" and then there's no sources to back it up.

<p>I really don't think we need a disambig page for BHG since most people searching for it are going to mean the band. There are countless other articles that utilize the technique that was on the old BHG page (including a link to the other usage of the term at the top of the article).

<li><b>Neutral</b> - As long as the page for "THE Bloodhound Gang" doesn't go directly to the band article, I don't oppose the move. However, I take issue with the statment that "The Bloodhound Gang" is a "forgotten TV show." For people who grew up watching <i>3-2-1 Contact</i>, the segment is considered a cult favorite, especially for its theme song.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 06:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - I agree with <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiface_de15.html" title="User:Liface">Liface</a>. The band is what most people were searching for, so if we need a disambig link at the top of the article to the TV show segment then just add it in. It's as easy as that. -- <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoeticsage_1b49.html" title="User:Noeticsage">Noetic Sage</a> 17:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose (band move)/Strong Oppose (redirect TBG directly to band)</b> - Keep the future in mind. Today's "currently active band" can easily become tomorrow's "forgotten" band. I also find it ironic that the nominator thinks the TV show has been "forgotten," as I suspect that it was the TV show that inspired the band's name. If it was as "forgotten" as he thinks it is, would his pet band have the same name? Also, immediately shoving a lewd, crude, pseudo-"infamous" foxtrotting band in the face of people who <i>are</i> looking for an innocent children's TV show, via changing the disambig to a redirect, is rude. This is a consideration with respect to moving the band to BG, but even moreso for redirecting TBG to the band, as per Fat Man.

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodhound_Gang_c064.html" title="Bloodhound Gang">Bloodhound Gang</a> is preferred over <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bloodhound_Gang_1ffa.html" title="The Bloodhound Gang">The Bloodhound Gang</a> per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_music_b99e.html#Bands" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject music">Wikipedia:Wikiproject music#Bands</a>. My observation is that the band uses it both ways. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:43, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then we are simply talking about a move from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bloodhound_Gang_%28band%29_2645.html" title="The Bloodhound Gang (band)">The Bloodhound Gang (band)</a> to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodhound_Gang_c064.html" title="Bloodhound Gang">Bloodhound Gang</a> and this avoids any issues with moving the redirect page. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Perhaps we should all get clear on just what we think is being proposed. I always understood that the TV show's article wasn't going to be moved; that was never a misconception I had. However, I assumed that the nominator's purpose in moving the disambiguation page was to empty the location so that it could be redirected to the band page. This was based on my not seeing the point of the move if this was not his intention, his talk about how "forgotten" the TV show was and how "unneeded" the disambiguation was, and the deduction that if he thought the band was so predominant that it should be the first stop for someone going to "Bloodhound Gang," it should also be where people going to "The Bloodhound Gang" should end up. If he intends to keep the redirect pointing to "Bloodhound Gang (disambiguation)", I still question the move, but the force of my objections is lessened. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 16:47, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Personally, I would have supported a further move from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bloodhound_Gang_%28TV_series%29_3602.html" title="The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)">The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)</a> → <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bloodhound_Gang_1ffa.html" title="The Bloodhound Gang">The Bloodhound Gang</a>. I remember the TV show fondly as well and there's no point having a dab page with two articles on it. Just get rid of the dab and have each article refer to each other. Just an idea. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 01:51, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Or maybe theBLOODHOUNDGANG or The Bloodhoundgang. The article needs to be moved to reflect the correct name of the band, as with the instances of the name in the article. Danke.<a href="../../../1/0/0/User%7E100110100.html" title="User:100110100">100110100</a> 08:34, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to their offical website and their myspace they go by both.So I think it's fine the way it is. <a href="../../../s/o/a/User%7ESOADLuver_339c.html" title="User:SOADLuver">SOADLuver</a> 00:24, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>the offical name is The Bloodhound gang. but as with a lot of bands that use the word the it usualy gets droped. and if you go to amazon.com some of their cd's are listed as bloodhound gang and some as The bloodhound gang (Mikedlif 18:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC))</p>
