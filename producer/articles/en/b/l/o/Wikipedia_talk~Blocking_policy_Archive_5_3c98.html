<p>The following addition has been proposed by <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShultz_IV_2c52.html" title="User:Shultz IV">User:Shultz IV</a>: <i>Users may not be blocked simply because they have been blocked on foreign Wikipedias, since their affairs are to stay entirely separate. However, you may discuss those blocks with the users in question if you wish.</i></p>
<p>I do not think this is a good addition. At best, it is <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">m:instruction creep</a>. At worst it could promote wikilawyering or otherwise get in the way of reasonable measures to limit the damage caused by cross-wikipedia vandals. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 21:39, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would tend to agree that this isn't a good idea - although we shouldn't normally be running around making sure all our blocks line up, there may be situations involving abusive cross-project vandals who should be banned based on their patterns elsewhere.

<dd>So if you know a user here that was blocked for vandalizing on a foreign Wikipedia, what would you do? Would you leave them alone or talk to them about it? --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShultz_IV_2c52.html" title="User:Shultz IV">Shultz IV</a> 22:22, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Policy about blocking ISP web proxy?</span></h2>
<p>I am aware that at least two ISP's in Thailand is permanently blocked recently. One is KSC Internet, the second ISP in Thailand and one of the biggest, which uses the IP address 203.155.1.245 for its outbound web traffic. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/203.155.1.245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/203.155.1.245" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for a long list of contributions before the block.) Another one is TOT, the second largest ADSL operator in Thailand, which recently use the address 202.47.247.116. Using a common IP address here is a norm as some web filtering is enforced by Thai government. Since too many users are affected because of one bad user (I suspect it is hacked or spywared), I proposed that these two addresses should be unblocked. And there should be something that mark the user page that the IP belong to ISP web proxy so that later administrator should only block for a short period. -- <a href="../../../l/e/r/User%7ELerdsuwa_cbec.html" title="User:Lerdsuwa">Lerdsuwa</a> 15:10, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biographies of living persons</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to add this to the policy, and would appreciate feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editors who repeatedly insert critical material into the biography of a living person (or its talk page), or into a section about a living person in another article (or its talk page), may be blocked under the disruption provision of this policy if, in the opinion of the blocking admin, the material is unsourced, or incorrectly sourced, and may constitute defamation. Blocks made for this reason are designed to keep the material off the page until it is written and sourced in accordance with the content policies, including <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, and should therefore be kept short in the first instance. Repeated infractions should attract longer blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've dealt with several cases where newish editors try to add unsourced material that could cause legal problems. Dealing with these is very time-consuming, because the policies have to be explained to the users several times, and then sources have to be found and used properly. In the meantime, they're reverting to restore the material, and we only have three reverts ourselves if it's not simple vandalism. Asking another admin to block the editors for disruption is awkward as the policy currently stands, because arguing about the use of sources and quality of writing is regarded as a content dispute and therefore not blockable. Asking Danny to deal with all these cases is unrealistic, because there are so many of them, and he restricts himself to formal complaints. It seems absurd that, with around 1,000 admins, Danny is having to juggle all these complaints, when we could head some of them off at the pass by taking early action against the users who make these problematic edits. My guess is that just the threat of a block for disruption would be enough in most cases to show new editors that Wikipedia takes these issues seriously.

<dd>Sounds quite reasonable, and I'd block for it, but I'm afraid the only way most people will, and the only way to keep such blocks from being lifted by a clueless AGFer, is if somebody creates a series of progressively forceful boilerplate warnings... as much as I hate the damn things, e.g. {{<a href="../../../b/l/p/Template%7EBlp1_299b.html" title="Template:Blp1">blp1</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../b/l/p/Template%7EBlp2_4735.html" title="Template:Blp2">blp2</a>}}, etc. Pathetic, I know. — <small>Apr. 20, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[23:01] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt>

<dd>We don't normally indef-block for the first instance of disruption. If many people consider a block unfair, there is certain to be an admin who will argue that the block should be undone, and that is an indication that the community's patience has yet to be exhausted. This all actually works out in practice, and I don't think it makes sense to remove it. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 02:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not a good way of putting it. To anybody threatened with such a block, it's bound to sound like a troll-basher's wet dream. The community is not a person. About whose patience exactly are we talking?</dd>
<dd>In reality, all the users listed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_banned_users_3583.html#Banned_by_the_Wikipedia_community" title="Wikipedia:List of banned users">Wikipedia:List of banned users#Banned by the Wikipedia community</a> were banned because the members of the community debated and decided that the user's further presence will not ever be beneficial to the encyclopedia. No patience, frustration, or other emotion involved, at least on the part of "Wikipedia community".</dd>
<dd>In addition to being redundant, it's probably even wrong. Community indefinite blocks are not blocks, they are <i>bans</i> and they are covered by their own, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">banning policy</a>, as #1 method of banning a user. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 04:27, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's mentioned briefly in the banning policy, but I see no harm in mentioning it here too.

<dd>It's also mentioned in the section right above. Also, every ban is enacted by an admin blocking, so I don't understand the rest of the argument.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Undoing another admin's blocks</span></h2>
<p>I would like to reword the section called "If you disagree with a block" in order to strengthen the caution against undoing other admin's blocks without discussion. Although it's generally accepted that we shouldn't do this, it continues to happen. The section currently says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you disagree with a block placed by another admin, please contact that admin to discuss the matter. Some reasons you might want to unblock would be:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The user was blocked in violation of this policy</li>
<li>The reason for the block no longer applies</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bear in mind that blocked users commonly e-mail several admins claiming to be the victims of persecution by a biased admin. Because it is not always obvious from the blocked user's edit history what the problem was, it is a matter of courtesy and common sense to consult the blocking admin, rather than performing the unblock yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Exceptions to this would be where an unambiguous error has been made ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to change this to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you disagree with a block placed by another admin, <b>do not unblock without discussing the matter thoroughly in advance with the blocking admin</b>, and with other admins on <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> if appropriate. Blocked users commonly e-mail several admins claiming to be the victims of injustice, and because it is not always obvious from the blocked user's contributions what the problem was, it is a matter of courtesy and common sense to consult the blocking admin rather than perform the unblock yourself. Exceptions to this would be where an unambiguous error has been made (not a judgment call) and the blocking admin is not online: for example, if a user was blocked for 3RR, but there were clearly only three reverts. If you feel that such an error has been made, and the blocking admin is not available, you must notify the blocking admin on his or her talk page and the rest of the administrator community at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> that you are unblocking a blocked user before doing so.

<dd>I strongly agree with this. I'm even willing to be repetitive here. :) There are few cases where needing to undo admin actions is so urgent they can't wait until a discussion supports them. If an admin blocks under the policy no other admin should revert that without consensus to do so. If the block wasn't a good one, consensus that it was bad will quickly develop and the user can be unblocked with minimum harm. If no consensus develops, <b>it should never be reversed</b>. Reversing another admin's action is a problem, and simply following the above will eliminate it for the most part. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 12:47, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a recent attempt to deal with a real problem in the wrong policy. People making war against Wikipedia <i>outside</i> Wikipedia is one problem (perhaps real). People making life difficult (attacking, harrassment, giving personal details) for Wikipedia contributors is definately a problem. I suggest everyone who thought <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> was the right place to solve some part of that, instead concentrate on making <i>this</i> policy perfectly clear about which parts of it apply to inside Wikipedia cyberspace and which parts apply to activities outside Wikipedia cyberspace as well (beginning with "Sysops may block IP addresses or usernames that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia, <b>or pose any kind of threat to it.</b>"). <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 19:51, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be great if it could be changed, because at the moment, if we want to extend a block, we have to manually unblock, including undoing any autoblocks, and then reblock. It also means that if admin A blocks for a week, and admin B blocks again for 24 hours without checking that admin A has already blocked, it's the 24 hours that takes precedence, so that admin A's block has effectively been undone without his knowledge, and possibly without admin B intending it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The person who blocked me told me that only new user gets warnings and because I clearly knew the policy (and linked to it) I qualified for a block without a warning or notice. I know we aren't entitled to one rule break (The no rule rue) But I felt that under the Particular circumstances their are exceptions.

I was especially upset because I Defended What I defended and was done with the issue and I was blocked after the fact.</p>

<p>Unfortunately their is a difference in what the Original Wikipedian believe Wikipedia is for and what the new wave of Wikipedian believe it is for. Wikipedia has a life of it’s own. Wikipedia is to large to be strictly controlled from one man and his others. Wikipedia is a Beaurocracy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and their aren’t blanked rules.

<p>Basically I felt i was not Disrupting Wikipedia but rather one user who was massily disrupting user space while refusing to talk with users. After the fact</p>
<p>A block was not appropriate because it prevented my form resolving the issue I was blocked for. It has frustrated me enough that I no longer want to go back and redit my comment with an apology. Being silenced is a horrible feeling. I am used to having the right to speak and be heard and the obligation to listen to others.</p>
<p>Another issue is that When you block somebody the Blocker almost craves power. They will tell thou that they will unblock you iff you admint what you did was wrong. This Policy is unacceptable because then Unsisere people will lie and say they know wat they did was wrong</p>
<p>I feel one should only be blocked when there is reason to suspect they will repeat the offence. Admins shoed <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>.</p>

<p>A user was <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Netscott_blocked" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">blocked and then unblocked</a> by a second admin, partly because the user was involved in a request for mediation. I think we should have some policy/guideline on whether to unblock when the editor has a request for mediation, comment or arbitration going on, as this has come up before and will almost certainly come up again. I'm reluctant to give them a complete exemption because some editors are involved in such cases frequently and they can take a long time to resolve, so the editors may be unblockable for a significant amount of the time. Also, their behavior may be even worse if they know they won't get blocked. Instead of not blocking these editors, I suggest that the blocks be kept short, 24 or 48 hours at the most. If they are ineffective, then something else could be tried, like a temporary ban from editing certain articles. I suppose that a user could get a longterm block and respond to the RfX on his or her talk page. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 06:12, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Or we could just use our common sense, like we're already doing. In some cases blocking should be avoided. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>Requests for comments take a long time, there is no reason for any block exemption at all.</li>
<li>Arbitration also takes a long time, but actually gets a useful result. Just don't block them for more than a few days at a time.</li>
<li>Users in mediation should mostly not be blocked, other than in extreme circumstances. --<a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhroziac_d326.html" title="User:Phroziac">Phroziac</a> <i><a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhroziac_3a1f.html" title="User talk:Phroziac">♥♥♥♥</a></i> 14:37, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>These days, I tend to ask before chastising, because experience has shown that usually there are superior reasons for many rules (on Wikipedia) or laws (in real life) which seem nonsensical at first sight. I don't see any such superior reason for this one though, even after clarification, so I'll move on to chastising. :-)</p>
<p>Any set of rules must be self-consistent in order to function. I feel that this particular rule is not consistent with the Wikipedia policy -- I feel it's intrusive, arbitrary, essentially dictatorial and contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>There are two sides to my objection against this rule. First, I feel this rule is essentially patronizing the administrators ("we, the 'Wikipedia lawmakers', know that you, the administrator, might want to take a break, and we also know that blocking yourself might help you accomplish that, but we shall not allow it, because we know better"). Second, I don't think it makes sense: can Wikipedia rules also prevent me from cancelling my contract with my <a href="../../../i/s/p/ISP_a5e9.html" title="ISP">ISP</a>, should I choose that method to terminate my Wikipedia contributions? Could it prevent me from failing to pay my Internet subscription, should I file for banckrupcy? What if I chose to commit suicide, just to stop being an admin -- would you resurrect me from the dead? (Ok, that was too extreme, but you get the idea.)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Full disclosure:</i> I am not an admin on the English Wikipedia, but I am an admin on a local one. A couple of weeks ago I wasted an hour or so cleaning up vandalisms on the local Wikipedia during business hours, in my office. I was cascading from fixing one vandalism to the next, so I ended up blocking myself for a couple of hours (literally) in order to break away. I was subsequently drawn to order (rather jokingly) by another contributor to the respective Wikipedia. You can infer my feelings from my comments above.</dd>

<p>When this rule came into place there were a number of admins who were blocking themselves to enforce a wikibreak. Some of them did not realise that thier IP used a caching proxy. When they blocked themselves they blocked everyone who used the same proxy, causimg some upset!

<p>Theresa, that makes sense -- but I wast assuming this wasn't the case; after all, there is a separate provision for that situation ("<i>Sysops also should not block themselves for testing unless they have an unshared static IP because the resultant <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoblock_1669.html" title="Wikipedia:Autoblock">"autoblock"</a> may affect other users.</i>")</p>
<p>Deskana, I see you're not the first who points out the uselessness of blocking yourself.

<p>It seems that there may be an oversight in the policy. A blocked user has recently stated that, though blocked, nothing in the policy prevents him from continuing to edit using different IP addresses. If this is covered somewhere, please let me know where. If not, can we add something like the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>While blocked, a user is not permitted to edit Wikipedia. Users should not attempt to evade a block.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It might also be wise to include existing practice (extension of the block period).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">presenting evidence to support an accusation</span></h2>
<p>I got blocked by <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> for being a sockpuppet of two users I had not even heard of. The admin did not present any evidence supporting the claim nor did she or he try to contact me in advance. She or he did not leave a message on my talk page <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blocking_policy.html#How_to_block" title="Blocking policy">as the blocking policy instructs to do</a>. I looked up what the users I was accused of being identical with had edited, and there were not even similarities in the articles they focussed on with mine. I looked it up at the checkuser page. There was nothing about the two users I was accused of being a sock of. Concerning me there was a case concerning a fourth user. It was a user whose block I had protested as he was blocked for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=58286151&amp;oldid=58285999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=58286151&amp;oldid=58285999" rel="nofollow">"personal attack" that in my eyes was none</a>. The admin who blocked me had disagreed about this with me. As this was the only event when I was in contact with her or him, I had the impression of getting censored. The case was labelled "inconclusive" by a user with a comment about the two of us editing from two different European countries that were unnecessarily identified: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Dabljuh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58550133" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Dabljuh&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58550133" rel="nofollow">Best advice is: If it smells like a sock, it probably is.</a> <small>As a sidenote, it disturbs me that someone ignorant of the principle of the benefit of the doubt and with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Essjay" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Essjay" rel="nofollow">history of blocks, even for vandalism</a>, apparently nearly exclusively handles such a sensitive field as checkuser.</small><br />
I requested to be unblocked, but the blocking admin did not answer, and others told me I should email him. I could not because I already get enough spam and do not want to provide an email address. She or he did not answer my unblock request, which was removed three times by admins claiming I needed to contact him first. Unblock requests are there for cases where a user feels a block was unfair, thus they are unlikely to trust the admin who blocked them and should not be asked to contact her or him. As <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> agrees with me:<br />
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Socafan&amp;diff=58921858&amp;oldid=58921052" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Socafan&amp;diff=58921858&amp;oldid=58921052" rel="nofollow">A request for unblock is not a request to get told to email the blocking admin. The above comment by Shell Kinney is entirely inappropriate. Zocky 10:38, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</a></i><br />
So I asked another admin, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_Knott_a4ea.html" title="User:Theresa Knott">Theresa Knott</a>, who provides a link on her user page to her webpage where an email address can be found. She was very kind and replied fast and asked <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> who had blocked me. All he replied was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theresa_knott&amp;diff=58788376&amp;oldid=58556734" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theresa_knott&amp;diff=58788376&amp;oldid=58556734" rel="nofollow">this</a>, showing he actually had no evidence supporting his claim.<br />
With this experience in mind, I suggest four changes to the policies:<br />
<b>1. Blocking admins should be instructed to post verifiable evidence for the accusation against the blocked user on her or his talk page.</b><br />
<b>2. Blocking admins should be instructed to watch the talk pages of users they recently blocked to ensure they see if any protest arises.</b><br />
<b>3. Unblock requests should not be removed unless an admin can present verifiable evidence for the accusation against the blocked user - of course if the originally blocking admin already presented this and the blocked user did not counter it convincingly the request can be removed stating just this.</b><br />
<b>4. The <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">checkuser policies</a> should be enforced:</b></p>

<p>Socofan you need to shut up. You are making yourself look bad, and in fact you are also making me look bad in the process because I unblocked you. Essjay is a highly respected admin, his so called "history of blocks even for vandalism" is evidence of what exactly? Anyone who looks at that block log will see it for what it is - two joke blocks , one error block and one unblocking of the aforementioned error. Please stop making personal attacks and calm down.

<dd>You may respect him for what he did in other cases, and it is your right to do so. When he handled my case I think he violated a policy, and as you wrote him yourself he did not answer my complaint nicely. Furthermore, this is not on anyone personally but on the general policy which I believe needs to be improved. Please stop falsely claiming that I personally attack others. I do not, I just give a factual report of what happened, and in fact I find it a personal attack on me to say that I personally attack others when I do not and to tell me to shut up when I am trying to improve a polciy.

<p>For the first suggestion - we would have a problem with <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>. We need to be careful not to tell socks how not to get caught in future. However as a general principle I can agree to it, but the wording would have to be gone over very carefully. Suggestion 2 isn't really practical. When I go on recent changes patrol I sometimes block multiple vandals. Watching everyone of them's talk page for more than a few minutes isn't really on. The point of the unblock template is so that another admin can see that the blocked user want's to talk. Suggeastion 3 - hmm makes sense to me. Suggestion 4 has nothing to do with the blocking policy and so shouldn't be discussed here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 13:47, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not so sure about it, Socafan. What is meant by "verifiable evidence"? If it's check-user evidence, it can't be presented. If it's linguistic evidence, admins may not want to present it publicly. For example, if I block X because he makes exactly the same unusual spelling mistakes as Y, I'd be prepared to e-mail that evidence to another admin who queried the block, but I wouldn't be prepared to post it publicly, because I'd want X not to know how he got caught. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:03, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Remember we are only talking about having to present evidence in order to remove an unblock request, not to be able to block in the first place. in socafan's case someone removed the unblock request without so much as looking at the block reason.This needs to be discouraged. To me, the word verifyable means that it <i>can</i> be checked out - not that it is necessarily publically available for <i>anyone</i> to check out. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a></dd>

<dd>I think it's just that, if we use the word "verifiable," I can foresee endless requests for more and more information, and a refusal to accept that it had been verified, just because the blockee didn't have access to all the info, or did but refused to accept it, or pretended not to accept it. Could we soften point 3 above to something like: "Before removing an unblock request, please review the blocking admin's reason for issuing the block, or ask for details if none were offered. When you are satisfied that the block is correct, you may remove the tag." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:21, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it needs to be verifiable. If we just write "Remove the tag when you are satisfied that the block is correct" that is entirely discretionary. Verifiable does not mean the blocked guy has to be shown how he was detected, but there should be at least a link to where at the checkuser site someone wrote that the user is a sock or in a case of vandalism or 3RR or personal attack or threat or whatever where it was done or decided upon. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> 09:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I'm not worried about it being discretionary, only that admins take sufficient time to study the fact's involved before removing an unblock request. OK let's try rewording it - <i>Unblock requests should not be removed until an admin has verified the evidence for the accusation against the blocked user. Where appropriate the evidence should be presented on the user's talk page.</i> How does that sound? Socafan I know it's a watered down version of your proposal but can you live with it? It can always be tweaked later if it needs to be.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 19:52, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But then the admin can even say, hey, there is an official policy, I have looked into it, I do not regard it appropriate to present evidence, I just remove the unblock request. That would make things even worse. What is so hard about presenting a link to where abuse happened or to where in checkuser it was stated that the user is a sock? I think socks are the only possibility where it might have disadvantages to present evidence, and in this case a link to checkuser would be sufficient. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> 20:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the conversation <a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlisonW_879f.html#IP_blocking" title="User talk:AlisonW">here</a>, I believe that we should have a system in place for longer blocks of static IPs with identifiable sources from which virtually all edits are vandalism. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> has noted the presence of about 20 primary school IPs from which abundant vandalism flows whenever a block is not in place, and objects to the 1-month limit on blocking such IPs as a waste of admin time. She notes also that the IP's in question are blocked almost all the time, as they begin vandalising again as soon as the block expires. Either we need a change in policy to address this, or perhaps a notice board where IPs for which a permablock is proposed can be brought.

<dd>I dislike it that I've had to take this step as I'm certain is everyone else, but we have to look at what is sensible for Wikipedia and what leaving these IP addresses open to editing results in. We aren't stopping them reading Wikipedia, we just stopping them vandalising it. I wouldn't look to this becoming a general procedure, but we also need to recognise that one size never fits all and where many have tried again and again to get this vandalism and disruption to stop - and failed every time - we must eventually stop hitting our proverbial head against the brick wall and accept we have no better solution that a permablock. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlisonW_8a46.html" title="User:AlisonW">AlisonW</a> 23:08, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How much time does it actually waste? I suspect not that much really. Are you suggesting indefinate blocks? That seems unecessary to me. However terms are usually fixed and well known. I'd support a proposal to allow admins to block problem schools until the end of the current term. This would potentially be ~3 months max. Does this seem like an idea peaople can live with? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheresa_knott_8b13.html" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheresa_knott_ddbf.html" title="User talk:Theresa knott">Taste the Korn</a> 07:06, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Extending it to up to three months or so seems reasonable. Has anyone tried to contact the schools about the problem? Perhaps they could punish those who vandalize. Even just a specific warning about vandalizing Wikipedia might help a little bit with elementary school children. If ability becomes available, requiring those with the IP to register in order to edit might be an acceptable solution. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Exausting the community patience</span></h2>
<p>In my opinion this section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There have been situations where a user has exhausted the community's patience to the point where he or she finds themselves blocked. Administrators who block in these cases should be sure that there is community support for the block, and should note the block on WP:ANI as part of the review process. With such support, the user is considered banned and should be listed on Wikipedia:List of banned users (under "Community").</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>has some problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of defining a rule it seems just to state something that has appened and seems to say implicitly that it's OK</li>
<li>It makes no specification about what can or should be a legitimate "exaustion of patience": it seems to imply that whenever a group of users feel they have lost their patience about the behaviour of some other user (maybe after an edit war) they can be legitimate to block him</li>
<li>It makes no specification of what does it mean to have the "community support": sure it is not referring to the whole wikipedia community, so how many people are needed to make the "community support"?</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't you think that this section, as it is stated, could easily be misused? --<a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokipsy76_1c38.html" title="User:Pokipsy76">Pokipsy76</a> 13:41, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A confusing sentence</span></h2>
<p>The following sentence from the <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html#Expiry_time_and_application" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK#Expiry time and application</a> section is potentially confusing:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For instance, if an administrator blocks a user for one day, and another administrator blocks the same user for two days, then the user will remain blocked for one day, assuming that the blocks were given at the same time.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is highly unlikely that two admins block the same user <i>at the same time</i>. What does <i>at the same time</i> mean? Within less than a second of one another? What will happen if the second block is given half an hour after the first one? If a user is blocked for one day, and is blocked again for two days in an hour, will the duration still be one day or will it be two? Would the duration of the block be counted from the time of the first or the second block?</p>
<p>While I am pretty sure that a shorter block always overrides a longer one, the sentence could still stand to be clarified by someone who knows for sure.

<dd>I responded to this on your talk, but I'll respond in brief here also. Firstly, I don't see much sign of consensus on this page, not least in the amendment proposal raised further up this page. While there may have been fewer wheel wars, it also creates vastly more room for unfair blocks, by giving admins who may be too emotionally involved or just downright wrong what essentially amounts to a veto over the overturning of their block. As such, I'm making the policy actually workable. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 15:59, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's nothing to stop concerned admins discussing blocks with the blocking admin. I've only had one occasion where I asked a blocking admin to consider overturning or reducing a block where the admin has said no. Usually, people are willing to consider other viewpoints. But if an admin simply undoes a block without discussion, it serves only to get people's backs up and entrench positions, and we end up either with wheel wars or worsening working relationships and resentment. This section of the policy basically asks people to respect each other's judgment, which is a good thing. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:20, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>David, if the blocking admin isn't available, the block can be discussed on AN/I instead. The point of the passage is to stop admins from unblocking on a whim because the blocked user has emailed them or appealed on IRC. We can water it down a little if you like, but if it's diluted too much, it'll just be ignored, and having it here really has made a difference in reducing block/unblock wars. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflicts) While there are good arguments for discussing blocks first to 'get a full picture' and 'cut down on wheel-warring' I have to agree with Rebecca that there is a 'flip side' problem of admins making questionable or unjustified blocks and using this to raise a stink when they are over-turned. The wording as it was had started to stray into the territory where correcting an erroneous block was a greater 'sin' than placing one. All these stringent warnings about fully discussing and getting second opinions before reversing blocks... but not before <i>making</i> them. Obviously we should all strive for consensus, but absolute statements like, 'never undo a block unless you have first done A, B amd C', go too far. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:20, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(ec)Slim's right - we shouldn't undo blocks without discussion, even bad ones. If the blocking admin isn't around or doesn't reply promptly, there's always AN/I. Changing policy pages without first getting consensus isn't acceptable, especially in reponse to falling afoul of the page. Even an archetypically "rouge" block shouldn't be undone unilaterally - and no, IRC <b>does not count</b>, unless Brandt is logging it ;). But most importantly, don't change policy without first achieving consensus to do so. That doesn't just apply to newbies - it applies to veritable institutions like Ambi and David. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:32, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one is saying blocks can't be overturned.

What shouldn't happen is for ONE other admin to arrive and say effectively "I know better than you," particularly when thef second admin knows little or nothing about the background. That's what causes wheel wars, and this part of the policy is designed to stop it. David, the reason I restored "discuss thoroughly" is that I had one admin post her "discussion" of her unblock with me one minute before unblocking, which is obviously pointless. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:30, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Assuming good faith should extend to assuming the original admin action was good unless there is a consensus it was not. There is simply no urgent need to undo it before discussion can occur. That eliminates essentially all wheel wars and causes no problems. The one making the action isn't required to be around 24hrs a day, but they should be at least notified of the discussion. If a consensus developes without them, then go ahead with the consnensus. If not, don't. Besides, in the specific topic at hand there was consensus on this talk page to strengthen the provision, so removing that out without consensus to do so it not helpful. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 16:38, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rebecca, I don't see the reason for your objection. Supposing someone e-mailed you and asked to be unblocked. You post a note to the blocking admin and ask her to reconsider her block. She says no and gives you a list of things the blocked user has done. You still think the user deserves a chance, and so you take the case instead to AN/I. There, you either get support and you can unblock, or you get other admins giving you more information about how terrible the user is, so you have to leave the block alone. What is it exactly about this process that strikes you as unfair or unworkable? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is far too onerous to unblock, and far too easy to block. In a case where a block has been discussed at length by quite a few people, this may well make sense, but requiring a consensus to unblock that wasn't necessary to make the block in the first place is patently unfair. CBDunkerson explains well below why we need a balance between preventing stupid unblocks and preventing stupid blocks. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 17:17, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we all agree that 'unblocking willy-nilly' is bad and warnings against it should be incorporated into the policy somehow. However, there is a valid argument that things had shifted too far the other way. I've seen admins handing out and/or threatening indefinite blocks based on 'exhausting the communities patience'... to people who have <i>never</i> been blocked before and indeed haven't really done <i>anything</i> except disagree with the admin in an edit war. Getting agreement from such an admin, or even a consensus from AN/I, is often nearly impossible... and that's not the way it should work. It shouldn't be more difficult to undo a bad block than it is to place one. The wording in the policy needs to balance these two concerns. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:11, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, there were a few more respondants in <i>support</i> of the admin than opposed - though most did say they should not have placed the block themself. Hence (for Slimvirgin) my statement about the difficulty of getting consensus to undo a bad block from AN/I. Unfortunately we admins <i>do</i> have some tendency to 'stick together' against the 'regular user hordes'. Having to get a consensus to overturn a block generally means it isn't going to happen in all but the most egregious cases. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:28, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That isn't what I said. I'm not talking about community bans (this is the blocking policy, not the banning policy), and it isn't limited to the rather extreme case of an admin blocking someone they are in a content dispute with. It may be a misguided block, or it may be someone the admin simply does not like. Either way, this policy makes it far more difficult to undo a bad block than it would be to make the bad block in the first place.

<dd>Rebecca, that's what I see as good about it. Bear in mind that if there's been a clear mistake, this part of the policy doesn't apply: so if someone is blocked and there's definitely no basis for it in policy (e.g. a 3RR violation with only two reverts), anyone can unblock straightaway.</dd>

<dd>But where there's no clear mistake i.e. where the block is <i>arguably</i> correct, then surely there does have to be discussion, because otherwise I think the block is good, you overturn it, someone overturns you, and so on, because we're all using our judgment and it differs. Where the block is based on a <i>judgment call</i>, if we don't discuss, we have wheel wars. David did dilute the section a little, so it now says discuss either with the blocking admin or AN/I.

<dd>Not especially. I agree that there does have to be some discussion, but in my opinion, that should be rather proportionate to the discussion that saw the block enacted in the first place. If the block was enacted because fifteen users in good standing agreed upon that course of action, then it had better need a very damned good reason for being overturned. On the other hand, if the block was enacted because an admin was having a bad day and blocked someone themselves on rather dubious grounds, then I see little need to discuss the matter beyond informing them of the unblock. Obviously, if it looks like turning into a block war, then both sides need to stop and hash things out, but I see no reason for leaving the user blocked in the meantime. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 17:27, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But how would you know that the blocking admin had made the block for a bad reason if not by asking him? What's wrong with dropping him a note saying "User X has asked me to unblock and frankly I can't see why he was blocked in the first place. Do you object?" The admin will then give you good or bad reasons for the block. There may be things you don't know about, or maybe his reasons will be very poor. But it's going to take a bit of looking into either way. I think we have to assume good faith about other admins, rather than only assuming it about blocked users. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:31, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it doesn't rely on getting the blocking admin's <i>permission</i>. It hopes that the blocking admin can be persuaded herself to remove the block, but if not, there is always AN/I.

<dd>Define 'clear error'. The page says '3RR which isn't'... but if you follow the 3RR talk page you've seen the wildly different interpretations of what is and isn't a 3RR. Indeed, there is apparently such a dispute in the case which tripped this discussion. Is an admin blocking a user they were in a content dispute with a 'clear error'? What if the block was for posting defamatory comments about a living person... and whose judgement of 'defamatory' are we using there? Et cetera. It is almost never <i>absolutely</i> clear. Does this clause then come down to 'admin judgement'? As in, don't unblock without discussion unless in your judgement the block was in error? I'm pretty sure that isn't what you are going for... and thus the 'clear error' clause generally goes the other way - if 'anyone' would dispute it then it isn't 'clear', and it is far more difficult to remove a bad block than to make one. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:05, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is almost never absolutely clear whether a 'clear error' has occurred and the very example chosen illustrates this nicely; some people look on the 3RR as a completely mechanical rule, an "electric fence" if you will. Others see it as a flexible tool for stopping revert wars and gladly block people for violating the "spirit" of the 3RR. A person of the first school might well see a 'clear error' in a block applied by a person of the second school. More generally, it takes a lot of 'judgment' to distinguish between a 'clear error' and a 'judgment call' and we have so many admins with such a wide variety of views as to what 'good judgment' is that I think this rule is unworkable. I suggest we remove the paragraph. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 14:29, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text that was removed said (in part) "<i>If you disagree with a block, begin by discussing it with the blocking admin</i>". If a person is blocking incorrectly, you <i>need</i> to let them know what's wrong with their blocks. There might be more there than you are aware of. Talking to them reduces the probability of wheel-warring. Unblocking without attempting to discuss the reasons for the unblock is also a clear slap in the face to the blocking admin. It's a huge failure to assume good faith. It shouldn't be <i>necessary</i> to say "don't unblock without discussion" - it should be unthinkable that any responsible member of the community would unblock without discussion. Obviously people <i>are</i> willing to unblock without the courtesy of informing the blocking admin. It's a bad idea.

<dd>Guettarda, if I were to block you for 24 hours right now with a block summary of "annoying user" and just a generic 'you have been blocked' message on your talk page should another admin have to try to contact me before removing it? Should they have to get consensus on AN/I first? You're well known so that might actually be possible... but consider when it is a well-liked admin, say Karmafist back when he was very popular, against some unknown newbie... how likely are other admins going to be to say 'yeah, it should be overturned' when they don't know what is going on. It should be incumbent upon the blocking admin to make a valid case for the block in their comments in the summary and on the talk page. If they just write 'troll' and 'You reverted me so I am blocking you' I think we ought to just be able to undo the block on the spot without having to talk to the blocker or get consensus from AN/I. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 17:47, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's the slap-in-the-face factor that we need to avoid. I once spent a couple of hours going through diffs of one user I was about to block for disruption, at the same time discussing the possible block with him by e-mail to see whether we could find another way, but in the end I did block. Minutes later, another admin posted to my talk page words to the effect of: "Hi! I've unblocked X but I'm on wikibreak so I don't know anything about his case!! Hope that's okay!!" as though it was all a big joke. Turned out the blocked user had emailed a bunch of admins and had gone on IRC looking to be unblocked. That's the kind of thing that starts wheel wars, resentment, leads to admin burn-out, and makes all admins looks silly to the blocked users who pull the strings. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:47, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't disagree with you one bit - those things need to be avoided, but I don't want to see the baby thrown out with the bathwater. If you're going to unblock a user, you should at least have some idea of what is going on. If the blocking admin is around, I don't disagree it makes sense to discuss it with them - or if they are not, to let them know (and let them know your reasons for doing so). I draw the line, however, at having to do something that wasn't required to block the user in the first place.

<dd>Rebecca, you're saying there's a disparity between what's needed to block (no discussion) and what's needed to unblock (some discussion). I see your point but I'm not sure there's any way round that, and it's not an uncommon situation. It takes a traffic warden seconds to give me a parking ticket, but might take me months to get it cancelled if it was given unfairly. We don't require all parking tickets to be discussed by a court before being issued, because that would be unworkable given how many are handed out. We do require a long process to have tickets cancelled, because otherwise everyone would try it on, so it's a self-selecting process whereby only the people who have a good case proceed. Similarly, we can't ask that all blocks be discussed first on AN/I, because there are so many, but we surely <i>can</i> ask that all unblocks are discussed to some degree (I'm not suggesting Camp David-style talks, just a courteous discussion), so that only users with a good case are unblocked. Most blocks <i>are</i> issued with good cause, as are most parking tickets, and that has to be our baseline when we talk about the undoing process. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:06, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree completely with that. I take the point that it can occasionally happen that an admin blocks because he's having a bad day or something. But evidence of abuse can be dealt with by RfC or RfAr, and in extreme cases, admins can be de-sysopped. Particularly since the blocking admin may have information that other admins who encounter the blocked user through e-mail or IRC do not have, the block should not be overturned without an attempt at finding the full background. It wouldn't matter very much if it's just a standard 24-hour block for 3RR (though even in that case, an effort <i>should</i> be made to contact the blocking admin. But when it's a case of sockpuppetry, abuse, posting of personal information (which may have been deleted from the history), I would strongly discourage unblocking by someone who doesn't know the background, unless the blocking admin is offline, <i>and</i> the matter has been discussed (not just reported) at WP:ANI. I think the wording before it was changed was better, though I wouldn't be opposed to some rewording to allow for the fact that "stupid" blocks are not meant to be protected under this policy. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 18:27, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To the above, I'd like to add that there are some cases where very clear evidence is available for the "offence" that led to the the block — for example a 3RR violation, or a very nasty personal attack. However, there are other cases where the evidence is not public, and shouldn't be. One such case is sockpuppetry, where new incarnations have the same linguistic style. Put that in the block log or talk page, and they'll know what to avoid with the next account they register. Or, you can have a user who deliberately posts the real name, address, etc. of another user. On occasion when I've seen that, I've blocked instantly, and then deleted the page, and performed a selective restoration. Let's say the blocked user moans on his talk page (or in e-mails to other admins) that he didn't do anything wrong. Another admin comes along, sees the block log ("stalking"), looks at the blocked user's Special:Contributions, can't see any reason for the block, and unblocks, while I'm asleep. I would strongly oppose any wording that might result in a weakening in the policy and allow that kind of thing to happen. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 19:36, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>However, it shouldn't be the job of the other admin(s) to 'guess' why the block was placed. I think this is our best way forward. Everyone agrees that 'blind unblocks' are bad and should be discouraged, but I'd like to see more requirements that blocking admins cite the actual evidence / reasons if the block isn't something obvious... for persistent vandals you can just say that in the block summary and anyone can check their edit history to confirm it. If someone 'posted personal info which was then removed from the edit history' the block summary absolutely has to <i>say</i> that rather than something completely unhelpful like 'blocking obnoxious jackass'. Likewise for sockpuppets... just say that you have evidence of sockpuppetry which cannot be publically disclosed. If there is <i>any</i> room for dispute then the blocking admin should spell out their case in the block summary / on the user's talk page. We don't currently stress this and we should. If 'lack of knowledge by unblocking admins' is one of the primary drivers of the strong 'do not unblock' wording then a better course would be to have stronger 'explain your blocks' wording. Admins reviewing blocks shouldn't be put in the position of having to leave the user blocked because they can't get info on the case. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 19:45, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would have no objection to a wording change that stressed that block logs should give as much information as appropriate. But in the case of something like stalking or sockpuppetry, no admin should even consider unblocking without hearing what the blocking admin has to say. And tne blocking admin should never be expected to report in the block log or on the blocked user's talk page personal details about other users or details that will help a notorious puppeteer to know what to avoid next time. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><b><font size="3">♫</font></b></a> 20:19, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"There is a presumption in favor of blocks having been made in good faith.

<dd>The basic presumption of a wiki system is in favor of <i>editing</i>, not in favor of administrative action. Blocking is a departure from that presumption, and needs to be carefully justified. I suggest that if another admin reverts a block, that this means that the block was not adequately explained and justified. The blocking admin <i>must not</i> re-block, but should instead explain the situation and the justification for the block more completely, and request that it be reinstated by another. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 19:59, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bingo. It should be the responsibility of the admin <i>placing</i> the block to justify it... they are the only one who <b>CAN</b>. All this stuff about 'the reviewing admin may not have the full story' is really only the case if the blocking admin hasn't explained it. In such cases the user should not have to remain blocked or the reviewing admin 'guess' because the blocking admin didn't provide a proper explanation. Failure to adequately justify a block ought to be a clear reason to overturn in and of itself. Maybe there was a valid reason for the block... maybe there wasn't. But if the admin who placed it didn't provide one that should never be held against the blocked user. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 20:08, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. I think that the presumption is that all editors, including admins, have <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>. We also assume that when an admin blocks an editor, there is good justification for it, at least in the eyes of the blocking admin. It is typical for many blocked users to complain to other admins, and if the other admin, without knowing the full extent of the situation, reverts the block, the quick reversal causes major damage and disruption to WP. The blocked user can wait a few more hours or even days - the world won't come to and end if he/she takes a short wiki-break, justified or not. OTOH, WP will suffer greatly if a well meaning blocking admin is prematuredly reversed. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 20:18, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that admins should say why they're blocking, but most do, either in the block log or on the blocked user's talk page, or on AN/I. What we're talking about here is where another admin wants to question whether the reason is good enough, and that's fine, questioning is good, but what isn't good is just overturning it, thereby substituting your own judgment for the blocking admin's, who almost certainly knows more about the situation. That's all we're talking about here. No one's saying one admin has a veto; no one's saying blocks shouldn't be questioned; no one's saying blocking admins shouldn't have to give reasons for their blocks.

<dd>Can you think of a case where a blocking admin fully explained the reasons for a clearly valid block and was reverted anyway? It seems an unlikely situation. That leaves invalid blocks (should be over-turned), poorly explained valid blocks (ideally should be upheld, but should not be <i>reviewer's</i> responsibility to differentiate from the previous), and issues where there is a disagreement in policy interpretation or personal judgement. It is this last category where 'discussion' comes into play, but I still don't think 'retain the block' should be the default. You speak of the possible 'slap in the face' to the blocking admin... but what of the 'slap in the face' they may have given to the person they blocked? Yes, over-turning another admin's block is placing your judgement over theirs... but sometimes we absolutely <i>should</i> do that. For instance, in cases where the blocking admin was involved in a dispute with the user. Or where the admin has been being incivil / making personal attacks. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 21:42, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On "assuming good faith"</span></h2>
<p>It's been argued above that when an admin places a block, that others should "assume good faith", by which is meant, assume that there was a valid and policy-supported reason for the block, <i>even if</i> the blocking admin does not state one. I think this position stretches "assume good faith" well beyond its reasonable limits.</p>
<p>"Assume good faith" means to assume that other editors are not acting out of malice. It means assuming that their intentions are good; that regardless of what weird or seemingly erroneous thing we may see them doing, that they are trying to improve the encyclopedia. It means that when we see an editor do something seemingly bizarre, we should try to interpret it as an experiment, a well-intentioned mistake, a difference of opinion, or something else innocent rather than jumping to the conclusion that it is vandalism.</p>
<p><b>"Assume good faith" never means "assume correctness."</b> For instance, if we see someone insert an erroneous claim into an article, AGF means we shouldn't assume they are vandalizing it; they probably are well-intentioned but making a mistake. We are within proper behavior to <i>revert the error</i>, giving our reason for doing so. AGF doesn't mean don't fix the article; AGF means we don't need to report the error-inserter as a vandal.</p>
<p>The interpretation of AGF that has been argued above is an "assume correctness" interpretation, and even more than that. It tells us that we should assume that a blocking admin has acted in a way which is correct, unbiased, and supported by policy, even in the absence of any stated argument to support that claim. I suggest that this interpretation has no legs to stand on. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 21:11, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As one of the people who raised the point, I would like to say that I did not seek to conflate "assume good faith" with "assume correctness". By requiring that you should (in most cases) talk before unblocking, it assumes that the original blocker did not place the block maliciously, and thus probably has a good point for blocking. <i>Thus</i>, you owe them the courtesy of engaging them before undoing the block. To undo their block without explanation is rude. It also amounts to an assumption of bad faith because it assumes that the blocking admin made the block maliciously. If someone has made a mistake, you talk to them and try to point out the error. That's even true if their reason for blocking is clearly in error (like a 3rr vio in which one of the alleged reverts was clearly not a revert) - if you believe that the admin blocked in good faith <i>but was wrong</i> you let them know, <i>with the hope that they will be more careful in the future</i>. Undoing a block without explaining it to the unblocking admin amounts to saying <i>you were wrong to block, and I don't believe that you are capable or willing to learn from your error</i>.</dd>

<dd>IMO because the admin <i>represents</i> WP. As such he/she is entitled to block at his/her discretion.

<dd>Admins absolutely do not 'represent' WP. They are <i>supposed</i> to have no more 'authority' than any other user. One of the problems with 'block at whim / unblock only with consensus' is that it abrogates that fundamental principle of the "WP system". When a user edits an article we do not require other editors to discuss before undoing or changing that edit if they disagree with it. They make their change and explain their reasons. Should be the same for admin actions. Edit or wheel warring from that point forward is a separate issue. There should be no 'whoever strikes first gets precedence'. At that, even if admins <i>did</i> represent WP... that would be true of the unblocking admin as well. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 21:52, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the AGF in the case of a block is different than a well intentioned edit that is overtly questionable. In the case of a block, it is the entire WP system that stands, temporarily, behind it. It is no longer just a (possibly trigger happy) admin - it is the organization. As such, it should be viewed with respect and reversed only upon careful consideration and discussion, if at all possible with the blocking admin him/herself. There is no urgent rush to undo it - as I noted, the world won't stop, there will be no irreparable harm to wait a day or two. OTOH, if we quickly undo a block we undermine the entire WP infrastructure - we create a bad impression and ill feelings all around, and we can potentially lose a good admin. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:34, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, the problem is in your definition of "unambiguous errors". I recently encountered a block that I consider an unambiguous error with no room for question whatsoever... yet more than a dozen other admins have said it was justified except for a possible minor procedural issue. The phrase is essentially meaningless. If it was entirely "unambiguous" the blocking admin would very seldom have blocked in the first place. And when you say 'discussion' does 'I am going to unblock because XYZ' qualify or do you have to get consensus? How long are you supposed to wait? I think every admin who undoes a block should place an explanation on the blocking admin's talk page... but I don't think they should need to do more than that unless they don't feel they have a solid understanding of the reasons behind the block. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:01, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An unambiguous error is one that everyone would agree was an error, where the blocking admin wouldn't have made the block had they realized they'd made the mistake e.g. miscounting the number of reverts in a 3RR report.</dd>
<dd>As for how long you have to discuss, you should be aiming to persuade the blocking admin of your views, but you might not succeed.

<dd>(outdent) I think that it is wrong to compare the reversion standards of <i>edits</i> to <i>blocks</i>. In the case of an edit, it is normally an issue of content, and it is WP's theory that by constant back-and-forth tweaking by multiple editors we'll eventually converge on a properly balanced article. In the case of a block the situation is very different. Here we have a case of an individual who was found to be disruptive (say) in the eyes of a presumed competent admin. Once that determination was made, it should not be undone in a rush, as it will disrupt the overall WP infrastructure. A block can and should be reviewed and either confirmed or reversed, but not on whim, rather via a careful due process mechanism, where the blocking admin is given a chance to defend and explain his/her rationale. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:30, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The unblocking admin is also presumably competent and not acting in a rush. Look at it this way... admin A reviews a situation thoroughly, determines that no block is warranted, and posts a detailed explanation of why. Admin B then comes across the issue, does not review it at all, and places a week long block immediately. Admins placing blocks don't have any 'special wisdom' over other admins in that moment of blocking. They are just as subject to fault as any other admin and their actions should not be more sacrosanct because it is a block... indeed, given the potentially disruptive nature of unjustified blocks they should be subject to review and reversal as needed. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:52, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with your example of A and B. I think that unless B has new information, then A should not be overridden, assuming A's reasons are well explained somewhere. But once a block is made, it should not be reversed without due process. Wheel warring looks like a childish food fight among the <i>teachers</i> to the outside world and to most other non-admin editors. There should be a clear and careful process of block reversal that should include a chance for the blocking admin to explain the rationale. Anything else will undermine the overall WP project. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:08, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'Whoever strikes first gets precedence' looks much more childish to the outside world. If the admins don't want to appear childish they can just try to get consensus on a block <b>before</b> doing it, as it happens in the wikipedia's of other languages. It must be up to the blocking admin to create a situation where he can't be corrected by other one, not on the other admin to accept his behaviour just becouse he came first or because they must give an idea of authority. This latter behaviour is definitaly the most childish one.--<a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokipsy76_1c38.html" title="User:Pokipsy76">Pokipsy76</a> 08:12, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is not an issue of 'whoever strikes first' but 'whoever starts the machine'. The 'machine' in this case is the WP formal censorship process, that temporarily prevents one editor, found disruptive in the eyes of (at least) one community vetted and elected admin, i.e a formal WP community representative, from editing. Once that step occurs, <i>for whatever reason</i>, it must be allowed to run its course via due process. That due process must include an opportunity for the blocking admin to fully explain his/her rationale if it is questioned. Simply reversing the block like a typical edit war over article content is <i>unacceptable</i>. If the block was not fully justified, it will be reversed in due course, and the blocked editor will simply have to endure a short wiki-break while things are sorted out. OTOH, if the block is too quickly reversed, that is a start of a wheel war, which is disruptive, destructive and must be avoided at all reasonable costs if we are to succeed as a project. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 13:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>3) If you really want to avoid wheel war at any cost you have an easy way: just require for a block to be supported by a votation or by consensus (that is the way other wikipedia's do). Wouldn't it be a "reasonable cost"?</dd>

<dd>From my time here, it's very rare that a user is blocked without reason. Sometimes other users may disagree with the blocking admin's reasons, but it's not as if users are being blocked "on a whim" without any review.

<dd>Ah, but that way lies wheel wars. Reversing an admin action should be the result of discussion, not the opinion of a single admin. So why not require the original blocking admin to discuss any block first? It would unworkable. Blocks are most often made quickly and with strong justification.

<dd>Hey, hey, we don't need to make this personal. ;) I was trying to provide some perspective to this issue. Only a small percentage of blocks are even remotely controversial. Yes, occasionally an admin will use less than ideal judgement in blocking. That's a situation for discussion, not an immediate unblock. The assumption should be that the blocking admin had good reason to block. Thus, an unblock without fully investigating and discussing would be inappropriate. Should an admin have a habit of using poor judgement for blocks, that's a matter for the ArbCom. <a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAren%27t_I_Obscure__6bd1.html" title="User:Aren't I Obscure?">Aren't I Obscure?</a> 14:53, 9 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Nothing personal. If it is so rare to have a controversial block why are you so afraid about wheel wars? If an unblock is likely to occur that mean that the judjement for the block are not so clear cut. I don't agree with a blind assumption on good reason for the block. The blocking admin who thinks the block could be reverted by people without appropriate information can provide the relevant informations when doing the block. What's the problem? If the block is "clear cut" he will not need to write too much.--<a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokipsy76_1c38.html" title="User:Pokipsy76">Pokipsy76</a> 15:09, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>'Unfair behavior to an editor', in the sense that he/she were blocked for a couple of days, while there was a belief by at least one competent elected community representative (admin) that the editor was distruptive and deserved the enforced wiki-break, is not disruptive, or destructive. Any reasonable person knows that sometimes mistakes happen, and waiting a couple of days off-wiki to have them sorted out is no biggie and will not threaten WP in any way.</li>
<li>It is most reasonable to expect a reasonable person to understand that mistakes can happen, assuming the person is totally innocent and it was all a silly misunderstanding.</li>
<li>The reason we allow an admin to block is to <i>temporarily</i> stop one user from editing. That assumes that within a couple of days other admins can review the block and reverse them <i>with due process</i> if needed. Requiring a consensus process just to block would be impractical, as there are times where a block is needed quickly and most blocks are very clear-cut.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I think for a reasonable user/editor, taking a short wiki-break once in a blue moon is not a big deal. Editing WP is not like breathing (although some would probably disagree with that). If you really think you were unjustly blocked, you reach another admin via email, who then finds out the real deal by, among other actions, discussing the block with the blocking admin. A couple of days tops, and the innocent editor is re-instated, no big deal (and IMO it would be extremely rare for a perfectly civil, guidelineline/policy adhering and rational person to be ever blocked by <i>any</i> admin). OTOH, for a blocking admin to be reversed too quickly, and without due process, it would start a wheel war, would look extremely ugly to the outside world, and would disrupt and over time destroy WP as a whole. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 14:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Irpen's summary in your reference. I also think that if an editor is mistakenly blocked (e.g. in a rush by an admin who issues multi-blocks), even for a couple of days, all he/she would really want upon re-instatement is a duly-issued, sincere and heartfelt apology from the blocking admin. That really seems to be missing. Yes, I agree that WP is the totality of its editors, not its admins, but the admins serve a vital and critical role to keep the machine running smoothly (as well as contribute personally of course). The blocking admins must block only when it is absolutely necessary in their judgment to stop further abuse, not as punishment, and must be ready of course to defend their actions. OTOH, once the block has started, it should never be reversed without discussion with the blocking admin. The hurt to the innocently blocked editor will not change that much if the block takes 2 days instead of 2 hours - it's the principle (e.g. of false accusation) that counts. I suspect many editors would prefer a 2 day block with a duly issued and sincere apology at the end to a 2 hour block with no apology at all (remember the block always has a declared reason - no apology perpetuates that reason at least by the blocking admin). A block is a formal procedure that is not a whim - it must be started as well as continued to its due course judiciously and carefully, with due process. A quick reversal with no consultation with the blocking admin is bad all around. We all want our valuable editors to keep contributing, but we must have a stable and respectable infrastructure for them to operate in. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 15:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This has reduced my wikistress significantly, since I can now step away from my computer after performing an admin action with a clean conscience, safe in the knowledge that if I happened to screw up, someone else can fix it even if I don't constantly monitor my talk page and e-mail.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn't help if I'm the one who spots what seems like a mistake by another admin. I haven't stumbled across any mistaken blocks yet, but I did once try to contact another admin about a mistaken copyvio claim; it took me two weeks (after two talk page messages and one e-mail) to get a response. Since then, I've generally followed the rule that, if I don't get any response from the other admin within a week, I assume they're away or not interested, go ahead with the revert and leave them a polite note explaining what I did and why. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> <small>(<a href="../../../i/l/m/User_talk%7EIlmari_Karonen_f3b7.html" title="User talk:Ilmari Karonen">talk</a>)</small> 17:38, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you would like to know when the block will expire, please search for your name or IP on the <a href="../../../i/p/b/Special%7EIpblocklist_2536.html" title="Special:Ipblocklist">block list</a>.</p>
<p>If the reason given is "username", "user...", or "contact an administrator for verification purposes", then you or someone with whom you share an IP address has most likely been blocked for choosing an inappropriate or suspicious username. Please read our <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">username policy</a> for more information. If you do not feel that the name is inappropriate, or if the name was registered by somebody other than yourself, please contact the blocking administrator, as described below.</p>

<p>Sometimes IP ranges or shared proxies are blocked from editing Wikipedia. This means that innocent people sometimes can't edit. If this is the case, it should be explained in the reason given above.</p>
<p>Also, some individual dynamic IP addresses may be blocked, usually for 15 minutes to 3 hours. Occasionally, users with dynamic IPs will be blocked accidentally, due to that fact that their present IP was previously used by a blocked user.</p>
<p>We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. If this problem affects you repeatedly, and you would like to help us resolve this issue, you will need to contact a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia administrator</a> and your <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_service_provider.html" title="Internet service provider">internet service provider</a> (ISP). The administrator should be able to obtain the time, date, and IP address used for the inappropriate behaviour in question, and describe what the problem was. You can then pass this information on to your ISP, explaining that you are unable to edit Wikipedia due to the inappropriate actions of another person using this ISP, and ask them to remedy the problem.</p>

<p>You can either wait for the block to expire, or contact $1 to resolve the problem that led to the block.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact $1, you may do so via <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_%244_87ac.html" title="Special:Emailuser/$4">email</a>, or by adding "{{<a href="../../../u/n/b/Template%7EUnblock_0164.html" title="Template:Unblock">unblock</a>}}" to <a href="../../../m/y/t/Special%7EMytalk_b474.html" title="Special:Mytalk">your user talk page</a> (which you can edit even while blocked, unless it is protected) to request unblocking.</p>
<p>If after discussing the matter with $1 you believe the block is unfair, you may <a href="../../../a/p/p/Wikipedia%7EAppealing_a_block_17a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Appealing a block">appeal the block</a>. You will need to know:</p>

<li>The reason you were blocked, which is:</li>
