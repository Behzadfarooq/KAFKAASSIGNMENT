<p><i>If you mean underage drivers as in people who aren't old enough to drive this seems odd - like shooting somebody and being charged for excessive noise. Do you mean that drivers below the drinking age have a lower limit (i.e. effectively no alcohol, because they're not supposed to be drinking?</i></p>
<p><br />
Oddly, underage refers not to driving before the legal age, but drinking before the legal age. Alcohol purchase and posession laws would seem to preclude "underage drinking" and therefore "underage drunken driving."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, underage drinking isn't illegal, underage purchase and possession is. There's nothing illegal in the US about giving 14-year-olds wine with dinner.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, states pass laws limiting <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_alcohol_content.html" title="Blood alcohol content">BAC</a> for underage drunken drivers above 0.0% (often at 0.08%). Perhaps this is a commetary on the legal system's opinion of the baseline capacity of teen drivers.... Less alcohol need be present to define an underage drunken driver as too impared to drive. --BrantEaton</p>
<p>I see what you're getting at, but the phrase underage drunken driving suggests there's a legal age for drunken driving.&#160;:) <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerloren_4ad8.html" title="User:Verloren">Verloren</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, my hair-splitting implements are all dull from too frequent use&#160;:) I'm sure the actual statute utilizes excruciatingly clear language&#160;:) I think we'll have to be satisifed that "underage" modifies the phrase "drunken driving," qualifying the activity by considering age. Personal perspective notwithstanding, no explicit suggestion exists indicating inebriated handling of a vehicle is permissible if the operator is above a minimum age. --BrantEaton</dd>

<p>On <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Wikipedia:Peer review</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> expressed POV concerns about the following paragraph (written by him (?)).</p>
<p>"Despite the liberal intoxication limits of many countries, one should not assume that driving with a BAC rating of, say, .079% is safe. At a BAC rating of 0.05%, the probability of a driver having an accident is more than four times its base level. Despite this, some drivers believe their driving actually improves with small amounts of alcohol. This assertion is completely false: Their perception of their driving improves because they are more relaxed, but their actual motor competence is markedly lower than when sober. "</p>
<p>In responding to this concern, I would say: cite your sources, e.g. "Research by Dr. T. Totaller found that a BAC level of 0.05% quadrupled the probability of a driving accident (see references)." I don't think the above paragraph is demonstrates a particularly strong bias, but if anyone does happen to think that, reporting the claims of experts is the way to go.</p>
<p>In terms of giving advice, simply reporting the fact that intoxication increases the odds of an accident is providing information, but not giving advice. If we wrote, "So don't drink and drive, knucklehead," that would be giving advice&#160;;-). -- <a href="../../../c/y/a/User%7ECyan_b70d.html" title="User:Cyan">Cyan</a> 02:25, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I saw this come up on peer review as well. I second Cyan's comments above.</p>
<p>But what I do think would really make this article more approachable is if it used the statitics to show how much a person could drink in the USA and still drive, and how much is believed the affect someone's ability to drive. Eg (with made up figures) "Under American law, an average person may drive after consuming 3 pints of beer (6 units of alcohol), however studies x and y show that the average person's ability to drive is affected after only half a pint of beer (one unit)."</p>
<p>Then, once people have a sense of the amounts involved, you can go on to give the detailed explanation why it's the blood alcohol content which is measured not the number of drinks you've had, and you can't rely on these "average" figures. It might also be interesting to include information on what level of alcohol in the blood is usually fatal, and the highest recorded cases of people exceeding this and survivng (alcoholics may build up a tolerance). Eg <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3335019.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3335019.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabiform_a7bf.html" title="User:Fabiform">fabiform</a> | <a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabiform_a651.html" title="User talk:Fabiform">talk</a> 23:05, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Maybe the political background for setting a limit should be mentioned. I suspect that the numbers reflect the culture; is alcohol considered "A Bad Thing" (Sweden), are people allowed to take their own responsibility, is a risk acceptable?</p>
<p>I believe that Sweden has a max of 0.02%, not 0%. A limit below 0.02% would mean that driving after eating a piece of ripe fruit constitutes a traffic violation if you're unlucky.</p>
<p>How much alcohol is 'one drink' in milliliters of pure ethanol? Standard sizes of glasses vary wildly between countries. -- <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHankwang_1955.html" title="User:Hankwang">Hankwang</a> 16:38, 17 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted gender -&gt; sex, which is indeed correct. Sex is biological, whereas gender is personal identity.

<hr />
<p>Nice article, a few corrections</p>
<p>1 BAC is literally blood alcohol content, not breath alcohol content. The Breathalyzer simply estimates BAC after measuring breath alcohol.</p>
<p>2 Old version Measured with a machine commonly referred to as a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breathalyzer.html" title="Breathalyzer">Breathalyzer</a> ... BAC is used as an ideally objective (and therefore, legally uncontestable) measure of the level of impairment of an individual,</p>
<p>I changed it because it is literally false. BAC is used as an objective legal proxy for degree of intoxication, which in turn is only a rough guide to degree of impairment. In other words, to enforce the law, the law must be based on something fairly objective and harder to contest (like BAC) rather than something hard to measure objectively (impairment of driving judgement and skill). I think the writer has the right concept but expressed it wrongly.</p>
<p>3 Old version Despite this, some drivers believe their driving actually improves with small amounts of alcohol. This assertion is completely false: their perception of their driving improves because they are more relaxed, but their actual motor competence is markedly lower than when sober.</p>
<p>I changed it because it is again literally false. The perception of his own driving skill deteriorates in accuracy and quality, not improves (in other words the gap between the reality of his skills and his perception of his skills increases). Again, right concept expressed awkwardly.</p>

<dd>Whoops. Sorry. I meant to say, with that bit (#3), that their <i>perceived level of competence</i> at driving improves; their actual <i>skills of perception</i> decline, as you said. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 19:54, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Our article says that BAC is measured as a percentage by volume, but all the sources I can find on the Web, e.g. <a href="http://www.icap.org/publications/report11.html" class="external text" title="http://www.icap.org/publications/report11.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3611173.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3611173.stm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, say it's measured in milligrams per millilitre (mg/ml) or per hundred millilitres (mg/100ml). However, there are many other writers out there who state BAC as a percentage without saying what it's a percentage of. This distinction matters: since the relative density of ethanol is 0.789 (<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol.html" title="Ethanol">Wikipedia</a>) and that of blood is about 1.06 <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/text_761578429___2/Blood.html" class="external text" title="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/text_761578429___2/Blood.html" rel="nofollow">(MSN Encarta)</a>, the %-by-volume definition is about one-third drunker than the mg/ml definition.</p>

<li>I'm not sure how to answer, but despite the fact that ml is not a weight measure, like mg, that's how the California code is written, at least: "(b) It is unlawful for any person who has 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle. For purposes of this article and Section 34501.16, percent, by weight, of alcohol in a person's blood is based upon grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath."<a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc23152.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc23152.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Seems kinda goofy to calculate based on different types of measures, but I guess it's not really a percentage (at least not "by weight"), despite what they say. I wonder if the discrepancy could be used to challenge a conviction. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 01:40, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>This seems somewhat POV to me, at least in tone. It sounds like someone from MADD wrote this, especially the italicized "four times." I think it should be tweaked or at least footnoted with some solid sources.</p>

<p>In the table that lists the number of alcoholic beverages and its affects, what unit of time would that go under? Within a day? Within an hour? I mean, five drinks in a stretched amount of time doesn't have the same affect is it does within a shorter time period.</p>
<p>I agree, the table says:</p>
<p>12 Drinks=.30-.40% BAC=Loss of consciousness</p>
<p>I'd like to see good solid evidence of this, a BAC of .3 to .4 can cause a loss of consciousness, but only 12 drinks to get there is a little extreme. I'm 6' and weigh 272lb, 250lb when training. During a Sunday football game, I used to consume about a 12-pack, since their is usually a double header, I might end up drinking 24 beers. If what the chart says is correct, then by the end of the first game, I should have had a BAC of .30 and be out. The highest my BAC ever has been was .45, after drinking an entire bottle of Jack Daniels. As a recovering alcoholic, I have a little experience here. Maybe there should be a time on the chart as well. -cplradar</p>

I think it'd better to have an expanded table between the typical BAC and its affects; I found this site that describes several levels and a fairly detailed explainations <a href="http://www.brad21.org/effects_at_specific_bac.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brad21.org/effects_at_specific_bac.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>As discussed in this page, there are several units for BAC. Could we please either tidy up the usage of units through the article, or better, fully state the units at every usage. For instance. The section "Effect at different levels" gives no units other that "%". Although the units section does say that just "%" on its own means % w/w, g/100g isn't the only one measured in %, and since the difference between the % units is a power of 10, it can be quite confusing. It also standard that if you use a %, you state whether you mean w/w, w/v, or v/v.</p>
<p>If nothing else, can we change it from saying something like "0.50%" in every row to "0.5" in the row and adding "% (g/100g)" or "% w/w" to the column header cell.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that since ICAP uses mg/ml as a standard unit, that should be the unit used whenever possible through the article. Here's an example ICAP report. The units through it are mg/ml as seen in the table of BAC's legal to drive in different countries. <a href="http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/ICAP_Reports_English/report11.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/ICAP_Reports_English/report11.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icap.org/portals/0/download/all_pdfs/ICAP_Reports_English/report11.pdf</a> --KX36 12:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I came to wikipedia looking to see if BAC is precisely correlated with intoxication level; i.e., that if someone's BAC is higher than it should be due to taking a drug that slows ingestion as mentioned in the article, resulting in a higher BAC, has the drug actually caused greater intoxication (impairment of motor skills, etc.)? Or has the drug simply elevated the BAC but the person is no more affected by the alcohol than if he had not taken the medication?</p>
<p>Some info would help clarify. 71.162.92.26 02:59, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
