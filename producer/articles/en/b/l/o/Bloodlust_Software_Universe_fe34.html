	    <p>Created by Ethan Petty and <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icer_Addis_d25d.html" title="Icer Addis">Icer Addis</a>, the <b>Bloodlust Software Universe</b> is the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">fictional</a> shared setting where all of the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_games.html" title="Video games">video games</a> published by <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodlust_Software_d3c0.html" title="Bloodlust Software">Bloodlust Software</a> take place. Since most of the characters in the universe have a knowledge of each other, each game should not be considered its own universe, but instead adds to the lore of the universe itself. In fact, many characters in the universe such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal_Ed_Bujone_f4e1.html" title="Cannibal Ed Bujone">Cannibal Ed Bujone</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillotine_%28Bloodlust_Software_Universe%29_61ac.html" title="Guillotine (Bloodlust Software Universe)">Guillotine</a>, and Buddy Tardinski have appeared in various games, settings, and situations. Exceptions to this rule include O' Sirus the Snip whose adventures have yet to take him outside of the Goblin Realm.</p>
<p>The Bloodlust Software Universe is one of the few (if not the only) fictional universes that includes major plotlines involving the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentally_retarded.html" title="Mentally retarded">mentally retarded</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midgets.html" title="Midgets">midgets</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibalism.html" title="Cannibalism">cannibalism</a>, and nearly <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aborted.html" title="Aborted">aborted</a> babies. Couple this with excessive <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gore.html" title="Gore">gore</a> and the end result is an exaggerated, tongue-in-cheek reflection of our own reality.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a> was introduced to the universe in <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeslaughter.html" title="Timeslaughter">Timeslaughter</a>. Due to this addition no one in the universe can ever truly be considered dead, even though a few of the characters have tasted death via natural or unnatural means.</p>
<p>Influences of the Bloodlust Software Universe include, but are not limited to: <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troma.html" title="Troma">Troma</a> films, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fight_ea44.html" title="Final Fight">Final Fight</a>, <a href="../../../g/w/a/GWAR_9568.html" title="GWAR">GWAR</a>, and the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellraiser.html" title="Hellraiser">Hellraiser</a> series.</p>

<li>About Almost Man</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When Cannibal Ed began experimenting with Atomic Food products one of his first attempts lead to near-mutant perfection: the Almost Man. Looking on the surface to be completely human his foes are taken by surprise when he attacks with superhuman strength and speed. Subsequent efforts to duplicate this success would fail, leading Ed to create the mutant horde that would become his army.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Trivia</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Though mutant by nature, Almost Man doesn't seem to possess any "mutant powers". Instead, he attacks with more traditional weapons: a platinum boomerang, spiked brass knuckles, and sheer brute force.</dd>

<ul>
<li>About Cannibal Ed Bujone</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Ed Bujone was born to <a href="../../../c/a/j/Cajun.html" title="Cajun">Cajun</a> parents deep in the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> swamps. His father was the first to teach him about the art of cooking, but Ed's need for new ingredients caused him to experiment with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibalism.html" title="Cannibalism">cannibalism</a>. After about a decade, Ed had perfected his greatest meal: all-you-can-eat-chili. Ed's fast food chains quickly grew in popularity, and eventually Ed was able to fund the Atomic Foods Corporation with the profits. Nobody realized the two main ingredients in atomic foods were human meat and toxic waste until the public began to mutate into hideous mind-controlled mutants. The government sent out Government Project: Executioners (Guillotine and Reaper to bring down Ed's many branches of Atomic Foods, and eventually Ed had to explode himself (and his company) to destroy them. This was not the end of the fast-food führer - Ed was wearing his explosion-proof apron, and was able to survive the blast. His revenge on the Executioners took place in a French restaurant - he ambushed them and cut them into tiny pieces. Ed is now hiding from Stumpy and the Great Midget Rebellion (who want him for midget slavery and founding the Nationwide Midget Emporium), Unther &amp; Renthor and the New Mutant Army (who want him for abandoning them after the atomic foods incident), and from the Executioners. It is rumored that Ed is now in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> studying the art of human sushi...</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Trivia</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Cannibal Ed was originally created in Ethan Petty's elementary school as a way to pass time. He would draw large, detailed plans for Ed's machines - often involving conveyor belts with humans on them being fed through grinders and ejected through meat pumps (onto hamburgers). Of course, the top level of the plan always looked like an innocent burger restaurant.</dd>
<dd>The all-you-can-eat chili phrase was first spoken by a Cajun employee at a real fast food chain who would not let the founders of Bloodlust order the food they wanted. She kept telling them they needed the AYCEC badly, and that they looked like "growing chili boys."</dd>
<dd>The many branches of Ed's Atomic Food Products can be seen in Executioners - you can see Ed himself running many of the stores in the background, and in Timeslaughter, you'll see graffiti telling you to "Eat at Ed's."</dd>

<li>About The Chicken Monster</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Appearing to be male in some ways and female in others, the Chicken Monster is a thing of grotesque beauty. The true origin of this beast is unknown, but it is assumed to be result of Cannibal Ed's mutated food supply. (Too much Atomic Fried Chicken, perhaps?) It is also unknown if more Chicken Monsters exist or this specimen was a fluke in mutant evolution. Despite its large size the Chicken Monster is extremely agile and can leap to extraordinary heights.</dd>
<dd>A true narcissist, The Chicken Monster spends most of its time at the beach showing off its "hot" body.</dd>

<li>About the Clobbers and the Slobbers</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When Cannibal Ed caught wind that the Executioners had made the Atomic Foods Corporation their next target he hired some extra protection in the form of the biggest and dumbest thugs he could find: The Clobber Twins and The Slobber Twins. Originally rival tag teams in the Atomic Wresting Federation the money Ed offered them was enough to set aside their differences and focus on pounding someone new -- Reaper and Guillotine. Ed soon found out that his money was well spent; no matter how many times these guys are put down they keep coming back for more punishment.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Trivia</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Before they made the jump to the GWF, Hammer and Nails managed to defeat all four of the Slobber/Clobber twins in a triple-threat-losers-retire-tag-team-cage-match, making the money Ed presented them hard to resist.</dd>
<dd>During their time in the AWF both sets of twins perfected the dropkick reversal. It’s useless to jump towards them!</dd>
<dd>The Clobbers and The Slobbers are only non-mutants enlisted in Ed's army.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Dogs O' War are the cutest members of midgetkind. But that's one of their best tricks - these little guys are ravenous. Originally, the Dogs O' War were created by Cannibal Ed to fight in the Atomic Foods army. When the Executioners defeated <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal_Ed_Bujone_f4e1.html" title="Cannibal Ed Bujone">Ed</a>, the Dogs went looking for a new master. Stumpy, leader of the Great Midget Rebellion, quickly adopted them into his group. While they are still treated like pets by the other midgets, they are subjected to much better living conditions than they were at Ed's Nationwide Midget Emporium. It is rumored that Stumpy is using William (Portal) Spade's dimensional travel technology to summon the Dogs O' War in mid-combat.</dd>

<dd>Dogs O' War would make this high pitch screaming noise in <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executioners.html" title="Executioners">Executioners</a> that drove cats crazy.

<ul>
<li>About Drag Hags</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When Cannibal Ed was designing his enforcer mutants, he carefully planned which animals would mix the most effectively with humans. He didn't take into consideration the dangers of mixing a male human with a female fox. The result was an army of Drag Hags - dangerous womanly men with <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slut.html" title="Slut">slutty</a> women's wardrobes and bushy tails. They're only 10% woman, but they are definitely 90% bitch. After the Executioners destroyed Atomic Foods, most of the Drag Hags went on the join <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_band.html" title="Boy band">boy bands</a> (they can easily pass for girly men), and one particularly successful Drag Hag went on to become a sissy white-boy rapper with a #1 Hit, "Forgot about Ed".</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Trivia</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Drag Hags were originally supposed to be women, but due to lack of art skill at the time they were dubbed <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drag_queen.html" title="Drag queen">drag queens</a>.</dd>

<p>Fishmen were a step above the normal enforcer mutant breed of Cannibal Ed's army. They didn't care about any of their brethren; they just ran in and destroyed anything that moved. The Fishmen are incredibly agile, and their arms end in long, sharp fins (less evolved Fishmen still have a few fingers). Don't let the fact that they look like seafood throw you off, these guys are just as dangerous above water as below it. Cannibal Ed was the only person who could convince the Fishmen to work towards his cause, and now that he's missing they have become extremely dangerous. Unther and Renthor employ them in the New Mutant Army, but keep them chained up until the battle starts. Like hand grenades, they are unlocked and thrown towards the enemy while the NMA runs for cover.</p>

<dd>Fishmen are a race of "men" that live under the sea but they can also come on land for a while but not too long. They come up to feed on small children and small mammals. They live for approx.7 years. They come in a variation of different colours including blue, red , green , pink and indigo. They can often be seen at night whilst hunting for prey they are quite shy and will run if approached although it has been known for some to attack and even Kill!</dd>
<dd>The fishmen are well educated and can speak 7 different languages and perform advanced calculations beyond the means of man they have invented many things such as computers, various weapons and the cat they have also been known to work for Microsoft developing software.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Best described as an almost legally retarded, axe-loving cyborg wearing a skull mask, Guillotine is part of Government Project: Executioners. In <i>Executioners</i> he and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reaper_%28Bloodlust_Software_Universe%29_57d4.html" title="Reaper (Bloodlust Software Universe)">Reaper</a> took on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal_Ed_Bujone_f4e1.html" title="Cannibal Ed Bujone">Cannibal Ed</a> and an army of mutants and midgets in an all out war against the Atomic Food Corporation.</dd>
<dd>Guillotine's appearance has changed quite a bit from game to game, but that can best be attributed to the many upgrades the government has given him over the years. Since he is a cyborg he can be considered immortal and is known to still be alive in the year 3000.</dd>
<dd>When Guillotine isn't on a mission for the government he enjoys performing do-it-yourself amputations and is quite active in the fight to preserve the world's rainforests.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Hemogoblins were the smartest of Cannibal Ed's enforcer mutants. Curiously, they don't seem to protect their superior brains very well - in fact they stretch their long, muscled necks to ram their skulls into the enemy. The Hemogoblin has a shell-like skin, usually colored blood red, hence their nickname. The Executioners were able to wipe out most of the mutants during the Atomic Foods incident, but very few Hemogoblins were destroyed. While the other mutants were out in glorious battle, most of the Hemogoblins were already on planes flying to other countries. It is rumored that there is a huge Hemogoblin population in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Igmu were the dumbest of Cannibal Ed's enforcer mutants. They were pointed towards the enemy, and they attacked. With no idea how to fight, and no idea why they were fighting, the Executioners had no problem dealing with them. Igmu did have needle-like teeth and claws, and when they did manage to hit the enemy, it hurt - but they rarely managed to connect. It is estimated that Reaper and Guillotine killed about 2,000 Igmu - the entire population. Good riddance to stupid mutants.</dd>

<li>About Supermidgets</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Armed with a cape, a <a href="../../../f/e/d/Fedora_%28hat%29.html" title="Fedora (hat)">fedora</a>, and the ability of flight Supermidgets were the air force of Ed's midget militia. Supermidgets aren't much on surprise tactics; they give a battle cry of "Midget Power!" before launching an attack, virtually destroying all chances of sneaking up behind their enemies. Instead they prefer attacking in large numbers hoping to overpower any "<a href="../../../a/v/e/Average_height.html" title="Average height">tallist</a>" they encounter.</dd>
<dd>After the fall of Atomic Foods Corporation the Supermidgets defected to Stumpy's Great Midget Rebellion, where perhaps he might teach them the art of stealth.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You can make <i>short</i> work of Supermidgets by chucking them, don't waste time kicking or punching them.</dd>
<dd>Supermidgets are near the bottom rung of midget force, surpassed by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Megamidget_578a.html" title="The Megamidget">Megamidgets</a> and the unique Gonzales the Wonder Midget. Only the Dogs O' War are ranked below them.</dd>

<li>About the Vemug</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>One of the enforcer mutants created during the rise of Cannibal Ed's Atomic Foods Corporation. Vemug are very slow, stupid creatures but they make up for it with their strange abilities. They can puff out their fat ripples instantly, and often do so as a warning sign to potential enemies. The fat bulge can be used as a powerful bludgeon attack or as a defense mechanism. The Vemug also possesses a razor-sharp, forked tongue which can stretch about five feet. Vemug are usually found in dark, damp areas, rarely associating with other mutants unless forced to do so. Many Vemug survived the Executioners' assault on atomic foods, and now live in Breakneck Cave.</dd>

<li>Trivia</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Vemug (as well as several other mutant thugs in <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executioners.html" title="Executioners">Executioners</a>) had blue jeans and tennis shoes for legs to make animation easier. Vemug's graphics were just a torso slapped onto the shared thug set of&#160;:The Chicken Monster is responsible for "birthing" some, if not all, of the Vemug population.</dd>
<dd>Vemug originally had a huge, poofy hairdo which was deemed too silly and removed.</dd>
<dd>Vemug have forked tongues. Fetus has a forked tongue. Fetus doesn't know who his father is. Hmm...</dd>
<dd>Throwing a Vemug in <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executioners.html" title="Executioners">Executioners</a> does huge damage to whomever they hit.</dd>
