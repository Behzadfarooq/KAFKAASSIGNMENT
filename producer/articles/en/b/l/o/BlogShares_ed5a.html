<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p>Weblogs, or blogs for short, are valued by their incoming links from other known blogs. In effect, links become the <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business.html" title="Business">business</a> deals in the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulation.html" title="Simulation">simulation</a> and players speculate on the fortunes of thousands of blogs by buying and selling shares. A whole host of options exist for advanced play including gifting shares, leveraged buy-outs, artefact building and usage, additional share issues, ideas market, player bonds, voting blogs into categories, and reporting spam or dead listings. Extensive documentation is available in the <a href="http://blogshares.com/help.php" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/help.php" rel="nofollow">BlogShares Help system</a>. The BlogShares community extends across on-site messaging, <a href="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php" rel="nofollow">forum</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Relay_Chat_c148.html" title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</a> channel, and numerous unofficial BlogShares-related blogs and sites maintained by players.</p>
<p><a name="Playing_Blogs" id="Playing_Blogs"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Playing Blogs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing Blogs</span></h3>
<p>The most basic objective of the game is to trade virtual shares in listed blogs. Each blog is automatically set to issue 5,000 shares, 1,000 of which are reserved for the blogger who actually authors the blog. Players can buy or sell shares from each blog's page in the game, and can manipulate prices through trading and Artifact functions. The basic advice of 'buy low, sell high' applies. Through other Artefact functions, players can forcibly take some shares in the blog from current holders (known as a 'Restructure') or grab all shares (known as a 'Hostile Takeover' or HTO), though paying three times the current price per share to do so.</p>
<p><a name="Industries_and_Ideas" id="Industries_and_Ideas"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Industries and Ideas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Industries and Ideas</span></h3>
<p>Industries in BlogShares are the same as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Categories.html" title="Categories">categories</a>. Ideas are produced when blogs (which have been voted into categories by players) are reindexed. Essentially commodities, Ideas are produced every 15-30 minutes in many of the 6500+ Industries. Ideas production is based on a mathematical <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algorithm.html" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a> that takes various factors and variables into account to determine the number of Ideas to 'drop' on the market. The algorithm behind Ideas production changed from the original code as rescued, to an algorithm developed by game player Alan Dean on <a href="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=1896.0" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=1896.0" rel="nofollow">September 13, 2004.</a>. The algorithm worked partially as intended, but created a market where prices continually inflated and rarely fell. On the plus side, Ideas became a long-term <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investment.html" title="Investment">investment</a> of choice for veteran players, with little <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volatility.html" title="Volatility">volatility</a> or <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk.html" title="Risk">risk</a>. On the downside, free cash within the game over time became completely consumed by the Ideas market as players became more and more invested.</p>
<p>This situation was temporarily resolved by <a href="http://blogshares.com/bs/archives/000082.html" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/bs/archives/000082.html" rel="nofollow">"Black Friday"</a> (November 25, 2005) which saw the BlogShares Currency re-valued on a 1:10,000 ratio; The Ideas market lost approximately 99% of its value but due to the uniform revaluation, no player lost their game ranking. While the revaluation and associated market crash alleviated the growth problem in the short term, it did not address the underlying cause. Over time, the market would consume all free cash once again.</p>
<p>Since Black Friday, a <a href="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=10076.0" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=10076.0" rel="nofollow">new algorithm</a> was worked on and <a href="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=15781.0" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=15781.0" rel="nofollow">improved upon</a> to solve the flaws of the previous implementation. The new math was eventually ratified by the <a href="http://blogshares.com/roles.php#super" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/roles.php#super" rel="nofollow">Board of Directors</a> and the <a href="http://blogshares.com/roles.php#math" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/roles.php#math" rel="nofollow">Game Improvement Commission</a> and, after much testing, was switched over <a href="http://helicell.net/blog/2006/08/21/new-math-is-coming/" class="external text" title="http://helicell.net/blog/2006/08/21/new-math-is-coming/" rel="nofollow">August 21, 2006</a>. Although too early to analyze the impact of the change fully, <a href="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=15972.0" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=15972.0" rel="nofollow">initial indications</a> are good.</p>
<p>Apart from increasing wealth, Ideas are also the product used to create the main gameplay tool, Artefacts. The composite rankings also consider how many unique Industries a player holds Ideas for, leading many players to attempt to own at least 1 Idea in as many Industries as possible. This is also known as 'Collecting', and the players known as 'Collectors'.</p>
<p>New Industries are added often, dictated by the dynamic emerging content of blogs. Some recent additions have captured the booming <a href="../../../n/e/o/NeoPets_8752.html" title="NeoPets">NeoPets</a> site, a slew of ailments and <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illnesses.html" title="Illnesses">illnesses</a>, and hundreds of cities and countries. Players can suggest new Industries and build up existing ones by voting blogs into correct categories.</p>
<p><a name="Composite_Rankings" id="Composite_Rankings"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Composite Rankings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Composite Rankings</span></h3>
<p>In April 2006, a <a href="http://blogshares.com/composite.php" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/composite.php" rel="nofollow">new scoring system</a> was implemented which awards points based on player rankings in six categories: Wealth, Artefacts, Chips, Industry Ideas, Karma, and Sigma. The top 100 players in each category are awarded points based on the formula: Points = 101 - Rank. A player ranked #1 in Wealth would receive 100 points for that category, and #100 would gain 1 point. Only the Top 100 in each category are considered, and a player who does not rank receives zero points for the category. The composite score is the total of all six categories for each player, which then determines the overall composite ranking. A player ranked #1 in all six categories would have the maximum of 600 points. Rankings are recalculated every hour.</p>
<p><a name="Artefacts" id="Artefacts"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Artefacts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Artefacts</span></h3>
<p>Artefacts are tools in the BlogShares universe. They have six functions that can affect blogs and one that affects ideas. Artefacts alone have no value, and do not contribute to overall net worth, but can be used to influence the player's wealth by raising share prices of blogs. Artefacts are only usable on blogs that have been voted into the artefact's specific industry. To create an artefact, a player must have 10,000 idea commodities in the artefact's industry. For composite rankings, the total number of Artefacts are counted for each player.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Voting and Moderating">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Voting and Moderating</span></h3>
<p>Players can categorize blogs based on the content they find. For example, a blog written in Swedish by a woman in Kenya which frequently includes discussions of cats and birds could be correctly voted into the Swedish, Kenya, Female, Cats, Birds, and Animals / Pets Industries. Descriptions are available for Industries so that voters can readily understand what content is expected for a vote to be correctly placed.</p>
<p>Moderators can pull up slates of ten votes and check them for correctness. Upon approval or rejection, the original voter is either rewarded or penalized both karma and chips based on the moderator's decision. Because of this power over the success or failure of others, players can only become a Moderator by first achieving a karma level of 750.</p>
<p><a name="Karma" id="Karma"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Karma">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Karma</span></h3>
<p>Players receive Karma for correctly voting blogs into categories. Each moderator-approved vote yields the voter 1 karma (as well as 5-40 chips depending on specificity of the vote). Moderators also receive Karma (and chips), gaining 1 karma point for each vote moderated (and 25 chips).</p>
<p><a name="Sigma" id="Sigma"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Sigma">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sigma</span></h3>
<p>Introduced in <a href="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=12217.0" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=12217.0" rel="nofollow">April 2006</a>, Sigma is awarded whenever a player's report of a spam blog (<a href="../../../s/p/l/Splog.html" title="Splog">splog</a>), dead listing, or non-blog is used to remove a listing from the game. Sigma is awarded at the rate of 1 per report, which also gives the player 20 chips.</p>
<p><a name="Currencies" id="Currencies"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Currencies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Currencies</span></h2>
<p>BlogShares has two main currencies.</p>
<p><a name="B.24" id="B.24"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: B$">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">B$</span></h3>
<p>The functional <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currency.html" title="Currency">currency</a> used in BlogShares is B$. The long form of this is referred to as 'BlogShares Dollars' or 'BlogDollars'. B$ is the currency used to purchase shares in blogs, ideas in industries, or can be traded among players. <i>The B$ has no real-life value supported by Santa Cruz Tech.</i></p>
<p><a name="Chips" id="Chips"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Chips">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chips</span></h3>
<p>The "social currency" of BlogShares is chips. They can be earned in a number of ways, among them by categorizing blogs (voting), answering quick survey questions, being gifted chips by another player or receiving incoming referral links. Chips can then be used to participate in <a href="../../../r/a/f/Raffle.html" title="Raffle">raffles</a>, which can be real-life prizes, services, or game assets, might be used to buy advertisement space on the front page, or can gifted to other players.</p>
<p><a name="Rules_and_Enforcement" id="Rules_and_Enforcement"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/BlogShares_ed5a.html" title="Edit section: Rules and Enforcement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules and Enforcement</span></h2>
<p>There are numerous <a href="http://blogshares.com/help.php?node=4" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/help.php?node=4" rel="nofollow">rules</a> players must follow in the game. Three <a href="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?board=16.0" class="external text" title="http://blogshares.com/yabbse/index.php?board=16.0" rel="nofollow">frequently broken rules</a> deal with the number of accounts, poor voting/moderating, and usage of unapproved scripts. Only one account may be created per player. Any automated off-site tools, such as a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Bot.html" title="Bot">bot</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_scraper.html" title="Page scraper">page scraper</a>, must be approved by game administration prior to any use. Players are expected to read and understand all game rules. It's usually a good idea for new players [noobs] to ingratiate themselves with the Index Managers and members of the BSEC.</p>
<p>BlogShares has a powerful rule-enforcing department, the <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/roles.php#bsec" class="external text" title="http://www.blogshares.com/roles.php#bsec" rel="nofollow">BSEC</a> - Blogshares Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. The BSEC is made up of several volunteer players who pursue cases of cheating, investigate, and hold deliberations to determine guilt and if necessary, punishment. The BSEC has the right to suspend players from the game, fine or penalize game assets, or recommend other administrative punishment. The BSEC has at times been accused of using their position to persecute players they dislike, but it should be noted even these cases involved actions deemed to be in violation of game rules. Further, the game's administration reserves the right to ammend or overturn any BSEC decisions. Game Administrators might take any means necessary to protect the game, its servers, and other players.</p>
<p>Anyone caught breaking rules at BlogShares is known as a Cheatypants.</p>
