<p>Good stuff, I like the proposal...I'd just like to make a short thing for information:</p>
<p><i>Putting a time delay on creation of accounts from blocked ips:</i></p>
<p><b>Pros:</b> Potential contributors on blocked ips can make accounts and continue editing.</p>
<p><b>Cons:</b> Potential contributors may be deferred and not willing to wait, determined vandals may be willing to wait.</p>
<p><i>Approval of accounts from blocked ips:</i></p>
<p><b>Pros:</b> Adds a human element into the process, thus making it more accurate in most cases.</p>
<p><b>Cons:</b> We need to find people <i>to</i> approve these accounts.</p>
<p><i>Nothing!</i></p>
<p><b>Pros:</b> Less work for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Cons:</b> Easier for vandals to get around IP blocks.</p>

<p>Yes, I like the idea in general, but then again, if you follow my opinions, I don't really think we need anonymous editing any more at all for en.wiki. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 18:25, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EBlocking_policy_proposal_b9ee.html" title="Edit section: Too many cons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Too many cons</span></h2>
<p>Personally, the consequences of this policy heavily outweigh the pros. The entire spirit of a wiki is to allow anyone to edit, and if this policy takes place, the entire AOL IP range, plus multiple other public use computers, universities, and libraries would most likely be blocked except for registered accounts. This restriction is contrary to what Wikipedia is — a free encyclopedia that <i>anyone</i>, whether non-registered, registered, admin, or Jimbo, can edit. In addition, this policy would not help counter vandalism; in fact, in my opinion, it would actually encourage it. Determined vandals would simply create an account, and once the account is blocked, create another account. Now, I'm not sure about the technicality of this, but there are two possibilities here - that the new registered account is auto-blocked, which would mean that we're back at the original type of block, or two, the account isn't auto-blocked, which means that vandals could create account after account. Under the old block, new accounts under the same IP would be blocked; however, in this system, they wouldn't. Thus, admins would have to use the old type of block to effectively block a vandal. Now, we're back to square one with the original block. (I hope that made sense!&#160;:-)) So, IMHO, I feel that this proposed idea would be more trouble than it's worth, and actually assist Willy and his counterparts.

<dd>That is a helpful description of the cons of the policy, however I would disagree for 3 reasons 1) The majority of vandals are not determined, 2) At the moment <i>nothing</i> stops these vandals at all, so the fact they can make a new account (which can also be blocked) is fairly inconsequential. 3) Wiki's policy of "anyone can edit" is more severely breached when a good user is blocked because they use an IP of a vandal.</dd>

<dd>Of course if someone can think of a good way of deterring creation of vandal accounts, then that would be even better. thanks - <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose"><font color="darkgreen"><i><b>Martin</b></i></font></a> 22:25, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>p.s. An IP address that was causing a lot of vandalism could of course use the old type of total block. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose"><font color="darkgreen"><i><b>Martin</b></i></font></a> 22:28, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I understand this, we can decide what we like here, but it will be given no effect until the devs write the code.

<dd>Yes, thats right, but according to <a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html#Bug_550" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> "Technically it's easy", and at <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550" rel="nofollow">bugzilla</a> that this is based on he seems to have already implemented it at a test site.

<dd>It's not just the politics. The issue for me is whether it makes it harder or easier to deal with vandalism. I fear making vandals more likely to create accounts will make their changes harder to spot. Anon edits raise a red flag of "look at me, I might be vandalism" - you'd lose (some of) that. I'd consider testing of some kind to see whether the net effect (vandals deterred - vandalism harder to spot = net effect) is positive or negative. Try it for a week, maybe, see how it goes. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 23:01, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, true. What would be interesting is if we could estimate how many new accounts are made from these kind of IP addresses, if it is 100's then it would be too difficult to monitor them all, if it is only a few then we could "approve" them before making them active. Or having a time delay, of say 2 hours, before the account becomes active would also put off the vast majority of vandals, and would of course only affect a very small proportion of potentially new ediors. We could also require a valid email for users to register from these IP addresses, but that is probably too difficult for most to swollow. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose"><font color="darkgreen"><i><b>Martin</b></i></font></a> 23:12, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I like this proposal, but IMO it should be used sparingly rather than being the new standard for IP blocks. This should be used like in the case that Martin presented (<a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.167.234.2.html" title="User talk:209.167.234.2">User talk:209.167.234.2</a>) so that an admin can unblock the IP indef and reblock with this new type of block, allowing legit users to continue editing and still blocking vandals.

<dd>Yes, the present kind of block would always be the standard, in fact this kind of block would be used rather infrequently, the major impact would be on AOL and similar ISPs (not sure how many there are...), after that it would just be the odd school etc. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose"><font color="darkgreen"><i><b>Martin</b></i></font></a> 09:00, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was my understanding and hope that this new kind of block would vecoem the standard, adn the presnt kind of block would be reserved for only the most serious situations, after the new form of block proved ineffectual. Otherwise there is littlke point in this proposal. In general we dopn't take more drastic action untill less drastic has been proved ineffectual. The new form is a less drastic action than the current form of the block. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:47, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My understanding of what Martin says is the new kind of IP blocking will be used for addresses that are shared, the old kind for ones that aren't shared, and that if we don't know, then we default to the old kind (which might be changed in response to emails from blocked users). If the new kind of blocking is a success, the it would be possible to revisit the question of which is the default. I agree with this, on the principle of not running before we have yet walked. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 17:58, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>At the very least, IP's known to be shared (AOL, netscape, and the like) must defualt to the new kind IMO, or I don't feel i can support this proposal. I think that if we don't know, we should defualt to the new kind, on the principle that we use the less drastic remedy first.

<p>I don't understand people saying that this will not reduce vandalism because determined vandals will just get an account. <b>99% of Wikipedia vandalism isn't from "determined vandals"</b>. For every Willy on Wheels there are 1,000 dumbasses vandalizing wikipedia just because it's so easy. It's like keeping a stack of crayons next to every painting in the Louvre!

<p>I am concerned that IP blocking tackles only one aspect of Wikipedia's problems. I don't see how it can prevent sock puppetry. For example, I have dial-up accounts (i.e. dynamic IPs) with three different ISPs. Then there is the problem of editor conspiracies to promote a POV agenda.</p>
<p>A simple approval procedure for <i>all</i> edits would provide a safeguard against many types of abuse. Anonymous editors could still make contributions, but edits would have be approved before going live. Editor conspiracies could be foiled by withdrawing approval status from individuals who ignored warnings. My user page has a brief outline of how it would work, plus links to similar proposals that have been made before. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookish_a5ec.html" title="User:Bookish">Bookish</a> 20:31, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone said that this would solve all Wikipedia's problems, or even more than one, but this seems like a good compromise solution to one pretty major problem (not being able to block shared IPs without excessive collateral damage). Your ideas can continue to be discussed after this is put in place, this proposal wouldn't stop yours from being made (although I suspect yours would/will get considerably less support). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 20:37, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's a related idea, which is mostly orthogonal to the current proposal, but intended to address the same problem. In general it makes sense to distinguish between registered users and anonymous contributors. For example, we have a problem with anonymous vandals coming in via closed proxies, which cannot (and should not) be blocked indefinitely. So how about a new kind of page protection which makes it impossible for anonymous editors only to edit a protected page? Like any kind of page protection, this would be a temporary measure which would allow good-faith editors to contribute while keeping the vandals at bay. The more general (but technically challenging) solution would be to have blacklists on a per-article basis to keep our certain editors, much like current blocks but restricted to individual articles. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 03:35, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This page isn't about a policy. As well as being in the wrong place, it is mis-named.

The English Wikipedia is not the only one subject to vandalism; it is the one most hit by vandalism in terms of volume and is also the most resilient to that vandalism (the more-eyes effect). Vandalism on smaller 'Pedias likely has a disproportionately larger effect on quality <i>and</i> on non-English editor recruitment (this is conjecture and not based on personal experience, but seems logical). Therefore, it is essential that the discussion here contribute to a wider MediaWiki-wide discussion that is trans-language and trans-Project. <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 00:47, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As an alternative automatic authorisation mechanism, it may be best to use email authorisation to create an account.

<p>please support this proposal. This seems like the most obvious thing in the world and I can't believe we've gone for so long without this. Both of the problems mentioned on the project page are trivial, IMO. Especially compared to the hundreds of wasted hours this will save in vandalism we don't have to revert. Anonymous IPs from AOL and school systems need to be blocked. Those addresses are where virtually all of our vandalism comes from. Anyone who legitimately wants to edit can easily get an account and go at it (if we implement this solution). It's rediculous that Wikipedia's most dedicated editors are reduced to the role of vandalism police due to the endless tide of crap coming from those IP addresses. Let's reinforce our levies so we can stop cleaning up messes and work on writing a great encyclopedia!

<dd>While I understand your opinion very well, and am one of the innocent victims of collateral damage (my school is 207.236.151.102, banned until school ends this year), and am myself in favour of this policy, I have to consider a few of the troubles:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It contradicts Wikipedia's open policy, especially in the case of AOL users, if not so much for school systems</li>
<li>Vandals can register if they really want to</li>

<li>Were people blocked from creating new accounts on an IP banned such, then decent users might be banned</li>

<li>IP semi-blocking might be overused, again violating wiki policy.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Even given all this, I am still in favour. The main problem is reaching consensus - Wikipedia operates by and for consensus, and we may not have this yet.

<p>I don't think that a vote on the technical choices to be made in implementing this proposal are likely to be very valuable, since few of us are well informed about anti-spamming and anti-vandalisation techniques, we are likely to be learning as we go in any case, and votes are not a good way of making technical choices in any case. I'd prefer to vote on whether to have this blocking policy at all, and leave the matter of how it is implemented to the people who will implement it.</p>
<p>I should emphasise that I don't mean that I think discussion of technical choices is a waste of time, only putting together a list of alternatives and voting on it. Rather I think the discussion of technical choices is likely to be useful to the implementors, but we should have just a three-way vote:</p>
<ul>
<li>no new class of blocked IPs</li>
<li>have pages blocking anonymous users, but freely allow creation of user accounts</li>

However, how would we deal with a situation where, for example, the votes were split 20, 40, 40 (respectively), because there would be a consensus to introduce the measure, but split between the second and third options (if you see what i mean), I suppose the more conservative option would win. thanks - <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose"><font color="darkgreen"><i><b>Martin</b></i></font></a> 21:40, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good proposal. Here is something even better. Whenever a non-registered user attempts to make an edit anonymously, let them click through a very short, clear and simple warning inviting them to create an account OR (if they already have one) inviting them to log in.</p>
<p>You guys probably don't have any idea how many new users completely overlook the whole login feature for months until they get into an editing conflict with people who start to complain that they don't have an account!

<dd>I'm not so keen. There are quite a few editors who deliberately don't create accounts, and even some who do most of their editing anonymously even though they have accounts (eg. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">User:siroxo</a>); I occasionally edit without an account for various reasons. This proposal makes such editing more of a nuisance. The case is made from time to time that we should not have anonymous editing.

Making a reasonably prominent message linking to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogin_5f6a.html" title="Special:Userlogin">Special:userlogin</a> for anons would fit within this system, without requiring extra clicks (or, done right, taking up too much screen space). <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 23:43, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we want several kinds of blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking anonymous editing from an IP address without affecting registered users (the current proposal). This is a Good Thing, as it will minimize collateral damage. However, I think we also want to retain the current blocking mechanism:</li>
<li>Blocking an IP address unconditionally, which will affect both anonymous and registered users (the current status quo). This is useful for static IPs that, for one reason or another, attract vandals. For example, during the Sollog affair, the disruptive edits came initially from a small static IP range. If we have reason to believe (as was the case in that incident) that a single person (plus meatpuppets) is behind a static IP and is up to no good, then unconditional blocking of that IP is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's where it gets a bit complicated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking a registered account without auto-blocking the IPs recently used by that account (often proposed).</li>
<li>Blocking a registered account plus auto-blocking anonymous editing from associated IPs. This is useful to the extent that auto-blocking is useful in general, but would result in reduced collateral damage. In essence, it would only apply in a situation where an account gets blocked, the user logs out, and tries to continue editing anonymously.</li>
<li>Blocking a registered account plus auto-blocking the associated IPs unconditionally (the current status quo).</li>
</ul>
<p>One way this could be reflected in the UI would be to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special:BlockIP for IP address blocks, with a check box (checked by default) "block will only disallow anonymous editing".</li>
<li>Special:BlockUser for blocking registered accounts, with three radio buttons "no IP autoblock", "autoblock IPs for anonymous editing", and "autoblock IPs unconditionally".</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the way forward is to have more tools available, not just different tools. I agree with the core of the proposal: we do need different tools that would allow more precision, but, occasionally, the current blunt tools are still useful. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 21:04, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>After yesterday, I very very strongly support the idea of an IP-wide anon-only block. I was blocked four times in the last 24 hours because of an anon vandal who shares my IP. I spent quite a bit of the day waiting until I could get back online, only to be blocked again half an hour later. On a couple of occasions, I lost a fair number of subtle and complicated edits (I was busy changing over templates and categories). Any measure that allows for the block of anons from an IP while allowing registered users to continue to work gets my firm vote.</p>
<p>Interestingly I was contacted by email by another fairly regular user who obviously shares my IP. He too was more than a little fed up with what was going on yesterday. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 23:26, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>

<p>How about, instead of letting all logged in users edit via a blocked IP, only letting logged in users with more than say 100 edits edit from blocked IP? If we allow account creation from blocked IPs and give administrators the ability to "bless" (which would do the same as the account having more than 100 edits for the blocking code), new users who want to edit from the blocked IP can mail the blocking admin or mailinglist and get a working account. Vandals who pretend to be good-faith editors might get one or two accounts out of admins but these will be blocked soon enough, as an admin who blesses a new account will keep an eye on it until the editor has proven himself. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 00:18, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I think time is more relevant than number fo edits or maybe a mix of both, it is much easier to do 100 OK edits, than to wait say 2 weeks. Only a very dedicated vandal would pre create users 2 weeks ahead of a vandalism, but to do 100 edits you can do with some script or something, one day or even 5 minutes before your planned vandalism. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefan_3752.html" title="User:Stefan">Stefan</a> 08:00, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

</dl>
<p><i>I have been for some time thinking about making a patch to MediaWiki to add a new user flag. Users with that flag would be exempt from all IP blocks, both direct and autoblocks (but would still be affected by blocks on the user itself). It would be perfect for your situation. However, I am not sure that hack would be accepted. I made a (completely untested) patch to MediaWiki <a href="http://www.dcc.ufrj.br/~cesarb/hacks/mediawiki/noipblock-2.diff" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dcc.ufrj.br/~cesarb/hacks/mediawiki/noipblock-2.diff" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which adds the flag I described above. If you manage to convince the developers to include this patch or something similar, and convince a bureaucrat to add the flag to your account, your problems with being blocked when your IP address is blocked should end.</i></p>

<dd>Vandals on shared IPs are definitely major problems. They contribute with significant amount of vandalism (my guess is around 1/2 of total) and they quickly learned they are unpunishable. When a good editor sits on the same IP as vandal his edits may get reverted by mistake.

<dd>I'll give you the list, if someone will block it&#160;:) Really if we just blocked schools, I think it would eliminate 1/3 of our vandalism. But that's just based on my anecdotal evidence. Personally, I think the benefits of blocking them would far outweigh the occassional useful edit. And I don't think I'm alone in this opinion. Of course it should only apply to anonymous edits and not to registered users from those IPs. <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 21:42, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Besides, i would be leary of as broad a block as you suggest, although the ability to IP block ranges without preventing loggend-in users from editing would surely help with the AoL problem, and other simialr cases. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:50, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a problem with all this, of course. Shared IP does not necessarily mean shared computer. I've been blocked before because someone else presumably living nearby was vandalising articles - yet I'm the only person to use this computer. yet the idea of public access computers needing special clearance to edit sounds reasonable - even if its only sokmething like ensuring that multi-use computer users must have non-anon user names. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 02:18, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, it sounds like in addition to "block IP" there should be "block Anonymous from IP". Perhaps if there's an anonymous vandal using "block anonymous users from IP" should be the first step, and only if they keep creating new accounts do you block the IP completely. It'd be better if we could limit things only as much as necessary, and no more.

<p>People seem to be rather confused by the benefits of logged-in vs non-logged-in users. Editors can be divided into two big groups: casual editors and devoted editors. Casual editors genearlly don't want to log in, and will not edit if they have to. Devoted editors are happy to log in, and may even edit only when logged in. The basic problem with requiring logging in as a way to cut down vandalism is that the percentage of good vs vandal edits are about the same for the two groups - i.e. the percentage of good edits from casual editors and from devoted editors are about the same, as is the percentage of vandalism from devoted and casual editors. So requiring logging in will just shift the balence away from casual editors towards devoted editors, but won't change the ammount of vandalism. However, the main difference between casual and devoted editors is that devoted editors, due to their devotion, generally make more subtle and complicated edits, either good or vandalism - tilting vandalism towards the subtle, hard-to-detect end is neither good to helpful for the wiki. That is why I don't support this proposal. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 00:39, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, it looks like we have a consensus that the community wants the new type of blocking.

<p>I just voted for both options above (feel free to count that any way you want). I think that, developers willing, completely configurable blocks with all sorts of different options are desirable. First block but allow new accounts, then block but disallow new accounts, finally, if that still doesn't work (e.g. the IP address starts hijacking accounts) then block fully. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozzerati_67af.html" title="User:Mozzerati">Mozzerati</a> 14:56, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll mostly repeat what others have said above: As far as the <b>technical</b> side (the MediaWiki software) is concerned, I think we want to have a wide variety of options available. IMHO it would be a Bad Thing to throw out one blocking mechanism and replace it with another one. Rather, there should be different levels of blocks that can be issued as warranted by the situation. For example: Dealing with one-off vandalism from an anon? Block the IP without locking out registered users, and allow creation of new accounts from same IP. Dealing with a persistent vandal, like the recent vandalbot? Block the IP without locking out registered users, but don't allow the creation of new accounts from the same IP. Dealing with a sockpuppet vandal? Block the IP and also block registered users editing from the same IP. Note that these are just examples of what <i>could</i> be done; my point is simply that different situations may call for different kinds of blocks. It is a matter of <b>policy</b> to tell us what <i>should</i> be done. For example, I'd argue for a policy of using the least intrusive, effective block. In any case, we need to separate the <b>technical</b> aspects from the <b>policy</b> aspects. The current poll seems to conflate these two. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a><big><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">✍</a></big> 20:55, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since I formulated more or less the three options that Martin formulated, I'll explain what I had in mind. What the first option disallows that the second embraces is precisely whatever technical blocks are needed to get this option to work best: if you are suspicious of the mediawiki gnomes then you should vote for option #1, and ask for new measures as they are seen to be necessary if you think the channels of communication work well, then option #2 is the best bet. The whole point of the three options is to separate the technical aspects from the policy aspects: the key is who is trusted to make the technical choices. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 21:15, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should this feature be implemented, we should clarify in the blocking policy that this type of block may only be used in situations where a regular IP block can be used. IOW, no indefinite blocks of AOL addresses unless the community specifically extends the blocking policy to allow them.</p>
<p>Even then, I think we should be deciding indefinite blocks on a case by case basis, through the arb com or through community consensus, but unfortunately current policy allows this.</p>

<p>I've just had to unblock an anon IP (212.85.15.67) that was blocked for two weeks... because it blanket blocked almost an entire London borough, thereby blocking hundreds - potentially thousands - of good faith users.

<p>I am a Wikipedian in good standing, having made thousands of edits and created several new articles. However, my ISP is AOL and I am continually blocked due to the dynamic I/P addresses which AOL assigns. This frequently happens mid-edit, with no warning, with disastrous consequences. For example, if I was moving a large section from one article to another, and delete it from the first article, only to be autoblocked before I can add it to the new article, that text is lost, and my actions now look like they were vandalism&#160;!</p>
<p>Autoblocking should be turned off until it can be made to work properly. Specifically, it should check for the ISP of the I/P, and not block any I/P under AOL or any other ISP which assigns dynamic I/Ps. Until they can get this working, autoblocking is doing more harm to Wikipedia than good and should be shut down, immediately. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 18:42, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This post contains several suggestions you could just use one of them.</p>
<p>Why not add the feature and let the Person Blocking the user chose instead of applied the change to all IP Blocks</p>
<p>We could have the normal Block with no edits (so IP’s only used for vandalism can be normally blocked)</p>
<p>We could have the Bulk Block that says Create an account.</p>
<p>We cold let anon create an anon account. You could Give the Anon a cookie and Block the anon who is Vandalizing with the cookie and if they delete the cookie they would have to reply for the anon account.</p>
<p>Accounts created from a blocked IP can have a Block At first Offence notice on there talk page and so if they vandalize they don't need a warning. The Block at first offence notice could be just like the IP notice on the bottom of IP talk pages and not be editable and could be program to go away after X edits and Y days so that if they create several accounts they would need to do X edits on each to get away from the notice to vandalize and if they do all their edits at once they still need to wait Y days and Both should be required so they don't create 100 accounts and wait Y days and start vandalizing.</p>
<p>You could also create a vandal watch list that all edits by vandal IP addresses show up on. Instead of recent changes patrol this would allow Vandal Patrol People to get to Vandalism faster in relativity to Normal Editors not looking for vandalism. It would also let people who want to find Vandalism get more of a chance each try--<a href="../../../y/s/k/User%7EYskyflyer_5780.html" title="User:Yskyflyer">E-Bod</a> 22:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd like to propose that this policy limit the amount of time a block of this type may be imposed on an IP for. My concern is that some admins may try to use this as a way to permanently block anonymous editing from shared IPs, such as AOL and school IPs. If a maximum length, at most a week for multiple offenses, were imposed, I would certainly vote for this policy, but until then I can't support it.-<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolotet_39d2.html" title="User:Polotet"><font color="blue">Polo</font></a><a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolotet_bad8.html" title="User talk:Polotet"><b><font color="black">te</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Polotet_728d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Polotet"><font color="orange">t</font></a> 03:33, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I actually stumbled across this policy proposal when looking for the best place to suggest it, however I was going suggest the exact opposite to polo, that permanent blocks on certain high vandalism IP addresses be put in place. It is my (entirely unsubstantiated) belief that there are some people who use these proxies for vandalism in the knowledge that they can not be permananetly blocked. I don't think that anyone seriously considering editing is going to mind the hurdle of registering in order to prevent repeated serious vandalism. I think we should trust Administrators opinions, if they believe it should be permanent, then let it be permanent. <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble"><span style="color:#008040;">Mr</span><span style="color:#007FBF;font-weight:bold">Weeble</span></a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/w/User_talk%7EMrWeeble_bf1b.html" title="User talk:MrWeeble">Talk</a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_British_TV_channels_03c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject British TV channels">Brit tv</a></small> 14:20, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And I intend to replace it with something well-planned and well-coded. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">talk</a>) 21:30, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, if this is being done as part of a more comprehensive code overhaul, then I'm fine with it taking time to do right. Better right than soon, as they say.

<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place to propose this, but it's related to the topic, so I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>One of the annoying things about the current blocking system is we've got this nice hierarchy of warning messages, culminating in things like "The next time you vandalize a page, you'll be blocked without further warning". And then what happens the next time? If it's spotted by a non-admin, the best they can do is add another warning. So you end up with a user talk page full of "This is your last warning" messages, and nothing happens because an admin (who has the power to actually implement the block) hasn't noticed. It doesn't take long for the vandal to realize that he can get away with stuff since the warnings don't result in action.</p>
<p>So, let's make a new template, analogous to {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDelete_bfa0.html" title="Template:Delete">delete</a>}}, called something like {{blockme}}. Any editor can place {{blockme}} on a user talk page, and that page will get added to Category:Candidates for blocking. It will be easy for admins to watch this category and implement blocks on users who deserve them quickly.</p>
<p>BTW, I fully support the current proposal. I lean towards the "allow creation of one account per hour per IP address" throttle mechanism, but would go along with any of the proposals, as long as <b>something</b> is done to stem the tide of vandalism. My proposal would be an additional tool that could be used. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 02:33, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strongly disagree with proposal of creating a new template {{blockme}}. List vandals on <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>, 3RR violators on <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a>, etc. Vandals must be warned, 3RR evidence must be presented, before a block is made. A template will not be any help in any situation actually requiring a block, and is begging for abuse. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 14:35, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been trying to get an account from Singaopre (one IP address, ~4.3M people), but the "only 6 new accounts allowed per 24 h" rule...</p>
<p>surely there can be another rule for IP addresses with lots of users? perhaps coupled with a "hammer of vandals" setting for a bot like <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot2_313a.html" title="User:Tawkerbot2">Tawkerbot2</a>, so that if</p>
<ul>
<li>the user is from a problematic IP address</li>
<li>the account is new</li>
<li>the bot catches the account vandalising something,</li>
</ul>
<p>then the bot automatically blocks the account for at least 15 min, or indefinitely if the user offends again.</p>

<p>The one resounding complaint of such a proposal is that potential new <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> are slightly discouraged from making contributions due to the perceived "fuss" of making an account at first. While I agree with the proposal, even if it in fact does deter some anonymous editors, I believe that any move towards relieving this problem is beneficial to the community. I'm sure many of our first edits were made anonymously as I know mine were.</p>
<p>While, it has been argued on both the <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> front that <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identd.html" title="Identd">identd</a> is by no means completely reliable, I still think that it could be of some use, were it to be used collaboratively with trusted organizations with shared IPs. Organizations, such as colleges and universities - where Wikipedia is often referenced and considered an important resource - could set up <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identd.html" title="Identd">identd</a> to work with their current user system if one is available.</p>
<p>Anonymous edit actions would immediately identify the IP address as not only shared, but as a semi-trusted organization that has <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identd.html" title="Identd">identd</a> installed and maintained. The Wikipedia server would then send an <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ident.html" title="Ident">ident</a> query to the organizations and log that response with the edit along with the IP, thus providing another level of identification where little is currently available.</p>
<p>This would help with selective blocking where it was once unavailble without registration, while remaining relatively transparent to our potential new editors. No fuss.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all organizations require unique logins and even less would be willing to manage it with <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identd.html" title="Identd">identd</a>. However, I know for a fact that my college has the former and that students often reference Wikipedia articles in their work. For the those that would use this system, there would be an obvious benefit to both Wikipedia as well as those collaborating organizations and its users. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyLaurie_8b7c.html" title="User:RoyLaurie">Roy Laurie</a> 08:49, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>I have a suggestion for the blocking policy that may address one of the cons. Limit the creation of new accounts from "banned IP address" to one per week...or one per fortnight, whatever. This limits the amout of damage a vandal can cause while allowing legitimate users the ability to create a new account from any IP. This also can be automated, and doesnt require human/time resources that could be better used on Wikipedia.</b> <a href="../../../x/m/_/User%7EXM_e1dc.html" title="User:XM">XM</a> 16:05, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Suggestion - as I use two library systems that have IPs repeatedly blocked: could a three level entry system be introduced (ie username/password/place of origin = Xlibrary etc)? This would enable Innocent Bystanders to get in from certain areas of shared IPs (as the Wikivandals won't know where is allowed).</p>
<p>It gets annoying for IBs who wish to correct minor mistakes in passing etc to find themselves repeatedly blocked - and seeing the number of blocked IPs might persuade people to do other things.</p>
