<dd>Some of their folkier stuff could possibly be compared to FC. I dunno though; FC often had pretty intricate arrangements, and sounded a lot like traditional English folk music, which is a sound that B&amp;S haven't explored very much. I'd say the comparison is a little dubious.

<dd>If it's official, go ahead and move it back, though I wouldn't trust album covers alone necessarily. I capriciously move bands to the ampersand in order to have a standard and because most bands don't have an official method of writing it -- if this is an exception, I have no problems with it being at <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belle_and_Sebastian_e74a.html" title="Belle and Sebastian">Belle and Sebastian</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a></dd>

<dd>I dunno--that's why I always make a redirect. Really it doesn't matter as long as one leads to another, it's just nice to have a community standard to minimize the use of redirects as much as possible. The exact methods of writing groups like Guns n Roses, Bone-Thugz-N-Harmony, etc, etc are many and varied, and have a tendency to spawn multiple, competing articles unless it is nipped in the bud with the judicious and wise use of redirect pages. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a></dd>

<dd>I agree.

<p>Are we drawing a distinction between singles and eps, and if so, what exactly is the distinction? Is it a single if its title matches the title of one of the songs? Or is it based on track count (&lt;=3; &gt;=4)? kevinb9n</p>
<p>I've edited so that records where the record title matches the title of the first track are listed as singles, and other records which were eligible to appear in the singles chart are listed as EPs. Initially (ie, up to and including This Is Just A Modern Rock Song), all the band's singles and EPs had four tracks; they changed to three when the UK singles chart stopped including records with more than three different tracks. SleepyCaitlin</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's an inconsistency, though. If you go to the wikipedia entries for what are called their singles in this article, (<a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_David_cda3.html" title="Jonathan David">Jonathan David</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_Man_57ad.html" title="Legal Man">Legal Man</a>, etc.) they are listed as being EPs there.</dd>
<dd>I'd say Legal Man and all afterwards are singles (except Books). --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyWater_d609.html" title="User:SaltyWater">SaltyWater</a> 19:26, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

"What should not be linked to" point one says, <i>"any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose."</i> Do these provide that?</dd>

<dd>I'm sure these are great sites. But by putting one in and not the others, we're doing them a disservice. Additionally, our goal here is <i>not</i> to make sure that fans have access to up-to-date information on tours and press releases. It is to provide stable, encyclopedic content. All these links should go.</dd>

<dd>Who are these links hurting? It's not like they are untruthful or distracting from the article. I think the label's page for a band is kind of important, and the mailing list is awesome; I love the availability of the chords there. The forum on Bowlie I would find not as important, but still harmless and at least helpful. Obviously, a broken link should be removed. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolkor_00a7.html" title="User:Folkor">Folkor</a> 23:07, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have at some point been involved in three of those sites in some capacity, things I would like to point out: Jeepster own the exclusive and worldwide contract for all of the early albums, and only sub-licensed to Matador, Virgin France, etc... their site was a significant resource back in 1998 and was a prime reason the fixing of the Brit award worked. I no longer work with or are connected with them in any way, but do not doubt their historical importance to the band and what was achieved there. They should be linked to still. I agree with your arguments regards the top level links for Sinister and Bowlie, yet both offer unique and core content that does match your criteria for link inclusion, I have taken the liberty of inserting a link to Bowlie that goes to the Press Cuttings archive, which has got just about every published article that we've found in the last few years. Let me know if you find this doesn't match your criteria. Similarly, for Sinister I've linked directly to the chords, again good enough to be included according to your criteria. User:buro9</dd>

<p>I was surprised to see that the entry had no reference to Belle &amp; Sebastian's U.S. involvement with Matador Records, so I added the info as a parenthetical aside next to the info about the move from Jeepster to Rough Trade. I also added info about <i>Storytelling</i> and Belle &amp; Sebastian references on U.S. TV shows as evidence of the band's growing influence and fame on American shores.

<p>Why do people keep reverting the band's lead-in to say just pop or indie instead of twee pop? Twee pop is the most accurate representation I can think of for the band, and it's been that way in this article for as long as I can remember. If someone could present some actual arguments as to why the band isn't twee, that'd be great. Otherwise I'll just keep reverting people's edits. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolkor_00a7.html" title="User:Folkor">Folkor</a> 09:05, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, the word "twee" has acquired semipejorative connotations as an adjective meaning something that is overly and /or self-consciously cute. For that reason, the label could be misread as dismissive toward the band. In addition, a lot of B&amp;S material has a "classical" pop sound to it that makes it seem inappropriate to shoehorn them into a subgenre like "twee". <i>The Life Pursuit</i>, for example, feels to me more like <i>Arthur/Village Green Preservation Society</i>-era Kinks than it does anything I'd call twee.--Andrewjnyc 22:39, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't and can't categorise music, but my 2cents... B&amp;S have never striked me as twee. Soft, they may frequently be, but they've always had balls. That's not very twee. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltyWater_d609.html" title="User:SaltyWater">SaltyWater</a> 01:16, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I was making the mistake of mostly making my judgment solely on "If You're Feeling Sinister", which is kind of twee. However, now with a copy of the new album on my hands, and a deeper understanding of the rest of the band's catalogue, I think you guys are right. I was looking for some discussion, which I have received. Thanks. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolkor_00a7.html" title="User:Folkor">Folkor</a> 07:45, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>When a band has a catalogue as extensive as Belle &amp; Sebastian's, what kind of utter bozo claims to be an authority on "the most accurate" description of their music based on a judgment "solely" formed from listening to one album? I don't so much object to the word "twee" as to the false impression that someone is making knowledgeable pronouncements when really that person has no clue. Matt, 8 March, 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>Woah, dude, I said sorry. I made a mistake and I apologized. As I said, I wanted some discussion on the topic, since different people (usually IPs, not registered users) would change twee to indie, and never give a reason. I then wanted other people's opinions, which I got, and then I backed down. I mean, IYFS is probably the band's best known album, and some of their other work is a bit twee too. However, I agree that the band isn't twee on the whole - thus my retraction. Again, I'm sorry; if you have a problem with me reverting edits that have no explanation from IPs that go against my previous knowledge, please just say I need to do more research instead of insulting me. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolkor_00a7.html" title="User:Folkor">Folkor</a> 06:32, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I reworded it to mention the application of 'twee pop' only to their early music. I think you'd find it very hard to call more than a handful of tracks from DCW or TLP that sound even a little twee. TLP, in particular, is not twee at all. I think this is a fair enough change but feel free to discuss / change back. 121.44.98.174 15:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm the one who added the "Cas(s)aco Marron" single info... and yet I'm confused.

And yet I'm pretty sure the original song is rightly spelled with two S's; B&amp;S/Azuli just messed up.

<blockquote>
<p>B&amp;S are a Scottish indie pop band formed in Glasgow in January 1996. The band rejects the "twee pop" label foisted on them early in their career. Belle &amp; Sebastian have much in common with influential indie bands such as The Smiths and Felt, and also take in the influences of northern soul and funk. Their sense of irony and humour are traits also not usually associated with twee. Audiogalaxy classified Belle &amp; Sebastian music as chamber pop, as they use instruments such as flute, cello, trumpet, as well as a regular violin string-section.</p>
