<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stronach's break with the Conservatives</span></h2>
<p>Some of the statements in the article seem to me to be beyond what we should be including in an encyclopedia. Consider these two paragraphs:</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_Party_d4fe.html" title="Ontario Progressive Conservative Party">Ontario Progressive Conservative</a> <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Provincial_Parliament_ca49.html" title="Member of Provincial Parliament">Member of Provincial Parliament</a> <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Runciman_1bc5.html" title="Bob Runciman">Bob Runciman</a> made himself the target of Liberals and media alike when he told <a href="../../../c/f/r/CFRB_fc8e.html" title="CFRB">CFRB</a>, a Toronto radio station, that, "She sort of defined herself as something of a dipstick, an attractive one, but still a dipstick." <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1116347413338_5/?hub=TopStories" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1116347413338_5/?hub=TopStories" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Asked to retract his statement or to apologize, he refused. He did elaborate that in his opinion, Stronach failed to adequately express her reasons for defecting from the Conservative Party.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Alberta conservative Tony Abbott made even more disparaging remarks, saying Stronach had "whored herself out for power." <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/05/18/stronach-sexism050518.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/05/18/stronach-sexism050518.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>This isn't a newspaper and I don't think what these fine gentlemen say about her in a moment of anger really needs to be included in an article on Stronach. Lots of other people in the Conservative and other parties have made comments, do we care? Do others share my concerns? <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 18:55, 2005 May 18 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that quotes from your harshest critics is valid way of showing all <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POVs</a> -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 19:07, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm of two minds about this. I think I side with James: the comments show the intensity of the reaction to her switch. And, it they also show that sexism is not dead in Conservative Canada. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 19:15, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sunray, I wrote both of those paragraphs, so I suppose I should explain their inclusion. I think it's appropriate to include information pertinent to the discussion; with time, those statements may be edited out, but they are useful right now. However, I don't think including all such statements is useful. There were plenty of other comments made by conservatives which don't merit mention here. As mentioned by <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a>, they also demonstrate the degree of response to the situation. I think it would be appropriate to include more moderate conservative sentiments too, since there were some who considered her a Red Tory and quite likely to quit the party. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 20:00, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Ground Zero that these comments are certainly sexist. But they are not notable. I could go out on the street and get similar comments from passersby. Do they shed any light on anything? Also, they are from individuals that are pretty much unknown outside their respective provinces (citys?). In BC we heard comments (less incendiary and somewhat more thoughtful) from local MPs here. But who cares? My point is that this is an article on Belinda Stronach. Just because some get thinks she's a whore is not reason to put that in an encyclopedia article. There has been a full spectrum of reaction (both positive and negative) to her move. Let's find a way to modify the tone of this. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 20:38, 2005 May 18 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that the tone should be changed; I never implied that the paragraphs should be left as-is. However, when provincial politicans, especially those who have held high positions (eg - Runciman; I know little about Abbott), make such statements, I think that the way in which they are perceived, by the media and public, should at least be mentioned. The statements were in all the major Toronto media today, and surely in other parts of Canada, so they have some relavence.</dd>
<dd>Note that the statements have a POV, but I tried to write about them in a neutral tone. I've made a minor modification, though I doubt that's sufficient. I think we may need to create a section covering the reaction to the switch, so that we can get a more balanced perspective. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 21:20, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>O.k. let's work on it. I think I will start by adding her statement of her reasons for making the move. I like the idea of a separate section on reaction.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Passport stuff</span></h2>
<p>I can't see any purpose in including this paragraph, so I've removed it:</p>
<dl>
<dd>When she became a cabinet minister she was automatically made a member of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_Canada_146a.html" title="Privy Council of Canada">Privy Council of Canada</a> which will allow her to travel under a special diplomatic <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passport.html" title="Passport">passport</a> under the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_Canada_6d4d.html" title="Queen of Canada">Queen of Canada</a> until the death of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_II_e338.html" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If true, this would be true of any cabinet minister, so there's no special reason to mention it here. I see that this is a remnant of an earlier paragraph which contained some weird speculation that she defected to the Liberals <i>for</i> this special passport.</p>
<p>In any case, why on earth would the death of the sovereign matter in the slightest? If a former cabinet minister can retain this special passport for the duration of the Queen's life, why wouldn't this privilege be automatically re-granted under her successor? --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 11:35, May 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for removing that. It was bothering me, too.

<p>One way or another we are all Stronach watchers here. Has anyone noticed changes in Ms. Stronach lately?

She's different. Did anyone see her interview with George Stoumboulopolis on CBC Newsworld's <i>The Hour</i> last night? Her grasp of the relevant issues was impressive.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"enabled the government to survive"</span></h2>
<p>Contrary to what's stated in 'Move to the Liberals', I don't think we can say with certainty that Stronach's defection kept the government alive. Neither <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kilgour_48c8.html" title="David Kilgour">Kilgour</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Cadman_1ae5.html" title="Chuck Cadman">Cadman</a> had made up his mind at the time of her defection (at least so far as they said publicly).</p>
<p>In particular, Kilgour claimed to be very unimpressed with Stronach's move and the government's complicity in it. He ultimately voted against C-48 (i.e. with the Tories); who's to say that Stronach's defection wasn't what pushed him over the edge to vote that way?</p>
<p>I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't say it's certainly false. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 00:14, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is true to say that many political pundits and observers credit Stronach's move with saving the government.AndyL 01:18, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm removing the sentence "The very sudden and public end of their romantic relationship marked several firsts for Canadian media and politics, which normally avoid discussing the romantic lives of politicians."

<dd>Unlikely.

<p>Belinda -- there was a better way -- if you are really sincere that you were doing this for Canada -- just cross the floor and sit as an Independent -- You could have staved off the Vote of Non Confidence and retained your dignity and moral fibre.

<p>Languages</p>
<p>Belinda Stronach answers questions from French media with the assistance of a translator. She did the same during French language debates when running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. If she has any knowledge of the French language, she certainly isn't showing it.</p>

<dd>I do find it troubling that any mention of the many accusations of bribery and other impropriety have been entirely stripped from the article. There's nothing left in the article that suggests her move the the Liberals was at all controversial. --<a href="../../../l/l/e/User%7ELlewdor_f4c9.html" title="User:Llewdor">Llewdor</a> 01:05, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess that's because they would just be that: accusations. If there were evidence that she made a deal for crossing the floor, criminal charges could be laid since it is legal to bribe a member of parliament. But no charges were laid. Including unproven accusations would not improve the article. Furthermore, there is commentary about how members of the Conservative Party reacted to her move. See the section on <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Stronach_50bc.html#Reaction_to_Stronach.27s_move" title="Belinda Stronach">Belinda_Stronach#Reaction_to_Stronach.27s_move</a>. I do not see how you can say that there is nothing left to indicate that the move was controversial. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 01:33, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
