<p>Belfast High School has a long and proud history. It opened in 1854. The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004 with a dinner in the Europa Hotel in Belfast, a sports evening at the school and a Carol Service in St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. The School was originally in Glenravel Street in Belfast, where it remained until 1963, when it moved to the current site in Jordanstown. In the school's history there have only been 7 head teachers:<br />
John Pyper (1854-1867), who founded the school<br />
James Pyper (1867-1917), the school's longest-serving headmaster<br />
Spring Pyper (1917-1937)<br />
Dr R H Harte (1938-1966), who bought land around an old house in Jordanstown in 1953 and moved the school there in 1963 (the house is now the administration block, housing the staff room, sick bay, and offices of the headmistress, her secretary, the bursar and vice-principal)<br />
Mr S H Dunlop (1966-1987), who saw the building of a new science block (1970), the closure of Somerton House (the school's preparatory department) in 1981 and the enlargement of the school library (1980s)<br />
Mr S R Hilditch (1987-2006), who saw the Harte Building opened in the 1990s to house Home Economics, Careers, Technology, ICT and a science lab, the refurbishment of the science block (2001-2003) and the refurbishment and enlargement of the Music Department<br />
Mrs L F Gormley (2006-present), the school's first headmistress.</p>
<p>The current head girl is Neal Gilliland and head boy is Jessica Barnes</p>

<p>The pupils are split up into 4 houses: Pyper, Watson, Storey and Boyd. The pupils must wear a tie representing the house. The tie is blue with thick yellow stripes between thinner stripes in the owner's house colour (blue for Pyper, red for Storey, yellow for Watson and green for Boyd).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_High_School_fa78.html" title="Edit section: Curriculum">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Curriculum</span></h2>
<p>The School curriculum is designed to provide the broadest possible choice of subjects and experience for pupils who can benefit from them. In Form 1 and 2 pupils study the following subjects:<br />
English, Mathematics, Science, French, History, Geography, Music, Latin, Art, Home Economics, Technology, Information Technology, Physical Education, Religious Education and Employability.<br />
In Form 3 pupils are offered a choice of new subjects including German, Spanish and Classical Civilisation, or they can continue with all their previous subjects (Science splits into Biology, Physics and Chemistry).<br />
In Form 4 and 5 pupils prepare for GCSE examinations. All pupils study English, English Literature, Mathematics and French. A small number may not continue with English Literature in Form 5. In addition the school offers the following subjects:<br />
Additional Mathematics, Art, Biology, Chemistry, Classical Civilization, Information and Communication Technology, Double Award Science, Geography, German, History, Home Economics, Latin, Music, Physical Education, Physics, Religious Studies, Single Award Science, Spanish and Technology (Products and Systems Design).<br />
Pupils choose 5 more subjects (within the limits of Government Regulations) from the list above. Greek, Music and Additional Maths can be made available outside the timetable as a tenth subject for very able pupils.<br />
At all levels throughout the School, pupils are required to do homework as an integral part of their studies. Parents are expected to co-operate by providing pupils with suitable opportunities to do their homework and by ensuring that it is done. Pupils in Lower Sixth study 3 or 4 AS levels drawn from a list of 23 or 24 different subjects. In addition some Sixth Formers follow a course leading to an additional GCSE or an accreditation in Key Skills (Information Technology). Young Enterprise, Motor Vehicle Studies, Business Studies and a Religious Studies short course are also available. All Sixth Form pupils participate in a course which deals with interview and communication skills, careers advice and information about tertiary level education.<br />
Upper Sixth pupils take 3 or 4 subjects to A2 level and follow an enrichment programme including UCAS preparation, talks by visiting speakers and basic life skills.<br />
Throughout Forms 1 to 5, classes in Religious Studies are provided for every pupil, but parents who have a conscientious objection may withdraw their children from this class.<br />
Careers Education is organised by a team of teachers, supplemented by the Careers Officers from the Training and Employment Agency, who provide information and advice for all pupils from Form 3 upwards. As well as Careers classes and interviews, the School has a full programme of special visits and work experience schemes designed to help pupils make informed career choices.</p>
