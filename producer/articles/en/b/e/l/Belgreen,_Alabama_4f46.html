<p>Belgreen was once the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_seat.html" title="County seat">county seat</a> of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_County%2C_Alabama_9436.html" title="Franklin County, Alabama">Franklin County</a>. The Franklin County Career Technical Center is now located on the site where the county <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courthouse.html" title="Courthouse">courthouse</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_jail.html" title="County jail">jail</a> once stood. Due to this, the road between the Career Technical Center and the Science Hall of Belgreen High School is named Jail Springs Road. The courthouse and jail existed on this site after the county seat was moved from Frankfort, which is approximately ten miles north of Belgreen. The courthouse complex existed on the current grounds of the Career Technical Center until it burned and was eventually moved to Russellville.</p>
<p>Another interesting note is that the building that now exists as part of the After-School program at Belgreen High School was once a canning plant, one of the many businesses that once existed in Belgreen. Other business also included a second gas station and country store at the beginning of Highway 49, as well as a barber shop at the four way intersection.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgreen%2C_Alabama_4f46.html" title="Edit section: Belgreen High School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Belgreen High School</span></h2>
<p>Any description of Belgreen, Alabama would be incomplete without a given history of Belgreen High School. BHS has existed just south of Highway 24 for over sixty years. The same building, along with many annexes, housed the K-12 school until 2001 when the original building was demolished to make room for the new complex. Many students and alumni came to the campus to witness the demolition of the building on the first day, which began with the stripping of the bricks off of the old library building after classes ended during the spring of 2001. The class of 2002 actually went through the entire school year and graduated without the use of a main school building, and instead used a multitude of makeshift classrooms and facilities in trailers and previously unused rooms.</p>
<p>The new building was completed in time for the 2002 - 2003 school year. Four years later, in 2007 a new lunchroom was completed directly in front of the old agricultural and home economics building. Also, a new gymnasium is being constructed next to the old gym and the baseball field, which should be in use in time for the 2007 - 2008 school year. The current gymnasium will remain standing to be used for practice and physical education class facilities</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgreen%2C_Alabama_4f46.html" title="Edit section: Belgreen Today">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Belgreen Today</span></h2>
<p>Belgreen is now known mostly for the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> program at the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a>, for which the girls' team won a 1A state championship in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. The size of Belgreen will be reduced somewhat after the planned addition of a four lane on Alabama Highway 24. The new lane of Highway 24 should cut through the area on the south side of Highway 24, opposite CJ's Gas and Grocery in the only four way intersection of the town.</p>
<p>What keeps the community of Belgreen alive today is the school and the surrounding area. Belgreen High School received a new state of the art building during the Summer of 2002, which regenerated interest in the area. Many business have tried to ride on the popularity of the school by opening grills or "burger joints" across the street from the school, but have always failed. The only business which has been successful is CJ's Gas and Grocery, which is more of a community gathering point than a gas station. Also near this condensed area are many well-attended churches, as well as a community fire department house.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgreen%2C_Alabama_4f46.html" title="Edit section: Community Features">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Community Features</span></h2>
<p><b>"CJ's"</b> - Probably the most well-known, frequently referenced, and widely recognized Belgreen location in Belgreen, CJ's Gas and Grocery is the central gathering place in the community. This small store and gas station is a familiar landmark to fishermen and hunters traveling to the Bear Creek area, and to persons on the road to Red Bay.</p>
<p><b>"The Firehall"</b> - Located in close proximity to CJ's, the firehall is home to the Belgreen Volunteer Fire Department. It also serves as a polling place during elections.</p>
<p><b>"The Underground Lake"</b> - Locals tell stories of an underground body of water. Supposedly it is located near Belgreen High School, but there are as many alleged locations as there are people who have supposedly visited the "lake." Purported locations of the "Underground Lake" are under Belgreen High School, "down the road from BHS," etc. The lake, however, is not a myth. People are merely confused as to its real location. It is known for a fact that the lake is located on private property.</p>
<p><b>Franklin Animal Hospital</b> - Actually closer to Russellville than to Belgreen, this vetrinary clinic is operated by Belgreen native and resident Jimmy Britton. Dr. Britton treats many pets and farm animals in the Belgreen area and is thus a prominent community figure.</p>
<p><b>Country Carwash &amp; Mini Storage</b> - Newly constructed by the principal of Belgreen High School, Eddie Britton, this now famous Belgreen landmark has earned a special place in the hearts of students at Belgreen High School. Because of its close proximity to the school, the carwash is a frequent gathering place for students on their way home from school.</p>
<p><b>"The Rock Cut"</b> - This is a section of a large rock formation that is cut out, allowing for a smooth transition of Highway 24 from Russellville to Belgreen. It is actually the bottom of an ancient ocean, and the same limestone deposit is quarryed elsewhere in the Belgreen area. The "Rock Cut" is a commonly referred to feature in local oral directions. The cut will have to be widened once the new lane of Highway 24 reaches it. It is unique cut from an engineering standpoint, as it is cut so as to allow for a four-way intersection. This gives it a cross-shape, which is obvious when viewed from the air.</p>
<p><b>Cedar Creek</b> - Cedar Creek is a local body of water that is mostly known as a popular area for bass fishing. It is a part of the Bear Creek lake system, operated by the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Valley_Authority_87b5.html" title="Tennessee Valley Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>. During the summer, fishing tournaments are held here nearly every weekend.</p>
<p><b>Glasgow Corners</b> - Glasgow Corners is a local intersection approximately three miles south from the school, which is commonly referenced in many oral directions.</p>
<p><b>Eddie Hicks Body Shop</b> - BHS Alumnus Eddie Hicks is the proprietor of the local auto body shop, which is also commonly referred to as a local landmark. The shop is around halfway between Russellville and Belgreen on the westbound side of Highway 24.</p>
<p><b>Slickrock</b> - "Slickrock" refers to a number of public facilities provided by TVA around the northern portions of Belgreen along Cedar Creek. Features include a swimming area, a campground, and a boat launch. These locations are usually more popular during the summer, as Cedar Creek is drained by TVA during the cold weather months.</p>
<p><a name="Myths" id="Myths"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgreen%2C_Alabama_4f46.html" title="Edit section: Myths">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Myths</span></h2>
<p>One of the distinguishing features of Belgreen is the collection of myths passed through oral tradition in the community. Whether the stories are true or not is not important. They are part of a rich tradition of Alabama storytelling that truly keeps Belgreen immortal, no matter how small the community is.</p>
<p><b>BHS Football</b> - Belgreen High School is one of the few schools in Alabama that does not have a football program. The reason for this has been debated for years. One story explains the reasoning for this is that a student was killed during a practice, which led to Belgreen being banned from ever playing the sport again. Another depicts Belgreen as being simply too small to have enough young men to play the game.</p>
<p><b>Moses Hollow</b> - Moses Hollow is a low lying region of road, approximately five miles away from Belgreen High School. It has a reputation of being "haunted," as some stories go. The most popular story involves the notion that if you were to leave your car in neutral at the bottom of the hill, a ghost will push you up the hill and leave handprints on the back bumper.</p>
<p><b>The "Belgreen Bear"</b> - Stories have also existed for years about a large grizzly bear in the area. Many residents have claimed to have seen the bear or areas in which the bear has damaged. Many residents have also claimed to have heard intimidating growls coming from forested areas. Actual accounts and pictures of the bear have come to surface, but they are few and far between.</p>
<p><b>The Circus Accident</b> - One commonly told legend amongst Belgreen natives is that which depicts an incident in which a caravan of circus animals wrecked on Old Highway 24. Thus, many non native animals were freed along parts of the community, which partially accounts for the "Belgreen Bear" in some retellings.</p>
