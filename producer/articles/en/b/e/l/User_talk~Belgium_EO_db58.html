<p>Hello! I see you have put a lot of effort in uploading images for the <a href="../../../z/a/t/Zatch_Bell%21_characters_f358.html" title="Zatch Bell! characters">Zatch Bell! characters</a> article. However, I reviewed them all, and noticed they are lacking a source. Could you please add the source (from where you picked the images) to each of them? If you have doubts, go to any image from that article, and see the Talk page where I explain how you should add the source. Images with no source can be deleted in the future, and is better to complete that information before you forget the source or once the article has been polished.

<li>Why did you move the mamodo that only appeared in the manga back to the middle of the ones featured in the anime? I found this to be confusing, which is why I made their own section. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 04:25, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Because there's no proof that they WEREN'T there. And after rewatching episode 51, I noticed that three of the tablets in the beginning depicted a squid, a bug-eyed thing with many tentacles, and a reptillian creature holding an axe. Definitely sounds like Ikageso, Isojin, and Hajime to me. S, they, at least, were there. EO out.</li>

<p>Stop re-adding the attacks, please. If you want it to stay, then explain me <b>why?</b> other then the fact it's nice every once in a while to look at such a list, it is completly useless.

<dd>Its been on wikipedia twice now... Once on the pages (as you keep re adding them onto) and they got deleted from the pages... Twice on their own attack page... The whole page got deleted. We set up thing on wikia because we couldn't get our own way here on wikipedia, the attacks sadly have no place on here. You can scream WP things at Kurigiri all century and it wn't make a difference, Kurigiri is <b>correct</b> in removing them. And that comment is not helpful in explainig why you kept insisting they remain. So why did you link, from what I could tell, it wasn't a fight between the two and all Kurigiri asked was you give a very good reason for readding them. That wasn't too difficult a request to do you know. ^_- <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 08:41, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You seem incapable of understanding the words 'Please stop adding the Attacks List'. You have yet to give a solid reason for their stay. While they have played an important role in the sotyr <b>most</b> have appeared once and since gone never to be mentioned again. At least halt putting them back in until we've finished our discussion on them, its the smart Wikipedian thing to do. There are 3 people at least against them, convince us they can stay and you'd be allowed to re-add them. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 16:25, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You shouldn't jump in and create pages without thinking, esp. to do with One Piece. Maybe Burukku will be a Straw Hat and maybe not... Its too early. We cannot take it as certain right now. It doesn't matter he has a page for now, but if he turns out to be a minor character that page will have to go. Don't worry, your not the first person guilty of this (<i>I did it with the Yonkou, but that was different slightly... In they'll be a bigger plot device later</i>). But point is, you really should think it through first. We know next to nothing on him.</p>
