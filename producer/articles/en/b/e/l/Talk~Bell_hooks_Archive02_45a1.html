<h2><span class="mw-headline">commencement speech</span></h2>
<p>I have adjusted this section according to the comments above. Again, I don't think we need such a section at all, since I don't think the speech is all that notable, but if we are going to post it here, we should post various views on it. The claim of frontpage that she was attacking her audience is false, according to the Austin Chronicle, and her comments should be set in the proper context, as the quotes I added attempt to do. I renamed the section since none of this really criticizes her ideas; it just suggests that she made a speech that was not well-received. I think a separate criticism section that actually addresses her ideas would be nice here.--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are on as shaky ground as insisting <s>Frontpage</s> that rag is patently unreliable when you confidently assert the Chronicle article clearly contradicts Frontpage's description of Hooks' behavior. The Chronicle article's ameliorating description stops short of saying Hooks didn’t attacked the audience <u>at all</u>; it just says she didn't call them something derogatory. But rather than making the focus be whether hooks <i>did or did not</i> attack the audience, which I think is missing the point, let us focus on why the speech was controversial. Among the things that are notable is that the audience <u>felt</u> attacked, which even the Chronicle article supports, as evidenced by the audience member's letter to the newspaper and the article's direct quote from a professor who actually offers an explanation as to why the audience felt that way. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 05:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The description from the Chronicle contextualizes hooks' comments as something other than blatant attacks on the audience (feel free to read the description yourself). Again, I don't think any of this is notable at all, but if we are going to note it, Frontpage's incredibly one-dimensional "summary" of the speech should not be the sole representation of it. Let's get real - I want to see actual criticism of hooks' ideas here, not the non-notable information that an audience once booed her at a speech. Get it?--<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 08:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As previously noted, I disagree with the idea that the speech's controversy isn't notable but I'm in complete agreement that Frontpage's comments should not be the only representation of it. I think you "went overboard" with the amount of sympathetic reviews but recognize your intent to balance. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 20:51, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What amound of sympathetic reviews are you talking about? The only thing I put in there that could be perceived as sympathetic is the quote from the Reverend. I don't see any evidence that this speech is notable other than sputtering smears from fring sources. A sentence or two is more than is necessary, but if you insist on presenting quotes from the likes of Glazov, we're going to need to contextualize it with comments from others.-<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 00:25, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Potentially valuable material that needs verification</span></h2>
<p>All information in WP articles must be verifiable (and, BTW, as the "living" version of {{<a href="../../../w/p/b/Template%7EWPBiography_858b.html" title="Template:WPBiography">WPBiography</a>}} at the top of this talk page states, this is especially urgent, even on the talk page, in cases of negative assertions about living and thus libelable people). At this point i'm using this section (but you can't assume others who use it will do the same) for two situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>statements that have been contradicted (including replacement with something that is consistent, even tho each asserts something the other doesn't)</li>
<li>statements whose verifiablity is unlikely, because what is asserted either is rarely documented when true, or is so ambiguous that the content of any verification will probably support a more valuable assertion.</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases of either situation, work is needed. IMO, the level of attention given, in the article's editing, to getting attention for editors' PoVs on her (or to making naming-magic more powerful) implies that if good information is temporarily obscured, that will be compensated by speeding net improvement of the article.</p>
<p><a name="Intent_of_her_pen_name" id="Intent_of_her_pen_name"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Intent of her pen name</span></h3>
<p>_ _ I've removed all reference to who she named herself after and why she downcases it, since all of this came into the article in multiple different accounts and without reason, let alone verifiable reason, being given. IMO such info will improve the article, <i>when we have something verifiable to put in</i>.<br />

<dd>The name is that of her maternal grandmother; hooks writes that it is spelled in lower-case letters to emphasize that the content of her work is more important than her name.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In fact, as i was surprised to stumble onto, at least one other revision (which i've lost track of) says Bell Hooks was her</p>
<dl>
<dd>great-grandmother</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's possible that one (or all) of these is someone's misremembering of something verifiable, or (since they are not clearly inconsistent) that all of them have a verifiable basis, in which case what we need to state is the various versions <i>she</i> has asserted, since we are unlikely to find definitive facts beyond the fact that she said one or more things.<br />
_ _ (In case someone is diligent enough to trace thru the full history of the article's treatment of the intent of her pen name, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=18138379&amp;oldid=16083848" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=18138379&amp;oldid=16083848" rel="nofollow">edit changing</a> from stating her purpose to stating <i>her account of</i> it is based on no reference: it should be obvious that knowing intent is never possible for anyone but the intender, so that a statement about another's intent is either a sloppy account about what the other <i>said</i>, or an unverifiable opinion. Either she said it, or Antonio has made a fool of me; i have no better source, and it would be appropriate for someone concerned about covering this aspect to seek one, since Antonio probably didn't just make it up.)<br />
