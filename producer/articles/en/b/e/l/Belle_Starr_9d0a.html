<p><b>Myra Maybelle Shirley Reed Starr</b> better known as <b>Belle Starr</b> (<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a> – <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_3.html" title="February 3">February 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>) was famous as an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female.html" title="Female">female</a> <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outlaw.html" title="Outlaw">outlaw</a>. Her legend developed soon after her death and she quickly became more famous for the impossibly fantastic legend than for anything she could have ever genuinely done. Depending on which parts of the legend(s) one reads and/or believes, she married no fewer than three of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cole_Younger_982e.html" title="Cole Younger">Younger brothers</a> and had her first child by Cole Younger. She had control (even carnal control) over every cutthroat brigand, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larceny.html" title="Larceny">horse thief</a>, and bank robber in <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Territory_1bdc.html" title="Indian Territory">Indian Territory</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. Every person she had any dealings with was on the wrong side of the law, even including her father. She kept a <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diary.html" title="Diary">diary</a>. She ran criminal gangs like a 19th century <a href="../../../m/a/_/Ma_Barker_5296.html" title="Ma Barker">Ma Barker</a> and even began her exploits during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> where she was described as being anything from a <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy.html" title="Spy">spy</a>, to a courier of military intelligence information, to being the only female <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html#Military_leaders" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate General</a> (even though, at that time, she was 13 to 17 years old).</p>
<p>In truth, there exists no evidence predating her death to support any of the above legend but nevertheless, such is the legend of Belle Starr. The <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_method.html" title="Historical method">historical</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary evidence</a> describes a woman who was very different and far more ordinary.</p>

In the <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860s.html" title="1860s">1860s</a> her father sold the farm and moved the family to Carthage buying an <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inn.html" title="Inn">inn</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livery_stable.html" title="Livery stable">livery stable</a> on the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_square.html" title="Town square">town square</a> where the young May Shirley received a classical education and learned piano.

In fact, she knew the Younger brothers and the James boys because she grew up with them in Missouri, and her brother, Bud, served with them in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantrill%27s_Raiders_ab70.html" title="Quantrill's Raiders">Quantrill's Raiders</a> in the Confederate Army, alongside another local Missouri boy, Jim Reed. Her brother John Allison Shirley, Bud, had attained the rank of Captain while serving as one of Quantrill's Scouts. Bud was killed in Sarcoxie Missouri, while he and another scout were being fed at the home of a Confederate sympathizer, Union troops surrounded the house and when Bud attempted an escape, was shot and killed in 1864. {The <a href="../../../y/o/u/Younger_Brothers_cad8.html" title="Younger Brothers">Younger Brothers</a> were involved in the killing of 3 law officers in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>.

<p>After the war the Reed family, too, moved to Scyene and she married Jim in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, giving birth to her first child, Rosie Lee (nicknamed Pearl) in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>.

<p>According to the fiction that grew up around her after her death she was briefly married to Bruce Younger in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>, but again, this was entirely unsubstantiated by any primary evidence.

<p>After Sam died, the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend.html" title="Legend">legend</a> has her associated with several men (almost all of whom died violently and some on Judge Parker's <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallows.html" title="Gallows">gallows</a> at Fort Smith), but again, without foundation. In fact, in order to hang on to her interests in her residence on Indian land she very quickly married a member of Sam's extended family, Jim July Starr. In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>, she was, herself, killed - shot out of the saddle with a shotgun. There were no witnesses but there were many suspects with apparent motive including her husband and both her children. A neighbor, Edgar A. Watson, was tried but acquitted for her murder. There was no further investigation and the case is still considered <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_case.html" title="Cold case">"unsolved"</a>.</p>

<p>One of the more unique adaptations of the legend of Belle Starr was made by the Japanese mangaka Akihiro Itou - perhaps best known to Western audiences as the creator of Geobreeders - who, in 1993, created a manga known as Belle Starr Bandits. Freely inspired by her life and exploits, the two volume series takes several liberties with historical figures, facts, and events, and, in spite of its heavily comedic and action-orented overtones, portrays Belle Starr as something of a tragic figure. Initially a somewhat ditzy young girl who just happens to be a crack shot, she is, as time progresses, forced to accept living life as an outlaw due to a series of misunderstandings and circumstances beyond her control, eventually developing a kind of inner strength and iron resolve as a result of her experiences.</p>
<p>The framing sequence of the story takes place in Canada in 1932 and chronicles the efforts of a female author and Belle Starr afficianado to write the definitive work on the female outlaw by uncovering the truth about her life and times.</p>
<p>Originally serialized in Fujima Fantasia and later in Dragon Comics, the only known foreign translation was made by the French publisher Pika Edition as part of their Manga Player Collection series in 1997, though, for unknown reasons, translation work ceased following the release of Volume 1. While still available for purchase online and elsewhere, the series is currently out of print and a release of the second and final volume seems highly unlikely after a nearly decade-long hiatus.</p>
<p>In addition, a 1941 film with little historical connection and a 1980 television movie were made with the title Belle Starr.</p>
