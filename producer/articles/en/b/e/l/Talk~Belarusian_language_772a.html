<p>Was Belarusian subject to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polonization.html" title="Polonization">polonization</a> or not? It is evident that Belarusian has incorporated a great quantity of Polish words. Still <a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">Rydel</a> has deleted link to polonization. What's the matter with it? — <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonedula_2d17.html" title="User:Monedula">Monedula</a> 14:35, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Monedula, I don't know what you are talking about.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there <b>was</b> Polonization in Belarus. The word polonization refers to the process that took place after we made a union with the Poles, the famous Recz Paspalitaja, and our nobles and even some simple people started switching to Polish, started educating their kids in Polish, etc. This is what Polonization means.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am not aware of any polonization that took place inside the Belarusian language. I never heard of the term "polonization" in the linguistic sense. I should add, Old Belarusian language basically died, became extinct, stopped existing (thanks to Poles and Russians!). And there was a big hiatus between Old Belarusian of the times of the Grand Duchy and the modern Belarusian. And I never heard anything about polonization <i>of the modern Belarusian language</i> at any point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I'm looking forward to hearing from you. And I'd like to see some concrete example. E.g. some concrete grammatical, syntactical features that let's say Old Belarusian did <b>not</b> have, and that modern Belarusian does have, and that it was indeed from the Polish language that this particular change came from.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm really excited about your new discoveries. --<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a> 18:08, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I guess that Monedula meant the huge number of Belaru<del>s</del>sian words of Polish origin. There are lots of such words in many languages, but it should be noted that it had nothing to do with <i>polonisation</i> of the language. Similarily, the huge number of Turkish words in Russian language does not mean that Russian was <i>turkified</i>. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 19:29, Dec 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe that was what she was referring to, to the <i>common vocabulary</i> between the two languages (Belarusian and Polish). Overall, and this is just my personal opinion, a real IMHO, etymology often seems to be a pseudo-science, that people use for political means. This whole "word origin" thing often times seems very fishy, IMHO.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, it's customary to speak of Belarusan having thousands of Polish loan words. But are they loan words? Who determined that? Some people found them in older Polish texts, and didn't find them in some Old Ruthenian texts? Is that the proof? I think the only proof would be 12-16th century audio tapes from Warszawa, Krakow, Bialystok, Hrodna, Navahradak, Vorsza, Polacak.&#160;;) Otherwise, it's all a bit suspcious, and could be used for political means. Are "cikavy" and "ciekawy" cognates, or we should call it a Polish loan word? Are "siastra" and "siostra" cognates, or we should call it a Polish cognate? How about <i>abzac, bursztyn, babior, dach, tlumaczyc, drot, jajka, jesci, plaszka, hvalt, hurok, handal, klajnot, kufar, koszt, kuchnia, lamantavac, lichtar, nyrki, achviara, kvitok, rachunak, szyba, szynka, szryft, szrot, szvagier, szpacyravac, sztraf, talerka, chvala, cybula</i>? And thousands of others. Are they Polish? Are they Belarusian? Well, in fact, all the Belarusian words that I just wrote are, most probably, German loan words. So does it mean somebody "germanized" our language? I really have no answers to that, and I don't really like the answers I hear from the traditional "etymology specialists". --<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a> 20:14, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, if there was no polonization, then what do you mean by "Russification" of Belarusian, and why it must be mentioned? — <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonedula_2d17.html" title="User:Monedula">Monedula</a> 22:24, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far my understanding goes, the term russification primarily means this (the same as with polonization): Belarusian-speaking people (mostly villagers) switching to Russian which is perceived as more "prestigious" and "urban" language, and Belarusian-speaking people educating their children in Russian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And when I say "government pursuing russification policies" I mean that in spite of the fact that equality of the two languages is proclaimed in the Constitution of this country, one of the languages is most of the time ignored, abandoned, not used, and simply discriminated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the Russification of our language (i.e. from the linguistic perspective), I guess the best example is the Bolshevik's reform of 1933. This reform changed the language quite a bit, and affected the language for 70+ years, and it's still in place. (And there never was such a reform at any point in the past when someone would forcefully introduce some Polish grammatical, syntactical or other features into our language. It simply never happened). --<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a> 23:14, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, the reform of 1933 is the only thing that makes the difference? And did it really make Belarusian more like Russian? Russian language was reformed, too (in 1918), but it did not make it any worse. — <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonedula_2d17.html" title="User:Monedula">Monedula</a> 23:34, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It did. 1933 reform was mostly a reform of orthographical rules, which means obviously that only spelling rules were changed. So theoretically it should've only affected the spelling, not how the language is spoken. But, of course, in practice it turned out differently. Here is an example (arguably one of the most damaging changes of that reform). This reform cancelled soft sign to show palatalization. E.g. before 1933 you had to write "сьнег", "песьня". And after 1933 the soft sign was abandoned, so you had to write "снег", "песня" (exactly like in Russian). Of course, you still had to pronounce all those words just the way you did before. But now the writing looked more like Russian, and I personally noticed that it affects pronunciation: most of the Russian-speaking kids from Minsk when they learn Belarusian in school, pronounce such words "лазня", "з'ява", "свет" just like in Russian, with hard з and с. They simply don't realize they should pronounce it very softly сь, зь (сЬвет, зЬява), almost like in Polish.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>After 1933 there was another reform in Soviet 1957, which did some damage too, but only a little bit. Unfortunately there is very little information in English about either of the two reforms. Here is one article which I put on pravapis: <a href="http://www.pravapis.org/art_belarusian_lecture_1968.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.pravapis.org/art_belarusian_lecture_1968.asp" rel="nofollow">1968: Grammatical Changes in Modern Literary Belarusian Language, Professor R. G. A. de Bray</a>. The professor is not an expert in Belarusian language studies, so he himself misunderstood a couple things, but in any case I guess that's the best text in English so far about 1933 reform that is available online as of this moment. --<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, if "they" really wanted to Russify Belarusian spelling, why did they change so little? Just replace all <i>ці, дзі, це, дзе, ць, дзь</i> with <i>ти, ди, те, де, ть, дь</i>, replace all <i>ў</i> with <i>в</i>, replace some stressless <i>а</i> and <i>я</i> with <i>о</i> and <i>е</i>, and the resulting language will be difficult to distinguish from Russian. But nobody tried to do what. So, I suppose, the spelling reform was motivated by the internal logic of Belarusian, not by desire to "Russify" it. (In 1930s, the standard Russian did not differ from Belarusian in the matter of softening <i>с</i> in <i>песня</i> and <i>снег</i> — the hard <i>с</i> here is only a recent phenomenon). — <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonedula_2d17.html" title="User:Monedula">Monedula</a> 11:28, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, anyway, this is a bizarre question, a strange way of trying to play Devil's advocate perhaps? "Why did they do so little?" My guess is that (1) there were enough resistence within that system (among linguists), (2) it was not possible to do much more damage within that system. Changing it any more than that would mean really to create a new system, which would not be phonetic at all. While modern Belarusian (like many other newer languages) by definition tries to be as phonetic as possible, it's considered to be a fundamental principle "як чуецца, так і пішацца" (although of course, it's no 100% phonetic). Now, I personally wouldn't mind using the "traditional" way, because that would create a tighter and more obvious link with the old language of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. But I think it would be more difficult for people to be able to read and write properly in that language. So personally I am fine with what we got from our early 20th century linguists.</dd>

<dd><i>the resulting language will be difficult to distinguish from Russian</i> — yes, it is an exaggeration. Still many Belarusian words would become spelled identically with the Russian ones. (It has nothing to do with phonetic changes — Russian <i>ти</i> is in reality pronounced as <i>ці</i>!) The simple reality is that, both in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, nobody cared to "Russify" Belarusian language. What purpose would it serve? <b>The actual policy was to teach standard Russian language to everyone.</b> — <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonedula_2d17.html" title="User:Monedula">Monedula</a> 13:16, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr.Anonymous and Monedula just proved that they've never been to Belarus and that they do not know anything about current sociolinguistic situation in that country.

<dd>Here's just one example for you ladies and gentlemen: There is <b>not a single school</b> in Minsk (almost two million people, the capital) where all subjects are taught in Belarusian. Lukashenka closed them all down. Get it: there is not a single Belarusian-language school in 1.5-million capital.

<dl>
<dd>Hey-hey, hold your horses, Russian miss. This is like a totally new, different article. I personally disagree with the changes. I propose that we discuss each change step-by-step and then do it (or not do it).</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>1</b>) First, I don't agree with the restructuring. Can you explain the reason for shifting paragraphs and sentences around? I think it weakened the chronological and logical flow.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, quite the reverse — I just attempted to put everything in chronological order. Maybe something got wrong, but we can work it out. Do not revert it wholesale.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And here are some other concerns that I have:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>2</b> <i>After <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_Poland_7a0c.html" title="Partitions of Poland">partitions of Poland</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a>-<a href="../../../1/7/9/1796.html" title="1796">1796</a>), the Belarusian territory was incorporated into <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a>. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has historically lacked a strong nationalistic drive.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Did you forget about Kosziuszko's anti-russian uprising and Kalinouski anti-russian uprising and Slucak anti-bolshevik uprising? No one lacked identity at that point. The problem with Belarus' identity is the problem of USSR times and Russification policies. The above sentence is in both versions, but in the original version this phrase does not stand next to 1772-1796, so it does not create a false time frame association with the 18th century.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To what time it belongs, then? In Soviet times, at least, there was no problem with Belarusian identity, because Belarusians had their own republic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3</b> <i>By the 16th century, the term "ruski" ("Russian" or "<a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenian</a>" in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>) continued to refer to the language spoken in modern-day <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and Belarus, not to the language of Muscovy (the Russians).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It is a fact. Why did you delete that? You, Muscovites, wanted to call your language "Russian", that's true, but it's very important to note that back then no one else called it "Russian". Later, yes. But not in 16th century. "Russian" was refered to "Old Ruthenian" or "Old Belarusian". For example, one of the many sources is <a href="http://txt.knihi.com/mova/dyplamat.html" class="external free" title="http://txt.knihi.com/mova/dyplamat.html" rel="nofollow">http://txt.knihi.com/mova/dyplamat.html</a> Дыпляматычная кантравэрсыя 1646 году за беларускую мову. (And this is even 17th century - Polish, Litvins, Ruthenes still resisted calling your language "Russian", even a century later)</p>
<p>I suspect the major reason for juggling with paragraphs and sentences was to delete this sentence. Very cunning.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I did not delete it, but moved to a different place. You just did not notice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>4</b> <i>A process of divergence that accelerated in the 17th century, created a new division between the languages spoken in the south (Ukraine) and north (Belarus) of Ruthenian-speaking territory.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This was deleted too without any grounds for doing that. Care to explain?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The division appeared much earlier. For instance, the transition of "o" → "a" in unstressed syllables appeared in the 15th century (and Belarusian shares this feature with Russian language, not with Ukrainian!). And the Ukrainian transition "o" → "i" (not featured in Belarusian) appeared in the 15th century too (possibly even earlier). So the phrase about 17th century is clearly disinformation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>5</b> <i>The Belarusization was stalled and even reversed since <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>. The orthographic reform of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, although minor, is seen by some as an attempt to "russify" Belarusian language. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> Russian language become an obligatory subject in all Soviet schools. The final blow was the school reform of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, when parents were given right to select the language of instruction for their children. After that, more and more people began to send their children to Russian-language schools, and the number of Belarusian-language schools began to diminish.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>"is seen by some" is ridiculous. <b>The only reason</b> for the reform was to bring the spelling (orthographic) rules closer to Russian. Period. I don't think anybody ever questioned that. It's obvious. Just read something about the reform or compare the spelling rules.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nonsence! If someone really wanted to "Russify" Belarusian language, one could just reintroduce the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Belarusian_language_6afa.html" title="Old Belarusian language">Old Belarusian</a> spelling, which is <b>much</b> closer to modern Russian spelling. Obviously that was not the issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>6</b> <i>The interest to Belarusian language was revived at the end of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> during <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perestroika.html" title="Perestroika">perestroika</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> Belarusian became the only official language of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_SSR_193d.html" title="Belarusian SSR">Belarusian SSR</a>, and a second campain of Belarusization followed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Has it become the only official language of BSSR or independent Belarus? I think BSSR is wrong here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it's true! In 1990 Belarusian was proclaimed the official language of Belarusian SSR! And Russian was not!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>7</b> <i>However, the Belarusization proved to be unpopular, and at the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> Referendum people overwhelmingly (83.3%) voted for giving Russian language an equal status with Belarusian.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>God! Ridiculous! What's next? You'll write that Saddam Husseyn is more popular and democratic than <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, because Clinton got only 43% of the popular vote, and Saddam Husseyn got almost 99.999%? Of course, that Lukashenka's referendum was rigged and falsified. No one knows what were the real figures. Whether it was 1% or 99% for any of the questions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh! I see. If you dislike a referendum, you just declare it rigged. Can you give some proof that it was rigged? So far as I know, people really disliked the Belarusification campaign of early 1990s.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>8</b> <i>This lack of a strong ethnolinguistic identity, along with the popular association of Belarusian dialects as rural, peasant languages as opposed to Russian's modern/urban connotations, is seen by some as a threat that may lead to the eventual extinction of the Belarusian language in Belarus.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think that refers to Soviet times and early 90's. Nowdays the socio-linguistic situation is different and not so simple.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Try to ajust the sentence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dd><b>9</b> <i>The situation changed dramatically after the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> and the creation of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusian_SSR_193d.html" title="Belarusian SSR">Belarusian SSR</a>.

It was the only then that the notions of "Belarus" and "Belarusian language" have become clear-cut.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>My god, you are putting things upside down, giving credit to Bolsheviks for something which they actually fought against. What's your agenda here, by inserting this misinformation?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are totally misinformed. Bolsheviks have <i>never</i> fought against Belarusian. Of course, at times massive repressions caused disruption, but, all in all, Belarusian had a firm position in Belarusian SSR, and Belarusian culture was well subsidized.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, you should not start with <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, but mention the <a href="../../../b/n/r/BNR_20b4.html" title="BNR">BNR</a> of 1918, the first national state that really cared about national values. And in 1917 Russians were not even in Belarus. There were Germans on our territory. World War I, ok?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>BNR was ephemerial and disappeared without traces. Modern Belarus is a successor of Belarusian SSR, that's clear.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second, please provide facts on "forced Belarusization". Who was forced? When? By whom?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bolsheviks forced everyone in Belarus to study Belarusian language, and children were sent to Belarusian-language schools without asking the parents what langauge they preferred. All administration and legal affairs began to be carried out in Belarusian. Many people really disliked this. If you want facts, just read something beyond the official Polish propaganda.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Third, what is "clear-cut", and what was not "clear-cut" before the Bolsheviks?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Before 1920, Belarusian language was just a collection of rural dialects, plus a few literary works written and read mainly by Polish nationalists. <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_243b.html" title="1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica">1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> stated that Belarisian dialects belong to Russian language. Most Belarusian peasants called themselves not Belarusians, but <i>tutejshiye</i> ("local people"). The real Belarusian identity was created by Bolshevics (and not by the Polish).</dd>

<li>I believe that some restructuring could be in place. Also, Monedula's version had certain advantages too. I guess the best solution would be to prepare a new version that would be the mixture of both versions.</li>
<li>Both of you are right here - to some extent. OTOH perhaps the wording should be changed, but the basic idea seems true - while the Belarusian folks openly supported the fight of others and in this aspect were the direct descendants of the Great Duchy, there is a huge difference between the sense of national identity in Poland or Ukraine and in Belarus. The Ruthenian gentry (and peasants as well, at least to a certain degree) took part in both <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_Uprising_d8bc.html" title="January Uprising">January Uprising</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_Uprising_49a4.html" title="November Uprising">November Uprising</a>, the movement was by no means massive. Also, with Kalinoŭski's role in the January Uprising the modern Belarussian was starting, it was an early beginning. The sentiments were strong, but aimed in different directions. In <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> the difference between a Belarusian, Pole or Lithuanian was still difficult to tell. <i>Lithuania, my motherland</i> wrote Mickiewicz - about Belarus.. The same was also true for Kościuszko who was a Pole, yet he was a Lithuanian (and Belarusian). Such a statement of identity was not contradictory at that time. Also, note the number of <i><a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutejsi.html" title="Tutejsi">tutejsi</a></i> even in 20th century. So, IMO Monedula's statement about <i>lack of strong nationalistic drive</i> seems acceptable.</li>
<li>Indeed the deleted sentence seemed true. I have no idea why was it deleted either.</li>
<li>See above</li>
<li>Indeed, this seems like an introduction of unnecessary <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_term.html" title="Weasel term">weasel term</a>.</li>
<li>Hmmm... never heard of SSRs adopting a new sole national language.</li>
<li>Indeed, the effects of the voting and the actual support for Lukashenka are openly questioned by almost anyone in the world. Even if the election results were true (which I seriously doubt), I believe we should avoid using them as a proof of anything unless any hard evidence is available - which I doubt will happen anytime soon...</li>
<li>Perhaps the situation is even more complex than it was, but I personally met a young couple from Minsk who told me that they knew Belarusian, but they never used it since they didn't want to be considered <i>peasants</i>. (BTW, they changed their mind after two years of studying here in Warsaw).</li>
<li>Well, initially the bolsheviks were not as Russo-centric as they were since late 1920's or early 1930's. Although the political independence of the <i>national regions</i> (SSRs, autonomous regions and such) was limited and mostly theoretical, initially they had a vast cultural autonomy. Even the Poles were given two autonomous districts with Polish-language schools and Polish newspapers. What happened later is a different story though.</li>
<li>Indeed this article deserves expansion. However, for me the arguments about <i>Soviet propaganda</i> are too strong. Let's just cool down and try to cooperate, without offending other contributors. Ok? Please leave the Polish propaganda/ Soviet propaganda/ Martian propaganda arguments on the side and try to prepare a great article. And please, stop the revert war, or else the article gets blocked and we'll have to cope with <i>the wrong version</i>, whichever it is. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 20:18, Jan 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Even if Monedula does not speak a word in Belarusan she might know a lot about it - as a historian, for instance. But please, be so kind as to show some maturity (both of you) and refrain yourself from future remarks similar to "Soviet propaganda", "Polish propaganda" and so on. This leads nowhere, i had the same disease when I first entered <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_7e23.html" title="Talk:Gdansk">Talk:Gdansk</a> some year ago and saw some nationalist idiots wanting to promote their stupid POV over and over again.

<dd>That's leads to a question that most smaller languages/cultures have to answer (let's say under 10 million). Can Danes or Slovaks or Norwegians or Belarusians survive by only knowning their native tongue? The answer is "yes" and "no". (Besides, there is at least one good counter-example: 10 millions of Hungarians. Hungarians had a state in Europe for 1000 years, they have rich culture, rich history, and they never really had a problem of losing their mother tongue). IMHO, the problem with Belarus is that it'd be wiser (and nicer) if the first foreign language would've been English, not Russian. --<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a> 02:03, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Under the Soviets, there was also the elimination of the Belarusian middle class between 1917 and 1941 by the Communist Party; in Kurapaty (a suburb of Minsk), the NKVD killed perhaps 100,000 people. Many thousands of people were sent to concentration camps (Gulag) or resettled to Siberia. Around 400 Belarusian authors were repressed during anti-nationalism campaigns that started around 1929 and culminated during the Great Purge."</p>
<p>If you want to bring this home again and again, put it in the "History of Belarus" article. All in all the history section look more like "History of Belarusian nationalism", then language. Related, of course. Not identical though. It has to be rewritten somewhat.</p>

</ol>
<p>Something is fishy here. First, AFAIK, by Belarussian orthography, there cannot be an unstresed "o". So I guess this phrase is written from the point of view that Belarusian langauge is a dialect of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>. Second, what kind of "e" is spoken about? "<a href="../../../y/e/_/Ye_%28Cyrillic%29_56fe.html" title="Ye (Cyrillic)">е</a>" or <a href="../../../e/_/%28/E_%28Cyrillic%29_1c55.html" title="E (Cyrillic)">e</a>? I guess, the second one, if my "dialectologic" guess is correct. It can be unstressed in Belarusian orthography, but only in non-slavic loanwords, AFAIK, and I am not so sure in such words, e.g, "syntez", it reduces to "a"; I would rather think of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwa.html" title="Schwa">schwa</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 20:55, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see a growing number of articles using <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacinka.html" title="Lacinka">lacinka</a> for various <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarusian</a> names. While I agree that it is best suited for the phonetics of the Belarussian language, it is far cry for being in English language usage, which is now transliteration (and I have serious doubts about other langauges as well, including Belarussian itself; in the latter case it is a matter of entusiasts of belarussian national revival). Therefore usage of lacinka is against wikipedia policies, not to say it makes names nonrecognizable.</p>
<p>I am going to start removing lacinka as main usage everywhere I see it. Wikipedia is not a vehicle for promotion of some POV (including POV on how to write in Belarusian language). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 16:21, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the case of Minsk is obvious. However, in cases where there is no commonly accepted English name I believe we should use lacinka for transliteration - as that is what it's for. Similarily, in Wikipedia we use Russian system of transliteration for Russian names, Japanese for Japanese language, Pinyin for Chinese and so on. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 06:15, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm presently writing biographies on sport shooters, and there are quite a few Belarusian ones. I wonder what transliteration I should use for these. The <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Shooting_Sport_Federation_1160.html" title="International Shooting Sport Federation">International Shooting Sport Federation</a> itself seems to use Russian-style transliterations (Sergei Martynov, Igor Basinski etc), but I'm not sure whether that's a preference given to them by the Belarusian shooting federation, or just an old habit that hasn't been broken. I <i>have</i> seen 2000-style transliterations (Siarhei Martynau, Ihar Basinski) in some situations. What should we use here? (So far the only entry in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Category%7EBelarusian_sport_shooters_f49d.html" title="Category:Belarusian sport shooters">Category:Belarusian sport shooters</a> is <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanstantsin_Lukashyk_1e92.html" title="Kanstantsin Lukashyk">Kanstantsin Lukashyk</a>, which is what the ISSF uses.) -- <a href="../../../j/a/o/User%7EJao_0764.html" title="User:Jao">Jao</a> 18:01, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The question about naming Belarusian sportsmen is not quite easy. Almost every sportsman has numerous available transliterations of his name and different organisations use different transliteration. I propose this algorithm to select proper transliteration for Wikipedia:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>First of all, check if there is one widely used name transliteration for this sportsman (for example, he is playing in club in Western Europe); if it is available, one should use this transliteration. See <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Gurenko_0ed3.html" title="Sergei Gurenko">Sergei Gurenko</a> (while he is probably transliterated <i>Siarhei Hurenka</i> in his international passport), <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitali_Kutuzov_a4e9.html" title="Vitali Kutuzov">Vitali Kutuzov</a> and so on.</li>
<li>Second, check any official protocols on international competitions. We usually can find really official transliteration in protocol, not something just translated (like on website). See <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Tikhon_399f.html" title="Ivan Tikhon">Ivan Tikhon</a> article for example (while his name should be transliterated <i>Ivan Cichan</i>).</li>
<li>If neither widely used nor official transliteration couldn't be found, one shouldn't prefer one website's transliteration over any other's - all they (even official ones) can give different transliterations created without any logic (often in Russian style). One should use direct one-to-one Cyrillics-to-<a href="../../../%C5%82/a/c/%C5%81acinka.html" title="Łacinka">Łacinka</a> transliteration, because it reflects name in Belarusian absolutely exactly. For shooters it should be <i>Siarhej Martynaǔ</i> and <i>Ihar Basinski</i>. Transliteration rules should be available on <a href="../../../%C5%82/a/c/%C5%81acinka.html" title="Łacinka">Łacinka</a> page. Anyway, feel free to consult about transliteration. --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkbel_aa4d.html" title="User:Monkbel">Monkbel</a> 10:51, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a serious question and not a political one. I want to know the real situation "on the ground".</li>
<li>I was born in Moscow. My mother tongue is Russian. Now i live in Israel, speak mostly Hebrew and English, but remember Russian well.</li>
<li>I have a great interest in languages and an above-average talent for language study. Although i never properly studied it, i can understand written Belarusian pretty well (i daresay - better than an average Russian-speaker).</li>
<li>I don't have the slightest sympathy towards neither Lukashenko nor Putin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the question:</p>
<p>Suppose that a group like BPF or whatever throws Lukashenko away. Flag is changed back to white-red-white, metro stations are renamed, integration with the Russian Federation is put on hold, etc. And then comes the question of language. What would actually happen in that field? The official status of Russian can be cancelled on paper, but what would the people do? How many would willingly and consciously <i>choose</i> to send their kids to the first grade of a Belarusian school? And if the child is already learning in a Russian school in the fifth grade, how many would choose to send him to the sixth grade in a Belarusian school? And to what extent Belarusian education will be forced?</p>
<p>And what about the adults? I study linguistics, and one of the most important i learnt is that people, especially adults, just <i>hate</i> when someone messes with the language they are used to. For example: What will actually happen if 50-years-old Russian speakers will have to fill out their tax forms written in Belarusian only? How many adult people who speak Russian at home are able to conduct a conversation in Belarusian or write it?</p>
<p>Yes, the referendum about the status of Russian might have been rigged, but what would be the results if it would not have been rigged? If all advertisement in Belarus is in Russian, as i read on some pro-Belarusian site, there must be a market demand for it - advertisers don't want their message to be misunderstood, so they use the language that people want; from this i understand that <i>Russian is what people want</i>. And please, please correct me if i'm wrong.</p>
<p>So the main question is: Is it possible to make Belarusian a viable state language in a democratic way, without forcing it on people?</p>
<p>I read the <i>pragrama</i> at the <a href="http://www.pbpf.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.pbpf.org/" rel="nofollow">BPF site</a>, in Belarusian. And even though i don't really <i>know</i> Belarusian i understood most of it and i didn't find a solution to this problem in their platform. I'm sure that they're not the only anti-Lukashenko movement, but they seem to be the dominant one (and correct me if i'm wrong).--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E.

<dd>I thought that i might get such an answer, that's why i wrote that this question is not political. Documenting the facts about the relations between Russian and Belarusian makes excellent encyclopedic material. I don't trust Russian and Lukashenko's official media that want me to believe no-one in Minsk cares about Belarusian and everyone speaks Russian. On the opposite side, anti-Lukashenko sites say that people know Belarusian but are afraid to speak it, but they have their bias too. So whom can i trust for solid facts? Wikipedia is far from perfect, but i found the dispute between rydel and monedula above very interesting and more than that - <i>scientific</i>. So yes, it does concern Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E. Aharoni</a> 14:14, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are difficult questions. I guess our neighbours could serve as role models for us. Ukrainian situation is the closest to ours (although they are ahead now, in terms of Ukrainization; for us the last 11 years have been totally lost, kind of like a "time machine" that took us back). Ideally, it would be cool to have something like Czech Republic or Poland where most people speak the state language. But I think this is highly unlikely to happen in Belarus within the next 20-30 years. So I guess it'll be something like Ukraine. And then, maybe, something like Switzerland or Canada, a country where, hopefully, Belarusian is a dominating state language, but other languages are respected, and speakers of those languages do not feel opressed. (Although Russians are a special case. Just look how they stage resistance in Latvia and don't have any respect for Latvia and Latvian language.) But we have only about 10-12% of Russians, fortunately. And the others (Russians-speaking Belarusians) will be on our side, if the Belarusization is done properly without causing them too much inconvenience. --<a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a> 14:33, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the way to approach this is to list some of the features which are defining or unique to Belarusian, and then some of the ways in which it is similar to related languages. Naturally, in the course of this contrasts, similarities, and influences of other particular languages can be mentioned where they are significant, but it doesn't have to start out as a comparison at all. It should be useful to a reader who knows nothing about Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, or Ukrainian. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2005-12-2&#160;01:39&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>They are definitely not identical. There are a lot of similarities, but they are definitely distinct languages.</li>
<li>The names are different, because the languages are different.</li>
<li>There are quite a lot of difference and theoretically an article could be written about them, but the very existence of this article wouldn't be NPOV, because that would imply that Belarusian is like a little sister of Russian, and Belarusians rightfully don't like it.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The more neutral reason do to it in spite of the above would be pragmatism: it is a fact that more people know Russian and there is considerably less research about Belarusian, so a comparison between Russian and Belarusian can serve as a quick overview for those who know Russian. But the politically - and scientifically - correct way to do it would be to write a three-way comparison of Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian and treat the three languages equally, being careful not to imply that Russian is some kind of a base language or that any of them is greater or older than the others. And sorry - i am not the man to do it (at least now - but i'm in the provess of studying the subject properly in the university).</dd>

<dd>Although it is not the most important difference, it is the most striking - the spelling rules are completely different. Accents of many words are different. Adjectives endings are different. Vocabulary is not the same at all. Some old Slavic words survived in Belarusian, but not in Russian (and vice versa). I'd better not go into details here, 'cuz i'll make terrible mistakes and then <a href="../../../r/y/d/User%7ERydel_a0e5.html" title="User:Rydel">rydel</a> might do to me what he did to <a href="http://www.br23.net/be/2005/11/21/pig-slaughter-video/" class="external text" title="http://www.br23.net/be/2005/11/21/pig-slaughter-video/" rel="nofollow">that pig</a>.</dd>

<dd>I've gotta say that i've seen at least one encyclopedia in which the article on Belarusian language consisted mostly of comparisons to Russian (i'm talking about Encyclopaedia Hebraica, an otherwise good encyclopedia in Hebrew printed in the 70's). While i can't deny that it was quite useful - especially for me - i didn't like it when i saw it a few years ago, and now i understand better then ever why it is wrong to write an encyclopedia like that.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E.

<p>Just the same, a comparison with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_language.html" title="Polish language">Polish language</a> can be made. Belarusian was heavily influenced by Polish. Also, there are words that exist only in Belarussian, and Belarussian has grammar traits found in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_language.html" title="Lithuanian language">Lithuanian language</a>. 21:31, 1 December 2005 (UTC) signed by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">user:Mikkalai</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually there are a lot of grammar traits of Lithuanian in Russian too - and vice versa. While true, it is definitely not the only thing that differentiates Russian and Belarusian. It wasn't (just) Polish and/or Lithuanian influence that made Belarusian distinct. A lot of people just find it really hard to accept that Russian and Belarusian are simply two related, but different languages - for whatever reasons. Just like Dutch and German, Spanish and Italian. Proper research of those differences and the reasons why they came to be is valid, but it's hard to find good scientific material amongst the various unscientific claims soaked in ignorance and stupid politics.--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E.

<p>Bonaparte, although they are from the same family, the languages are not identical. In fact, an average Russian speaker who didn't have any exposure at all to Belarusan or Ukrainian before, will probably understand very little (I'd say 25-30%, just a wild guess). Here are some places for you to start reading (this is just about vocabulary, for starters):</p>

<dd>Belarusian is also spoken in rural areas in Western Belarus. So in terms of the amount of Belarussian population, the answr to your question is "no". Even in rural it is to a various degree corrupted into <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Trasianka.html" title="Trasianka">trasianka</a></i>. In towns with population over 50,000 you will hear the Belarussian speech only rarely. Also, AFAIK the Belarussian diaspora in some places in Canada and USA pretty much tries to preserve the national culture. I don't know whether it is just a hobby or they use Belarussian at home as well, but I did hear them speak Belarussian very nicely. E.g., the Belarussian Sunday School in New Yourk is known (this reminds me to write an article Danchyk (Dančyk) (Данчык, Багдан Андрусішын, Bahdan Adrusišyn (Bahdan Adrusishyn))). All Belarussian topics are heavily undercovered in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:26, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, any dweller of a major city who consciously speaks Belarussian language in everyday life is 95% sure nationalist, in positive sense, the one who strives for the preservation of national culture and identity. (There are no Belarussian nationalists in "negative" sense: Belaruis is already a separate nation; it was/is negative only in Soviet lingo.

<p>The table is difficult to read, especially in a narrower browser window, which makes the text wrap—you can't tell where the rows start.

<p>I'd like to add that this table is very selective and designed to demonstrate differences between Russian and Belarusian best. Russian in particular has a lot of regional dialects and vocabulary that at times make it sound very much like Belarusian, for example; what's used here is the most common word TODAY; there are many older synonyms that are still widely used that diminish the apparent differences between Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian...and even Polish. The compilers of this table only take contemporary, official Russian words and ignore the vernacular totally. It is somewhat misleading. - V.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quite true. My mother who left Lviv during WWII often says <i>faino</i> or <i>znamenyto</i> in Ukrainian for "excellent!". I've rarely heard <i>pryvit</i> or <i>khorosho</i>, and I don't even know if non-Galician Ukrainians use pan/pani/panna very much or at all. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2005-12-8&#160;09:49&#160;Z</small></i></dd>

<b>I've seen this text on the Ukrainian language article. We should add something like this also!</b></p>
<p>Soviet policy towards the Ukrainian language changed abruptly in late <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, when <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> had already established his firm control over the party and, therefore, the Soviet state. In December, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, the regional party cells received a telegram signed by Molotov and Stalin with an order to immediately reverse the korenization policies. The telegram condemned Ukrainianization as ill-considered and harmful and demanded to "immediately halt Ukrainianization in <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raion.html" title="Raion">raions</a> (districts), switch all Ukrainianized newspapers, books and publications into Russian and prepare by autumn of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> for the switching of schools and instruction into Russian".</p>
<p>The following years were characterized by massive repression and many hardships for the Ukrainian language and people. Some historians, especially of Ukraine, emphasize that the repression was applied earlier and more fiercely in Ukraine than in other parts of the Soviet Union, and were therefore anti-Ukrainian; others assert that Stalin's goal was the generic crushing of any dissent, rather that targeting the Ukrainians in particular.</p>
<p>The Stalinist era also marked the beginning of the Soviet policy of encouraging Russian as the language of (inter-ethnic) Soviet communication. Although Ukrainian continued to be used (in print, education, radio and later television programs), it lost its primary place in advanced learning and republic-wide media. Ukrainian was considered to be of secondary importance, and an excessive attachment to it was considered a sign of nationalism and so "politically incorrect". At the same time, however, the new Soviet Constitution adopted in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> stipulated that teaching in schools should be in native languages. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">Bonaparte</font></a></p>

<dd>I don't claim to be a specialist in Belarusian language or the demographics of Belarus, so i won't tell who's right, but: User Rydel knows Belarusian (do you?), and learnt a couple of things about Belarusian linguistics (did you?) and he spent his childhood in Belarus (did you?).
<dl>
<dd>Well I lived in Volyn for five years along with my wife who is native Volynian herself. The Ukrainian dialect of Volyn is identical to the Belarusian Polessian dialect. Moreover I have absoloutely no problem understanding Volynian since I first heard it. (Although being from the Kuban, where the local dialect, balachka is spoken I cannot give an honest Russian POV). And having been preatty much everywhere in Belarus I cannot say that there was an instant where I could not understand what people were talking about (rural native Belarusian from Vitebsk to Brest, from Grodno to Gomel). And as for origin family records indicate a root to my Zaporozhian ancestors who in turn were runaway peasents from the modern territory of nothern Belarus (around Lida I presume). -- <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> 12:17, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_Poland_7a0c.html" title="Partitions of Poland">partitions of Poland</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a>–<a href="../../../1/7/9/1796.html" title="1796">1796</a>), the Belarusian territory was incorporated into <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a>. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has historically lacked a strong nationalistic drive. During the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> times, educated people of Belarus tended to identify themselves with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, and today some prominent persons are claimed both by Poland and Belarus for their nationality. More recently, the population of Belarus tends to identify itself as a close associate of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> (if not considering themselves Russian outright).</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this situation is the minority status of Belarusian speakers in urban areas—traditional cultural centers.

<p>After <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_Poland_7a0c.html" title="Partitions of Poland">partitions of Poland</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/7/1772.html" title="1772">1772</a>–<a href="../../../1/7/9/1796.html" title="1796">1796</a>), the Belarusian territory was incorporated into <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Russia_1215.html" title="Imperial Russia">Imperial Russia</a>. Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has historically lacked a strong nationalistic drive. During the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_68ac.html" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> times, educated historical people of Belarus tended to identify themselves with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, and today some prominent persons are claimed both by Poland and Belarus for their nationality. For the peasents, however, most continued to refer to themselves as Russian.</p>
<p>Initially Imperial Russian athorities thought that the language spoken by Belarusian peasents was nothing but Polonised Russian, nevertheless as Polish influence over the territory slackened, the Russification of Belarusian peasents proved counter productive. In the 1897 most refered to their home language as not Russian during Polish rule, but as Belarusian</p>
<p>Table In all respects the urban language of Belarusian towns remained either Polish or Russian and in the same census towns exceeding 50000 had Belarusian speakers of less than a tenth. This state of affairs greatly contributed to a perception that Belarusian is a "rural", "uneducated" language</p>
<p>However the census was a major brakethrough for the first steps of the Belarusian nation, as it clearely showed that by this point the population and the language was neither Polish nor Russian. In 1904 the Russian Imperial athorities legalised the language and Belarusian schools along with communities switched their language of communication. Initially only in Rural areas, but in cities all schools too were mandatory to include Belarusian language</p>
<p>And then: The Belarusization was stalled and even reversed beginning in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>. The orthographic reform of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> changed the Belarusian spelling rules and somewhat brought it closer to Russian.</p>
<p>The sentence:More recently, the population of Belarus tends to identify itself as a close associate of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> (if not considering themselves Russian outright), was moved towards the end of the article thus allowing for a continuous timeline.</p>

<dd>You also added wrong info, for instance "not Russian as they did during the Polish rule." The languge was referring to as "руська мова" (Ruthenian language), not Russian language.

<dd>To adress the points:
<ol>
<li>Actually by the 16th century the laguages would have been more similar to each other than by the mid-19th century. Unless of course you have audio cassetes with 16th century recordings.</li>
<li>Yes I have, actually I was going to expand the census table breaking into Rural and Urban, before you came and started trolling the article.</li>
<li>Like I am not against returning him unless of course his section be expanded. (Have a look from a side, circle of freinds of a Polish poet). So his page should also be expanded to accomodate these facts. If you will do them by all means return him back.</li>
<li>Now that is the confusion. Before 19th century all of the Ruthenian population of Astro-Hungary, Poland, and Malorossia were called Ruthenians. They called themselves Ruthenians as well. Russians translated that as Russians, whilst calling themselves Velikorossians (Great Russians). So they (wrongly) assumed that the dialect that local peasents spoke was nothing more than Polonised Russian. However after a century of depolonisation (which included disestablishment of the Uniate Church, the removal of Polish magnates and nobility from Belorossian lands) the national consciosness of Belarusian peasents rose. And in 1897 they overwhelmingly referred to their nationality nor as Ruthenian (which Russians wrongly interpreted as Russian) but as Belarusian. This is a very important historical fact.

<dd>Воссоединение униатов нанесло католицизму и полонизму в Белоруссии сокрушительный удар, от которого им уже не суждено было оправиться. Но каковыми оказались исторические последствия этого события для белорусов? Конечно, это все те последствия, которые историки связывают с вхождением Белоруссии в состав Российской империи, ведь, как мы уже говорили, без воссоединения Россия не сумела бы цивилизационно привязать к себе свой Северо-Западный край. Во-первых, ликвидация унии духовно соединила все части белорусского народа, расколотые унией, в единое целое, восстановило его цельность.[75] Во-вторых, подрыв позиций полонизма и католицизма в Белоруссии привел к постепенному возвращению белорусов к их истокам. В-третьих, воссоединение дало толчок становление самосознания народа, которое, прежде всего, выражается <b>языковым самоопределением</b>. Со всей очевидностью это явление нашло отражение <b>в результатах всеобщей переписи населения Российской империи, прошедшей в 1897 г. Здесь население всех белорусских губерний, и западных и восточных, однозначно назвало свой родной язык не русским, как во времена унии, но белорусским.</b>[76] В-четвертых, ликвидация унии придала <b>новый мощный импульс развитию белорусского языка, формированию его литературной формы</b>.[77] В-пятых, начало делать <b>первые шаги национально-культурное возрождение белорусов</b>. В-шестых, <b>возник научный интерес к изучению истории, этнографии и фольклора белорусского народа</b>. Из всего сказанного следует, что воссоединение униатов <b>сдвинуло с мертвой точки искусственно замороженный в Речи Посполитой процесс превращения белорусской народности в белорусскую нацию</b> That is what I inputed into the article back in first edit. If Rydel knows so much about his native language why would he remove one of the most significant historical details which allowed to transform a peasent dialect into an officially recognised language? -- <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> 22:50, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where a language disappears, there you have the disappearance also of the national structure and the national spirit. The death of a language is the death of its people.</p>
<p>The case of Belarusian, a national and co-official language, which the great majority of the population of Belarus considers as its mother tongue, but which has become endangered due to sustained official policies discriminating against it, and the general apathy of the population.</p>
<p>For a variety of complex historical and contemporary reasons, Belarus missed out in this nationbuilding process and the Belarusian language failed to emerge as a catalyst for national revival or as the undisputed hallmark of Belarusian identity (Radzik). Although the rising national significance of Polish, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian and Ukrainian has been well documented in each country’s history, literature and scholarly research (Davies, 1996), the fate of Belarusian has been very largely neglected. The complex set of historical, social, cultural and political circumstances that prevented that country from following the common trend set by its Central and Eastern European neighbours, where each has emerged as a separate nation with its own distinct language, is worthy of closer investigation. The exceptional status of Belarus throughout the twentieth century continues to this day, with the country generally regarded as one of the most enigmatic nation-states of Europe. Although freed from Soviet rule, it appears to disdain its national language and its newly independent status, shows distrust of western-style democratic institutions and hankers after its old links with Russia. This quixotic behaviour, so much out of keeping with the explosion of nationalism and the simultaneous craving for a market economy evident among its Baltic neighbours and all the other countries of East-Central Europe, can be traced to the turbulent history of Belarus which reflects the deep-rooted east–west cultural split derived from the country’s dual allegiance to rival forms of Christianity (Radzik).</p>

<p>The 1999 census data are very illuminating in highlighting the dissonance among the population in relation to their self-declared national identity, ‘mother tongue’ and the language spoken at home Belarusian was the declared ‘mother tongue’ for 73.7% of the citizens, but no more than 36.7% claimed Belarusian as the language ‘usually spoken at home’, while 62.8% said they used Russian. What is even more remarkable was that among the clear majority of people (81.2% of the republic) claiming to be ethnic Belarusians, as many as 85.6% declared Belarusian was their mother tongue, but only 41.3% stated that they actually used Belarusian as their usual home language. Belarusian was better maintained among the rural population, with 96.8% claiming Belarusian as their mother tongue and 79.2% speaking mainly Belarusian at home. The corresponding figures for the urban Belarusian population revealed that while 80.2% regarded Belarusian as their mother tongue, only 23.0% usually spoke it at home.</p>

<dd>Have a close look at the accusations:

<li>Russian, well I mean if one takes a look at the POV of pravapis.org website then the Russophobic tendencies of the content there is clear enough.</li>
<li>POV pusher. If a rational person takes a look at my edit of this site alone then they would rephrase that as NPOV-pusher.</li>
<li>No knowledge of Belarus, i.e. naive. Well considering I have been over 30 times to Belarus and can actually easialy read the language and understand upon hearing it.</li>
<li>Lier... oh dear, speak for yourself.</li>
<li>Previous scandals.

<dl>
<dd>Thank you very much for locking the article. I was just about to ask the admin to that anyway. You see there seems to be two separate instances of misunderstanding</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>My original edit, which Rydel tried to remove twice on the 14th and 21st of December. After his second revert I started a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belarusian_language#Edit_war:_Kuban_Kazak_and_Rydel" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belarusian_language#Edit_war:_Kuban_Kazak_and_Rydel" rel="nofollow">heading on this talk page</a> offering explanations, reverted to my new edit. This time Rydel puts a slightly different edit. Keeping my factual expansions he returns the POV sentences and two paragraphs which I have slightly rewritten and NPOVed before the table, which I put in and after which my edited versions of the paragraphs go.</li>
<li>Since Rydel offered no explanation for his action and labelled it a minor edit. I though of it as a revert, warned him on his talk page of reporting him to the WP:3RR. In the meantime another user (-Amir E. Aharoni) on the same day (22nd discusses with me a few points about my edits, I explain them.</li>
<li>On the 27th and 28th two anons restore Rydel's section, one even brings <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belarusian_language#Kuban_kazak" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belarusian_language#Kuban_kazak" rel="nofollow">this up</a>. However with absence of actual explanation I revert, Rydel (who has been silent since the 22nd comes back and again reverts the article, under a pretext of it being <i>Russian vandalism</i>). On his talk page I repeat my warning and once again urge him to respond on the talk page. Nothing happens. I suspect heavy sockpuppetry.</li>
<li>Fast forward to 10th January, AndriyK comes along. A user who has a very controversial edit history. A user who is under an arbitration might I add, without any explanation on the talk page once again restores Rydel's version with the two paragraphs and POVed sentences.</li>
<li>Here is where the second misunderstanding took place. AndriyK, as expected from him based on his previous behaivour, simply did not bother to read the important history, did not bother going to the talk pages, started a revert war with me which of course I responded to urging him to read the page history. (Mind me adding previously AndriyK has contributed nothing to this article).</li>
<li>AndriyK's behaivour is defined under Wikipedia's rules as <i>trolling</i>. However when on the 16th after a fifth attempt of the revert war. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belarusian_language#A_disputed_point" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belarusian_language#A_disputed_point" rel="nofollow">add a section here on the talk page</a> summing the three versions of the article]. Also I add one on AndriyK's talk page and title it as "For the trolls". AndriyK responds with a comment <i>I am not going to read anything that is title "For the trolls"</i>.</li>
<li>Then out of nowhere Rydel shows up, (again nearly three weeks since begining of conflict not a single explanation in the meantime). At this point I report it to WP:Vandalism notice board. However AndriyK pulls a stunt which I think the admin will be very intersted to know. Since he has either not looked in history deep enough to realise how stubborn he is acting with this revert war, or he simply wanted shared Rydel's POV and wanted to get it across. In any case he puts on a 3RR notice board, I get blocked. The admin tells me off, realising that it is the other party who has started the edit war (its their job to have something to legitimise the ban, but personally I hold nothing against <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">User:William M. Connolley</a>, or anyone else on the admin board) for using the term "troll".</li>
<li>However although the ban took me off for an hour, it has nevertheless attracted admin's attention.</li>
<li>It takes little knowledge to realise that this is not a content despute (otherwise we would not have people putting grammatically incorrect paragraphs). This is a classic case of a)someone trying to get a POV across b)someone deceiving the admin about it. The only thing that has changed is that next time either Rydel or AndriyK pull something like this off I will not give warnings and report it straight to the Admin. For the latter persona, I think this is an excellent addition for his arbitration. -- <a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> 18:47, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Kazak, would you start explaining your edits below, instead of raging about who reverted or blocked who&#160;? This is not interesting and does not bring us forward an inch. --<sub><a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysy_04aa.html" title="User:Lysy">Lysy</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../l/y/s/User_talk%7ELysy_c2aa.html" title="User talk:Lysy">talk</a></sup> 22:41, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know enough about the subject to suggest which edits are correct, but protecting the article was certainly warranted considering the childish exchange of reverts. To help resolve this I recommend everyone considers the way they've ignored the spirit and the rule of Wikipedia editing. Look at the article's history: at least four or five editors should be ashamed of their contribution here. We all have lapses, now it's time to grow up and get a grip on yourselves.</p>

<dd>This "false" information is very well sourced and referenced, and just because you are Belarusian (or maybe I should call you Litvian to avoid shaming the majority of the population of a respectable nation) <b>it does not make you the god of Belarus-related topics on wikipedia</b>. Now if you are still not keen to discuss the topics then I will agree for this article to be unlocked only if you promise not to return to reverting. Also please keep the petty childish insults aside, sorry mate I could not care less what your write on your websites but wikipedia is an international encyclopedia, and you will have to learn to respect other people's opinions and counter-opposing facts.

<dd>Well said. Rydel lives abroad and, thoroughly brainwashed by CIA prop, he doesn't know/understand much about the country. He is as Belarusian as you and me. I don't know why he privatized Belarus-related articles. In my experience, for him Belarussia should better be renamed to Belapolska or Lesser Poland, if that name were not already associated with another area. The Russians snatched the country from Poland, depolonized it, and made it an independent state. Without them, it would still have been another Polish province, just like <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masuria.html" title="Masuria">Masuria</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomerania.html" title="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>. Mother Russia saved your country from total annihilation in the WWII.

<dd>You simply can't live without offending people, can you. Does it make you better if you start your day with calling someone an idiot or brainwashed moron? Also, as to your interpretation of history... I wonder whether you ever asked yourself a question would Belarus be involved in WWII if the "Mother Russia" did not start the war.

<dd>So you assume the WWII was started by "Mother Russia" and not Poland, which greedily clung to Danzig but ignominously lost the resultant war (like it had lost most conflicts throughout its history). Halibutt, although I know that your Russophobia is boundless, I didn't expect such ridiculous claims.

<dd>I do not know what use this silly discussion is. Clearly it does not belong to an article about the Belarusian <i>language</i>. But as a German I have to say one thing when I read nonsense like this: Both World Wars were started neither by Russia nor by Poland nor by anyone else but by Germany alone. (Of course, one might discuss the fatal alliance system before the First World War and the unsuccessful appeasement policy before the Second World War, but the ultimate aggression came exclusively from Germany.)

</dl>
<p>Several of the many problems that I've corrected today (and that Kuban Kazak is trying to revert):</p>
<ol>
<li>Skaryna's Bible was the first <i>East</i> Slavic Bible. It's a fact. This was returned to the article;</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All bibles existed in slavonic since Cyril and Methodius, ruthenian, serbian and bulgarian.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I reinstated the removed sentence "The 16th century was the Belarusian <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_age.html" title="Golden age">golden age</a>". This is also a fact;</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What was so gold about living under Polish rule?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I reinstated the removed explanation that term "rus'ki" means "Ruthenian", not the language of Muscovy. It's a very important clarification.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ruski = Ruthenian; there are Great Ruthenian (aka Russian); Small Ruthenian (Ukrainian); White Ruthenian (Belarusian). That is a fact.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I reinstated the removed sentence: "Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has historically lacked a strong nationalistic drive."</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And, how does this OT belong in the subject, feel free to expand on this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I reinstated the removed sentence: "There existed a minor movement for returning to the Belarusian language; it was important in the circle of friends of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Mickiewicz_3265.html" title="Adam Mickiewicz">Adam Mickiewicz</a>."</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reference the facts about how a Polish poet is relevant and by all means return</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I removed this paragraph (because it contains false information suchs claims that Russification was good) and makes a point of how the language was called during census (as if that matters, "rose by any other name..."): "This latter fact caused many nobles of Imperial Russian authorities to assume that the language spoken by Belarusian peasents was nothing but Polonised Russian, nevertheless as Polish influence over the territory slackened, the Russification of Belarusian peasents proved counter productive. In the 1897 Imperial census most refered to their native language not as Ruthenian as they did during the Polish rule, but as White Ruthenian or Belarusian."</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Russians translated that as Ruski as Russian, whilst calling themselves Velikorossians (Great Russians). So they (wrongly) assumed that the dialect that local peasents spoke was nothing more than Polonised Russian. However after a century of depolonisation (which included disestablishment of the Uniate Church, the removal of Polish magnates and nobility from Belorossian lands) the national consciosness of Belarusian peasents rose. And in 1897 they overwhelmingly referred to their nationality not as Ruthenian (which Russians wrongly interpreted as Russian) but as Belarusian. This is a very important historical fact.

<dd>Воссоединение униатов нанесло католицизму и полонизму в Белоруссии сокрушительный удар, от которого им уже не суждено было оправиться. Но каковыми оказались исторические последствия этого события для белорусов? Конечно, это все те последствия, которые историки связывают с вхождением Белоруссии в состав Российской империи, ведь, как мы уже говорили, без воссоединения Россия не сумела бы цивилизационно привязать к себе свой Северо-Западный край. Во-первых, ликвидация унии духовно соединила все части белорусского народа, расколотые унией, в единое целое, восстановило его цельность.[75] Во-вторых, подрыв позиций полонизма и католицизма в Белоруссии привел к постепенному возвращению белорусов к их истокам. В-третьих, воссоединение дало толчок становление самосознания народа, которое, прежде всего, выражается <b>языковым самоопределением</b>. Со всей очевидностью это явление нашло отражение <b>в результатах всеобщей переписи населения Российской империи, прошедшей в 1897 г. Здесь население всех белорусских губерний, и западных и восточных, однозначно назвало свой родной язык не русским, как во времена унии, но белорусским.</b>[76] В-четвертых, ликвидация унии придала <b>новый мощный импульс развитию белорусского языка, формированию его литературной формы</b>.[77] В-пятых, начало делать <b>первые шаги национально-культурное возрождение белорусов</b>. В-шестых, <b>возник научный интерес к изучению истории, этнографии и фольклора белорусского народа</b>. Из всего сказанного следует, что воссоединение униатов <b>сдвинуло с мертвой точки искусственно замороженный в Речи Посполитой процесс превращения белорусской народности в белорусскую нацию</b> That is what I inputed into the article back in first edit. If you know so much about your native language why remove one of the most significant historical details which allowed to transform a peasent dialect into an national language?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<li>I reinstated the removed sentence: "Hundreds of people were shot or sent to Siberia <a href="http://www.martyraloh.org/all_victims.asp?location=culture" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.martyraloh.org/all_victims.asp?location=culture" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>".

<dd>Well noting that they can't even spell the name of the capital of Belarus correctely I can only raise an eyebrow on that site. However you will have to provide evidence that there repressions were done directly against Belarusian culture, and not as part of a wave where thousands of other representetives of all Soviet Union's nationalities were killed or deported to Siberia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I rephrased this sentence: "In terms of lexicon, Belarusian is most closely related to Ukrainian, then to Polish." This can be proven by looking at Swadesh lists, for example. You can find them on Wiktionary.</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look Rydel the reason of all my edits is that the POV of the article is not to provide history of the Belarusian language but to prove how a group of finno-urgic/mongolo-tatarian bears roamed across a land and brought no good to it for 200 years. Ommiting the fact that by the end of the 17th century all noble class was Polish and Belarusians were looked upon as second-class people. Even after forcibly converting them into Unia it was still not possible to assertain the privliges that a Latin catholic could have. What I tried to say is that during the 19th century Russians removed those influences, wether to Russify Belarusians, wether to liberate them from the Poles and turn them into a destinct separate nation, it was the latter fact that they achieved.

<li>Skaryna's Bible was the first <i>East</i> Slavic Bible. It's a fact. This was returned to the article; <i>Cyril and Methodius did not write in an EAST Slavic language, did they?</i></li>

It's a very important clarification. <i>And no, "russian" and "ruthenian" are not the same thing at all, although Kuban Kozak wants to confuse the matters (just like the propagandists of the Russian empire did before him).</i></li>
<li>I reinstated the removed sentence: "Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has historically lacked a strong nationalistic drive." <i>It's not off-topic. Ukraine and Belarus have very similar histories, so it's worth making a comparison. And national identity is also very closely related to languages in our region. So it's not OT, as Kuba Kozak said.</i></li>
<li>I reinstated the removed sentence: "There existed a minor movement for returning to the Belarusian language; it was important in the circle of friends of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Mickiewicz_3265.html" title="Adam Mickiewicz">Adam Mickiewicz</a>."</li>
<li>I removed this paragraph (because it contains false information suchs claims that Russification was good) and makes a point of how the language was called during census (as if that matters, "rose by any other name..."): "This latter fact caused many nobles of Imperial Russian authorities to assume that the language spoken by Belarusian peasents was nothing but Polonised Russian, nevertheless as Polish influence over the territory slackened, the Russification of Belarusian peasents proved counter productive. In the 1897 Imperial census most refered to their native language not as Ruthenian as they did during the Polish rule, but as White Ruthenian or Belarusian." <i>Kuban Kozak wanted to confuse things further, by posting large texts on the talk page of propaganda nature (with "proofs" how destruction of Uniate faith on Belarus' lands was a good thing).</i></li>
<li>I reinstated the removed sentence: "Hundreds of people were shot or sent to Siberia <a href="http://www.martyraloh.org/all_victims.asp?location=culture" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.martyraloh.org/all_victims.asp?location=culture" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>". Adding a link where you can see last names and biographies of these persons. Of course, thousands were shot. <i>I meant the people of culture: writers, historians, journalists, politicians, prominent people. And, again, Kuban Kozak has nothing to answer, but just picks on the spellings of the word "Minsk" in a language that he doesn't even speak (hint: the languages is called Belarusian).</i></li>
<li>I rephrased this sentence: "In terms of lexicon, Belarusian is most closely related to Ukrainian, then to Polish." This can be proven by looking at Swadesh lists, for example. You can find them on Wiktionary. <i>No one provided a rebuttal or more precise data, so this definetely stays.</i></li>

<li><i>And no, "russian" and "ruthenian" are not the same thing at all, although Kuban Kozak wants to confuse the matters (just like the propagandists of the Russian empire did before him).</i> Russian - citizen of Russian. Ruthenian - ethnically eastern slavic. No need to victimise of an empire that does not exist for 90 years. My ancsestors, Zaporozhians also called themselves Ruthenian, after the governments of Kievan and Moscovian (per Ivan III) Ruthenia.</li>
<li><i>It's not off-topic. Ukraine and Belarus have very similar histories, so it's worth making a comparison. And national identity is also very closely related to languages in our region. So it's not OT, as Kuba Kozak said.</i> Did Belarus became sight of the famous Cossack resistance and uprising to defend Orthodoxy? No it was reaquired in late 18th century as a sorry land with Poles and Jews ruling everythnig and the Ruthenians working for the land.</li>
<li>No explanation why</li>
<li><i>Kuban Kozak wanted to confuse things further, by posting large texts on the talk page of propaganda nature (with "proofs" how destruction of Uniate faith on Belarus' lands was a good thing).</i> Proper sourced material which is directely related to history of development of your language you stubborn Litviak.

<li><i>No one provided a rebuttal or more precise data, so this definetely stays.</i> I did, I simply said what difference does it make saying that Belarusian is close to Ukrainian Polish and Russian or first to Ukrainian then to Polish then to Russian. Actually being able to speak Ukrainian quite well, I can say that it depends on where in Belarus you are. If it is Polessia then obviously that is true.

<dd>I guess you're addressing a wrong guy. Be as it may-Belarusians have chosen security with Lukashenka. Fine. Just, he'll, in retrospect, remain a footnote in history's textbooks, just like 100,000 Irish who had died during the WW1 fighting on the Britain's side. Unlike those few killed in Kilmanhaim jail after the Easter rebellion. Lukashenka will go down in history as a temporarily successful anachronism. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 18:59, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know that it is painful for Belarusians to acknowledge this, but of course their alphabet has been developed from the Russian alphabet; the letters ё, э, й, and ў did not exist in the alphabet used for <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_Slavonic_language_d72e.html" title="Church Slavonic language">Church Slavonic</a>, but the first three do exist in the Russian alphabet, and the fourth is clearly modelled on й, specially for Belarusian.

<dd>Humorously, it's somewhat of opposite.&#160;:) Russian "Grazhdanka", introduced by Peter I, was styled on the work of Kopiyevich, which work, in its turn, was originating from fonts of the contemporary Belarusian books. Look into the newly created "Belarusian alphabet", too. Yes, YO was taken from Russian (in form with diacritics, not as suggested digraph "IO'), but EH is local invention, SHORT I (in form of IZHE with TITLO) is seen, e.g., in 1588 Statute.

<p>I see you touched Volynian (Luck), but I feel duty to expand and a bit and adjust your comments. It is linguistically proven (Ch. Stang; Z.Zinkevičius; etc.) that Ruthenian lang. used in chancellery of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was dominated by Volynian until mid XVI century ( some linguist say that Volynian dominated until end of XVIc.). This conclusion was drown after analysis of Ruthenian documents issued by Grand Duchy of Lithuania chancellery. Second decisive moment is that when central dialect of present-day Belarus territory (roughly) was used – chancellery and spoken languages remain with notable differences; so it should be also clear division between chancellery and spoken languages – so it is another issue why terms with “old” can’t be applied without tremendous exceptions when talking about chancellery issues. <a href="../../../m/2E/k/User%7EM.K_4b8a.html" title="User:M.K">M.K.</a> 14:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC) p.s. when talking about languages of metrica don’t exclude Latin (German as minor).</p>

<p>The exact relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages, common ancestry from a Baltic-Slavic proto-language or simple areal convergence, is one of the major controversies of comparative Indo-European linguistics. As a result, I've changed the History section from mentioning a common Baltic-Slavic ancestor as a certain fact, to showing both sides of the issue. I've also changed the British "Slavonic" to the America "Slavic" in a few places, since unfortunately Wikipedia adheres to American nomenclature and orthographic norms in articles not directly related to Britain. <a href="../../../c/r/c/User%7ECrculver_e648.html" title="User:Crculver">CRCulver</a> 02:17, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem -- and thanks.

<dd>Just an outcome of uncertainty what to use when referring to the city in Medieval times.

<p>O.K., but the name <i>Vilnya</i> wasn't official. I believe that in <i>X language</i> articles general naming rules apply rather than <i>X</i> rules. Eventually original Belorusian names could be quoted, like <i>Białystok (Беласток in Belarusian)</i>. <i>Vilnya</i> isn't one, it's an English version. <a href="../../../x/x/2/User%7EXx236_c238.html" title="User:Xx236">Xx236</a> 13:33, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Err, don't quite see your point here. "Вільня" is traditional Belarusian and "Vil'nya" is its BGN/PCGN rendition. And I rather don't know just whose rules would apply in 1918.

<li>Did Wilno belong to the BNR at the time when the book was printed?
<ul>
<li>AFAIR, it was under the German 10th army administration, war was continuing and nobody of the 4 factions emancipated by the German commander-in-chief decree (Belarusians, Lithuanians, Poles, ...Jews(??)) could claim the city in a real sense of the word. BNR was, like, tolerated by German authorities in the moment. <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 08:16, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have just seen this article for the first time. I am not Slavic nor a historical linguist; I want a simple outline of the main features of the history, characteristics, and linguistic relationships of the language. But the existing article is highly technical and excessively detailed and is incomprehensible to a layperson. For one example, the letters "GDL" appear without explanation. This is a sign of writing for specialists instead of the general reader.</p>
<p>Some other language articles are much shorter but manage to give basic information in a simple way in the first few sentences or paragraphs (see <a href="../../../u/z/b/Uzbek_language.html" title="Uzbek language">Uzbek language</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmen_language.html" title="Turkmen language">Turkmen language</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazakh_language.html" title="Kazakh language">Kazakh language</a>, which I happened to be looking at recently, as models).</p>
<p>My plea: Let's have a very, very simple and nontechnical opening of a few paragraphs for this article. Then, a concise description of the phonology and grammar, the main points only. After that, it would seem reasonable to have more details. But English Wikipedia is not the place for an advanced treatise, which is how the article seems to me. Please, write for English speakers, not Belarusians. Thank you. <a href="../../../z/a/s/User%7EZaslav_7e27.html" title="User:Zaslav">Zaslav</a> 23:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While your comments are quite valid, and I, for myself, am going to address them ASAP, I still think you're deceiving yourself somewhat in the matter of <i>possibility</i> of "dumbing down" of the highly tumultous and contested topic as the history of Belarusian language. Several paragraphs on the actual structure etc., moved to the article's beginning -- sure thing, can do. With history, won't be so easy, and personally I'm quite unwilling to separate it into article of its own...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For starters, could you point to the especially difficult passages in the current text version? <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 22:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Confession: I didn't read much of the article. I found it so technical that I was lost. (The first paragraph wasn't so bad but it didn't give the information I wanted.) I did read much of the talk page and found that Belarusian is very controversial. This helped me to understand why there is so much technical detail about the history. I'm not sure it's necessary, but I understand why it's there.</p>
<p>I'm glad you want to improve the article. I'm not suggesting it be "dumbed down". I believe there is a way of writing about highly technical questions that makes them accessible to more people. You write in layers. The first layer, at the beginning, is the simplest possible presentation of basic information, and is short. The next layer gives more detail but avoids being technical. And so on. The number of layers depends on the difficulty of the topic and how long you want the article to be.</p>
<p>I will try to be more specific despite my ignorance of Slavic language and history. I came to this article because of the <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadjik_language.html" title="Tadjik language">Tadjik language</a> article, which says Tadjik is a dialect of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>. I wondered who decided that, since the difference between language X being a dialect of Y or being a sister language is often subjective. Then I remembered I had once heard that "White Russian" is a dialect of Russian. (I apologize if this offends anyone. I report what I heard once.) I wondered if Wikipedia would tell me whether this is true or not. What I found was an article from which it was hard to extract much idea of just how closely related Russian and Belarusian are. Instead, there was a very technical and argumentative discussion of history and language comparison, which seemed not well organized.</p>
<p>An example: One apparently important question in the article: Which Bible in which Slavic language was first? The first, simple treatment, in Layer 2 could say something like: "There is controversy over which East Slavic dialect/language was the first to have a translation of the Bible." Then in Layer 3, more detail: "There are two early Slavic Bibles, the X Bible in an early form of Belarusian and the Y Bible in Old Church Slavonic. The X Bible has been variously dated between 696 and 969. The Y Bible has been reliably dated to around 720." Then in Layer 4, a discussion of the evidence. (Obviously, I made up all these "facts". This is just to explain my idea of reader-friendly presentation.)</p>
<p>Another example: The stages of language development. A short summary (made up, since I don't know the facts): "Belarusian can (or cannot?) be traced as a distinct dialect back to the early stages of differentiation of what became the East Slavic languages. One can distinguish 8 main stages of development. This is a remarkably large number for any language, within a period of less than 1500 years. [N.B. English has only 3 main stages despite a complex history. Thus, I suspect the Belarusian article has too many distinctions.] ... In the 18th century Late Middle Belarusian had become an artificial literary/aristocratic speech, much influenced by neighboring Slavic languages and French. [I told you I'm making this up. Don't believe a word!] However, the vernacular had developed independently with comparatively little outside influence, and it is this speech that formed the basis of modern Belarusian." I hope this shows you the kind of presentation I would find helpful and readable.</p>
<p>How to organize all the layers? Have sections called (these are ideas for titles): (no title: the introduction; this is Layer 1) (Then in Layer 2) Summary of the language and its history. (Then in Layer 3 with moderate detail) Description of the language. History of the language. (Then in Layer 4) Detailed description; comparison with related and neighboring languages. Arguments/Controversy about the history.</p>
<p>I hope these comments are not a waste of your time. Organizing this article is obviously a very big job. Best wishes to all those who help. <a href="../../../z/a/s/User%7EZaslav_7e27.html" title="User:Zaslav">Zaslav</a> 07:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Although i didn't place the cleanup tag myself I feel that it is warranted in the most general sense. The article is messy in its presentation of information and it is very difficult to get an overview of the information. It abuses <b>bold</b> text which also causes confusion rather than provide the intended focus. It has too many bulleted lists that should be transformed to prose. What it really needs is a cleanup turning it in to smoothly flowing prose. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaunus_db7a.html" title="User talk:Maunus">·ƛ·</a> 12:51, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the work on this article is far from completed. Many instances of bold text are just the side-effect of using the template {{lang-be|}}, and I don't like those myself. But remove the template?.. I don't know... The point on the bulleted lists is duly noted. I won't promise the "smooth flow prose", however.&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>You are right on the phonology bit, this is in plans, and would you please check the places of articulation translation, like noted in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBelarusian_grammar_fba1.html" title="Talk:Belarusian grammar">Talk:Belarusian grammar</a>? <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 14:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't remove the template just remove the bold text unless it is really needed - many of them should really be wikilinks. I can't really help with the places of articulation I have never heard belarusian and cannot possibly know how those sounds in question differ from their russian or polish counterparts - the safest thing to do would be to find a book with IPA transcriptions of Belarusian as a reference.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaunus_db7a.html" title="User talk:Maunus">·ƛ·</a> 14:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore several sections are completely useless to people who do not already know belarusian for example the vocabulary section - since there are no translations or transliterations (if there are several latin transliterations why not use one of them?)provided for the words written in cyrillic the entire section might as well be written in belarusian to me. The Entire article lacks images - not every one mihgt know where the "conventional" line from pruzhany to stolin runs exactly, nor what is conventional about it. Some might not even be entirely sure where Belarusia is. Also some sections can be made much shorter without losing too much valuable information.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·</a> <a href="../../../m/a/u/User_talk%7EMaunus_db7a.html" title="User talk:Maunus">·ƛ·</a> 15:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your comments! Quite a new perspective on some of the issues, some of these I'd never guess by myself. As for the template "Belarusian language", which scatters lots of "bolded" <b>Belarusian</b>, well, it somehow gets so automatically, by token of having the displayed string equal to the name of the article or something. On other pages it's displayed as a wikilink to this article, as intended. <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYury_Tarasievich_42c0.html" title="User:Yury Tarasievich">Yury Tarasievich</a> 07:33, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
