<p>You know, I am dismayed at the route the Bellingham page has been going, with politically charged or biased entries that are better served in some other way (i.e. most of the Future Development section). A healthy dialog on growth issues is one thing, but I think this is a bit much for a general community page. Maybe a linked page from the Bellingham community page just on development issues would be better. Am I alone in this idea? I would rather the community page emulate cities that provide more content and substance like <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> or <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene%2C_Oregon_1214.html" title="Eugene, Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>. I would gladly make the edits and changes to head in this direction, but want to open this up for a general discussion first...</p>

<p>Article was edited on that date to remove "vandalism". Portions were removed that noted the cause of the pipeline explosion to be youths playing with fireworks. I'd agree that the phrasing in that version was crude and somewhat insensitive, however that is, to the best of my knowledge, as a bellingham resident, the suspected cause of the fire.</p>

<dd>Hi. You're confusing two edits. My edit of March 8/9 (depending on time zone) was the anti-vandalism change, modifying income numbers in the demographics section. The edit of March 30/31 by 66.165.10.26 (odin.restek.wwu.edu) changed the text about ignition of the vapors. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bellingham%2C_Washington&amp;diff=13008031&amp;oldid=11707705" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bellingham%2C_Washington&amp;diff=13008031&amp;oldid=11707705" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>Hadn't heard this before but I suspect it's related to nearby Vancouver, BC's tag of "No Fun City". And it's true - I've had more fun in B-ham than in Vancouver; small but fun, vs. big but repressive . . . <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 22:00, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "City of Subdued Excitement" label is not widely used nor an official slogan (the weekly alternative paper that used it the most is now out of business) We are a laid back kind of town...and you can have lots of fun here!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I absolutely disagree. I am a 25 year Bellingham resident and can state emphatically that the slogan of Bellingham, official or no has been "The City of Subdued Excitement" since way before the Weekly dropped the "Every Other". I may think it's sort of dumb, even, but it's the slogan. Googling "city of subdued excitement" finds 917 hits, and I doubt any of those don't directly refer to Bellingham. If you can find any other slogan even tangentially attributed to Bellingham, feel free to post it here. Bellingham has a motto - it's ad hoc, there was no subcommittee devoted to finding it, but it's real. I'm reverting this, although I'm open to reasons why the slogan should be removed. -<a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 10:37, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Edit: just realized that I forgot to contest the fact that this slogan is not widely used. It is. I'm sorry if my edits here are erratic, I feel very embarrassed defending this dumb slogan, which I never really even understood or endorsed. But seriously, tons of people use it, to the point of it being annoying. -<a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 11:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody (71.231.38.152) is vanalizing this nickname and instead calling it "City of Generic Logos". While "City of Subdued Excitement" is not official it is commonly accepted as such. This malicious visitor is clearly protesting the new city logo (which admittedly I dislike as well) and has also made the change "He is also the one who hired a Seattle company to design a generic Bellingham logo." in reference to former mayor Mark Asmundson.

<p>My controversial essay bashing the town of Bellingham, WA and its mysterious curse, is finally done. You will find info about it that you won't find anywhere else. Read why I consider it to be the most boring, stuck up, and anti-social place on the planet (or at least in the ten countries I've been in). Also included are many point by point comparisons to how it is in Europe/Russia, where my best memories and experiences are. Here is the link:</p>

<p>Any of you Bellinghamians (ites?) ever heard of a pirate colony called Hermosa, possibly/supposedly connected with the mysterious Spanish party at Kelowna which got wiped out on its way "home" via the Similkameen? Supposedly Hermosa was Fairhaven, or the author theorizing/demonstraing this dubbed it that in lack of any other, and it was supposedly a pirate haven of sailors who had fled north from the limits of the Spanish/Mexican navy, which then was no farther north than San Blas; according to the gist of the legend, part of the reason for the voyages sent north from that garrison-port were to secure the interests of the Spanish king; but curiously the Spanish did not seek to penetrate the Strait of Juan de Fuca, as if held off. References are scattered but have been summarized in at least two accounts that I can think of, two which I think I have around the house. Just wondering if this is known about down there....Haven't been able to dig up any native stories that back this up, other than the massacre at Keremeos, but there were indications of "un-Indian" activities in some of the early reports from the Strait of Juan de Fuca; most strikingly, crucifixions of victims, then unknown in native culture in this region. The Spanish may have only feared the Euclataws or the then-powerful Cowichans and Suguamish, but at least one account I read analyzes some of the accounts which hint at something known to the chronicler and his captain, but recorded deftly, as if not to admit to the existence of something; that particular account I don't have but if I gave it some thought I could come upwith the author; one of the local journalist-historians.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 06:55, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What happened to the Bellingham Weekly? When I last lived in Bellingham, there were several competing weekly papers. Somebody told me that they merged, or one went out of business. I remember the every other weekly, the echo (classified ads) and a couple of others. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewalrus_f8e2.html" title="User:Thewalrus">Thewalrus</a> 01:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Echo's still around. The Every Other Weekly became the Bellingham Weekly. There was a falling out amongst the BW's editor and the owner, from what I understand. I heard that the staff &amp; editor were fired, re-hired and then fired again, although this is all hearsay. The staff and editor started a new paper which is called the Cascadia Weekly. It is now funded by Bob Hall and David Syre, but it's basically the same paper. --<a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 22:36, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>any info on whether this town is more conservative or liberal by american standards?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Overall it's pretty liberal, like most of western Washington. <a href="../../../s/t/l/User%7EStlom_b292.html" title="User:Stlom">Stlom</a> 10:14, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>...there are lots of military people around that area, and also there is a homeland security office there, which may attract some conservative types.</p>
<p>it's a northwest college town, but traditionally a lot of employment came from extraction industries (timber, fishing). hence there's a tendency toward extremism, at least on environmental/land use issues. whatcom county is probably skewed conservative, but I believe the city itself skews slightly liberal.</p>
<p>- I am absolutely sure the city skews left, but maybe high school and college students create an even more disproportionate impression. But overall, especially if compared to other parts of America as a whole, definitely liberal. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrey_at_last_971d.html" title="User:Frey at last">Frey</a> 07:11, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just look at how washington votes: every county with the exeption of whatcom, and king vote conservitive. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.212.125.230 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.212.125.230_0e7f.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.212.125.230">contribs</a>).</small></p>
