<p>Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. In the event an accusation is made concerning a baptized member, if there is sufficient evidence, a tribunal or judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, administer help and possibly apply sanctions. There are three possible formal sanctions that are applied.</p>
<p><i>Marking</i> is one sort of discipline. Someone who chooses a course that is deemed unscriptural, but for which the standard of disfellowshipping would not apply, would be marked. Though such a one would not be shunned, social interaction outside of formal worship settings would generally be restricted. The intent of this cutting off of social fellowship is to shame that person into a course considered proper. Generally, a talk would be given at the Service Meeting outlining the shameful course, but without explicitly naming the wrongdoer.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Reproof</i> involves sins which are more serious than those for which one would be marked. Reproof is given "before all onlookers." If the sin is private, the reproof would be private. If the sin is known by a small number, they would be invited by the elders, then reproof would be given before both the sinner and those with knowledge of the sin. If the sin is known generally by the entire congregation an announcement of public reproof would be given. A talk is generally given in the case of public reproof, where the wrong course is outlined, but without explicitly naming the people involved.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[39]</a></sup> Reproof is usually linked with a probationary period.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[40]</a></sup> Restrictions may include not sharing in meeting parts, not commenting at meeting parts and not praying for a group. The length of the probation period is dependent upon the elders. One cannot pioneer or auxiliary pioneer for at least one year after reproof is given.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Disfellowshipping</i>, or excommunication, is the most severe discipline administered. This is done at the determination of the judicial committee. The standard put in place to determine if one should be disfellowshipped is the judgment of repentance. To judge repentance, members of the judicial committee ask questions and review actions by the member being considered. The committee must be convinced without a doubt that the repentance is genuine.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[42]</a></sup> Baptized members who express disagreement on any Bible doctrine can potentially be disfellowshipped for <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">apostasy</a>.<sup id="_ref-w89_0401_1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-w89_0401_1" title="">[9]</a></sup> Once the decision to disfellowship has been made a person has seven days to appeal. After the seven days, if the person has not appealed, the disfellowshipping will be announced to the congregation; disfellowshipping does not take effect until the announcement is made to the congregation.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[43]</a></sup> After one is disfellowshipped, all baptized members would cut off all association with that person. They would not speak to such a one, or acknowledge him or her.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[44]</a></sup> There are two exceptions. First if a member was forced to have commercial dealings with a member who is disfellowshipped, these would continue as before. Second, if the disfellowshipped member is living with family members who are baptized, they could continue to associate with this one, but are not to speak about matters pertaining to the religion. The extent to which disfellowshipped or disassociated relatives living in the same household would be included in family life would be left to the discretion of the family.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[45]</a></sup> Family members living outside the home who are disfellowshipped, would have minimal contact.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[47]</a></sup> In the case of doctrinal disagreements, and depending upon the nature and publicity of their disagreement, they may be labelled as an "apostate."<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses are organized into congregations, and each congregation has weekly meetings. Men are selected by representatives of the Governing Body to teach and direct the preaching work. Women cannot be teachers in the congregation; though female Witnesses do participate in meeting programs.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[49]</a></sup> Prayer is featured at these meetings. Prayers are given at meals as well. Private prayers are given as desired. For a prayer to be acceptable, they must be made to the Father <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah.html" title="Jehovah">Jehovah</a> in the name of the Son.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[50]</a></sup> The use of idols is prohibited.

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses typically have three gatherings each week, which are made up of five meetings, totaling approximately five hours. Meetings are held in local <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hall_d54c.html" title="Kingdom Hall">Kingdom Halls</a> and private homes. There are three conventions held annually in facilities owned or maintained by the Watchtower Society or in rented stadiums or auditoriums. Throughout the week, there are also meetings to organize the preaching work where members meet either in homes or Kingdom Halls to organize and pray prior to engaging in evangelism. On Saturday mornings, publishers are usually expected to engage in preaching activity. <i>Watchtower</i> and <i>Awake!</i> magazines are featured, though from time to time, various campaigns are arranged with specific literature offers.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[52]</a></sup> Each month, a report is submitted to the congregation elders indicating the number of hours in the ministry, along with other details, and is required to be officially counted as a Jehovah's Witness. On a daily basis, Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to read the Bible and read publications such as <i>Examining the Scriptures Daily,</i> a booklet with a biblical scripture and commentary.</p>
<p>The most important event is the celebration of the Lord's Supper held once a year after sundown on the date corresponding to Nisan 14 on the Hebrew calendar. Only those claiming to be of the "<a href="../../../f/a/i/Faithful_and_Discreet_Slave_d50d.html" title="Faithful and Discreet Slave">remnant</a>", those who expect to be resurrected in heaven, partake of the unleavened bread and wine. Others simply observe the proceedings without partaking.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[53]</a></sup> They do not believe in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transubstantiation.html" title="Transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consubstantiation.html" title="Consubstantiation">consubstantiation</a> (of the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>)<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a ransom or propitiatory sacrifice by observing The Lord's Evening Meal, or Memorial, each year on <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartodeciman.html" title="Quartodeciman">Nisan 14</a> according to the ancient Jewish calendar. They believe that this is the only celebration commanded for Christians in the Bible. In support, they often cite Jesus' words found at 1 Corinthians 11:25, 26, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Translation_0deb.html" title="New World Translation">NWT</a>, "'Keep doing this ... in remembrance of me.'" Of those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide will partake of the eating of the unleavened bread and the drinking of the wine. (For statistics of the number of partakers in relationship to non-partakers, see <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html#Membership" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses (Membership)</a>)</p>
<p>Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only those with a heavenly hope can partake of the bread and wine. The persons who actually partake, are in general considered of the "anointed," though Jehovah's Witnesses believe that some of them may be in error.</p>
<p>The celebration of the Memorial of Christ's Death proceeds as follows: In advance of the Memorial, Jehovah's Witnesses invite anyone that may be interested to attend this special night. The week of the Memorial is generally filled with special activity in the ministry (e.g. door-to-door work). A suitable hall, for example a Kingdom Hall, is prepared for the occasion. The Memorial begins with a song and a prayer. The prayer is followed by a discourse on the importance of the evening. A table is set with wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread stands for Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine stands for his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation. Hence, the wine and the bread are merely symbols (sometimes referred to as "emblems"), but they have a very deep and profound meaning for Jehovah's Witnesses. A prayer is offered and the bread is circulated among the audience. Only those who are anointed partake. Since many congregations includes no anointed, it is common for the bread and wine to be passed and have no partakers. Then another prayer is offered, and the wine is circulated in the same manner. After that, the evening concludes with a final song and prayer.</p>

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses call their meeting places "<a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hall_d54c.html" title="Kingdom Hall">Kingdom Halls</a>" instead of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">churches</a>, to indicate that the gathering of the congregation is what is important, not the physical location itself. Another reason is that they deem the use of the term <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a> to now be largely confusing and inaccurate because the term in its Biblical context actually refers to a gathering or a "congregation" of people and not to the meeting place or the building itself (see the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html#Etymology" title="Church">etymology of the word</a>). In general, the buildings are functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols.</p>
<p>In many countries, the Witnesses have "Assembly Halls" where about twenty congregations meet two or three times a year for one-day or two-day Assemblies. In countries and areas without such Assembly Halls, or when attendance is expected to exceed <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seating_capacity.html" title="Seating capacity">seating capacity</a>, the annual assemblies are held in borrowed or rented facilities suitable for the purpose, such as public auditoriums.</p>
<p>The Assembly Halls are typically too small to accommodate the larger "District Conventions" and "International Conventions." Once a year Jehovah's Witnesses come together at larger assemblies called "District Conventions" which are usually three days long. Every fifth year "International Conventions", with visiting delegates from a number of foreign countries usually lasting three to four days, are held in selected cities. The attendance of some "International Conventions" number into the hundreds of thousands with the largest-ever gathering held in New York in 1958 at the Yankee Stadium and Polo Grounds with a peak attendance exceeding 250,000.</p>
<p>The great majority of the Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls, as well as the Watchtower Society's headquarters and branch office facilities around the world, have been constructed by the Witnesses themselves freely contributing their own time. The needed finances come from voluntary contributions made by Jehovah's Witness members according to each one's means and inclination.</p>

<p>Congregation meetings<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[55]</a></sup> are held three times a week. All meetings are generally synchronous, so that all congregations are studying the same material at the same meeting.

Hymns called <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_songs.html" title="Kingdom songs">Kingdom songs</a> are usually sung at meetings held in the Kingdom Hall, as well as at assemblies and conventions.

<p>On a weekday evening (commonly a Thursday although due to some congregations sharing facilities other days are often used), the 'Theocratic Ministry School' is held. The School is designed to train <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organizational_structure_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_0344.html#Organizational_structure_of_Jehovah.27s_Witnesses" title="Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses">Publishers</a> to be more effective in their ministry. The publishers are trained in how to use the Bible. Over the course of a few years, the entire Bible is discussed and part of it is read aloud. The publishers are encouraged to read the rest personally. Then practical training is given on how to give a short public talk, doing Bible research, and presenting material to people one might meet in the public ministry. Enrollment is voluntary and open to all congregation members in good standing. Students in the school receive assignments on a rotating basis. At each meeting, six students give brief speeches on pre-selected Bible topics, (although there could be auxiliary classrooms, each having 3 additional students) and an instructor comments on the speech and offers commendation on specific points of delivery. Additional constructive criticism is sometimes given privately. The Theocratic Ministry School is 45 minutes in length and is usually followed immediately (with a transitional song) by the Service Meeting.</p>

<p>This is followed by the 'Service Meeting', a training program for their preaching work. This forty-five minute meeting gives the publishers practical instructions that will help them to become more efficient in carrying on their house-to-house ministry. The program provides a variety of methods for instructing and teaching. There are talks, demonstrations, question-and-answer parts, interviews and discussions between two or more persons. <i>Our Kingdom Ministry</i>, a monthly publication of Jehovah's Witnesses, outlines the material to be covered during the Service Meeting.</p>

<p>A qualified elder or ministerial servant delivers a discourse on a Bible-based subject. The speaker may be from the local congregation or from another congregation, usually nearby. This Public Meeting is generally held on Sundays, but can be on another day if that is more convenient for the congregation (this is most usual when more than 4 congregations share a Kingdom Hall). This talk is particularly directed toward interested members of the public who are not Jehovah's Witnesses, but is of interest to Jehovah' Witnesses as well. This meeting is 45 minutes in length, and is usually followed immediately after (with a transitional song) by the Watchtower Study.</p>

<p>Generally following the Public Talk, after the intermission of a Kingdom Song, is the Watchtower Study. The Bible is studied with the aid of an article in the <i>Watchtower</i> magazine. An experienced elder (the Watchtower Study Conductor) leads the discussion from the platform. Each paragraph is read by a fluent reader who is a 'brother in good standing' and is assigned by the conductor for that week. Questions included in the article for that paragraph are then posed to the audience. After calling on one or more in attendance to express themselves on that question, the conductor will often ask follow-up questions of his own or offer comments himself before moving to the next paragraph. Many of the numerous scriptures cited in the study article will be read aloud by called-on members of the audience. Four or five review questions are typically asked at the end of an article. The Public Talk and Watchtower Study together usually last 2 hours from opening prayer to closing prayer.</p>

<p>At a separate time during the week the 'Congregation Book Study' is held, for which Witnesses meet in small groups of about 10 to 15, usually in the private homes of members, and typically lasting an hour. Spiritual topics are covered using a study book or a brochure prepared by Jehovah's Witnesses and Bible. The material usually has some questions prepared, and a discussion is encouraged starting with these questions. The Q&amp;A format and conductor-reader arrangement is similar to the Watchtower study, but the meeting format is smaller, less formal, and more interactive. The elder (or, if there are not enough elders in the congregation to conduct each book study, ministerial servant) who serves as conductor for a book study group is generally loosely responsible for 'shepherding' those publishers who attend it and for organizing field service meetings and arrangements for them. In some lands exercising a ban on the activity of Jehovah's Witnesses, such book study groups become "mini-congregations" that meet individually for all meetings except on occasion. This allows their activity to go relatively unnoticed by governmental authorities as would larger gatherings.</p>

A person violating these guidelines would not have any action taken against them, but neither would they be allowed to serve with special privileges in the congregation.

<p>Among Jehovah's Witnesses, there is an avoidance of practices considered to have nationalistic or false religious origins. Examples include not singing the national anthem or not saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. Distinctive titles in address (such as Father, Pastor, Reverend, etc) are not employed. Witnesses address one another as "Brother" or "Sister", often followed by the first or last name of the individual. Despite varied positions of service, these are not used as a title to address the person by, such as in the case, "Elder John".</p>
<p>Weddings, anniversaries, and funerals are typically observed.

<p>The family structure is patriarchal. Husbands are considered the final authority of family decisions. He is the head of his family. He must only have one wife. Wives should be submissive to their husbands and husbands are to have deep respect and love for their wives.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[60]</a></sup> Husbands are instructed to treat their wives as Jesus treated his followers. He should not hurt or mistreat his family in any way. The father should be hardworking in providing necessities to his family. He must also provide for them in a spiritual capacity. This includes religious instruction for the family, and taking the lead in preaching activities.</p>
<p>Parental discipline for children should not be in a harsh, cruel way. Children are instructed to obey their parents.</p>
<p>Married couples are encouraged to speak with local elders if they are having problems. Married couples can separate in the case of physical abuse and neglect, and if one partner attempts to hinder the other from being a Jehovah's Witness. Divorce (with the ability to remarry) is permissible only on the grounds of adultery.</p>

<p>Although in general respecting the law of the land, Jehovah's Witnesses do not <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salute.html" title="Salute">salute</a> flags, sing national anthems, or pledge allegiance to any state or nation. This is not intended as disrespect for any particular nation or for governments; Witnesses recognize the legitimacy of political leaders, believing that they are the "superior authorities" referred to by the Apostle Paul in Romans 13:1 (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Translation_0deb.html" title="New World Translation">NWT</a>), and are therefore to be respected. Indeed, in many places, the Witnesses have been commended for their law-abiding stance. They make a distinction, however, between a show of respect and what they consider to be a manifestation of worship. Jehovah's Witnesses feel that saluting a flag or singing a national anthem crosses the dividing line between the two. This is because they believe they owe allegiance solely to Jehovah (God), that he alone may be worshipped.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>For Jehovah's Witnesses, neutrality is defined as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The position of those who do not take sides with, or give support to, any of two or more contending parties. It is a fact of ancient and modern-day history that in every nation and under all circumstances true Christians have endeavored to maintain complete neutrality as to conflicts between factions of the world. They do not interfere with what others do about sharing in patriotic ceremonies, serving in the armed forces, joining a political party, running for a political office, or voting." - (<i>Reasoning from the Scriptures</i>, pages 269-270)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this regard, Jehovah's Witnesses feel that their position is similar to that of the early <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a>, who refused to sacrifice a few drops of wine or a few grains of incense to the Roman emperors even when faced with execution.</p>

<p>Among the results of this belief in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> are several cases of Constitutional law regarding the <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pledge_of_Allegiance_e133.html" title="Pledge of Allegiance">Pledge of Allegiance</a>. The early cases establishing that government schools cannot mandate the Pledge, or the salute to the flag, all involved Witness students punished or threatened for their refusal.</p>
<p>Some courts in other countries have also protected the Witnesses' right to abstain from patriotic ceremonies. For example, in 1986, the Supreme Court of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> held that no one can be forced to join in the singing of the national anthem if the person has a genuine, conscientious religious objection.</p>

<p>Additionally, Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to serve in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> organizations, citing the principle they call <i>Christian Neutrality</i>. They understand Jesus' words , "They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world," to mean that they should take a neutral stand concerning political and military controversies.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Historically, this refusal to join the military has created serious difficulties for Jehovah's Witnesses, particularly in war time. During World War II, young Witnesses in a number of countries were executed for their conscientious objection to war; even in more democratic countries they were generally refused exemption from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">conscription</a> and have often been imprisoned.</p>
<p>Currently, there is less conflict between Witnesses and most governments over this matter, as many countries have abolished conscription, whereas others have recognized the views of conscientious objectors and thus instituted the right to alternative civilian service, which Witnesses generally accept. In certain republics of the former <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, however, as well as in South Korea, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and some countries in Africa, young Witness males continue to serve prison terms in connection with this issue. As of December 15th, 2005 there were 1044 Witnesses imprisoned over this issue in South Korea.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted by the Allies and the Axis powers for refusing to participate in these powers' respective war efforts. (See <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_and_the_Holocaust_871e.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses and the Holocaust">Jehovah's Witnesses and the Holocaust</a>).</p>
<p>Jehovah's Witnesses are not <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifists</a>, that is to say, they are not opposed to the use of violence in all circumstances. They recognize, for instance, the legitimacy of the wars between the ancient nation of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> and surrounding nations, and point out that passages in both the Old and New Testaments refer to God using warlike methods at times. On the other hand, because they do not believe God is using or backing wars in modern times, and because they are told to strictly adhere to the Bible's command to love your neighbor and not murder, they do not participate in any wars. While neutrality is one reason why they do not join the military, their belief that murdering is wrong is the primary reason.</p>

<p>In harmony with the principle of Christian neutrality, referred to above, Jehovah's Witnesses are discouraged from voting in elections, but not prohibited from voting.

On the other hand, they do not seek to prevent or discourage others (non-Witnesses) from doing so, if they so desire.</p>

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses make vigorous efforts to spread their beliefs throughout the world in a variety of ways, with particular emphasis on the written word. Their literature is published in 410 languages through a wide variety of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book.html" title="Book">books</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">magazines</a> and other publications. Their publications make extensive use of secular references and quotations from the Bible.</p>
<p>Both <i>The Watchtower</i> and <i>Awake!</i> are published simultaneously in dozens of languages. In addition to the formats mentioned above, both magazines are available in various audio and electronic formats and some of the articles from these magazines are available online. After the end of each year the issues are collected and re-released in a printed annual edition, commonly referred to as a bound volume. In addition to this, the <i>Watchtower Library</i> computer program contains several decades worth of articles for both magazines and is updated on an annual basis. (Until 2003, this was only done <a href="../../../b/i/e/Biennial.html" title="Biennial">biennially</a>.) It also contains many books, booklets, brochures, and other publications of the Witnesses.</p>
<p>New books, brochures, and other items are released from time to time, major releases being announced at their <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organizational_structure_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_0344.html#Circuits.2C_Districts.2C_Zones_and_Their_Overseers" title="Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses">annual conventions</a>.

<p>The sale of their religious magazines, and all Jehovah's Witnesses' literature, continued around the world until the early 1990s. The Watchtower is now distributed in exchange of donations. These donations have made the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society of NY, Inc. one of the top 40 companies (by turnover) in New York, reporting an annual revenue of about $951 million USD<a href="http://www.watchtowernews.org/Top40NYCcorps.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.watchtowernews.org/Top40NYCcorps.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> free of taxation as they are registered as a non-profit corporation.

<p>As their name implies, Jehovah's Witnesses are well known for their intensive witnessing, or, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proselytism.html" title="Proselytism">proselytizing</a>, efforts. Witnesses generally refer to their evangelizing activities by terms such as: "preaching," "disciple-making", "service," "the ministry," and, more formally, but less frequently, "evangelizing". All members (known as "publishers") who are healthy enough are strongly encouraged to go from door to door, participating in this activity to the extent that their circumstances allow, every week if at all possible. Even children are encouraged to participate, accompanied by their parents. A publisher who fails to participate for a month is known as an "irregular publisher"; publishers who have not compiled and turned in a field service report for six consecutive months are known as "inactive publishers". Witnesses who spend at least 840 hours of witnessing during a year (an average of 70 hours per month) are known as "regular pioneers". Witnesses who wish to spend 50 hours per month are known as "auxiliary pioneers" and can serve in this capacity either a month at a time or consecutively.</p>
<p>Missionary service is another opportunity members have to reach persons in other lands. Those invited to share in such work are usually given specialized training at the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watchtower_Bible_School_of_Gilead_1545.html" title="Watchtower Bible School of Gilead">Watchtower Bible School of Gilead</a>. These individuals, on an average dedicate over 120 hours a month to their work. As of 1998 there were 2,390 Witnesses having missionary status serving in 148 lands.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>Witnesses have, in the past, used a wide variety of methods to spread their faith, including information marches, where members wore sign boards and handed out leaflets, to sound cars, and syndicated newspaper columns and radio spots devoted to sermons. Between 1924 and 1957, the organization operated a radio station, WBBR, from New York. They discarded this medium largely due to the prevalence of [teleevangelist] radio programs to minimize identification with other religious groups. In recent decades, additional methods have included preaching by telephone, at bus stops, places of business and in the street. Specialized territories of residential and commercial areas are made up within a congregation's boundaries and distributed to publishers.</p>
<p>Currently, door-to-door evangelizing for the Witnesses involves endeavouring to engage individuals in discussion of religious matters and offering literature about their faith, with the goal of starting a Bible study with anyone who shows an interest. The production of literature is supported by donations. No financial or material rewards are offered for conversion. Publishers carry forms knowns as "not-at-home slips" to keep record of those homes that need revisiting at another time when its occupants are at home.</p>

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses are known in many lands for their building work. International and regional building teams frequently undertake "quick builds", construction of Kingdom Halls over the course of one or two weekends. Larger construction projects, including the building of regional Assembly Halls and Bethel offices, factories, residences, warehouses, and farm facilities, are also carried out almost entirely by volunteer members.</p>
<p>Jehovah's Witnesses are also involved in relief work in disaster stricken areas. One notable example is the relief efforts to both Hutu and Tutsi Witnesses during the genocide in Rwanda as well as to Congo refugees. This humanitarian aid was not given exclusively to Jehovah's Witnesses; others also benefited. For instance, the Witnesses distributed medicine and clothing to several primary schools and an orphanage near Goma.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses fund their activities, such as publishing, constructing and operating facilities, evangelism, and disaster relief via donations. There is no <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tithing.html" title="Tithing">tithing</a> or collection, but all are encouraged to donate to the organization; Witnesses typically provide an opportunity for members of the public to make such donations as they encounter them in their preaching work. Donation boxes labeled for several specific purposes, are located in Kingdom Halls and other meeting facilities. Generally there is a Kingdom Hall fund for operating expenses locally, and a general fund for the "Worldwide Work", which includes the printing of literature, organization of conventions, supporting missionaries and disaster relief.</p>
<p>The accounts (including donations) and the financial operation of the local congregation are reviewed monthly with the entire congregation at the Service Meeting. (This meeting is open to the public.) Donations are also accepted via mail, and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society can be named as a beneficiary to an estate, and also accepts donations in the form of life insurance policies, pension plans, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, retirement accounts, stocks and bonds, real estate, annuities and trusts.</p>

<p>Raymond Franz argues that a sense of guilt is imposed on those not complying with organization arrangements for field service. Further, that engaging in this formal activity became an extra-scriptural requirement placed upon those wanting to qualify for eldership.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[75]</a></sup> Though field service can be counted for activity pertaining to those not witnesses, time spent helping fellow members cannot be counted toward time spent in the ministry.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[76]</a></sup> In essence, claiming: that an individuals spirituallity is measured by how much time they devote to the ministry.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>

"kat' oikon") does not require the idea of consecutive door-to-door visitation.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[78]</a></sup> He compares 27 Bible translations, showing the more common rendering of "at home", "at your houses" and "in your homes".<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>

<p>Critics contend that fear of being shunned and family break-up/loss causes people to stay who might otherwise freely leave the religion. Jehovah's Witnesses have no provision for conscientious objectors who freely leave to have any continued normal associations. Critics further contend the judicial process itself, due to its private and nearly autonomous nature directly contradicts the precedent found in the Bible and the organizations' own teachings<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[80]</a></sup> and can be used in an arbitrary and punitive manner if there is consensus among just a few to abuse their authority.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[81]</a></sup>Also no tape recorders, microphones or any form of record keeping is allowed for the one accused. Witnesses believe that disfellowshipping (excommunicating) and shunning can have the beneficial effect of both restoring an errant former member to the religion and "upholding God's Holy Name".<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>

<p>The refusal of blood transfusions has been a significant issue among medical professionals, especially when it involves minor children. Some children of Jehovah's Witnesses have died subsequent to not having blood transfusions. In some countries, laws may impose limitations on physicians on the ability to withhold or withdraw blood transfusions or blood therapy from minors, particularly in life-threatening situations; parents who have prevented children under their care from receiving blood therapy in life-threatening situations may face prosecution. Courts have ordered transfusions for some children, often the very young; in other cases they have respected the declared choice of an under-age minor who is able to defend his or her own beliefs to the court in a manner that reflects a mature understanding and without undue influence from the parents.</p>
<p>According to <i>Journal of Church and State</i> in a recent peer-reviewed article, Jehovah's Witnesses are allowed to accept whole blood provided it is in the form of blood fractions.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[83]</a></sup> Kerry Louderback-Wood, the writer, alleges that to label the currently acceptable blood fractions as "minute" in relation to whole blood, causes followers to misunderstand the scope and extent of allowed fractions. She also claims Witness publications exaggerate the medical risks of taking blood and the efficacy of non-blood medical therapies in critical situations.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
