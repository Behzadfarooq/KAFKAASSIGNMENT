<dd>Thanks for your answer. What I'd like to know, though: is the "x" pronounced as "ss" a standard in Wallonia and Bruxelles? Is it used for other terms than city names? Is the "x" pronounciation ever heard for Bruxelles and if so, would it be seen as erroneous or curious? What about in France? Here, I do think both are used alternately. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 22:27, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The standard for Belgian French is "x" = "ks", the only exceptions I can think of are Bruxelles and Auxerre. Walloon may differ, I don't know. "ks" is sometimes pronounced for the x in Bruxelles, but not by most belgian people. It strikes me as only slightly curious (but i've met many french people so...). I suppose many French people say "ks" (ditto for belgian people and Auxerre I suppose.) I've heard Belgians say "ks" when speaking to french people to be sure they're understood. By the way, there's also a difference with "Anvers" (<a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>) where Belgian people pronounce the final "s", and most French people don't. I guess there are other exceptions like that. <a href="../../../f/v/d/User%7EFvdP_984c.html" title="User:FvdP">--FvdP</a> 19:31, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a side note about Auxerre: as far as I know, pronouncing x as ss is standard for place names in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgundy.html" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a> (though this is often ignored, especially for towns less known than Auxerre, or by speakers from outside of the region). Thus, Fixin is pronounced Fissin, etc. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 15:52, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One more note about Auxerre/Bruxelles. It seems that the fact that French cities or villages like Auxerre, Fixin and some others are written with "x" while pronounced "ss" would be due to an habit in use in ancient Burgundy. Since the Dukes of Burgundundy at some point of time were also Duke of Brabant (and resided often in Brussels) has had for effect that the "x" has also been used for writting Bruxelles instead of Brusselles (that you find in Dutch, German and English a.o.). That practice remained even after the Dukes of Burgundy have lost the control over Brabant. At least this is the story that was stold to me more than 30 years ago by my French teacher. --<a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob-BE_9c69.html" title="User:Lebob-BE">Lebob-BE</a> 23:02, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some of Man vyi's clarifications are good, but others change the intended meaning in wrong ways IMO:</p>
<p>He modified "Belgian French and standard French" -&gt; "Belgian French and Parisian French": by "standard" I really meant "french as spoken in France", not only in Paris. "Parisian french" is too restrictive IMO. I'm leaving that "Parisian" for now, waiting for feedback.</p>
<p>He modified "the fact that Belgium was politically separated from <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> in (...) diminished the opportunities of vocabulary unification" -&gt; "the fact that Belgium has been politically separate from <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> for (...) means that French authorities have had no powers to impose a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_language.html" title="Standard language">standard language</a>"&#160;: OK for "was-&gt;has been" but I disagree with "no powers to impose": this is not IMO a question of imposition, but of sharing of culture. French people moved mostly within France, not to (or from) Belgium; French conscripts went to the French army not the Belgian one; French pupils go to french schools separate from the belgian schools where belgian pupils go; and so forth. The part of imposition is IMO minimal with respect to less formal ways, and less voluntary ways to unify the language. -&gt; reverting <a href="../../../f/v/d/User%7EFvdP_984c.html" title="User:FvdP">--FvdP</a> 18:25, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes <i>standard French</i> is a problem phrase - the problem being that there are several standard Frenches in the same way that there are several standard Englishes. Those of us from countries where France is an official language often have problems with the term <i>standard French</i> - whose standard? <i>Metropolitan French</i> is sometimes used, but is rather Francocentric. An academic I've worked with has used <i>French of France</i> to get round the problem - I've edited to put in this version, inelegant though it might be.

<dd>I don't see "diminished the probability of a unified <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard_language.html" title="Standard language">standard language</a> developing" as much better than "diminished the opportunities...". "probability" is not the right concept here, I like my "opportunities" better (in the sense that there were less <i>reasons</i> that the language unify). Perhaps with "chances" instead of "probabilities"&#160;? The rest is OK. <a href="../../../f/v/d/User%7EFvdP_984c.html" title="User:FvdP">--FvdP</a> 22:17, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like "chances". To my ear, "opportunities" suggests an intention, whereas "probability" or "chance" suggests simple blind historical development due to circumstances.</dd>
<dd>Yes, "French of France" poses the same kind of problem as "British English", but as a way to differentiate the French language as broadly used in France from other standards it's better than nothing (for the moment). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMan_vyi_dbe0.html" title="User:Man vyi">Man vyi</a> 08:21, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you sure the word "Cokotteur" isn't derived from Dutch (Flemish)&#160;?</p>
<p>In (Belgian) Dutch, the word "kot" has two meanings&#160;:</p>
<p>- small building, (garden) shed, small stable</p>
<p>- student room (the same meaning as in Belgian French)</p>
<p>I've always thought the second meaning was derived from the first. Hence, "Kot" being a Dutch word, "Cokotteur" is derived from Dutch. <i>On the side&#160;: the adaptation by French speakers of the Dutch word "Kot" has his origins in the fact that the largest French speaking Belgian university until 1968 was situated in Louvain (Leuven), which is in the Dutch speaking part of Belgium.</i> --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucVerhelst_3fe1.html" title="User:LucVerhelst">LucVerhelst</a> 20:52, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In standard (Netherlands) Dutch, the word "kot" means small building (etc) exclusively. Using "kot" for a student room is Flemish, in standard Dutch it is simply "kamer" (room), although the plural "kamers" is often used, depending of the context.</p>

<p>Is not uniquely used for Belgium French. It is used for Flemish words That arn't used in the Netherlands as well.

<p>The article states "and the use of s'il vous plaît to mean voici". I'm not a Belgian French speaker so I won't edit it myself, but as far as I recall from my stays in Belgium, the expression "s'il vous plaît", in addition to the standard French meaning "please", would better be described as "je vous en prie" (you're welcome), typically following "merci" (thank you). Is that right? 217.117.168.186 01:32, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I understood it when I was in Belgium, it had two senses in addition to the normal meaning "please". The first use what you say when giving something to someone (="voici"). The second (which isn't mentioned in the article) is what you say when you don't understand what someone said (="pardon"). I haven't heard it as an equivalent of "je vous en prie", but we might have to check with a Belgian on this one. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELesgles_b335.html" title="User:Lesgles">Lesgles</a> (<small><a href="../../../l/e/s/User_talk%7ELesgles_4345.html" title="User talk:Lesgles">talk</a></small>) 05:23, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with both meanings above, though I still think "you're welcome" would be a third possible meaning, at least in some given contexts. In any case, a clarification from a Belgian French speaker would be helpful on this one. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthieu_Houriet_06aa.html" title="User:Matthieu Houriet">Matthieu Houriet</a> 21:25, 22 March 2006 (UTC) (previously 217.117.168.186)

<dd>As a Belgian French speaker, I can tell you that "s'il vous plaît" is never used after "merci". X</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There something else too. The text says "and that are not of Walloon or Dutch origin". Well, IF "s'il vous plaît" is used for "voici", as the text says rigth now (I don't know that, but if), it would be a Dutch habbit; Dutch uses the word "alsjeblieft/alstublieft" (meaning litteraly "s'il vous plaît") also for "voici" (as in: giving something to someone). (Applies to both standard Dutch and Belgian Dutch of Flemmish.)</p>

<dd>Yes. [ɑ̃] is a back vowel, so I think it would be unlikely to merge with either [œ̃] or [ɛ̃], which are front vowels. The difference between [ɛ̃] and [œ̃], on the other hand is simply one of roundedness.

<p>I changed the word "usually" to "sometimes" in the section referring to W as being pronounced as a V in "standard" French. While there are very few words in French that start with a W (and most are taken directly from English, German, or Dutch), even fewer have the V sound. Most still have the W sound, as in English. (Wagon is an acceptable instance of the V sound.)
