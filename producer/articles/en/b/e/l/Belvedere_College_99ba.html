<p>Belvedere College is run by the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Jesus_37d2.html" title="Society of Jesus">Jesuit</a> order. Most of the school's current teaching staff are now lay-persons, although a number of Jesuit priests and brothers take part in the school's administration.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> ethos of social justice for all and educating "men for others" are keystones of the Belvedere College culture and education philosophy. The school recently celebrated the 500th birthday of the patron saint of the college, St. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Xavier_8b71.html" title="Francis Xavier">Francis Xavier</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belvedere_College_99ba.html" title="Edit section: Charitable Activities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Charitable Activities</span></h2>
<p>For example, some students travel with the Dublin Pilgrimage to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lourdes.html" title="Lourdes">Lourdes</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> to assist the elderly and the disabled, others take part in an exchange to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> where they assist in homes for orphans and street-children. Belvedere's <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Vincent_de_Paul_0c69.html" title="St. Vincent de Paul">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a> is one of the largest of any secondary school in Ireland, organising activities such as old-folks events and flat decoration in inner city Dublin. Certain students also undertake a charity walk from Dublin to Galway every summer in order to raise funds for Irish Guide Dogs For The Blind and The Temple Street Children's Hospital (which is located near the school).</p>
<p>An annual <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_cause.html" title="Charitable cause">charitable</a> fundraising event held by the College is the "Belvedere Sleepout", which takes place from <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_24th.html" title="December 24th">24th</a> each year. It is run by a collection of teachers and students from the College to raise funds for <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_Ireland_dd64.html" title="Focus Ireland">Focus Ireland</a>, The Home Again Society and Father Peter McVerry's Society for homeless boys. The students <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast.html" title="Fast">fast</a> for 24 hours of the sleepout. The culmination of the event is Christmas Eve midnight mass, in the college chapel. In the past, the college has managed to raise over <a href="../../../%E2%82%AC/_/_/%E2%82%AC.html" title="€">€</a>120,000 for the charity.</p>
<p>Belvedere College has an active alumni association - the Belvedere College Past Pupils' Union, the aim of which is to encourage social interchange among Belvederians and to promote the aims of the Society to which the College belongs. The Union has a number of sub-committees including the Belvedere Youth Club, which provides social, recreational and educational facilities for youth in the Dublin city centre area, and Belvedere Social Services, which provides housing for young vulnerable homeless boys who would otherwise be at grave risk, and facilitates them with opportunities for training and employment.</p>

<p>Under Irish law, entrance tests were recently prohibited. Potential students now undergo an assessment and interview with a faculty member (Belvedere is known for its high academic standards). Preference is given to the progeny of Old Belvederians. Although private and fee-paying, the school awards a number of full scholarships each year in furtherance of the school's aim to be socially just.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belvedere_College_99ba.html" title="Edit section: Sports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>
<p>Belvedere College has a strong <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby</a> football tradition. In 2005, for the first time in the school's history, they won both the <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster_Junior_Cup_8146.html" title="Leinster Junior Cup">Leinster Junior Cup</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leinster_Senior_Cup_%28rugby%29_c1ac.html" title="Leinster Senior Cup (rugby)">Leinster Senior Cup</a>. Only Blackrock College have won the Leinster Senior Cup more times than Belvedere, with Terenure College having the same amount as Belvedere..</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">Cricket</a> has also, traditionally, been a strong sport within the school. Belvedere has won both the Leinster Senior and Junior Cups more times than any other Leinster school.</p>
<p>Belvedere have also won the Leinster and All-Ireland schools debating competition on a number of occasions (most recently in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>), the Alliance Française debating championship and the last ever series of Blackboard Jungle, a popular television programme on <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Telef%C3%ADs_%C3%89ireann_1c03.html" title="Radio Telefís Éireann">RTÉ</a>.</p>
<p>Belvedere's Lifesaving club is also very successful, with a number of All-Ireland Titles to their credit and students have represented Ireland at International Lifesaving Competitions.</p>
<p>Basketball has also become a prominent sport in the school, with the u19 team reaching the All-Ireland Championships and finishing third in 2005.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belvedere_College_99ba.html" title="Edit section: Science">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Science</span></h2>
<p>The promotion of Science has become a priority for Belvedere's Board of Management. Over € 7 million has been invested in the Dargan-Maloney Science and technology block. Dr Garret FitzGerald of the University of Pennsylvania has instituted an annual five-week scholarship to two students who excel in Transition Year science.<a href="http://www.belvederecollege.ie/pdf/BelvedereWinter06.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.belvederecollege.ie/pdf/BelvedereWinter06.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belvedere_College_99ba.html" title="Edit section: Culture of Belvedere">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture of Belvedere</span></h2>
<p>The school motto is Per Vias Rectas translating as <i>"By straight paths"</i> and the College aspires to produce <i>"Men for Others"</i>. Students often write <i>"AMDG"</i> the motto of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_Jesus_37d2.html" title="Society of Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>, ie: <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_maiorem_Dei_gloriam_ddaf.html" title="Ad maiorem Dei gloriam">Ad maiorem Dei gloriam</a>, on the top left of pages of their copybooks. This translates as <i>"For the greater glory of God".</i> Until recently the students would write <i>"LDSetBVM"</i> or Laus Deus Semper et Beatum Virginum Maria (Love God forever and the Blessed Virgin Mary) on the bottom right of the same page, but this practice has largely died out. Yet the writing of AMDG in copybooks is still practiced today.</p>
<p>The unofficial school anthem, often heard at rugby matches, is <i>"Only In God"</i>, based on <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm.html" title="Psalm">Psalm</a> 62 in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. The official anthem is less popular, entitled <i>"Belvedere, Oh Belvedere"</i> it was composed by a past pupil and recorded by the school choir in 1997.</p>
<p>The school <a href="../../../y/e/a/Yearbook.html" title="Yearbook">yearbook</a> is known as <i>"The Belvederian".</i> The term Belvederian is also sometimes used to refer to attending students and Old Belvederian (OB) for alumni. Old Belvederians normally refer to their graduation by using the name of the final year in the college followed by the year as, for example, "OB 1984".</p>
<p>Belvedere College is the backdrop for much of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s novel <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man_fa2a.html" title="Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a>. It is a semi-autobiographical piece of work, and the teacher was based on Joyce's own English teacher, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Dempsey_4bea.html" title="George Dempsey">George Dempsey</a>. In the book Joyce mentions his involvement in the College Opera which continues today. The College's Dramatic Society performs four times during the academic year.</p>
<p>A museum<a href="http://www.belvederecollege.ie/Museum1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.belvederecollege.ie/Museum1.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and archive<a href="http://www.belvederecollege.ie/Museum%20part2.html#Archives" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.belvederecollege.ie/Museum%20part2.html#Archives" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> was opened in 2002 dedicated to the history of Belvedere College and its alumni.</p>
<p><a name="School_Academic_Structure" id="School_Academic_Structure"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belvedere_College_99ba.html" title="Edit section: School Academic Structure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">School Academic Structure</span></h2>
<p>In Belvedere the years and classes are divided in a non standard way, reflecting the Jesuit ethos of the school and the steps towards full education.</p>
<p><b>Secondary School</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: First Grammar (1G)</li>
<li>Second Year: Third Syntax (3S)</li>
<li>Third Year: Second Syntax (2S)</li>
<li>Fourth/Transition Year: First Syntax (1S)</li>
<li>Fifth Year: Poetry (P)</li>
<li>Sixth Year: Rhetoric (R)</li>
<li>Discontinued Seventh Year: Philosophy, taught to those who were too young to attend University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, in each year there are five classes or houses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loyola (L) - after St. <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatius_of_Loyola_8402.html" title="Ignatius of Loyola">Ignatius of Loyola</a>, the founder of the Society of Jesus.</li>
<li>Aylmer (A) - after Fr. Charles Aylmer, a former Headmaster of the school.</li>
<li>Xavier (X) - after St. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Xavier_8b71.html" title="Francis Xavier">Francis Xavier</a>, the famous Jesuit missionary to China, and the school's patron.</li>
<li>Kenney (K) - after Fr. Tom Kenney SJ, an early Belvedere rector.</li>
<li>Finlay (F) - after Fr. George Finlay SJ, the first rector of the school, often known as the "second founder" of Belvedere.</li>
<li>Scully (S) - after Fr. Tom Scully SJ, former Physics teachers in Belvedere.</li>
</ul>
<p>and formerly, but now discontinued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dempsey (D) - after George Dempsey, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s English teacher</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if a student is placed in Loyola form in first year, he is in First Grammar Loyola, or 1GL. He will stay in Loyola until he graduates, from Rhetoric Loyola, or RL.</p>
<p>To make matters seemingly more confusing to the outsider, though patently obvious to the attendee, the preparatory house in the school, since closed, had its own class naming conventions. The house was composed of the four years of school following first holy communion:</p>
<p><b>Primary School</b> (now closed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Third Class: Elements (Ele)</li>
<li>Fourth Class: Rudiments (Rud)</li>
<li>Fifth Class: Third Grammar (3G)</li>
<li>Sixth Class: Second Grammar (2G)</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the junior school the class names were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements - Clonard and Durrow</li>
<li>Rudiments - Tara and Kells</li>
<li>Third Grammar - Ulster, Munster and Connaught</li>
<li>Second Grammar - Xavier, Aylmer and Loyola</li>
</ul>
