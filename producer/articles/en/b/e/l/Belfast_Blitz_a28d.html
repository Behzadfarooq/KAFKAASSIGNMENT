<p>Unfortunately, the government of Northern Ireland lacked the will, energy and capacity to cope with a major crisis when it came.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Craig%2C_1st_Viscount_Craigavon_4734.html" title="James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon">James Craig, Lord Craigavon</a>, was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since is inception in 1921, until his death on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. Lady Londonderry confided to Sir <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Hoare_54bf.html" title="Samuel Hoare">Samuel Hoare</a>, the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Secretary_407d.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, that Craigavon had become <i>"ga-ga".</i> <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Richard Dawson Bates, was the Home Affairs Minister. According to Sir Wilfred Spender, the cabinet secretary, <i>"incapable of giving his responsible officers coherent directions on policy"</i> – actually, he was drunk for most of each day.<span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a href="#fn_1" title="">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p>It appears that <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Brooke%2C_1st_Viscount_Brookeborough_7da3.html" title="Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough">Sir Basil Brooke</a>, the Minister of Agriculture, was the only active minister. He successfully busied himself with the task of making Northern Ireland a major supplier of food to Britain in her time of need.</p>
<p>Mention must be made of John Clarke MacDermott, the Minister of Public Security, who, after the first bombing, initiated the “Hiram Plan” to evacuate the city and to return Belfast to 'normality' as quickly as possible. It was MacDermott who sent the telegram to deValera seeking assistance.</p>
<p>There was unease with the complacent attitude of the government, which led to resignations:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Edmond Warnock, the parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs, resigned from the Northern Ireland government on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. He said "<i>I have heard speeches about Ulster pulling her weight but they have never carried conviction."</i> and "<i>the government has been slack, dilatory and apathetic."</i></li>
<li>Lt. Col. Alexander Robert Gisborne Gordon, Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, resigned on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, explaining to the Commons that the government was <i>"quite unfitted to sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face."</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Craigavon died on Sunday, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. He was succeeded by the 70 year old, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Miller_Andrews_c1af.html" title="John Miller Andrews">John Miller Andrews</a>, who was no more capable of dealing with the situation than his predecessor. The minutes of his cabinet meetings show more discussion on protecting the bronze statue of <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Carson_249a.html" title="Edward Carson">Carson</a> than the provision of air-raid shelters.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_28.html" title="April 28">April 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, six members of the Government threatened to resign, forcing him from office. He resigned on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was almost no preparation for the conflict with Germany.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Craig%2C_1st_Viscount_Craigavon_4734.html" title="James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon">James Craig, Lord Craigavon</a>, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since is inception in 1921, claimed; <i>"Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be."</i> He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: <i>“if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours'.</i>” His reply was: <i>“We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">empire</a> to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster.html" title="Ulster">Ulster</a> people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.”</i></p>
<p>Richard Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, simply refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts that Belfast was a certain Luftwaffe target, nothing was done.</p>
<p><a name="Air-raid_Shelters" id="Air-raid_Shelters"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_Blitz_a28d.html" title="Edit section: Air-raid Shelters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Air-raid Shelters</span></h4>
<p>Belfast, a city with the highest population density had the lowest proportion of air-raid shelters. Prior to the "Belfast Blitz" there were only 200 public shelters, although 4,000 households had built their own shelters. No searchlights set up, as they only arrived on April 10. There were no night-fighters. On the night of the raid, no <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> aircraft took to the air. There were only 22 anti-aircraft guns, six light, and sixteen heavy. On the night, only seven were operated for a short time. There was no smokescreen ability. There were some barrage balloons.</p>
<p>These air-raid shelters were <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_raid_shelter.html#Anderson_shelter" title="Air raid shelter">Anderson shelters</a>. They were just sheets of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corrugated_galvanised_iron.html" title="Corrugated galvanised iron">corrugated galvanised iron</a>. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, these structures provided effective shelter for those who had them.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_Blitz_a28d.html" title="Edit section: Children">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Children</span></h4>
<p>Unlike British cities, children had not been evacuated. There had been the "Hiram Plan" initiated by Richard Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, but it failed to materialise. Less than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 children in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria barracks received a direct hit.</p>

<p>From papers recovered after the war, we know of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance flight over Belfast on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>. The Germans established that Belfast, was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most undefended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:</p>

<p>There had been a number of small bombings, probably by planes that missed their targets over the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Clyde_ffa3.html#Course" title="River Clyde">Clyde</a> or the cities of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_West_England_8c09.html" title="North West England">north-west of England</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, John McDermott, Minister for Security, wrote to the Prime Minister, John Andrews expressing his concerns that Belfast was so poorly protected. <i>"Up to now we have escaped attack. So had Clydeside until recently. Clydeside got its blitz during the period of the last moon. There [is] ground for thinking that the ... enemy could not easily reach Belfast in force except during a period of moonlight. The period of the next moon from say the 7th to the 16th of April may well bring our turn."</i> Unfortunately, McDermott was proved right. On 7th April 1941 Belfast suffered the first of three air raids.</p>
<p>The first deliberate raid took place on the night of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>. (Some authors count this as the second raid of four). It targeted the docks. Neighbouring residential areas were also hit. Six <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinkel_He_111_aa95.html" title="Heinkel He 111">Heinkel He 111</a> bombers, from Kampfgruppe 26, flying at 7,000 feet, dropped <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incendiary_bomb.html" title="Incendiary bomb">incendiaries</a>, high explosive and parachute-bombs. By British blitz experience, casualties were light. 13 lost their lives, including a soldier killed when an anti-aircraft battery, at the Balmoral show-grounds, misfired. The most significant loss was a 4½ acre factory floor for manufacturing the <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fuselage.html" title="Fuselage">fuselages</a> of <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_Stirling_87ea.html" title="Short Stirling">Short Stirling</a> bombers.

Simpson shot down one of the Heinkels over <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downpatrick.html" title="Downpatrick">Downpatrick</a>.</p>
<p>The Luftwaffe crews returned to their base in Northern <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and reported that Belfast's defences were, <i>"inferior in quality, scanty and insufficient"</i>.</p>

<p>That evening up to 200 bombers left their bases in Northern <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and the Low Countries and headed for <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>.

<p>At 10:40<small>PM</small> the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_defense_siren.html" title="Civil defense siren">air raid sirens sounded</a>. Accounts differ as to when flares were dropped to light up the city.</p>
<p>The first attack was against the city's waterworks, which had been attacked in the previous raid. High explosives were dropped. Initially it was thought that the Germans had mistaken this reservoir for the harbour and shipyards, where many ships, including <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Ark_Royal_%2891%29_d280.html" title="HMS Ark Royal (91)">HMS <i>Ark Royal</i></a> were being repaired. However that attack was not an error. When incendiaries were dropped and the city burned, the water pressure was too low for fire-fighting.</p>
<p>Wave after wave of bombers dropped their incendiaries, high explosives and land-mines. Altogether 203 metric tons of high explosives bombs, 80 landmines attached to parachutes, and 800 firebomb canisters containing 96,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on the city.</p>
<p>There was no opposition. In the mistaken belief that they might damage RAF fighters, the 7 <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aircraft.html" title="Anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> batteries, ceased firing. But, the RAF had not responded. The bombs continued to fall until 5<small>AM</small>.</p>

<p>When the bombs fell, the population did not know what to do. There were few bomb shelters. An air raid shelter on the Hallidays Road received a direct hit killing all those taking shelter within it. Many people who were dug out of the rubble alive had taken shelter underneath their stairs and were fortunate enough that their homes had not received a direct hit or had even caught on fire.</p>
<p>The population did not know whether to run, hide or stay in their beds.</p>
<p>In the New Lodge area people had taken refuge in a Mill, which presumably appeared to them to be a sturdy building. Tragically 35 were crushed to death when the mill wall collapsed. In another mill, the York Street Mill, one of its massive sidewalls collapsed on to Sussex and Vere Streets killing all those who still remained in their homes.</p>
<p>Major O’Sullivan reported <i>"In the heavily ‘blitzed’ areas people ran panic-stricken into the streets and made for the open country. As many were caught in the open by blast and secondary missiles, the enormous number of casualties can be readily accounted for. It is perhaps true that many saved their lives running but I am afraid a much greater number lost them or became casualties."</i></p>
<p>That night almost 300 people, many from the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shankill_Road%2C_Belfast_f2b5.html" title="Shankill Road, Belfast">Shankill</a>, took refuge in Clonard Monastery in the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falls_Road_865c.html" title="Falls Road">Falls Road</a>. The crypt under the sanctuary and the cellar under the working sacristy, had been fitted out and opened to the people, as an air-raid shelter.

<p>The mortuary services had emergency plans to deal with only 200 bodies. In the event, the public baths on the Falls Road and on Peter’s Hill, and the large fruit market, Saint George’s market, were used as mortuaries. 150 corpses remained in The Falls Road baths for three days. Then they were buried in a mass grave, 123 were still unidentified. There were a further 255 corpses were laid out in St. George’s Market. Many bodies and parts of bodies could not be identified</p>
<p>Mass graves were dug in the Milltown and City Cemeteries where the unclaimed bodies of those who died on that Easter Tuesday are buried.</p>

<p>Nurse Emma Duffin, who had served in the Great War, contrasted death in that conflict with what she saw:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“ (Great War casualties) had died in hospital beds, their eyes had been reverently closed, their hands crossed to their breasts. Death had to a certain extent been...made decent. It was solemn, tragic, dignified, but here it was grotesque, repulsive, horrible. No attendant nurse had soothed the last moments of these victims; no gentle reverent hand had closed their eyes or crossed their hands. With tangled hair, staring eyes, clutching hands, contorted limbs, their grey-green faces covered with dust, they lay, bundled into the coffins, half-shrouded in rugs or blankets, or an occasional sheet, still wearing their dirty, torn twisted garments. Death should be dignified, peaceful; Hitler had made even death grotesque. I felt outraged, I should have felt sympathy, grief, but instead feelings of revulsion and disgust assailed me.”</i></dd>

<p>Major Seán O’Sullivan, reported on the intensity of the bombing in some areas, such as the Antrim Road, where bombs <i>“fell within fifteen to twenty yards of one another.”</i> The most heavily-bombed area was that which lay between York Street and the Antrim Road..</p>
<p>His opinion was that the whole civil defence sector was utterly overwhelmed. Heavy jacks were unavailable. He described some distressing consequences, such as how <i>“in one case the leg and arm of a child had to be amputated before it could be extricated.”</i></p>
<p>In his opinion, the greatest want was the lack of hospital facilities. He went to the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mater_Infirmorum_Hospital_0a66.html" title="Mater Infirmorum Hospital">Mater Hospital</a> at 2<small>PM</small> in the afternoon, 9 hours after the raid ended, to find the street with a traffic jam of ambulances waiting to admit their casualties. He spoke with Professor Flynn, (Thomas Flynn an Australian based at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mater_Infirmorum_Hospital_0a66.html" title="Mater Infirmorum Hospital">Mater hospital</a> and father of <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Flynn_9845.html" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> of Hollywood fame) head of the casualty service for the city, who told him of <i>“casualties due to shock, blast and secondary missiles, such as glass, stones, pieces of piping, etc.”</i> O’Sullivan reported: <i>“There were many terrible mutilations among both living and dead - heads crushed, ghastly abdominal and face wounds, penetration by beams, mangled and crushed limbs etc”</i>. His report concluded with: <i>“a second Belfast would be too horrible to contemplate’</i>.</p>

<p>220,000 fled from the city. Many “<i>arrived in Fermanagh having nothing with them only night shirts”</i>. 10,000 “officially” crossed the border. Over 500 received care from the Irish Red Cross in Dublin. The town of Dromara saw its population increase from 500 to 2,500. In Newtownards, Bangor, Larne, Carrickfergus, Lisburn and Antrim many thousands of Belfast citizens took refuge either with friends or strangers</p>
<p>Major O’Sullivan reported on a</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“continuous trek to railway stations. The refugees looked dazed and horror stricken and many had neglected to bring more than a few belongings” … “Any and every means of exit from the city was availed of and the final destination appeared to be a matter of indifference. Train after train and bus after bus were filled with those next in line. At nightfall the Northern Counties Station was packed from platform gates to entrance gates and still refugees were coming along in a steady stream from the surrounding streets... Open military lorries were finally put into service and even expectant mothers and mothers with young children were put into these in the rather heavy drizzle that lasted throughout the evening. On the 17th I heard that hundreds who either could not get away or could not leave for other reasons simply went out into the fields and remained in the open all night with whatever they could take in the way of covering.”</i></dd>
<dd>Moya Woodside noted in her diary: <i>“Evacuation is taking on panic proportions. Roads out of town are still one stream of cars, with mattresses and bedding tied on top. Everything on wheels is being pressed into service. People are leaving from all parts of town and not only from the bombed areas. Where they are going, what they will find to eat when they get there, nobody knows.”</i></dd>

<p>Regrettably, there were those who took advantage of the misfortune of others. Cabinet Minister Richard Dawson Bates informed the cabinet of rack-renting of barns, and over thirty people per house in some areas.</p>

He believed that this was being done already but it was inevitable that a certain number of civilian lives should be lost in the course of heavy bombing from the air".</i></p>

<p>Among the people of Northern Ireland, reactions tended to blame their government for inadequate precautions. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Henderson_65aa.html" title="Tommy Henderson">Tommy Henderson</a>, an Independent Unionist MP in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Commons_of_Northern_Ireland_9906.html" title="House of Commons of Northern Ireland">House of Commons of Northern Ireland</a>, summed up their feelings when he invited the Minister of Home Affairs to Hannahstown and the Falls Road, saying "The Catholics and the Protestants are going up there mixed and they are talking to one another. They are sleeping in the same sheugh, below the same tree or in the same barn. They all say the same thing, that the government is no good."</p>
<p>There were those who sought to attribute blame for the calamity.</p>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../b/e/l/Image%7EBelfast-Lough-2.png_2473.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/b/bd/Belfast-Lough-2.png/200px-Belfast-Lough-2.png" alt="" width="200" height="261" longdesc="../../../b/e/l/Image%7EBelfast-Lough-2.png_2473.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>One claim was that the Germans located Belfast by heading for Dublin, which was not observing a blackout and following the railway lines north. In "The Blitz: Belfast in the war years", Dr Brian Barton writes <i>"Government Ministers felt with justification, that the Germans were able to use the unblacked out lights in the south to guide them to their targets in the North."</i> Dr Barton insists that Belfast was "too far north" to use radio guidance.</p>
<p>Other writers, such as Tony Gray in "The Lost Years" say that the Germans did follow their radio guidance beams. It seems strange that the railway line, and the railway telegraph wire which was used to call Dublin for help, remained intact if they were following it. Several accounts point out that Belfast, standing at the end of the long inlet of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast_Lough_b637.html" title="Belfast Lough">Belfast Lough</a>, would be easily located.</p>
<p>Another claim was that the Catholic population in general and the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_%281922-1969%29_80f4.html" title="Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)">IRA</a> in particular guided the bombers. Dr Barton writes: <i>"the Catholic population was much more strongly opposed to conscription, was inclined to sympathise with Germany"</i>, <i>"...there were suspicions that the Germans were assisted in identifying targets, held by the Unionist population. It is true that the bulk of the damage caused by the raids was in Protestant areas."</i>, and <i>"The police, at the time reported seeing lights shining from the hills surrounding the city and thought it suspicious."</i></p>
<p>He is correct to say that the bulk of the damage caused by the raids was in Protestant areas. However many of the industries attacked, such as the Harland and Wolff Shipyards, mainly employed Protestants. The areas adjoining these industries were largely Protestant.</p>
<p>This view was probably influenced by the decision of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/IRA_Army_Council_9017.html" title="IRA Army Council">IRA Army Council</a> to support Germany. However they were not in a position to communicate with the Germans. Information recovered from Germany after the war showed that the planning of the blitz was based entirely on their own aerial reconnaissance.

<p>After three days, sometime after 6pm the fire crews from south of the border began making up their hose and ladders to head for home. By then most of the major fires were under control and the firemen from Clydeside and other British cities were arriving. Some had received food, others were famished. All were exhausted. Two of the crews received refreshments in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banbridge.html" title="Banbridge">Banbridge</a>; others were entertained in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Order_of_Hibernians_4ced.html" title="Ancient Order of Hibernians">Ancient Order of Hibernians</a> hall in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newry.html" title="Newry">Newry</a>.</p>
<p>Belatedly in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> on the fiftieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War an invitation was received by the Dublin Fire Brigade, addressed to any survivors of those historic days, to attend a function at <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillsborough_Castle_10fc.html" title="Hillsborough Castle">Hillsborough Castle</a> and meet <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince Charles</a>. Only four of those who were there were still known to be alive at that time, one Tom Coleman, travelled north to receive some recognition for his colleagues' solidarity at such a critical time.</p>

<p>There was a later raid on Belfast on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>; it was confined to the docks and shipyards. Again the Irish emergency services crossed the border, this time without an invitation.</p>

<p>Most civilian deaths during bombing raids are caused by falling masonry. The advice for those unable to use a bomb shelter was to go under their stairs. A staircase is the strongest internal structure. Many lives were saved by this advice. In the aftermath of a raid, bricks and debris from collapsed houses had to be removed to release those buried below under their staircase. One particular family were trapped in this way. They had been calling for assistance for some time. Eventually, to their relief, they heard digging overhead. They shouted for help. The replies were reassuring, even though they were in a strange accent. The family were perplexed. The conversation continued. In time, a brick was removed, they could see out. Looking up, they saw men in a strange uniform. “Who are you?” they enquired. “We are the Dublin fire-brigade” was the reply. “That must have been a mighty bomb – we have been blown all the way from Belfast to Dublin!”</p>
