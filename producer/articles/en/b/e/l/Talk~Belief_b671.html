<p>Hmm. Im wondering, how come Hume and Kant seem to be quoted so often here in WP. Certainly they are <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillar.html" title="Pillar">pillars</a> of western thought, but they do have some <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holes.html" title="Holes">holes</a> in their ideas, and besides, I thought we had long ago begun the process of weening ourselves off of our <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacred_cow.html" title="Sacred cow">sacred cows</a> of westernism.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Westernism"? What's that? If you mean Western culture generally, um, no, I'm not aware that anyone other than some "postmodern" and extremely politically correct types are making a move to "weaning ourselves" off of this material. We've got to have a huge amount of such material on Wikipedia if it's going to be complete. But this doesn't stop you from adding as much "non-Western" (whatever that means) type material as you like. --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Not again... More silly resentment towards "postmodernism" and "politically correct types".... they're not out to kill you. So you disagree with them, get over it. I'd be willing to bet that you (yes, you, Larry Sanger) will be dwelling on this absurd cynicism for a very long time. Postmodernism is just a catch-all phrase for something easy to criticise; the fact is that there is no such thing as a postmodern "movement" or "school of thought" or "belief system"... The obsession with postmodernism is simply a phenomenon among critics who are desperate for a board to throw darts at.</p>
<hr />
<p>Would it be relevant (or interesting) to mention the logical convolutions of <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Smullyan_9ab0.html" title="Raymond Smullyan">Raymond Smullyan</a>, eg characters who believe one thing, but consistently lie, so say the opposite, etc?</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not sure--why would it (on this page)? Wouldn't that belong on <a href="../../../l/y/i/Lying.html" title="Lying">lying</a> or something like that? --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Just a thought (I'll crib what I've typed here to pad out the stub on Smulllyan, at any rate). At one point he introduces characters who only believe only false things, yet lie: hence all their statements are true. -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I wonder what point he was making with that. Sounds interesting...</p>

<p>If I may add my own experience (and I am quite sure many people would recognize a pattern here)... I have a firm belief that reincarnation exists because instinctively I can't imagine I could stop being conscious after death, but I also admit I can't live forever. But by rational thinking I also know that nothing to my knowledge can justify reincarnation. This is only one example among others where belief seems to oppose knowledge. I think there are many other such examples, essentially about concepts difficult or impossible to prove, for example involving the existence or non-existance of God. <a href="../../../f/a/f/User%7EFafner_f8ab.html" title="User:Fafner">Fafner</a> 09:47, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC) ---</p>
<p>If I find the time... I'll try to add sometime here. Hume (amongst others) noted that we acquire beliefs passively, that the aquisition of them is not subject to the will. Bernard Williams' paper 'Deciding to Believe' investigated this and tries to show that the coneptual relations between belief, truth and evidence rule out voluntary believing. While some have shown that his argument for the incoherence of 'believing at will' is not quite right, most philsophers do believe that decision and belief can't be linked in the same way as, for instance, decision and imagination&#160;: I can successfully decide to imagine a scene, but I can't successfullly decide to belief that scene represents truely. However, as Williams noted, this doesn't rule out deciding and influencing our belief by more "roundabout routes". One could embark on a course of action, hypnosis or drugs were his suggestions, such that afterwards you would have brought it about that you belive some proposition or other. Williams remarks that this would make the person "deeply irrational". Some have questioned this but it reamins to be seen whether any convincing account of belief at will can be found.

<b>Note:</b> This entry needs work. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdraeus_0992.html" title="User:Adraeus">Adraeus</a> 02:10, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)<br />A <b>belief system</b> (also <i>system of beliefs</i>) is...<br />Here is my small contribution. It will probably need lots of works,
but after all we have to start from somewhere ;-)
I don't know if the comparison has been used somewhere, but a belief
system really looks like a mathematical logical system with a set of
axioms (unproved beliefs) and inferring rules (reasonnings).
Axioms (beliefs) are very debatable since it usually involves beliefs
in God(s), supernatural, or even science after all (how many people
among you has ever <i>seen</i> and <i>verified</i> an experiment in quantum
mechanics? probably not the majority, certainly not my case but I
<i>believe</i> in quantum mechanics) ;-)
Inferring rules (reasonnings) are usually common to most people.
Deduction is the most reliable, induction is used to assert probable
conclusions (although I met someone acknowledging <i>only</i> induction
as reliable and rejecting deduction).

<p>I seem to recall something about the application of Gödel's proof to beliefs, to demonstrate that one's beliefs cannot, taken as a whole, be logically self-consistent. It seemed very interesting at the time, but I can't pull up a cite -- can anyone help?

When you say "X has a probability of more than 50%", you don't believe that "X", you believe that "X is more probable than not"; this is entirely different. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules.lt_85f8.html" title="User:Jules.lt">Jules LT</a> 19:13, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

(edited to correct it in a way)</p>
<p>-&gt; To belief is diffrent from the word believe, believe is to trust and see something in another person. But belief is like to imagen to trust and have faith into a higher being. Belief can't just be put out in words it comes from you and is within you.</p>
<p>I think what you ment was believe and even there is a mistake in that. If you believe in a person you either do it or not you can not just believe have trust and faith in them her him or what ever just 50% else what kind of person would you be?</p>

<p><i>Beliefs can be acquired through perception, reasoning, contemplation or communication</i></p>
<p>This statement is plain incorrect, How on Earth can resoning be related to 'belief' . Infact they have completely opposite meanings. Obviously if you can reason(or if there is a logical explanation) to something, then there won't be any 'need' to believe because that 'thing' would be undeniable fact(like a maths equation). The point of belief only arises if there is an absence of resoning!!</p>
<p>The only possibility here is if 'resoning' is being referred to as 'bias' dependent on culture/surroundings etc. Reasonit 00:26, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this results from a confusion between belief as an unproven fact and belief as a conviction adopted after a reasonning (for example a political position). The difference between the two of them might be thin in some cases. Just a thought... <a href="../../../f/a/f/User%7EFafner_f8ab.html" title="User:Fafner">Fafner</a> 08:01, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes. A belief can be adopted based on a number of criteria: - authority - experience - perceived phenomena - reasoning - discussion (e.g. clarification/debate)</p>
<p>"Beliefs" don't necessarily have any relation to reason. Especially those induced by authority figures. An associated topic might be rigidity of belief systems and conflicts arising therefrom..</p>

<p>"<i>Most philosophers hold the view that belief formation is to some extent spontaneous and involuntary.</i></p>
<p>Most philosophers!? That's a bold and sweeping statement. I'm not sure if to just suggest that is radically POV or ask for some kind of verification. For now I've added a "citeation needed" tag and left it.</p>
<p>Maybe "many philosophers" would be a better choice of words, and easier to add a few references for. The word "most" suggests that nearly all philosophers past-and-present agree about this - somehow, I seriously doubt that... -<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeural_a81d.html" title="User:Neural">Neural</a> 03:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Belief is usually defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification; therefore a belief is a subjective mental interpretation derived from perceptions, contemplation(reasoning), or communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is simply wrong. At least, there is no such definition in my SOD, and if it were the case, one would not be able to believe a verified proposition. Nor is "1+1=2" a "subjective mental interpretation" (Can you think of something that is subjective and yet not mental? Interpretation of what?), yet it is something one might believe.</p>

<p>The paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the religious sense, "belief" refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation — generally called faith. Historically, faiths were generated by groups seeking a functionally valid foundation to sustain them. The generally accepted faiths usually note that, when the exercise of faith leads to oppression, clarification or further revelation is called for.</p>

<p>has been removed. I can;t see a reason to give prominence to religious belief. Someone may wish to insert it into a new section within the article. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 07:38, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that the epistimology section contradicts itself, saying that belief is a deductive process, but the building of the belief system is an inductive one. Am I missing something? I'm in favor of stating all belief systems are inherently inductive, and that all deductive processes used in the belief system are based off of premises that require induction.</p>
