<p>Frankie Ruiz helped replace long-time Cross Country coach Carlos Barquin. Ruiz, a full time marathon runner, has helped the Belen Wolverines triumph and maintain their tough position to always qualify for States.</p>
<p>Richard Stuart has successfully led the football program for over 20 years; Belen won its first district title in 2006, with a win over Monsignor Pace. Belen will have five football players playing Ivy League football in the Fall of 2007-2008 (two at Princeton; one at Yale; one at Columbia; one at Dartmouth).</p>
<p>The crew team has become one of the toughest teams in the school as of late and has improved in both size and efficiency due to the coaching of former head coaches Dawn Viyella and Adam Thorstad and new head coach Edgardo Carranza. Belen also has an excellent soccer team. In the last four years the team has seen itself reach the Regional finals twice and was District champion three out of the last five years.</p>
<p>Belen recently renewed athletic competition with its longtime rival, Columbus. The schools resumed their basketball rivalry in 2003 after not playing for over 20 years. Belen won the 2004, 2005, and 2007 games. The two schools have recently begun to compete against each other in Football and Soccer. The 2006-2007 school year was met with great success by both the swimming team and cross country team at Belen Jesuit. Both teams won state titles in their respective divisions.</p>
