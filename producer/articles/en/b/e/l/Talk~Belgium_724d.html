<p>Can anyone help characterise the use of the English language in Belgium in such a way as to ensure it is not deleted by those who seem to be interested in bilingual "purity"?</p>
<p>Also, can anyone find any statistics or references that are not treated as POV by these people?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>English is pretty limited in official Belgium - there are only 40,000 of us here, and it is forbidden for use in Government and associated institutions. As an example, no local government can create publications in English; instead, they ask the British Embassy to send out publications on events. Weird or what. And if anyone ever insists to you of bilingual "purity", tell them they're an idiot and that Beglium is a tri-lingual state... Although they have a point; no English and very little German (only around 600,000), so you can't really argue with them I'm afraid. David</p>

<dd>English is not forbidden for use in official publications (e.g. laws, royal decrees, etc.) by the Government and associated institutions (e.g. Regions, Communities, municipalities). It's simply that it is not an official language of the country. This means that no official document (e.g. income tax returns are available in English, even if non official translations - most of the time written by private companies for instance, may exist). Anyway, I am not sure that filing a income tax return drafted in English would be regarded as valid by the Belgian tax authorities. But I think the same would happen in English speaking countries like the UK or the USA if I tried to file a income tax return written in French or in Dutch. This being said, numerous official institution, including the federal government publish documents in English. But most of the time, these documents are merely informative and not legally binding. Please think that Belgium has to cope with 3 official languages, which is not easy and quite expensive. If one can of course discuss the fact that 60 000 (or 70 000 according to the sources) German speaking people in Belgium have the right to have the laws and the official documents translated into German while this is not the case for the 40 000 English speaking people living in Belgium. But one should keep in mind that these German speaking people are Belgian citizens while most of the English people aren't. And if Belgium had to translate offical documents into foreign (i.e. non official) languages, priority should then be given to the Arabian language which is the native language of much more people currently living in Belgium than those who speak English. --<a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob-BE_9c69.html" title="User:Lebob-BE">Lebob-BE</a> 21:24, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Pardon my language, but it is bullshit to say that we "minimize the differences" between Dutch as it is spoken in Holland and Belgium when we say it is still one and the same language. Any linguist can assure you that there is far more difference between the English spoken in Bristol and Brighton than between the Dutch of Antwerp and Amsterdam. And yet no-one would dare to imply that they speak more than one language in England.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The majority of the Dutch people here are rather inclined to minimise the differences between the two, but the majority of the Flemish people know all to well that what they speak is 'vlaams' (flemish), and not 'dutch' as it is used in the Netherlands, though historical tendencies have tried to unify it, even by using 'ABN' (General *Civilised* Dutch, for crying out loud). Because it was so blatantly denigatory of Flemish, they ultimately dropped the 'civilised' part. But the tendency and attitude of some elitist intellectuals (including some Belgians, I may add) remains the same. The fact there are Belgians striving for this language-unification too, is not surprising, seen the fact that some Belgians even want a (political) unification with the Netherlands (notably in the right wing Vlaams Belang).</p>
<p>Now, I can't say Flemish is an officially recognised language, simply because, well, it isn't recognised as such due to the historical tendencies I just mentionned, and thus I can accept this statement in the wikipedia. But trying to dilute Flemish as being 'only dialects' is absurd; it may not have official status as the language of a distinct country, but 'in the street' Flemings call what they speak 'Flemish'.</p>
<p>The fact that there are different flemish dialects does nothing to change that, whether a person speaks West-flemish or not; an east-fleming will still consider it Flemish (and vice versa).</p>
<p>So, no, Flemish can not be portrayed as an official language of it's own, but it STILL should be portrayed as the unnofficial language of the Flemings. This lies, in practise, nearer to the truth then pretending it's all one big happy unified language, certainly considering the reality of practical (and daily) use (and perception about it) of the majority of the Flemish people. Flemish is, in this sense, not regarded as being the same as Dutch, and neither are Flemings Dutchmen, even if some would like it to be so.</p>
<p>The difference between Dutch and Flemish is very simple: in general, both languages are the same, however, some pronouncements and words are different. Compare it with the difference between German (Germany) and Swiss-German (Switserland).</p>
<hr />
<p>Is the language Dutch or Flemish? Even if Flemish is a Dutch dialect, shouldn't it be mentioned in the table?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Flemish is indeed just a dialect. Putting it in the table would also mean you'd have to 1) say Australian English, Canadian English, etc. 2) include other (major) dialects. The official language is Dutch, and is not different from the Dutch spoken in the Netherlands. In spoken language, the pronounciation is different, and there are different words, but it's rather like the English spoken in the UK vs. US . <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a></dd>

<dd>Afrikaans is a completely different languages as it has its own grammar, a different vocabulary and its own literature. Afrikaans is clearly derived from Dutch and 'close'; speakers from one understand the other, more or less as German-speakers understand quite some Dutch and vice versa, or as the speakers of the various Scandinavian languages. Rudi</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that's something different. When Dutch settled in South Africa in the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a>, the kept their own language, Dutch. However, from that point, the two language evolved concurrently, and in different directions, especially after Dutch control in South Africa ended in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1806.html" title="1806">1806</a> or thereabouts. Calling Afrikaans a dialect now would not be true; it has become a language on its own. It is, however, still possible for Dutch speakers to comprehend the basic language, as many words and constructions are still the same. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a></p>
<p>Some more info: if you look at <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ethnologue.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethnologue.com</a> , you'll find more linguistic details than I can offer you. You'll see that Flemish and Dutch are the same, though there is also a real language called Vlaams (=Flemish) spoken by only 200,000 people. But then again, several of the languages listed here would be classified by me as a dialect; then again I'm not a linguist. <a href="../../../j/h/e/User%7EJheijmans_2d7f.html" title="User:Jheijmans">Jeronimo</a></p>

<dd>The "Vlaams" Jeronimo speaks of here is more commonly known as "West-Vlaams" or West-Flemish. This is a Dutch dialect that is considered by many to have suficient different traits to be called a language separate from Dutch.

<p>This won't change much to the core of the discussion, but to call Flemish a dialect is not really true in my opinion. It's rather a regional variety of Dutch.

<dd>No, it's not a real dialect (per ethnologue), you're right.

<p>There are two meanings of the word dialect, one is the official linguistic meaning, something like 'a child node in a family tree of languages'. In that sense, English is a dialect of Germanic, which is in turn a dialect of the Indo-European language. In that sense, Afrikaans is a dialect of Dutch.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I beg to disagree. This is only a rather theoretic definition. A much more pragmatic definition is that dialects are not formally defined; they don't have a proper grammar + vocabulary + literature. As such, dialects tend to gradually fade over in neighbouring dialects. There are no clear boundaries for the areas of each dialect. As such, dialects are basically mainly different in their spoken expression. Most people speaking a dialect will write 100% of the time in the standard language. As someone said below, a dialect is something ambiguous by nature. Rudi Dierick, 31 July 2004</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The other meaning is an informal one, something like 'an un-language, a derivative of the "real" language'. Rudi Dierick</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both meanings of 'dialect' are useless and I would suggest that we refrain from using them, not from the POV of being politically correct (I personally hate PCness), but for the practical reason that the use of the word 'dialect' is ambiguous and that both meanings are not really useful in this discussion.--<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranko_4c86.html" title="User:Branko">user:Branko</a></p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I guess the correct definition of dialect is "geographical variation of language" - then, everybody speaks a dialect: what happens is that some dialects assume the status of standard languages and so people start saying that who speaks the standard language doesn't speak a dialect and everybody else speaks a dialect, which assumes a degoratory sense then. Flemish is the group of dialects of the Neerlandese language spoken in Belgium. Both Belgium and Netherlands accept the unity of the Neerlandese language spoken in both sides of the border. The dialects of the language are a continuum which does not present a clear limit between what is Flemish and what is Dutch, I guess. The situation is similar to Catalan, which is called Valencian in Valencia, despite the fact that the language is the same and dialectal variation is also a continuum. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarco_Neves_4f1c.html" title="User:Marco Neves">Marco Neves</a>Marco Neves
<dl>
<dd>Are you sure about this? As far as I understood, Catalan as an idiom is clearly well defined, normalised and standardise"d, and, as a result, quite widely used in education. Flemish, on the contrary, is not used at all in education. Moreover, catalan has a vocabulary which in terms of its linguistic roots is quite different from Spanish; Catalan words having latin roots for 99%, whereas Spanish has some 60% latin roots, some 30% arab, and some 10% visigothic.</dd>
<dd>E.g.: 'city hall' is in Spanish 'ayuntamiento' (Arab roots) whereas in Catana it becomes 'casa de commu' (strictly latin roots). Rudi</dd>

<p>In Flanders, or the Northern part of Belgium, there are linguistically four groups of Dutch dialects. The first one is the dialect West-Vlaams (mainly spoken in West-Vlaanderen). Then you have Oost-Vlaams (spoken in Oost-Vlaanderen). The third dialect is Brabants (spoken in both Brabant and Antwerp). The fourth is Limburgs (spoken in Limburg). The use of the word Flemish for all the Dutch dialects is linguistically incorrect, but is widely used. The official language as you all know is Dutch. The use of these dialects is nowadays declining among youngsters (mainly the vocabulary). But you can still hear trough the accent from which region a person is originating.</p>

<p>Flemish is barely different enough from Dutch to be called a dialect. Afrikaans is only just different enough to be called a separate language. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 10:02, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Flemish (Vlaams) is a group of dialects spoken in the belgian provinces West -and Oost Vlaanderen, the dutch province Zeeland, and the french region Nord-pas de Calais. Other dialectgroups in the Flemish region are Brabandic (Brabants) and Limburgish (Limburgs) these are all dutch dialects.</p>

I haven't read all the comments here, so sorry if I'm repeating something, but it absolutely should be referred to as Flemish. It is a minor language in it's own right; it has varied grammar, different pronunciations and entirely different idioms to Dutch. Whilst I realise this could also be said for Australian/Canadian/whatever else English, I never see those as the same. Also, the Flemish have quite a strong identity which is contained in their language (I live here, so I'm not just making it up), so I think it definitely should be changed - in fact, I have changed it several times, but it's always been changed back. And yes, there are four main dialects of FLEMISH (not Dutch, there are far more). If you want to picky, Flemish is a dialect of Dutch itself, but is more recognised and established than "normal" dialects might be. If that makes any sense. David</p>

A bit of search on the web gives a large choice of alternatives: <i>strength lies in unity - strength in unity - strength through union - union (unity) makes strength - in union (unity) there is strength - union (unity) is strength</i>. Why not <i>union makes strength</i>&#160;?

<p>I think that this remark is not true&#160;: "For example, a school building in Brussels would be regulated by the regional government of Brussels. The school as an institution however would fall under the regulations of either the Flemish government, if the primary language of teaching is Dutch, or the French Community government, if the primary language is French".</p>
<p>The "French" school buildings are not regulated by the bilingual (French-Dutch) Brussels-Capital Region's Government itself but are regulated by the Société Publique d'Administration des Bâtiments Scolaires, which is a public office dependent of the French-Speaking Community Commission (Commission Communautaire Française) at a time when the school herself as education service is regulated by the French Community Wallonia-Brussels (the French Community is the community of all french-speaking people, Brussels people and Walloon people together). I don't know about the "Flemish" school buildings in Brussels (regulated by the Flemish Community Commission - VGC-Vlaams Gemeenschapscommissie - or by the Flemish Community-Vlaams Gemenschap&#160;?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that the name of 'French Community Wallonia-Brussels' is only a very recent invention which, moreover, is unconstitutional. The proper, official name is 'Communauté française de Belgique' or its English translation (see also all legal texts on this).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The term 'French Community Wallonia-Brussels' is hotly contested by all Flemings (within and outside Brussels) and German-speakers as the term gives the erronuous impression that it refers to the community of all Walloons and all Brussels people, and, related with that, the equally wrong both Wallonia and Brussels are both French-speaking, whereas in fact it only refers to the French-speakers in Brussels and in Wallonia. Anyway, the German-speakers clearly don't feel Walloon at all; they deeply resent being 'dumped' in the Walloon region, and often put forward proposals to get out of it. One might conclude that the term 'French Community Wallonia-Brussels' carries a strongly political, partisan, and slightly imperialistic suggestion.</dd>
<dd>For or all these reasons, I feel this confusing and non-constitutional term is not appropriate for an encyclopedia as Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>"hotly contested" "all flemings" "they deeply resent" imperialistic" all seem a bit exaggerated to me. The reality is that most Belgians don't give a danm about the nationalist mumbo-jumbo. Most don't even know the state works, let alone have an opinion on it. When such emotional terminology regarding a Belgian institution is used , it can only mean one thing&#160;: the text above was written by a (in this case flemish) nationalist.</p>

<p>The river Maas should be called by both its Dutch and French names in an article on Belgium, and only in Dutch in an article on Holland or Limburg, and only in French in an article on France or Liege.</p>
<p>Also, it is actually better to say Schelde than Scheldt in English, since there is a tendency to use real names (Aachen, Torino, Brugge, Vlissingen, Hoek van Holland) rather than names copied from the French (Aix la Chapelle, Turin, Bruges) or obsolete English names (Flushing, Hook of Holland).</p>
<p>As the major rivers Maas and Schelde are given, however these are the Dutch names. To my knowledge Scheldt is the official English name for the river, while the French name Meuse is used in English according to VanDaele. Anyone mind if I edit the right names in. (Also: Sinterklaasdag should be written as one word) First post here, so I thought it might be better if I didn't just barge in and change the main page. -- Jeroen H, 4 May 2004 (Belgium)</p>

<dl>
<dd><font color="blue">You are correct in that it is impossible to known the exact percentages for French and Dutch-speakers in brussels. However, given that Dutch and French are the official languages in Brussels, it is scientifically fully correct to take into account the widely shared estimates when discussing the languages spoken in belgium. That's why I expressly said '+/- 60' and '+/' 40'. Please, note that that estimate remain well below the official claims of the Flemish authorities. Of course, you will also appreciate that my approach does respect all scientific requirements, as well as the sensitivities of both groups involved. I really don't see why those carefully worded figures (as estimates) should be removed. That would only make the game of the French-speaking nationalists who radically want to remove all reference to the existence of Flemongs in brussels, and all links between them and the other Flemings.</font></dd>

<p><i>I am from Brussels and French-speaking. Just because the Brussels region is regarded as 'bilingual' this does not mean you can label all Brussels citizens as speaking both languages. There is nothing scientific in your claim. Brussels is a predominantly French-speaking region (and this irritates the Flemish community since they claim the city as their capital). As for French-speaking nationalists, there isn't much of French-speaking nationalism anymore. Flemish nationalists (Vlaams Blok/Vlaams Belang) are more virulent. (Chris 20/10/05)</i></p>
<p>So, any hint about the following questions? (with my guesses in brackets):</p>
<ul>
<li>How many inhabitants in the Brussels-Capital Region do speak French (85%&#160;?), Dutch (10%&#160;?) or another language (5%&#160;?) as their <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_language.html" title="First language">first language</a>?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue">Scientific estimates speak of over 20% other languages, between 15 and 18% Dutch speaking and the rest French-speaking. However, more importantly, the notion of 'native tongue' is, as all scientists who studied this problem in general, extremely difficult for migrant populations in varying stages of integration.</font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue">Compare that with the 'biased' estimates from political sides: French-speaking nationalists setting the number of French-speakers at up to 90%, Dutch at 10% and all migrants being forcibly assimilated into French-speakers, compared with Flemish nationalists setting the number of Dutch speakers as high as 30% and even more.</font></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How many inhabitants in Flanders do speak Dutch (92%&#160;?), French (5%&#160;? - <i>inter alia</i> in the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipalities_with_facilities.html" title="Municipalities with facilities">municipalities with facilities</a>) or another language (3%&#160;?) as their first language?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue">Again horribly difficult to figure in a scientifically justifiable way. Please do note that the oldest minority language in Flanders is Juddisch (still spoken), followed by ladino (disappeared); other important minority languages (as far as still dominant for private use) are Italian, Polish, Turkish, Amazigh, Arab, Spanish.</font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue">As a second remark, one should insist on a more rigourous wording of the question: 'How many inhabitants in Flanders do speak ...' is completely useless. linguists and socio-linguists distinguish following dimensions:</font>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">1. Languages spoken with parents and/or brothers and sisters;</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue">2. Languages spoken with other relatives and friends;</font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue">3. Languages spoken generally in public life (in casu: in Flanders, 99% of those speaking Polish, italian or Spanish at home use Ducth most of the time in public life);</font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue">...</font></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue">on top of that, scientists also estimate mixed language use, e.g. how many percent of second versus third generation migrants from North-Africa speak their language of origing with their parents versus with their brothers and sisters. Even in these close family circles, the percentages are already significantly different (--&gt; language most commonly used with older people versus with people of similar age or younger).</font></dd>

<li>(<i>Bonus</i>) How many inhabitants do have their father and mother speaking a different language (e.g. a French-speaking father and Dutch-speaking mother or the other way around)?</li>
</ul>
<p>So (after combination) my <i>guess for first language spoken</i> is 54-55% Dutch-speakers, 38-39% French-speakers and 6-7% other (incl. German).</p>

<dd><a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPdehaye_f3af.html" title="User:Pdehaye">Paul Dehaye</a> talking: If I can just make a comment on this discussion, it is on the lack of effort on Rudi's part to answer an essential question. It is very relevant to the history, the present and the future to know what percentage of the population considers themselves French-speaking or Flemish-speaking. Edcolins tried to answer this scientifically, dividing the problem into subproblems and estimating for each. Rudi opposed some valid points and some of bad faith. Before he says it, it is also unclear what it means to 'live in Belgium', etc... His number of 18% Dutch-speaking inhabitants of Brussels is ludicrous. I have lived in Brussels for 20 years. I know how it works. Some areas of Brussels are overly French-speaking some others overly Dutch-speaking. But I don t _think_ it sums up to 18% (if it does, cite a _source_). I suspect there is more Dutch spoken in Brussels by federal workers (who _live_ outside of Brussels, and are only there between 8 and 5 on weekdays) than by locals.
<dl>
<dd>Dear, if yoy really want to contribute to a neutral and scientifically correct Wikipedia, why then insist on using the wrong word for the language spoken by the Flemings? This language is, as recognised in all relevant legal texts and in science, <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>, and nothing else, and certainly not <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish.html" title="Flemish">Flemish</a> (being a global category of ideoms and dialects spoken in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>). --Rudi Dierick 12:23, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You correctly assume that there is more Dutch spoken in Brussels by federal workers than by locals, however, altough many of these live outside Brussels, many other do NOT. --Rudi Dierick 12:23, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Your personal anecdotical evidence is clearly 1. non-scientific, 2. biased by th fact that many Flemings from Brussels oftern speak French against people they don't know yet because of the regular hostile reactions from certain more natinalistic French-speakers. This second phenomen is widely discussed in scientific articles, both on language, as on Brussels. It is also widely resented by many non-Ducth-speakers who claim the eagernessof many Flemings to speak other languages renders it more difficult for them to practice Dutch.--Rudi Dierick 12:23, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to suggest another scientific way of counting: look at the result of the last elections, available <a href="http://www.ulb.ac.be/soco/cevipol/documentation/Belgique/Nationales/2003.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ulb.ac.be/soco/cevipol/documentation/Belgique/Nationales/2003.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If I sum up Dutch-speaking parties against French-speaking parties, I get 62% - 38%. Of course this doesn't account for people voting for the 'other lannguage'. But in any case, the most likely occurence for this is French-speaking people voting for Vlaams Blok (at the time), because it is the main far right party.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This appears, at first sight, a good suggestion, however, reality shows hat this method is not reliable. E.g. in Voeren/Fourons, there have been, untill some years ago, at the same time French-speaking majorities for the municipal elections, and clear Duth-speaking majorities for European elections! Similar differences occur for the different elections in Brussels. --Rudi Dierick 12:23, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Full disclosure: I am French speaking <a href="../../../p/d/e/User%7EPdehaye_f3af.html" title="User:Pdehaye">Paul Dehaye</a> 22:30, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And I am Vlaams, Vlaams is not only a language (recognized or not) it is also a culture and an ethnicity. Any attempts to disgrace this by political arguments is contrary to the purposes of wikipedia. Brussels is a funny region because it is historically Vlaams but many people have spoken french over the years for historical reasons, but they are still Vlaams, only they don't practice their language. Please consider including a bit about the fact that Vlaams is an unrecognized language, because it is. More so, the official Nederlands that is used in Belgium in different in usage than in Holland. The words are different and sentance structure is different. Many phrases may have a different meaning in the end to either populations. Confer US and UK English: Have you got children vs Do you have children.</p>
<p><br />
As for Voeren I think it is funny to note that clientalism influences local politics more so than language. The elected officials ensure they are liked.</p>

<dd>Merriam-Webster's own examples contradict this! It is "a crossroads" (a place where roads meet), singular (= carrefour) -- though of course there can be several such crossroads (places where roads meet), i.e. usually singular, but can be used as a singular or a plural. The other point is that "a crossroad" is something else (= route transversale).

<p>My opinion is, that in the whole article, but for sure under the head "languages spoken in Belgium" Dutch should comes first, not French. Now it says "French, Dutch, German" and it should say "Dutch, French, German". This should also be done for the national moto and in the article of the national anthem.

<p>well french is a langage way more important than dutch in the world</p>
<p>That is an extremely dumb argument. If you don't know the customs of a country, you shouldn't have such an outspoken opinion of it. It just doesn't make you look very intelligent. The order of languages should be "Dutch, French, German".</p>
<p>Besides, what do you mean by "more important"? Spoken more often? More influential? Please, use the correct wording when you are going to annoy people anyway.</p>

<p>"Flemish" is NO language. Apart from a difference in the pronunciation and apart from some variations in vocabulary, there is NO difference between the Dutch spoken in The Netherlands and the Dutch spoken in Flanders; the language spoken by the Flemish people in Belgium is Dutch. (E.g: the official language of Australia is English. Not "Australian English", but plainly "English".) The official languages of Belgium are Dutch, French and German. Not "Flemish", but "Dutch". Everyone who keeps insisting there is a "Flemish language", is making a fool of himself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Flemish (Vlaams) was actually the name the French speaking minority in Belgium used in order to try and loosen the bond between the Dutch speaking population of Belgium and that of Netherlands.

<dd>With regard to the article text, there is little to clear this confusion up for the casual reader. I put in a reference to 'Flemish' in parentheses after 'Dutch', only to have it instantly retracted by a keen-eyed sysop. However, I wasn't suggesting that Flemish is a language, but trying to make it clearer to the reader that, while they may think Flemish is an official language of Belgium, it is in fact the same as Dutch. Suggestion: should be insert a reference explaining the links between Flemish and Dutch? This would acknowledge the wide misconception about the language. At the moment the discussion here smacks of intellectual snobbery, which is not really what Wikipedia is about in my view. <a href="../../../p/p/e/User%7EPperos_d8fc.html" title="User:Pperos">Peeper</a> 12:57, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

How about an additional sentence in parentheses along the lines of " (<i>for more information on official languages in Belgium including the relationship between Dutch and Flemish, see below</i>) after the introductory mention of language?

<p>Put the article about 175 years Belgium back in. I do not see how this is propaganda. This is truly a feast for the Belgians and , finally, an occasion where Walloons, Flemish and other Belgian entities can all be proud of their country together.</p>
<p>"175 years Belgium On the 21st of July 2005 Belgium will have a great feast to remeber 25 years of federalism and 175 years Belgium. ( *Belgium is celebrating the 175th anniversary of its independence and the 25th anniversary of the federal state - in French, Dutch, English, German )</p>
<p>Belgium is celebrating the 175th anniversary of its independence and the 25th anniversary of the federal state. The various entities of this country, i.e. the federal government and the Communities and Regions, are all involved in the organisation of these exceptional celebrations. This festive year, which is dedicated to looking forward to the future, encourages and provides many opportunities for coming together. It's all about exchanging ideas between cultures, between generations, between the political, economic and social worlds, and between citizens."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you a politician? I don't think such sentences belong to an objective article. Of course it is interesting to state that Belgium is celebrating its 175th birthday but this paragraph is definetively too long. Moreover for me sentences like "looking forward to the future" or "exchanging ideas between cultures" belong to sentimental governmental propaganda and are reducing the objectiveness of this very well written article. I had also replaced the word "today" for "however" because the word "today" provides the false impression that today all Belgians are friends and have forgotten about their old quarrels. So I make my changes back again. I suggest you to wait a while before reverting them back again. Maybe someone else will provides his/her advice in this talk page and help us resolve this very small conflict. 131.220.68.177 08:23, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with this. The support for independance among Flemings varies between 20 aqnd 30%. Only recently, in January 2006, one single opinion poll ended up just above 50%. That was probably heavily influenced by a major anti-Flemish declaration by the King (or was it his son?). So, it needs to be seen how those support figures might change over the next years. And anyway, opinion polls are to be trated with great care (as no binding referendums exist in belgium, what a pity). --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 17:30, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think that adding something about politics in Belgium makes the articles worse, you are mistaken.

It doesn't makes this article worse to have a few information about politics. Size is <i>not</i> an argument in this case. If you have a problem with adding other issues like foreign policy than some other people will do it but don't block. An edit war could have been avoided if you had followed the conventions in wikipedia and had discussed it instead of mass reverting my edits. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMale1979_76fc.html" title="User:Male1979">Ben</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMale1979_96ca.html" title="User talk:Male1979">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Male1979_fd02.html" title="Special:Contributions/Male1979">C</a> 06:05, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</sub></dd>

<dd>Well I agree with you on one point. Some discussions of Belgian current politics are missing. Both in Belgium and in Politics of Belgium. Up to now, the focus has been put on generalities (which are in the case of Belgium) complicated enough. But I think one should put in the main Belgium article only short summaries or overviews of information already discussed in more detailed articles (as stands in the frame I added). Moreover I think the info you introduce is strongly not NPOV (from your contribution it seems that only the Flemish parties were for stopping the nuclear plants -- what about <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecolo.html" title="Ecolo">ecolo</a>?). One could/should in this article treat all politics in Belgium on an equal footing. Not only those important to the Green parties are relevant but also those to other parties. If you really want to introduce such a discussion I am really keen on it and support you but that's a huge job. I think the best way to proceed is to improve first the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Belgium_e3fe.html" title="History of Belgium">History of Belgium</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Belgium_c4a1.html" title="Politics of Belgium">Politics of Belgium</a> and then summarize the improvements when they reach a balanced NPOV status into the Belgium article. Both articles are far from being ripe for being featured. Introducing some stub in them is not a problem. As other politics of Belgium which could be listed I see: <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage_in_Belgium_fd96.html" title="Same-sex marriage in Belgium">same-sex marriage in Belgium</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Dutroux_6c38.html" title="Marc Dutroux">Marc Dutroux</a> and the reform of Justice, the polemic of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde_d417.html" title="Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde">Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde</a>, the problem of the Belgian debt and the politics of the eurozone, the foreign politics with respect to the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, the relationship with the United States and the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_disarmament_crisis.html" title="Iraq disarmament crisis">Iraq disarmament crisis</a>, the rise of the <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlaams_Belang_4b54.html" title="Vlaams Belang">Vlaams Belang</a>, the Belgian point of view on the <a href="../../../k/y/o/Kyoto_protocol.html" title="Kyoto protocol">Kyoto protocol</a>, and so on, and so on. If everybody who thinks one of these topics is important would do like you do, the size of the Belgium article would explode very fast and would be all the time risking conflict with respect to the NPOV. I think the Belgium article is close to get featured. If we want to introduce a NPOV discussion of current Belgian politics directly within it (and not first within one subarticle), I have the feeling it will be a never ending story. --131.220.68.177 08:01, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now I see your point. That's something completely different from what you stated before, like size or whatever.

I will introduce it on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Belgium_c4a1.html" title="Politics of Belgium">Politics of Belgium</a> and I ask you to help me on NPOVing it, e.g. ecolo - in the news article I read it said about "the Belgian Green party" but not which. I checked the article on <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecolo.html" title="Ecolo">ecolo</a>, there was next to nothing and in <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groen%21.html" title="Groen!">Groen!</a> it said they were part of the government so I included them... Please add to <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power_phase-out.html" title="Nuclear power phase-out">nuclear power phase-out</a> and later <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Belgium_c4a1.html" title="Politics of Belgium">Politics of Belgium</a>. And later sometime we put it in the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> article as have to be same-sex marriage, Kyoto protocol, etc. All of this is just too interesting to be missing, at least it has to be mentioned.

<dl>
<dd>The country has two main ethnic groups, the Flemings, Dutch speakers living in the northern part and in brussels, and the Walloons and French speakers, mainly in the south and in Brussels.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't agree with this change because, though I understand Belgium is composed of two main ethnic groups (this is also stated in the CIA World Fact Book), I think this issue is for many Belgians still controversial. Some people may be hurt because they don't feel Walloons nor Flemish but simply Belgian or European or citizen of a particular Belgian city or subregion. We should stick to the fact that two main languages are used in Belgium. Saying that those both languages are linked with the appartenance to an ethinc group is a controversial issue and should not appear in this article or at least not directly in the introduction. --131.220.68.177 13:51, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Rudi introducing Belgium by its two major language/cultural groups. But "ethnic" gives an me impression of difference in race. Instead of ethnic, maybe another word could be used.
<dl>
<dd>linguistic groups perhaps? That seems to cover it. Of course, there is an official third linguistic group - the german speaking - but those are a 60.000 person minority group. --<a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a> 15 May 2006, 10:20 (CET)</dd>

<dd>There has been quite some discussion about this. Is the difference between Flemings and their French-speaking belgian neighbours 'only' linguistic' or is it rather ethnic? I recently read a nice history that might clarify a bit: it was about French-speakers who claimed that, when driving in Flanders, they would pretend being French when speaking with Flemings, in order to avoid any animosity. Once, I heard something similar from a Fleming who explained he prefers to suggest he's Ducth. So, even when not denying their mother tongue, attitudes are often much more friendly when Walloons and Flemings pretend their ethnicity is different. In addition, I've also seen very hostile reaction from certain French-speakers here in brussels towards migrants who use Dutch, or who participate in Flemish political parties. For these reasons, I guess the real issue is ethnicity and not language. That, of course, is just my, anecdorical, feeling. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucas_Richards_c6aa.html" title="User:Lucas Richards">Lucas Richards</a> 17:26, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would qualify the difference between the two groups as linguistic rather then etnic. In fact the 'etnical' aspect and of is mainly a political card that politicians like to play. The juxtaposition between the two groups at the base is far smaller than at the top. From the aspects of etnicity germanus posted, I think that only the linguistic difference is a difference felt with a large portion of the society. The cultural difference is in my huble oppinion, as stated above a 'political retoric', and not so great. Unfortunaltly, comming to 'Lucas Richards' point that retoric leads to friction between the two communities, hence that behaviour (although I don't think, or like to believe, it's not that widespread) + we don't expect French ppl to know Dutch, and Dutch ppl to know French. I can also not deny that the two communities are growing apart, politically and mentally. So ironicly, Belgium itself is creating two etnicities, based on the will of the linguistic groups to stand on their own two feet.- Wout <i>semi-unsigned comment by User:84.197.184.249</i></dd>

<p>Belgium is officially a federal state, but not actually in a continuous state of devolution. I will agree that since the beginning of federalisation 25 years ago, many things have devolved to the Flemish/Walloon government, but things are not constantly devolving. Not officially anyways. Devolution is only possible by law, and so far no new laws promoting devolution have been passed. I therefore removed this small passage from the text.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have restored this because politicians are still negotiating many points of the federal system (see <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde_d417.html" title="Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde">Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde</a>) and many are calling for new reforms (the 25% of the Vlaams Blok show how high the pressure is). Moreover this is a short NPOV comment about the country which makes clearly the point about why Belgium politics is so special and maybe interesting. <a href="../../../v/b/_/User%7EVb_8dc7.html" title="User:Vb">Vb</a> 09:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have remove the POV assertion "in a continuous process of devolution" which implicitly implies that devolution is irremediable in the future. This looks like a wishful claim. The article should not try to predict the future. Future devolution in Belgium might be likely but should not be presented as irremediable. Moreover, "continous" would have implied that the process of devolution is "uninterrupted in time, sequence, substance, or extent". Discontinuous would have been more appropriate, but the introduction should be kept factual and neutral IMHO. --<a href="../../../e/d/c/User%7EEdcolins_06ae.html" title="User:Edcolins">Edcolins</a> 15:05, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with all the info added recently by JoJan and others. All of this is correct and important: Status od the Congo, temporary government in 1830, Leopold I, etc... I also personaly agree with the splitting of the paragraph about Belgian current policies in three. But I am affraid people commenting at the FAC page don't like that and will prevent the page to be featured for such reasons. On the one hand I agree with them too. The page must not be lenghty-boring for someone not familiar with Belgium and citing Leopold as first king is a bit sad for all the other important persons which are not cited (the other kings, important Prime Minister, Charles V, Phillip II, Clovis, etc...). Other events are also important (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_Belgium_78f5.html" title="United States of Belgium">United States of Belgium</a>,...) and are not listed in order to keep a short history section and a NPOV. It seems also as a criteria for featured article that there should be no list-like or too short paragraphs. Cutting a pragraph into three is therefore negative from this point of view. Putting all current policies issues seems to help readers which are not interested in this aspect of Belgium. I hope these editors will understand this and make the changes by themself or conter argue. If they won't, I will.

<dd>Because of the historical bias Belgian authorities had in the past against the Dutch language. They considered French better suited as official language in the Belgian Congo (and before that in the Congo Free State) and in Ruanda and Urundi (as these countries were called in those times). On the other hand, the Dutch government used the Dutch language as official language in its colonies, (it is still spoken now in Suriname and Aruba and the Dutch Antilles). <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 18:46, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The current statistics are based on what side of Belgium people live in, but as we all know not everybody speaks the language of their region as their first language. Saying that, it is probably certain there is a majority of Dutch speaker in Belgium. Even if it were 60%, 60/40 ration is not <i>predominant</i>.

<dd>Hmm, that appears a bit 'very cautious'. I have the impression that 99,00% of all French-speaking politicians and journalists very much insist on maintaining all the special double majorities and special alarm bell procedures BECAUSE otherwise the lemish minority would be able to dictate them all 'national' decisions. So, from their point of view, there is not the slightest doubt on the fact that a numeric majority of the belgians are Flemish.

<dd>It's not POV, it's simply the law. The Brussels Capital Region is a metropolitan area (<i>agglomeratie</i>) but not a city. The difference is as big as between the NYC (8 million) and the NY metropolitan, area (22 million). And yet the metropolitan figures are not used to determine the size of a city itself. -- <a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a>, 8 June 2006, 13:25 (CET)</dd>
<dd>Once again, you're mixing things, Brussels Capital Region is not a metropolitan area but an federal entity in Belgium. The metropolitan area englobes things that are not part of the Region. Now in Belgian terms what is a city? Is a city a municipality? Is a city a whole metropolitan area? I guess it's whatever you feel like it is. I insist however that this is not about the largest <i>municipality</i> and therefore the different conceptions of the largest city of Belgium should be indicated. Polaron mentioned the case of Japan which seems like a good idea to me. --<a href="../../../m/o/y/User%7EMoyogo_6e0f.html" title="User:Moyogo">moyogo</a> 12:38, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course, every country is different but there is a separate mayor of London (Ken Livingston) so London is somewhat unified as a city. Whereas the Brussels Capital Region has nineteen separate towns and cities - all separate municipalities with their own government, legal personality and mayor. The Region itself is - for lack of a better alternative - the quivalent of a German lander (as are the other Regions and Communities). As said before the difference lays with Antwerp being unified in one big city during the "Big Fusion" of the seventies whereas for Brussels the political choice was made to keep all the separate entities</dd>
<dd>Brussels indeed is the largest urban area - as said in the footnote AND as used by the government office of statistics as shown above - but with regard to cities (that is a municipality with its own legal personality and possessing city status) Antwerp is the largest, which the above mentioned government office of statistics figures unequivocally say as well -- <a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a> -- 3 July 2006, 20:20

<p>Hi. I've been living in the Brussels municipality of Uccle for several years and it would never occur to me to say I'm from Uccle. Nobody I know here has any kind of identity linked to the commune/gemeente he or she lives it. The 19 communes are, granted, officially separate entities. However, note the following facts: Brussels' main train station, Bruxelles-Midi/Brussel Zuidstation, is in fact in Saint-Gilles. The famous Atomium is in Laken. The European institutions are sprawled over several municipalities. The NATO headquarters is in Evere. The mass transit network takes no account of internal boundaries, which are invisible save a few small rusting signs on buildings. My point is this: nobody gives a damn about administrative subdivisions in Brussels. Similarly, people from Queens or Brooklyn call themselves New Yorkers. From Laken to Watermaal and from Anderlecht to Woluwe, Brussels is just Brussels, the largest city in Belgium. Antwerp is a great city, but still much smaller than Brussels. Alex M. NOV 15, 2006</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better to do it in the way like they did in the UK article? <b>"Largest Most populous conurbation: Brussels"</b>. That is the most correct and it can't be discussed. It also is more correct than how it is right now, even with the footnote. If you ask someone from Belgium what the largest city of his country is, no normal person would say Antwerp. It's Brussels, by far. If you want the largest municipality then you have in fact <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doornik.html" title="Doornik">Doornik</a>. Because, in my opinion, 'largest' indicates the surface, not the population. A bigger population does not immediately mean a bigger city or municipality. The population also depends of the population density. So making it something like 'Largest urban area: Brussels' is never wrong and the most correct. Wikifalcon 14:21, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is a very good suggestion, I changed the article using the term <i>largest metropolitan area</i> thanks to the template feature largest_settlement_type (which however does not allow to drop the word <i>largest</i> for <i>most populous</i>).

<dd>The general saying for the many wars that took place on Belgian ground is the "battlefield of Europe", as used by the belgian Foreign Ministry and others<a href="http://www.diplomatie.be/en/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=49019" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.diplomatie.be/en/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=49019" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Cockpit is an old English word for a place where many battles have been fought.

<dd>Either is okay with me, but not "battlefield" with a link to Nuttall because that's probably a misquote. Btw. the Belgian Foreign Ministry is neither neutral nor English speaking, so that's not proof that "cockpit" would be less good than "battlefield". But it's a very small issue. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 14:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I know, "Cockpit of Europe" is a recognised phrase. A quick Google shows it up as an entry in "Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable", published in 1898. Also a boardgame called "Cockpit of Europe" covering the War of the Austrian succession. Suggests that <a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a>'s idea of including both terms is the right one. Brickie 16:59, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The map for this country has recently been changed to a format which is not standard for Wikipedia. Each and every other country identifies that country alone on a contintental or global map; none of them highlight other members of relevant regional blocs or other states which which that country has political or constitutional links. The EU is no different in this respect unless and until it becomes a formal state and replaces all other states which are presently members; the progress and constitutional status of the EU can be properly debated and identified on the page for that organisation; to include other members of the EU on the infobox map for this country is both non-standard and potentially POV.</p>
<p>Please support me in maitaining Belguim's proper map (in Wikipedia standard) until we here have debated and agreed this issue? Who is for changing the map and who against? The onus is on those who would seek to digress from Wiki standard to show why a non-standard and potentially POV map should be used. Belgium deserves no less!

<dd>The Liuzzo maps have no language at all; the single 'legend' image that serves all maps was created by the same David Liuzzo who mainly works at the German-language Wikipedia. Neither the maps nor the bilingual German &amp; English legend are on the English Wikipedia, they're at the international Wikimedia Commons. The legend had been presented at the WikiProject Countries where the maps were extremely thoroughly discussed, but no-one paid attention to the legend... Someone created a map caption text on nearly all the articles (at least the EU members) and properly linked to the bilingual legend. Meanwhile I rephrased the caption text and simply maintained the link to the legend. The best thing to do is to create a similar legend image and upload it to Commons by a different name, and then we simply change the name underneath the link in the articles. I'm afraid I'm not well equipped for graphical output and it would take me too long a time, but I'll be glad to change the links if one notifies me on my talk page that a better legend is uploaded (don't forget to license it so as to be acceptable). Please refrain from putting a comment about this in every article, it should be solved quickly without controversy for all articles as it requires only one image.

<dd>Actually, that still is the coat of arms of Belgium... although the province of Brabant was indeed split in two in 1994, forming the provinces of Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant, the coat of arms was never adapted to the fact that Belgium now has 10 provinces in stead of nine... thus the pre 10 provinces coat is still the official coat of arms of Belgium. -- <a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a>, 27 March 2007, 14:10.</dd>

<p>English speaking people who want to know the French or German names of a Flemish town or the Dutch name of a Walloon one should simply use a dictionary!</p>
<p>And please note that Dutch, French and German are not official languages in Belgium, as foreigners tend to think, but each is the sole official language in its own state, with only tine Brussels (161 km²) bilingual. So there is no difference with the UK and Italy: Portuguese is not an official language in the UK and French is not an official language in most of Belgium! Antwerp is not called Anvers, and Namur is not called Namen, anymore than Paris is called Parigi and London Londres.</p>
<p>People should stop thinking in terms of "official languages of Belgium" as there is an official language in, say, Spain. The situation is completely different. Derek Christopher Manderfeld</p>

<dd>As far I know, this article is about Belgium and, unless I would have missed some recent changes, French and Dutch are still official languages in Belgium (and German as well, by the way). So, I really don't see why this makes a problem to give both names. There is a big difference with the examples you have provided: Portuguese is not an official language in the United Kingdom not Italian in France. It might well interess a English speaking reader to know how Antwerp is called in French and how Liège is called in Dutch and German (maybe I should add the German translation as well, when there is one available).--<a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob-BE_9c69.html" title="User:Lebob-BE">Lebob-BE</a> 14:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that most articles on Flemish municipalities do state that the French name is not an official name any more (although until very recently they were, and if I recall correctly there's still one municipality in Flanders with a French-speaking majority that ignores the fact that the French translation is no longer official). I don't know about the Walloon Region, but I think that the Dutch names there are still official (meaning there's an official list of translations) although they're probably only used in the municipalities with linguistic facilities, if they're used at all. And the municipalities of the German-speaking Community have two equally-valid names if I'm not mistaken.</dd>
<dd>There is also the fact that members of all three linguistic communities refer to certain municipalities with another name than the official one. For instance, most Francophones will refer to <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leuven.html" title="Leuven">Leuven</a> as <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvain.html" title="Louvain">Louvain</a>, and most Dutch-speaking and German-speaking persons will refer to <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge_%28city%29.html" title="Liège (city)">Liège</a> as, respectively, Luik and Lüttich. I believe that those names should be included as they are used by a large part of the Belgian population and because they're in one of Belgium's official languages.--<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanchelkas_9fc9.html" title="User:Ganchelkas">Ganchelkas</a> 16:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is the English Wikipedia and that therefore all the city names should be written in English only. It happened by the way that English names are closer to the French ones but there are exceptions like <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghent.html" title="Ghent">Ghent</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> for example. 09:53, 28 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../v/b/_/User%7EVb_8dc7.html" title="User:Vb">Vb</a></p>

<p>The great majority of Wikipedia entries on Belgian cities, provinces, rivers etc suffer from two great ills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Redundant information: most irritatingly, some busybodies like to add the French, German, Spanish or even Italian names of Belgian places, just because those names exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is against normal Wikipedia standards. The English Wikipedia entries on London and Paris should not mention the French name for London and the Italian name for Paris. To an Englishman seeking information about the city, this is not relevant. In articles on Belgian places, it can even be downright misinforming: adding the French name for Gent or the Dutch name for Namur could lead people to think that both places are bilingual. Or that German is an official language there.</p>
<p>Only the 19 boroughs of Brussels (and every street, museum or church within them) are bilingual and should therefore always be referred to by both names. Ironically, precisely those places are now always referred to only in French!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypertranslations: that is, translating what cannot and/or should not be translated. In many articles on Flemish cities, for instance, the name 'Grote Markt' is translated as 'central market square' or something similar. It would be very good to add that description, but people will really need the Dutch name 'Grote Markt' to find that precise place in towns like Sint-Niklaas. Sometimes the term "Grand'Place" is used for that Flemish town! Imagine a poor American looking for information on the Grand'Place in Sint-Niklaas, or even Saint-Nicholas.</li>
</ul>
<p>More disturbing is the English translations of Flemish (and Dutch) provinces: Americans have heard of Flanders, but not of Oost-Vlaanderen and Vlaams-Brabant. As a consequence, there is no English name for them, and that is wonderful: no need to change names, no problems of confusion. Alas, contributors to Wikipedia have decided to make up their own translations and force-feed them on the British and Americans: "Flemish Brabant" (though not "Walloon Brabant", amazingly), East Flanders and South Holland!</p>
<p>This only adds up to confusion, as it makes it necessary to explain that East Flanders is located in the western half of Flanders, and South Holland is in the middle of the Netherlands! To use the real names only would avoid such confusion.</p>
<p>Both the redundant information and the hypertranslations were blatantly against Wikipedia standards last time I checked.</p>

<dd>What is also against Wikipedia standards is to change what you have written on a discussion page after an answer had been given to what you had written first. Please answer the point instead. Moreover, this page is over Belgium, not Belgian cities. The last time I checked, Belgium was still a country with 3 official languages. Otherwise, please explain why any law published in the official gazette (Belgisch Staatsblad - Moniteur Belge) need to be published in the 3 languages (although one could discuss for the German language since it doesn't happen much in pratice. If you think that changes need to happen on the Flemish cities, please proceed. And please register as a Wikipedia contributor first. --<a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob-BE_9c69.html" title="User:Lebob-BE">Lebob-BE</a> 10:19, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
