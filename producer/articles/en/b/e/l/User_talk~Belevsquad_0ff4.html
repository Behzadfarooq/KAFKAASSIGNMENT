<p>They also called the World Heavywight Championship the "World Championship" when Rey Mysterio was champion. The point is, that doesn't mean the title's name has changed. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 19:55, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was just using that as an example. Sometimes they change the name when someone wins it and then change it back. If the next person to hold the belt is also called just the "ECW World Champion", then I would agree. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 04:51, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed your talk page post here: <a href="../../../e/c/w/Talk%7EECW_Tag_Team_Championship_6479.html" title="Talk:ECW Tag Team Championship">Talk:ECW Tag Team Championship</a> and decided to reply here about it. I've heard the rumor about the tag titles coming back as well, but I somehow don't think it would work. ECW is only 1 hour a week, and they don't hold regular PPV events either. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 05:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:ECW-New logo 2006.JPG. Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<dd>Scotty and Funaki haven't teamed for quite a bit either. I think both teams should be put in inactive. Why should the roster page be incorrect just because of a few editors not realizing it (or just not wanting to change the article)&#160;?
