	    <p><b>Belief revision</b> is the process of changing beliefs to take into account a new piece of information. The <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formal_logic.html" title="Formal logic">logical</a> formalization of belief revision is researched in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, in <a href="../../../d/a/t/Databases.html" title="Databases">databases</a>, and in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> for the design of <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational_agent.html" title="Rational agent">rational agents</a>.</p>
<p>What makes belief revision non-trivial is that several different ways for performing this operation may be possible. For example, if the current knowledge includes the three facts “<span class="texhtml"><i>A</i></span> is true”, “<span class="texhtml"><i>B</i></span> is true” and “if <span class="texhtml"><i>A</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>B</i></span> are true then <span class="texhtml"><i>C</i></span> is true”, the introduction of the new information “<span class="texhtml"><i>C</i></span> is false” can be done preserving consistency only by removing at least one of the three facts. In this case, there are at least three different ways for performing revision. In general, there may be several different ways for changing knowledge.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Revision and update">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revision and update</span></h2>
<p>Two kinds of changes are usually distinguished:</p>
<dl>
<dt>update&#160;</dt>
<dd>the new information is about the situation at present, while the old beliefs refer to the past; update is the operation of changing the old beliefs to take into account the change;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>revision&#160;</dt>
<dd>both the old beliefs and the new information refer to the same situation; an inconsistency between the new and old information is explained by the possibility of old information being less reliable than the new one; revision is the process of inserting the new information into the set of old beliefs without generating an inconsistency.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The main assumption of belief revision is that of minimal change: the knowledge before and after the change should be as similar as possible. In the case of update, this principle formalizes the assumption of inertia. In the case of revision, this principle enforces as much information as possible to be preserved by the change.</p>
<p><a name="Example" id="Example"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Example">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Example</span></h3>
<p>The following classical example shows that the operations to perform in the two settings of update and revision are not the same. The example is based on two different interpretations of the set of beliefs <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/4/2/64240f0707bf378103542ce845615d4f.png" alt="\{a \vee b\}" /> and the new piece of information <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>update&#160;</dt>
<dd>in this scenario, two satellites, Unit A and Unit B, orbit around Mars; the satellites are programmed to land while transmitting their status to Earth; Earth has received a transmission from one of the satellites, communicating that it is still in orbit; however, due to interference, it is not known which satellite sent the signal; subsequently, Earth receives the communication that Unit A has landed; this scenario can be modeled in the following way; two propositional variables <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i></span> indicate that Unit A and Unit B, respectively, are still in orbit; the initial set of beliefs is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/4/2/64240f0707bf378103542ce845615d4f.png" alt="\{a \vee b\}" /> (either one of the two satellites is still in orbit) and the new piece of information is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/1/f/a1fb17953a3cc31a0b4993d229b3d5ce.png" alt="\neg a" /> (Unit A has landed, and is therefore not in orbit); the only rational result of the update is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/1/f/a1fb17953a3cc31a0b4993d229b3d5ce.png" alt="\neg a" />; since the initial information that one of the two satellites had not landed yet was possibly coming from the Unit A, the position of the Unit B is not known;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>revision&#160;</dt>
<dd>the play “Six Characters in Search of an Author” will be performed in one of the two local theatres; this information can be denoted by <img class='tex' src="../../../math/6/4/2/64240f0707bf378103542ce845615d4f.png" alt="\{a \vee b\}" />, where <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i></span> indicates that the play will be performed at the first or at the second theatre, respectively; a further information that “Jesus Christ Superstar” will be performed at the first theatre indicates that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/1/f/a1fb17953a3cc31a0b4993d229b3d5ce.png" alt="\neg a" /> holds; in this case, the obvious conclusion is that “Six Characters in Search of an Author” will be performed at the second but not the first theatre, which is represented in logic by <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/d/0/ed0392ce500cf1f0844e0b045e1530a0.png" alt="\neg a \wedge b" />.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This example shows that revising the belief <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/0/d/50ddb475ce61684d9dace1f3ed6cc135.png" alt="a \vee b" /> with the new information <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/1/f/a1fb17953a3cc31a0b4993d229b3d5ce.png" alt="\neg a" /> produces two different results <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/1/f/a1fb17953a3cc31a0b4993d229b3d5ce.png" alt="\neg a" /> and <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/d/0/ed0392ce500cf1f0844e0b045e1530a0.png" alt="\neg a \wedge b" /> depending on whether the setting is that of update or revision.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Contraction, expansion, revision, consolidation, and merging">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Contraction, expansion, revision, consolidation, and merging</span></h2>
<p>In the setting in which all beliefs refer to the same situation, a distinction between various operations that can be performed is made:</p>
<dl>
<dt>contraction&#160;</dt>
<dd>removal of a belief;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>expansion&#160;</dt>
<dd>addition of a belief without checking consistency;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>revision&#160;</dt>
<dd>addition of a belief while maintaining consistency;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>consolidation&#160;</dt>
<dd>restoring consistency of a set of beliefs;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>merging&#160;</dt>
<dd>fusion of two or more sets of beliefs while maintaining consistency.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Revision and merging differ in that the first operation is done when the new belief to incorporate is considered more reliable than the old ones; therefore, consistency is maintained by removing some of the old beliefs. Merging is a more general operation, in that the priority among the belief sets may or may not be the same.</p>
<p>Revision can be performed by first incorporating the new fact and then restoring consistency via consolidation. This is actually a form of merging rather than revision, as the new information is not always treated as more reliable than the old knowledge.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: The AGM postulates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The AGM postulates</span></h2>
<p>The AGM postulates (named after the names of their proponents, Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Makinson_8b29.html" title="David Makinson">Makinson</a>) are properties that an operator that performs revision should satisfy in order for being considered rational. The considered setting is that of revision, that is, different pieces of information referring to the same situation. Three operations are considered: expansion (addition of a belief without a consistency check), revision (addition of a belief while maintaining consistency), and contraction (removal of a belief).</p>
<p>The first six postulates are called “the basic AGM posulates”. In the settings considered by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson, the current set of beliefs is represented by a deductively closed set of logical formulae <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> called belief base, the new piece of information is a logical formula <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>, and revision is performed by a binary operator <span class="texhtml">*</span> that takes its operators as the current beliefs and the new information and produces as a result a belief base representing the result of the revision. The <span class="texhtml">+</span> operator denoted expansion: <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> + <i>P</i></span> is the deductive closure of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/9/3/09368759fc158b2633a48b047677a267.png" alt="K \cup \{P\}" />. The AGM postulates for revision are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> is a belief base (i.e., a deductively closed set of formulae);</li>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is in <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span></li>
<li><img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/1/6/c16208ecceda73377ef6eb1662abfff3.png" alt="K*P \subseteq K+P" /></li>
<li>if <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/f/2/0f2e79a69b73d78671a979fda112b655.png" alt="\neg P \not \in K" />, then <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i> = <i>K</i> + <i>P</i></span></li>
<li><span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> is inconsistent only if <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is inconsistent</li>
<li>if <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i></span> are two logically equivalent formulae, then <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i> = <i>K</i> * <i>Q</i></span></li>
<li><img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/b/a/dba3684324cf3a5f9222c8d41d064e67.png" alt="K*(P \wedge Q) \subseteq (K*P)+Q" /></li>
<li>if <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/c/a/1cae8bc437c81f46a10015412e498e04.png" alt="\neg Q \not\in K*P" /> then <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/9/0/c90f55bbd324c64fa42cdc15733d897a.png" alt="(K*P)+Q \subseteq K*(P \wedge Q)" /></li>
</ol>
<p>A revision operator that satisfies all eight postulates is the full meet revision, in which <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> is equal to <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> + <i>P</i></span> if consistent, and to the deductive closure of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> otherwise. While satisfying all AGM postulates, this revision operator has been considered to be too conservative, in that no information from the old knowledge base is maintained if the revising formula is inconsistent with it.</p>
<p><a name="Conditions_equivalent_to_the_AGM_postulates" id="Conditions_equivalent_to_the_AGM_postulates"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Conditions equivalent to the AGM postulates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conditions equivalent to the AGM postulates</span></h2>
<p>The AGM postulates are equivalent to several different conditions on the revision operator; in particular, they are equivalent to the revision operator being definable in terms of structures known as selection functions, epistemic entrenchments, systems of spheres, and preference relations. The latter are <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reflexive_relation.html" title="Reflexive relation">reflexive</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitive_relation.html" title="Transitive relation">transitive</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_relation.html" title="Total relation">total relations</a> over the set of models.</p>
<p>Each revision operator <span class="texhtml">*</span> satisfying the AGM postulates is associated to a set of preference relations <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/2/f/22f4db95b49c7266b3b3eaae9e751c85.png" alt="\leq_K" />, one for each possible belief base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>, such that the models of <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> are exactly the minimal of all models according to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/2/f/22f4db95b49c7266b3b3eaae9e751c85.png" alt="\leq_K" />. The revision operator and its associated family of orderings are related by the fact that <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> is the set of formulae whose set of models contains all the minimal models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> according to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/2/f/22f4db95b49c7266b3b3eaae9e751c85.png" alt="\leq_K" />. This condition is equivalent to the set of models of <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> being exactly the set of the minimal models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> according to the ordering <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/2/f/22f4db95b49c7266b3b3eaae9e751c85.png" alt="\leq_K" />.</p>
<p>A preference ordering <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/2/f/22f4db95b49c7266b3b3eaae9e751c85.png" alt="\leq_K" /> represents an order of unplausibility among all situations, including those that are conceivable but yet currently considered false. The minimal models according to such an ordering are exactly the models of the knowledge base, which are the models that are currently considered the most likely. All other models are greater than these ones, and are indeed considered less plausible. In general, <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i> &lt; <sub><i>K</i></sub><i>J</i></span> indicates that the situation represented by the model <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i></span> is believed to be more plausible than the situation represented by <span class="texhtml"><i>J</i></span>. As a result, revising by a formula having <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>J</i></span> as models should select only <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i></span> to be a model of the revised knowledge base, as this model represent the most likely scenario among those supported by <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>.</p>
<p><a name="Contraction" id="Contraction"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Contraction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Contraction</span></h2>
<p>Contraction is the operation of removing a belief <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> from a knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>; the result of this operation is denoted by <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> − <i>P</i></span>. The operators of revision and contractions are related by the Levi and Harper identities:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/d/d/8ddff807a5f3c26a1261ab2c1a8d70ae.png" alt="K*P=(K-\neg P)+P" /></dd>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/5/7/557e53e7b2e4d5bf0935a5dcdb2a217d.png" alt="K-P=K \cap (K*\neg P)" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Eight postulates have been defined for contraction. Whenever a revision operator satisfies the eight postulates for revision, its corresponding contraction operator satisfies the eight postulates for contraction, and vice versa. If a contraction operator satisfies at least the first six postulates for contraction, translating it into a revision operator and then back into a contraction operator using the two identities above leads to the original contraction operator. The same holds starting from a revision operator.</p>
<p>One of the postulates for contraction has been longly discussed: the recovery postulate:</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> = (<i>K</i> − <i>P</i>) + <i>P</i></span></dd>
</dl>
<p>According to this postulate, the removal of a belief <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> followed by the reintroduction of the same belief in the belief base should lead to the original belief base. There are some examples showing that such behavior is not always reasonable: in particular, the contraction by a general condition such as <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/0/d/50ddb475ce61684d9dace1f3ed6cc135.png" alt="a \vee b" /> leads to the removal of more specific conditions such as <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span> from the belief base; it is then unclear why the reintroduction of <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/0/d/50ddb475ce61684d9dace1f3ed6cc135.png" alt="a \vee b" /> should also lead to the reintroduction of the more specific condition <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span>. For example, if George was previously believed to be have German citizenship, it was also believed to be European. Contracting this latter belief amounts to stop believing that George is European; therefore, that George has German citizenship is also retracted from the belief base. If George is later discovered to have Austrian citizenship, then the fact that he is European is also reintroduced. According to the recovery postulate, however, the belief that he also has German citizenship should also be reintroduced.</p>
<p>The correspondence between revision and contraction induced by the Levi and Harper identities is such that a contraction not satisfying the recovery postulate is translated into a revision satisfying all eight postulates, and that a revision satisfying all eight postulates is translated into a contraction satisfying all eight postulates, including recovery. As a result, if recovery is excluded from consideration, a number of contraction operators are translated into a single revision operator, which can be then translated back into exactly one contraction operator. This operator is the only one of the initial group of contraction operators that satisfies recovery; among this group, it is the operator that preserves as much information as possible.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: The Ramsey test">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Ramsey test</span></h2>
<p>The evaluation of a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterfactual_conditional.html" title="Counterfactual conditional">counterfactual conditional</a> <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> &gt; <i>b</i></span> can be done, according to the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_P._Ramsey_0858.html" title="Frank P. Ramsey">Ramsey</a> test, to the hypothetical addition of <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span> to the set of current beliefs followed by a check for the truth of <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i></span>. If <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> is the set of beliefs currently held, the Ramsey test is formalized by the following correspondence:</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> &gt; <i>b</i></span> if and only if <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/c/9/0c9fbe0b560e300bfd270249927c8681.png" alt="b \in K * a" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If the considered language of the formulae representing beliefs is propositional, the Ramsey test gives a consistent definition for counterfactual conditionals in terms of a belief revision operator. However, if the language of formulae representing beliefs itself includes the counterfactual conditional connective <span class="texhtml">&gt;</span> , the Ramsey test leads to the Gardnefors triviality result: there is no non-trivial revision operator that satisfies both the AGM postulates for revision and the condition of the Ramsey test. This result holds in the assumption that counterfactual formulae like <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> &gt; <i>b</i></span> can be present in belief bases and revising formulae. Several solutions to this problem have been proposed.</p>

<p>Given a fixed knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and a revision operator <span class="texhtml">*</span> , one can define a non-monotonic inference relation using the following definition: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/6/4/a6448114ad322c2ea2acdaf1dc82276a.png" alt="P \vdash Q" /> if and only if <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/9/c/49cd992a017f1bfd5444b50cf707f99e.png" alt="K*P \models Q" />. In other words, a formula <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> entails another formula <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i></span> if the addition of the first formula to the current knowledge base leads to the derivation of <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i></span>. This inference relation is non-monotonic.</p>
<p>The AGM postulates can be translated into a set of postulates for this inference relation. Each of these postulates is entailed by some previously considered set of postulates for non-monotonic inference relations. Vice versa, conditions that have been considered for non-monotonic inference relations can be translated into postulates for a revision operator. All these postulates are entailed by the AGM postulates.</p>

<p>In the AGM framework, a belief set is represented by a deductively closed set of propositional formulae. While such sets are infinite, they can always be finitely representable. However, working with deductively closed sets of formulae leads to the implicit assumption that equivalent belief bases should be considered equal when revising. This is called the <i>principle of irrelevance of syntax</i>.</p>
<p>This principle has been and is currently debated: while <span class="texhtml">{<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>}</span> and <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/3/2/c327117b8c73fce4cff2af26daa9cbf0.png" alt="\{a \wedge b\}" /> are two equivalent sets, revising by <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/1/f/a1fb17953a3cc31a0b4993d229b3d5ce.png" alt="\neg a" /> should produce different results. In the first case, <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i></span> are two separate beliefs; therefore, revising by <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/1/f/a1fb17953a3cc31a0b4993d229b3d5ce.png" alt="\neg a" /> should not produce any effect on <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i></span>, and the result of revision is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/e/4/9e4e0f8ae7bbe649b7cb64c8a78bbff5.png" alt="\{\neg a, b\}" />. In the second case, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/0/8/2087fb4763a6e238d1917e47e2a5aa29.png" alt="a \wedge b" /> is taken a single belief. The fact that <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span> is false contradicts this belief, which should therefore be removed from the belief base. The result of revision is therefore <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/5/d/d5dee72dcf755a5938ab788b7f1ee7a7.png" alt="\{\neg a\}" /> in this case.</p>
<p>The problem of using deductively closed knowledge bases is that no distinction is made between pieces of knowledge that are known by themselves and pieces of knowledge that are merely consequences of them. This distinction is instead done by the <i>foundational</i> approach to belief revision, which is related to <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundationalism.html" title="Foundationalism">foundationalism</a> in philosophy. According to this approach, retracting a non-derived piece of knowledge should lead to retracting all its consequences that are not otherwise supported (by other non-derived pieces of knowledge). This approach can be realized by using knowledge bases that are not deductively closed and assuming that all formulae in the knowledge base represent self-standing beliefs, that is, they are not derived beliefs. In order to distinguish the foundational approach to belief revision to that based on deductively closed knowledge bases, the latter is called the <i>coherentist</i> approach. This name has been chosen because the coherentist approach aims at restoring the coherence (consistency) among <i>all</i> beliefs, both self-standing and derived ones. This approach is related to <a href="../../../c/o/h/Coherentism.html" title="Coherentism">coherentism</a> in philosophy.</p>
<p>Foundationalist revision operators working on non-deductively closed belief bases typically select some subsets of <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> that are consistent with <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>, combined them in some way, and then conjoined them with <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>. The following are two non-deductively closed base revision operators.</p>

<dd>similar to the above, but a priority among formulae can be given, so that formulae with higher priority are less likely to being retracted than formulae with lower priority.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A different realization of the foundational approach to belief revision is based on explicitly declaring the dependences among beliefs. In the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_maintenance_system.html" title="Truth maintenance system">truth maintenance systems</a>, dependence links among beliefs can be specified. In other worlds, one can explicitly declare that a given fact is believed because of one or more other facts; such a dependency is called a <i>justification</i>. Beliefs not having any justifications play the role of non-derived beliefs in the non-deductively closed knowledge base approach.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Model-based revision and update">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Model-based revision and update</span></h2>
<p>A number of proposals for revision and update based on the set of models of the involved formulae were developed independently of the AGM framework. The principle behind this approach is that a knowledge base is equivalent to a set of <i>possible worlds</i>, that is, to a set of scenarios that are considered possible according to that knowledge base. Revision can therefore be performed on the sets of possible worlds rather than on the corresponding knowledge bases.</p>
<p>The revision and update operators based on models are usually identified by the name of their authors: Winslett, Forbus, Satoh, Dalal, Hegner, and Weber. According to the first four of these proposal, the result of revising/updating a formula <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> by another formula <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is characterized by the set of models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> that are the closest to the models of <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>. Different notions of closeness can be defined, leading to the difference among these proposals.</p>

<p>The revision operator defined by Hegner makes <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> not to affect the value of the variables that are mentioned in <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>. What results from this operation is a formula <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i>'</span> that is consistent with <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>, and can therefore be conjoined with it. The revision operator by Weber is similar, but the literals that are removed from <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> are not all literals of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>, but only the literals that are evaluated differently by a pair of closest models of <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> according to the Satoh measure of closeness.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Iterated revision">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Iterated revision</span></h2>
<p>The AGM postulates are equivalent to a preference ordering (an ordering over models) to be associated to every knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>. However, they do not relate the orderings corresponding to two non-equivalent knowledge bases. In particular, the orderings associated to a knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and its revised version <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> can be completely different. This is a problem for performing a second revision, as the ordering associated with <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> is necessary to calculate <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i> * <i>Q</i></span>.</p>
<p>Establishing a relation between the ordering associated with <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span> has been however recognized not to be the right solution to this problem. Indeed, the preference relation should depend on the previous history of revisions, rather than on the resulting knowledge base only. More generally, a preference relation gives more information about the state of mind of an agent than a simple knowledge base. Indeed, two states of mind might represent the same piece of knowledge <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> while at the same time being different in the way a new piece of knowledge would be incorporated. For example, two people might have the same idea as to where to go on holiday, but yet they differ on how they would change this idea if they win a million-dollar lottery. Since the basic condition of the preference ordering is that their minimal models are exactly the models of their associated knowledge base, a knowledge base can be considered implicitly represented by a preference ordering (but not vice versa).</p>
<p>Given that a preference ordering allows deriving its associated knowledge base but also allows performing a single step of revision, studies on iterated revision have been concentrated on how a preference ordering should be changed in response of a revision. While single-step revision is about how a knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> has to be changed into a new knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span>, iterated revision is about how a preference ordering (representing both the current knowledge and how much situations believed to be false are considered possible) should be turned into a new preference relation when <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is learned. A single step of iterated revision produces a new ordering that allows for further revisions.</p>
<p>Two kinds of preference ordering are usually considered: numerical and non-numerical. In the first case, the level of plausibility of a model is representing by a non-negative integer number; the lower the rank, the more plausible the situation corresponding to the model. Non-numerical preference orderings correspond to the preference relations used in the AGM framework: a possibly total ordering over models. The non-numerical preference relation were initially considered unsuitable for iterated revision because of the impossibility of reverting a revision by a number of other revisions, which is instead possible in the numerical case.</p>
<p>Darwiche and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea_Pearl_602a.html" title="Judea Pearl">Pearl</a> formulated the following postulates for iterated revision.</p>

<p>Specific iterated revision operators have been proposed by Spohn, Boutilier, Williams, Lehmann, and others.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Spohn rejected revision&#160;</dt>
<dd>this non-numerical proposal has been first considered by Spohn, who rejected it based on the fact that revisions can change some orderings in such a way the original ordering cannot be restored with a sequence of other revisions; this operator change a preference ordering in view of new information <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> by making all models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> being preferred over all other models; the original preference ordering is maintained when comparing two models that are both models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> or both non-models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>;</dd>

<dt>Natural revision&#160;</dt>
<dd>while revising a preference ordering by a formula <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>, all minimal models (according to the preference ordering) of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> are made more preferred by all other ones; the original ordering of models is preserved when comparing two models that are not minimal models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>; this operator changes the ordering among models minimally while preserving the property that the models of the knowledge base after revising by <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> are the minimal models of <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> according to the preference ordering;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Transmutations&#160;</dt>
<dd>these are two forms of revision, conditionalization and adjustment, which work on numerical preference orderings; revision requires not only a formula but also a number indicating its degree of plausibility; while the preference ordering is still inverted (the lower a model, the most plausible it is) the degree of plausibility of a revising formula is direct (the higher the degree, the most believed the formula is);</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Ranked revision&#160;</dt>
<dd>a ranked model, which is an assignment of non-negative integers to models, has to be specified at the beginning; this rank is similar to a preference ordering, but is not changed by revision; what is changed by a sequence of revisions are a current set of models (representing the current knowledge base) and a number called the rank of the sequence; since this number can only monotonically non-decrease, some sequences of revision lead to situations in which every further revision is performed as a full meet revision.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Merging">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Merging</span></h2>
<p>The assumption implicit in the revision operator is that the new piece of information <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is always to be considered more reliable than the old knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>. This is formalized by the second of the AGM postulates: <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> is always believed after revising <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> with <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>. More generally, one can consider the process of merging several pieces of information (rather than just two) that might or might not have the same reliability. Revision becomes the particular instance of this process when a less reliable piece of information <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> is merged with a more reliable <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>.</p>
<p>While the input to the revision process is a pair of formulae <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>, the input to merging is a <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiset.html" title="Multiset">multiset</a> of formulae <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>, <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i></span>, etc. The use of multisets is necessary as two sources to the merging process might be identical.</p>
<p>When merging a number of knowledge bases with the same degree of plausibility, a distinction is made between arbitration and majority. This distinction depends on the assumption that is made about the information and how it has to be put together.</p>
<dl>
<dt>arbitration&#160;</dt>
<dd>the result of arbitrating two knowledge bases <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i></span> entails <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/2/c/92cba432f55a7f452aae56facffed7ea.png" alt="K \vee T" />; this condition formalizes the assumption of maintaining as much as the old information as possible, as it is equivalent to imposing that every formula entailed by both knowledge bases is also entailed by the result of their arbitration; in a possible world view, the “real” world is assumed one of the worlds considered possible according to at least one of the two knowledge bases;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>majority&#160;</dt>
<dd>the result of merging a knowledge base <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> with other knowledge bases can be forced to entail <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> by adding a sufficient number of other knowledge bases equivalent to <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>; this condition corresponds to a kind of vote-by-majority: a sufficiently large number of knowledge bases can always overcome the “opinion” of any other fixed set of knowledge bases.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above is the original definition of arbitration. According to a newer definition, an arbitration operator is a merging operator that is insensitive to the number of equivalent knowledge bases to merge. This definition makes arbitration the exact opposite of majority.</p>
<p>Postulates for both arbitration and merging have been proposed. An example of an arbitration operator satisfying all postulates is the classical disjunction. An example of a majority operator satisfying all postulates is that selecting all models that have a minimal total Hamming distance to models of the knowledge bases to merge.</p>
<p>A merging operator can be expressed as a family of orderings over models, one for each possible multiset of knowledge bases to merge: the models of the result of merging a multiset of knowledge bases are the minimal models of the ordering associated to the multiset. A merging operator defined in this way satisfies the postulates for merging if and only if the family of orderings meets a given set of conditions. For the old definition of arbitration, the orderings are not on models but on pairs (or, in general, tuples) of models.</p>

<p>Many revision proposals involve orderings over models representing the relative plausibility of the possible alternatives. The problem of merging amounts to combine a set of orderings into a single one expressing the combined plausibility of the alternatives. This is similar with what is done in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_choice_theory.html" title="Social choice theory">social choice theory</a>, which is the study of how the preferences of a group of agents can be combined in a rational way. Belief revision and social choice theory are similar in that they combine a set of orderings into one. They differ on how these orderings are interpreted: preferences in social choice theory; plausibility in belief revision. Another difference is that the alternatives are explicitly enumerated in social choice theory, while they are the propositional models over a given alphabet in belief revision.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belief_revision.html" title="Edit section: Complexity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Complexity</span></h2>
<p>The problem about belief revision that is the most studied from the point of view of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computational_complexity.html" title="Computational complexity">computational complexity</a> is that of query answering in the propositional case. This is the problem of establishing whether a formula follows from the result of a revision, that is, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/9/c/49cd992a017f1bfd5444b50cf707f99e.png" alt="K*P \models Q" />, where <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span>, <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span>, and <span class="texhtml"><i>Q</i></span> are propositional formulae. More generally, query answering is the problem of telling whether a formula is entailed by the result of a belief revision, which could be update, merging, revision, iterated revision, etc. Another problem that has received some attention is that of model checking, that is, checking whether a model satisfies the result of a belief revision. A related question is whether such result can be represented in space polynomial in that of its arguments.</p>
<p>Since a deductively closed knowledge base is infinite, complexity studies on belief revision operators working on deductively closed knowledge bases are done in the assumption that such deductively closed knowledge base are given in the form of an equivalent finite knowledge base.</p>
<p>A distinction is made among belief revision operators and belief revision schemes. While the former are simple mathematical operators mapping a pair of formulae into another formula, the latter depend on further information such as a preference relation. For example, the Dalal revision is an operator because, once two formulae <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> are given, no other information is needed to compute <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i> * <i>P</i></span>. On the other hand, revision based on a preference relation is a revision scheme, because <span class="texhtml"><i>K</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i></span> do not allow determining the result of revision if the family of preference orderings between models is not given. The complexity for revision schemes is determined in the assumption that the extra information needed to compute revision is given in some compact form. For example, a preference relation can be represented by a sequence of formulae whose models are increasingly preferred. Explicitly storing the relation as a set of pairs of models is instead not a compact representation of preference because the space required is exponential in the number of propositional letters.</p>
<p>The complexity of query answering and model checking in the propositional case is in the second level of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polynomial_hierarchy.html" title="Polynomial hierarchy">polynomial hierarchy</a> for most belief revision operators and schemas. Most revision operators suffer from the problem of representational blow up: the result of revising two formulae is not necessarily representable in space polynomial in that of the two original formulae. In other words, revision may exponentially increase the size of the knowledge base.</p>
