<dd>Do you have a source that it's the ARH-70?

I also work with a fellow Army aviator who recently served on the Task Selection Board for the ARH and the official Army documentation he received had ARH-70A as the designation as well. I have, however, looked in vain to find an official DoD or Army Press Release stating the designation. The only official word I can find is <a href="http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/412015-L(addendum).html#_Note_YRH70A" class="external text" title="http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/412015-L(addendum).html#_Note_YRH70A" rel="nofollow">this document</a> which would make us both wrong for the moment, but it does tend more towards it eventually being ARH- or just plain RH-.</dd>

<dd>Gotcha, I found only one link for the ARH-70 but I see google's been refreshing and it's mostly being called the ARH-70A. Is the Arapaho designation semi-official?

It was a humorous anecdote when the aircraft was finally selected that it would be called the ARH-69 Arapaho.

<p><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a>: I removed a paragraph from the article that attempted to contradict the <a href="../../../c/o/t/COTS_3cf1.html" title="COTS">COTS</a> status of the aircraft only by further proving it, as well as trying to reintroduce the history of the OH-58 and OH-6 into the article.</p>
<p>There is way more history involved in the OH-58 and covered in the <a href="../../../o/h/-/OH-58_Kiowa_ee17.html" title="OH-58 Kiowa">OH-58 Kiowa</a> article than can be or should be included in an article on this aircraft. The Army is starting over with a new aircraft. That the 407/427 share rotorhead design with the OH-58D and is essentially taking over the mission (albeit modified with an urban focus) does not directly tie it into the OH-58 history. The MH-6M MELB was a contender and should not "share" space in this article with the ARH. It is a footnote to this aircraft's program, an "also ran", that should be more fully covered in the <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hughes_H-6_075b.html" title="Hughes H-6">Hughes H-6</a> article. -- 10:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course there is a much more involved history, but a 3 sentence summary of the ARH origins is highly pertinent to the entry, and especially the development sub-section. <a href="../../../a/7/5/User%7EA75_2fba.html" title="User:A75">A75</a> 05:25, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The military development of the 206 is irrelevant to the COTS status of the ARH program. It's called sunk costs. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 22:11, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a>: Does the reference to this aircraft in the introduction make any sense? It's like we're stretching to include the RAH-66 and give it credit that it never earned, since it was never produced. "part of the mission that the RAH-66 Comanche would have done." I don't mean to sound derisive, but that part bothers me everytime I read through the article. It's vague, and misleads by suggesting that this aircraft has anything more to do with the RAH-66 than benefitting from that program's cancellation. -- 05:24, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oops on the picture. I've correct it to the original caption, though it may still be wrong. Is a "technology demonstrator" the same thing as an SDD? To me, a technology demonstrator is usually a one-off aircraft testing a new desing principle. I believe the X-32 and X-35 were originally classed as such, hence the X-series designations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the Infobox, I read through much of <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAir_76dc.html" title="WP:Air">WP:Air</a> beforehand, and got the impression it was an accepted practice, if not poilicy. In fact, even today the infobox template has been modified, and there is ongoing discussion on it <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Aircraft_a08f.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Aircraft">here</a>. I thought I was helping conform the pages to <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAir_76dc.html" title="WP:Air">WP:Air</a> policy. If I am wrong, I apologize, at least for not realizing adding them would be contentious. If you have a specific link to a policy or discussion page discouraging its use, please post it, and I will take a look.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There was an older infobox on the <a href="../../../s/h/-/SH-2_Seasprite_cdfe.html" title="SH-2 Seasprite">SH-2 Seasprite</a> page, which contains basic info, and detailed specs. I understood that this was being replaced with the in-text "Specifications" template, and that the smaller basic infobox took the old box's place at the top of the page. A copy of the old SH-2 infox is still on that page, for info transfer to the new specs list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have spent much of the past two weeks adding the "Aircraft Infobox" to a number of articles I have been frequenting. I had assumed that most of them were recent articles, or they were articles on recent aircraft (like the ARH-70). Personally, I like the infoboxes, and feel they bring a "uniform" look to the beginning of the aircraft articles. I won't be adding any new infoboxes for the time being.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I will be seeking a definitive answer from the Project on the issue, and will abide by its consensus.</dd>

<dd>Bill, yeah, sometimes I forget to tag on my signature, thanks! Please don't take my comment personally, as none of my "rancor" is directed to you, just infoboxes.

<dd>It's OK, I didn't take it personally (much&#160;:) ). Thanks for posting this issue on WP:Air. I see you noticed I have a note at the template page. It seems that they may have been working independently, which is understandable given the size of Wiki.

<p><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a>: I assume that we won't get any real figures for ARH specifications until Bell and the Army finishes the test flight program. In the meantime, I've heard a rumor that the passenger area is not actually going to be a part of the production aircraft. If you look at the prototypes, there are no windows on the rear (what would be "passenger") doors. -- 04:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What exactly does "the passenger area is not actually going to be a part of the production aircraft" mean?
<ol>
<li>The helicopter is going to be shorter as it does not have the passenger area. I would think that would defeat the purpose of using a COTS aircraft.</li>
<li>The passeger area will be filled with equipment.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I assume the the OH-58D also has the passenger area filled with equipment, but it's only an assumption as I don't fly one&#160;:). One of the reasons I had heard for Bell using the 407 airframe (as opposed to a shorter 406) was that the Army wanted to be able to use the passenger space for passengers (insertion, etc.) So I guess that part isn't true. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 06:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a>: What I've heard is that they simply aren't going to put seats back there. Again, a rumor. The purpose of that would be to keep commander's from distracting the aircraft from its missions. Yes, the OH-58D has equipment back in its passenger compartment, but the ARH equipment won't take up half as much room as the OH-58D. It could be used for more fuel and more ammo, or at the very worst, the Army could have plans to save the space for optional equipment they might dream up later. -- 15:15, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Latest news articles speculate that there will be a slippage in the timeline for the ARH. Currently, it is scheduled for the end of FY2008 (SEP 2008) to begin fielding to the first unit. Some estimates have it slipping by a month or two and some unsubstantiated opinions (which may yet prove valid) have it slipping by as much as two years. The most recent delay is based on the Army's desire to field a common sensor between UAS and the ARH (not sure if common sensor applies to the AH-64D/UH-60M's MTADS/MPNVS). Bell's subcontractor, FLIR Systems International says it is one month from fixing the last issue for integrating its TASS into the airframe.<a href="http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/NewsAnalysis.aspx?Action=745115149&amp;ID=c1fc5278-5ca0-431b-aa26-cde7a0bf67cf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/NewsAnalysis.aspx?Action=745115149&amp;ID=c1fc5278-5ca0-431b-aa26-cde7a0bf67cf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Still, comments seem to be positive from the pilots flying the prototypes.

<p>On March 22, 2007 the Army issued a stop work order and gave Bell Textron 30 days to come up with a plan to get the program back on track. The current timeline has moved from Sep 2008 to Dec 2009 for delivery. Bell has stated that they cannot produce the helicopters at the cost they previously provided in their bid. Textron states that they will lose between $2 million and $4 million per airframe at the current contract price.

You may feel free to address an issue however you wish in your own comments but you will not attribute a comment to me that I did not make or attempt to put words in my mouth. Thank you. In the future, please refrain from editing my comments as well. You mentioned a deadlink and I fixed the deadlink but did not edit the text of the comment. If you were concerned about how you appeared through your comment, <i>YOU</i> should simply add a comment that you realized that the link was now fixed, which would be apparent with my edit summary. And now, I leave you once again with the deadlink, and worrying about how others will or won't misunderstand your comment.
