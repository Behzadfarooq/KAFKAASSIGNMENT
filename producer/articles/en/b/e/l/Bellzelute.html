	    <p>The <b>Bellzelute</b> is a fictional robot in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Robot_Wars_af61.html" title="Super Robot Wars">Super Robot Wars</a> series. It has appeared as a playable unit in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Robot_Wars_Judgement_2723.html" title="Super Robot Wars Judgement">Super Robot Wars Judgement</a> only.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellzelute.html" title="Edit section: Appearance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Appearance</span></h2>
<p>The Bellzelute is a slender, frail-looking unit and is built for speed and mobility. It is blue and white, with gold highlights. Its concept faintly echoes that of the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weiss_Ritter_a14d.html" title="Weiss Ritter">Weiss Ritter</a>, another mobile flight-type humanoid weapon, built around a multi-mode gun.</p>
<p>The Bellzelute is piloted by either Touya Shun or Calvina Coulange, the two original pilots in the game. They are assisted by Festenia Muse, Katia Grineal and Melua Melna Meia, though only one of them can accompany the pilot in battle. The main pilot handles attacking and combat, while the subpilot handles the rest of the functions.</p>

<p>In an attempt to infiltrate human society and begin planting the seeds for their eventual domination, the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Fury_%28Super_Robot_Wars%29_3597.html" title="Fury (Super Robot Wars)">Fury</a> sent several of their knights undercover with the intention of working alongside the humans and learn about their technology. Two of these knights were Al-Van Lunks and his subordinate, Jua-Mu Dalby. During that time, they began working on Ashalley Kreutzer's project of mobile weapon development. The data they collected would be later used in creating their prototype mobile weapons. Later, Al-Van led the attack to destroy the facility, with the intention of annihilating all traces of the project for the Fury. However, one staff managed to survive: Calvina Coulange.</p>
<p>Franz Zeppelin was a human who was involved in the Bellzelute's contruction (as well as the <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorlent.html" title="Vorlent">Vorlent</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granteed.html" title="Granteed">Granteed</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coustwell.html" title="Coustwell">Coustwell</a>, depending on which machine the player chooses to use in the beginning of the game). He was a good friend of Touya Shun's father. At some point, he and El-Seruda, Touya's father, decided to betray the Fury and provide some hope to the Earth by helping Festenia, Katia and Melua escape from their confinement. Knowing his life wouldn't last long, he programmed a disk with his artificial intelligence, so the pilot of whichever machine was chosen, could ask about his purpose.</p>
<p>The three subpilots managed to escape. However due to their poor piloting abilities, they could not escape far enough without being caught. In the end, they crashed near the protagonist's whereabouts (in Touya's route, they would crash land in his school during one of <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Hell_b393.html" title="Dr. Hell">Dr. Hell's</a> attacks; in Calvina's route, they would appear while the <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadesico.html" title="Nadesico">Nadesico</a> is engaged in combat). During the commotion, the Bellzelute reacts to the protagonists. Touya or Calvina are forced by the circumstances to pilot the mech, and turn out to be particularly adept at it. Later, they become the lone pilots allowed to utilize the machine.</p>
<p>The Bellzelute would serve as the protagonists' personal mech for first half of the game. Its ranged weapons, speed and maneuverability dictates hit and run sniping tactics, as it does not have much armor to fall back on in case of a hit. However, during the fight to protect <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factions_of_the_Cosmic_Era_5003.html#Orb_Union" title="Factions of the Cosmic Era">Orb</a>, it would become heavily damaged in a battle with Al-Van's <a href="../../../l/a/f/Laftkranz.html" title="Laftkranz">Laftkranz</a>. The Bellzelute would later be upgraded into the Bellzelute Brigandy, sporting a transformable exoskeleton/heavy weapon add-on.</p>
<p>The Bellzelute is designed for mid-range to long-range combat. Its extended range and high agility means that it can fire at its targets, dodge the return fire, and dash away to another advantageous position. It is flight capable, both in space and in an atmosphere. It carries three main weapons for use in different systems. Of the three starting original mecha, it is the fastest, but most fragile ranged combat unit, and it is the only one among them with a MAP weapon, a weapon capable of striking multiple non-adjacent enemies.</p>
<p>There are two pieces of special equipment present in the machine. The first is the Larseilam Canceller, a device which negates the Fury's ability to stop time, their favorite tactic when engaging enemies and leaving no evidence of survivors. The second is a Cytron Control system, which allows a subpilot to interface with the machine and enhance its performance in various ways, depending on the subpilot. While the Bellzelute doesn't possess the Orgone Cloud ability, the Bellzelute Brigandy does. The Orgone Cloud acts as a barrier that can negate damage at times, allowing the machine to do a short time-space jump, effectively evading any attack thrown at it, no matter how accurate the attack is, and ignore terrain and enemy unit formations when moving.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellzelute.html" title="Edit section: Specifications">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Specifications</span></h2>
<p><b>Bellzelute</b></p>
<p><b>Height</b>: 21 meters</p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: 30 tons</p>
<p><b>Weapon Systems</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missile Launcher<br />
<i>The Bellzelute fires a barrage of homing missiles from its leg compartments. Commonly used when there is a need to conserve ammunition, or when energy attacks are ineffective.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Short Launcher<br />
<i>The Bellzelute launches a pair of Orgone-powered blasters stored at its hip into the air, firing two shots with one blaster, then catching the other blaster and firing a finishing shot.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Orgone Rifle N<br />
<i>The Bellzelute brings out its main gun and shoots three railgun slugs from it.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Orgone Rifle B<br />
<i>The Bellzelute brings out its main gun and fires two beams of Orgone energy at the target.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Orgone Rifle A<br />
<i>The Bellzelute suspends itself in mid-flight, and brings out its Orgone Rifle. The two Short Launchers eject and attach themselves to the Orgone Rifle, together transforming into a weapon resembling a giant crossbow. The Bellzelute pulls a lever on the new weapon, opens its vents, and begins to gather Orgone energy at the tip of the weapon, solidifying it into a giant arrow which it shoots at the target. This also serves as the Bellzelute's MAP weapon, as the solid Orgone arrow is large enough to impale multiple targets clustered together in a line.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bellzelute Brigandy</b></p>
<p><b>Height</b>: Unknown</p>
<p><b>Weight</b>: Unknown</p>
<p><b>Weapon Systems</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orgone Ragna Rifle N<br />
<i>The Bellzelute Brigandy brings out its left arm, now directly equipped with the new Orgone Ragna Rifle from the exoskeleton, and fires two solidified Orgone rounds at the enemy. The Bellzelute Brigandy then flies towards its target and delivers a final shot at point blank range.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Orgone Ragna Rifle B<br />
<i>The Bellzelute Brigandy brings out its right arm, now directly equipped with the new Orgone Ragna Rifle from the exoskeleton, and fires two beams of Orgone energy at the enemy.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Homing Lasers<br />
<i>The Bellzelute Brigandy suspends itself in mid-flight, opening four compartments from its exoskeleton, and fires a barrage of Orgone-based lasers that directly hones in on its enemy. This also serves as the Bellzelute Brigandy's MAP weapon, as the lasers can lock on to multiple targets in a pre-determined area.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Orgone Buster Cannon<br />
<i>There are three different attacks of the Orgone Buster Cannon, depending on the preferred subpilot for most of the game:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>If Festenia is the preferred pilot, the Bellzelute Brigandy ejects itself from the exoskeleton, and directly connects to it, transforming the exoskeleton into the Orgone Buster Cannon. After extracting Orgone energy from its surroundings, the Bellzelute Brigandy fires an immense wave of Orgone energy from the cannon to the enemy, encasing it in a solidified Orgone prison, preventing escape. At the tip of the cannon, Orgone energy is gathered to form a giant arrow. The arrow is let loose and pierces the prison, shattering it and the enemy inside, resulting in a devastating explosion.</i></li>
<li><i>If Katia is the preferred pilot, the Bellzelute Brigandy ejects itself from the exoskeleton, and directly connects to it, transforming the exoskeleton into the Orgone Buster Cannon. After extracting Orgone energy from its surroundings, the Bellzelute Brigandy fires an immense wave of Orgone energy from the cannon to the enemy, encasing it in a solidified Orgone prison, preventing escape. Four funnel-like satellites break off from the cannon, and fires railgun shots at the prison, while at the tip of the cannon, Orgone energy is gathered to form a giant spearhead. The Bellzelute Brigandy now charges at high speed, striking the prison and enemy inside. As the Bellzelute Brigandy flies off from the attack, the prison explodes.</i></li>
<li><i>If Melua is the preferred pilot, the Bellzelute Brigandy ejects itself from the exoskeleton, and directly connects to it, transforming the exoskeleton into the Orgone Buster Cannon. After extracting Orgone energy from its surroundings, the Bellzelute Brigandy fires a barrage of homing missiles from its leg compartments, a set of homing lasers from the Orgone Buster cannon, and finally a deadly stream of Orgone energy from the cannon at the enemy. The missiles and lasers stuns the target, while the Orgone energy encases it in a solidified Orgone prison, preventing escape. Using the Orgone Ragna Rifle from the exoskeleton, the Bellzelute Brigandy fires a single round of the rifle's N and B mode, ending in a cataclysmic explosion.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
