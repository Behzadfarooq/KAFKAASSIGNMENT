<li><b>Comment</b> - believer's baptism is used more often than believers and believers' combined according to a quick google search. The term, however presented, is somewhat informal; maybe credobaptism as a title might be better. With the singular posessive, I take it to mean that it is the baptism of a believer; hence it is their baptism. I think either could work - but with no apostrophe it means nothing at all. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 13:14, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"i feel that belivers baptism is someones choice " people should not be pushed into anything they dont wanna do! anyone agree?!?!?!?</p>
<hr />
<p>In response to Wesley's concern of "resurrected by God". Was it not the Niacine Creed that determined the nature of God (The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are ONE BEING), mans own interpretation? If we were to use logic, our own interpretation, God and Jesus, the Father and the Son, are two separate beings. To read it any other way is simply relying on the interpretation of Man. James 1:37 says: "If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God". Certainly if we really wanted to know the nature of God, we could ask him through prayer, and find out for ourselves. --Eric</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you suggesting that the bishops at the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Nicene_Council_db4f.html" title="First Nicene Council">First Nicene Council</a> didn't pray and ask God? Or that if I were to pray and ask God, and receive a different answer, that that would somehow NOT be my interpretation? The doctrine of the Trinity is not only consistent with what Jesus Christ and the first apostles taught, it is what countless Christians have also confirmed by their experience in prayer, both corporately and separately. To depart from this tradition would be to elevate myself higher than the apostles and saints and presume that God had spoken more clearly to me, and that all the church for the last 2000 years has been in error. That somehow seems a bit arrogant. Also, individuals running around, praying individually and arriving at their own interpretations has led to tremendous fragmentation in the church, to the tune of tens of thousands of protestant denominations all claiming to be guided by the Holy Spirit. But now I've strayed rather far from the topic of improving the Believers Baptism article. Sorry Larry! --<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></dd>

<p>I think there is some confusion this page between Age of Accountability and age of consent. Many children have reached the age where they realize the serious nature of christian belief, and thus are accountable for their actions, but are still a part of their family. Age of consent usually is associated with matters other than baptism, but when consent is a part of baptism, it is very common that the consent of the parents is required for baptism as well as the desire and understanding of the child.</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree with Ben, this point is definitely confused in this article. The article for <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> seems to have it right. Could we just copy the relevant paragraph over here?</p>
<hr />
<p>i agree with the both of you. jesus and god are two separte things. however the christian faith believe that the holy tinity are all one thing user nay</p>
<hr />
<p>This is tangential to the point of the article, but when you say that Jesus was "resurrected by God", you're implying that Jesus was not himself God, but was as much in need of being resurrected as was Lazarus, for example. Is that what you really mean to say? --<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></p>
<hr />
<p>That may be your interpretation of the phrase, but the implication is only there in your understanding. The phrase 'resurrected by God' is a rephrasing of a direct quote from the Bible:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Acts 4:10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God <b>raised from the dead</b>, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</dd>
<dd>1Cor 6:14 And God hath both <b>raised up the Lord</b>, and will also raise up us by his own power.</dd>
<dd>Gal 1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who <b>raised him from the dead</b>;)</dd>
<dd>1Pet 1:21 Who by him do believe in God, that <b>raised him up from the dead</b>, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, that does look like a direct rephrasing. It just struck me funny in the other context somehow. --<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a></dd>

<p>I have changed "and many Protestant churches baptize infant children of believers" to "and a number of Protestant churches baptize infant children of believers" When we look at the Protestants, we find that quite a big number of them practice Believers Baptism. The rise of Pentecostal churches within the last decades has changed the statistics. By now the majority of Protestants were baptized as believers. This might not be the case in Europe, but especially in the developing countries. Stating that "many" Protestant churces practise infant baptism suggests that those who practise Believers baptism are a minority. That would be a very Europe-centered view, and suggests something that is no longer the case. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeikoEvermann_f3ea.html" title="User:HeikoEvermann">Heiko Evermann</a> 21:16, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Believer's Baptism can only be administered to someone over the age of accountability or reason, which is usually 8-12, depending on the individual church, and sometimes on the individual themselves.</i></p>
<p>Is it true that there are actually churches which set a specific age for this? In my experience almost everyone would say that depends on the individual. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 20:04, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I am aware setting an age is not so common as to be held by any entire denomination. If someone can name a specific group that holds this... otherwise, it is probably too specific in its application to really belong in this article. An article on the concept of <b>age of accountability</b> might be another matter. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a>, 2006 Sep 02</dd>

<p><i>Some also hold that individuals are not held eternally accountable by God for their sins until they reach a state of moral and rational accountability.</i></p>
<p>I altered the wording to <i>some</i>. Formerly it seemed to imply all, which is plainly wrong. At least three fellowships of the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwarzenau_Brethren_38fd.html" title="Schwarzenau Brethren">Schwarzenau Brethren</a>, if not all of them, do not hold this doctrine (although a few individual Pastors within the fellowships might teach it), and I have my doubts about its universality among other Anabaptist groups.</p>
<p>I also marked the statement as needing a citation, not because I think a citation is needed to the effect that such a doctrine exists at all, but because I think the association between the doctrine of Age of Accountability and that of Believer's Baptism needs to be more firmly established if the statement is to remain in this article. A statement as to which particular groups hold both doctrines would be a good start toward that. I have always thought of Age of Accountability as largely a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> doctrine and Believer's Baptism as primarily an <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> one (although a handful of Protestant groups have adopted it, notably the <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptists</a>), so if there is a connection between the two doctrines it ought to be better documented. Otherwise the sentence about age of accountability does not belong in this article. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonadab_d568.html" title="User:Jonadab">Jonadab</a>, 2006 Sep 02</p>

<p>The article contains the sentence "Yet all three modes have Scriptural support." I fail to see how that is not POV. Some churches believe the Scripture teaches only immersion; other churches believe the Scripture teaches the possibility of using any of these methods. In this sentence the article takes a side in the debate, which is not appropriate. Moreover, it directly contradicts or minimizes the previous sentence which talks about those churches that "prefer" immersion. In fact, the very word "prefer" in that sentence is a misrepresentation, since to those who believe only in immersion, it is not at all a matter of "preference."</p>
<p>Finally, the sentence says "all three modes," but there has clearly been some editing, because there are only two modes mentioned up to that point. <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> 04:27, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed, that would be an interesting argument to see. I was under the impression that most groups practicing non-immersion simply considered the distinction unimportant, arguing that it is the act that matters and not the details of the method; I was not aware that anyone (especially anyone who disagrees with infant christening and holds to baptism only of believers) actually argued that <i>βαπτιζω</i> refers to a method other than dipping.

<p>I would like to see some more in depth discussion in this area of theological objections. It seems to me to be very slanted to the objectors and no scriptural support is given to the objections.</p>
<p>The first objection seems to be contradictory to the necessity of baptism at all and is somewhat fatalistic. Knowing that this must be someone's objection, I think it should be stated perhaps more intellectually. It also presupposes that baptism is essential for salvation which is not a prevalent view in the baptist and anabaptist community. The same things hold true for the second objection. This also shows a presupposition that baptism is essential for salvation.</p>
<p>The third objection needs clarification. In the New Testament there are many evidences of family members who were not saved while others were. Timothy is a good example in that his mother was "saved" yet there is no mention of his father having the same relationship with God through Christ. James, the "half-brother" of Jesus is another example. I would like some clarification on how this third position treats those "baptised" family members who turn away from their faith and then potentially turn back.</p>
<p>The fourth Objection is very problematic since the act of baptism is looked at through the prism of a work and not a response to God's grace. I would contend that the majority of those who practice believer's baptism do not view it as a work, but rather as an act of obedience. I guess my problem is in the term "usually".

<dd>I think all these points could be easily balanced by addressing the adherents' reasoning in the main body, which were pretty thinly represented here. I've tried to do that by adding some theological reasoning that goes beyond the mere mechanics. Others please help. 128.158.14.42, 04 Aug 2006</dd>

<p>Shouldn't the title of this artice be Believer's Baptism? --<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazon10x_f33a.html" title="User:Amazon10x">Amazon10x</a> 19:14, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states: "Believer's baptism is more prevalent in Christian traditions which maintain that there is a state of innocency from birth to the age of accountability (if the believer, due to mental or emotional disability, is not likely to gain the ability to judge the morality of his or her actions, this state of innocency persists for life). Credobaptism is less prevalent in traditions which maintain that the corruption of original sin is present at birth and is sufficient guilt in the eyes of God to cause the child to be damned, should it die before baptism." This statement assumes that a belief in "original sin" means a belief that an unbaptised person is damned, and that baptism is considered necessary for salvation - but while some on each side believe this, some certainly don't. Many people (myself included) who believe in believers' baptism (not as a necessity for salvation) also believe in original sin. In fact, as far as I was aware, most do. Of course, this creates problems. If everyone is born a sinner, but can only be saved by believing in Jesus, what about those who are too young to do so? Many would say, "we don't know, but God will do what is right," with the assumption that sending babies to hell would not come under the heading of "right"! Anyway, don't catholics, who certainly believe in baptism for salvation, believe that unbaptised babies go to limbo, instead of being "damned"? Not sure how to edit this, but I have added in limbo.

<p>I would suggest adding the following verse:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"... Baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ." --I Peter 3:21.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, I fixed a few punctuation errors, incuding a missing parentheses ")" at the end on " (See Independent Christian Churches."</p>

<p>As I understand it, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_ff27.html#Ordinances" title="Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">LDS</a> also believe in baptism only after age of accountability. (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> - I am not myself an LDS but I have family who converted.) Should they be included here, or alternatively, if they don't fall under the category, should some explanation be given? I have no stake in the matter, just raising the question. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecampbell_a2f7.html" title="User:Davecampbell">Davecampbell</a> 19:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did anyone else not have a clue what this guy is talking about?</p>
<p>"One standard theological argument leveled against believer's baptism is that it makes the efficacy of the sacrament dependent upon the understanding of the baptisand; that is, it depends upon what the baptisand knows. This runs counter to the Calvinistic belief that God saves whomever he wills, regardless of any worthiness or knowledge on the part of the saved. It also runs contrary to the concept of free will and the notion of choice."</p>
<p>Sounds messed up to me. Totally wrong.</p>
<p>In my experience, the one to be baptized in a believer's baptism because he then knows Christ. Doing so does not actually save him; it merely goes in accordance with the scripture somewhere in the bible that says go and be baptized, once you are saved. It symbolizes your relation with Christ. During the time period that the Romans ruled Judea, being baptized was merely showing your strong commitment to anything, Jesus used it to symbolize a strong commitment to him.</p>
<p>And for the last sentence I quoted: God DOES save whoever he wants, which is everyone, but only if they accept him.</p>
<p>Just my little kick at it.</p>
