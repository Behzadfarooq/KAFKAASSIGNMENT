<dd>This was in fact added a little while ago and I've removed pending further discussion. If you look more closely at the source you might gather that it's not accurate to say the star was "named after" Emmett; she "sponsored" it as part of the Mt Stromlo and Siding Springs Adopt-a-Star programme, presumably by making a donation to the facilities. Hundreds of people have done the same thing so, while laudable, it's not a particularly notable event. Not the same as a crater on the Moon being officially named after Arthur C. Clarke or a snake being named after Monty Python (think I've got those two right) for instance. I don't think it's worth including, myself, at least not until her article gets a lot bigger and such minor details might be thrown in without overbalancing it.

<dd>I think it's Rove McManus, who "On Valentine's Day 2000 bought naming rights to a star, formerly known as HR-3821. And now one of the brightest stars in the night sky is called Belinda.

<dd>Thanks for that, mate. That gives it some context, which was missing before. If somebody wants to add a line under the 'Marriage' section to the effect that McManus sponsored a star through this programme to put Emmett's name on it as a Valentine's Day gift, citing your news item and the ANU page, then I have no particular objection. That'd give it its proper place, as part of their romance. Cheers, <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rose_c71d.html" title="User:Ian Rose">Ian Rose</a> 07:43, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although you can "buy" a star, it's not recognised by any astronomical society and multiple people can purchase the same star through different agencies. It may be a romantic gesture but there's no official recognition. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysie_e9e1.html" title="User:Naysie">Naysie</a> 06:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Belinda Emmett had breast cancer, which spread to her bone. The breast cancer was never cured. She never had bone cancer. She had breast cancer that spread to her bones.

<dd>We need to base it on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources. We can't just write anything and then say "trust me - it's correct". The best we have so far says she was successfull treated for breast cancer about 6 years ago, then 2001 she was diagnosed with "secondary breast cancer". Does this not suggest that it is cancer resulting from the earlier? There is not one source (so far) that we have seen that says she actually died from breast cancer. If there are conflicting sources then it is OK to point out that sources conflict. Wikipedia can only report on the hard facts as we know them - the facts are not that she died from breast or bone cancer - the facts are that source&#160;??? reported she died from breast cancer.</dd>
<dd>I don't know on what basis you are saying she died from breast cancer, you need to provide a source. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 02:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not about to hunt through media sources to find a journalist who got it right. The question of whether she died from breast or bone cancer is a medical one, and not one that the media will get correct. Her breast cancer was never cured. Current medical style is to say that cancer is 'in remission' rather than 'cured' for precisely this reason. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 02:43, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, feel free to edit in changes if they are verifiable and reasonable and if you feel it adds value. And as I said, for me the word "secondary" implied at least a link to the first illness in 98). My only concern was that we should always be wary of "trust me i've heard/read/know it", etc. Cheers and happy editing. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 02:46, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You dont normally die from breast cancer. Rather, its the movement of the original cancererous cells to other vital organs, in this case the bone marrow (which produce immune and respiratory cells, that are essential for life) The destruction of this tissue would have led to her death. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 202.173.198.208 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.173.198.208_9789.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.173.198.208">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>Why do we need four quotes from politicians in the <i>Death</i> section? Wouldn't one be enough?

<dd><a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> says it all. However, to cite both Howard and Beazley or to just cite Howard would be acceptable. The reason for this is that Howard is the Prime Minister and he (in the general sense) is deemed to be the person running the country (and Beazley is certainly not, and will likely, never run the country). Personally, I'd either include Howard's or both. I wouldn't remove both, but if you must remove any for the sake of space (though this isn't a very long article, so removing, in my opinion, would be a little silly) I would only suggest removing Beazley's comments.</dd>
<dd>All of that said, each person has brought different things to the table, and I think both should stay as both represents different (and both completely valid) points to be mentioned on the page.</dd>
