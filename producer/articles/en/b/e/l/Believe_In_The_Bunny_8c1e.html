<p>Mr. Whiskers is prancing around in the Amazon when he is hit by a sudden bolt of lightning. However, when Mr. Whiskers gets up after the incident, he discovers that his right foot is tapping uncontrollably and he bursts out in a wacky dance of sorts. He immediately rushes home in order to show Brandy what is going on, in which he interrupts Brandy who is trying to tell Cheryl and Meryl a story about what happened earlier that day. Mr. Whiskers shows Brandy what he can do and he expresses the fact that it means Easter is near, though Brandy mentions that they don’t have a calendar so it’s impossible to know what day it is. Mr. Whiskers then expresses that all rabbits naturally know when Easter is coming, in which Mr. Whiskers pulls down a sheet and a film begins to play that shows two trains crashing into one another. After he fixes his mistake, the film shows how an ancient alien bunny once lived on another planet, though after meeting a female bunny and having the bunny population multiply in number, the ancient alien bunny took all the rabbits to earth and that is where they have lived ever since. However, Mr. Whiskers proclaims that every Easter the ancient alien bunny returns to earth in order to hide some Easter eggs, though Brandy doesn’t believe his story as she believes Easter had a different meaning and purpose. Mr. Whiskers doesn’t care much for Brandy’s claims and he runs off to spread the word of the Easter Bunny. However, when he runs past Gaspar and Cousin Slim, Gaspar’s cousin from Texas, they decide to try to hunt down and eat a rabbit, as Slim likes to hunt and hunting is the primary reason that he’s decided to visit Gaspar. Later that night, Mr. Whiskers is at the tree house attempting to play a banjo while working on his Easter Bunny song, though Brandy tells him that it’s nighttime and that he needs to go to sleep. However, when Mr. Whiskers keeps making noise, Brandy threatens him and he agrees to remain quite until the Easter Bunny arrives; though when Mr. Whiskers hears something in the middle of the night, he screams that the Easter Bunny has arrived. Brandy wakes up in a terrible mood, in which she angrily tells Mr. Whiskers that the Easter Bunny isn’t real and that the reason nobody has ever seen him is because he isn’t real. Mr. Whiskers refuses to believe Brandy, though he shortly succumbs to her logic and he bursts into tears, which keeps Brandy awake all night. In the morning, Brandy attempts to calm him down by expressing that she now believes in the Easter Bunny, though Mr. Whiskers ignores her and he continues to cry. Lola Boa arrives and tells Brandy that if she doesn’t stop Mr. Whiskers from crying, she’ll squeeze the both of them; as his crying has kept nearly the entire Amazon awake all night. Brandy decides that in order to restore Mr. Whiskers’ faith in the Easter Bunny, he’ll need to think that the Easter Bunny has actually arrived and visited the Amazon, though since that cannot occur, she decides that she’ll dress up as the Easter Bunny and perform the deeds herself. Brandy dresses up in a makeshift rabbit disguise and she starts bouncing around the Amazon hiding eggs, though she enjoys herself as she considers bouncing to be quite entertaining. However, Brandy hops right past Gaspar and Cousin Slim while proclaiming that she is the Easter Bunny, in which Gaspar and Cousin Slim decide to capture and eat her, as they haven’t been able to find a rabbit up until that point. Gaspar and Slim easily capture Brandy, though she tries to express that she isn’t really a rabbit, though Gaspar is set on eating some rabbit and he refuses to believe that she is telling the truth. Brandy decides to leave a trail of eggs in order to let her friends know where she is, though the scene changes to Ed, Cheryl, Meryl and Lola waking Mr. Whiskers up in order to tell him that the Easter Bunny has been hiding eggs. Mr. Whiskers ecstatically jumps up and he begins to search for the eggs, though he drags Brandy’s friends along with him. Eventually, Mr. Whiskers stumbles across the trail of eggs and he begins to follow them, consuming the ones that he picks up, though he eventually discovers that Gaspar and Cousin Slim are slow roasting Brandy over an open fire. Mr. Whiskers asks Brandy what is going on, in which Brandy confesses that she was trying to be the Easter Bunny in order to restore his confidence, though Mr. Whiskers expresses that he’s come to terms with what has happened. However, Gaspar and Cousin Slim refuse to care, as they’ll just eat Brandy even though she isn’t a rabbit, though Lola Boa rushes out and forces Mr. Whiskers to spit out the eggs that he was eating, which causes Gaspar and Cousin Slim to run away. After Mr. Whiskers and the rest of Brandy’s fans rescue Brandy, the two head home where Brandy expresses that she is sorry that she said what she said. The episode ends with Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers returning home, though the two of them discover that their house is full of Easter eggs and candy, in which Mr. Whiskers looks out the window and he witnesses the alien bunny’s spacecraft as it is taking off; though Brandy merely stands there in disbelief over what has just taken place.</p>
