More than 30 men from other high schools of republic, industry and because of a boundary are annually accepted on training in target post-graduate course. In BSUIR there are three councils on protection dissertation both assignment of scientific degrees of the doctor and candidate of sciences works.</p>
<p>The scientific researches at university meet to a structure of preparation of the experts and basic directions scientifically - technical and socially - economic development of republic. At university more than 10 years successfully work a special design bureau with pilot production, in which the newest scientific development are lead up to laboratory breadboard models and skilled samples.</p>
