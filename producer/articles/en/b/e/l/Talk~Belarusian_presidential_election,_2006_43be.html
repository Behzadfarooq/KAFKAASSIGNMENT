	    <p>Oh come on, the CIS observer mission?

<p>Question: Is Pravda.ru a legit source to be using here, as it is? 68.39.174.238 00:34, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, I believe that Pravda is a legitimate newspaper site, since Pravda is a very old newspaper and one of the biggest in Russia. While I do know that the article in question is biased towards Lukashenko, and also states that Belarus "does not need a revolution" that took place in .ua, .ge and .kg, I think it would be good to get the Russian view in. I have not heard much from the American press at all, but the BBC did report that Kazulin was arrested and assulted by Minsk police on 03/01/2006. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a> <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Fair use policy</a></sup></small> 02:04, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Should be believe to newpaper called "Truth"?&#160;:). Well actually I think it is a good source but has to be checked as it has some biases (as every newspaper). As we are able to confront their claims with other newspaper I believe that including their views can only improve the article. --<a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJan.Smolik_bd31.html" title="User:Jan.Smolik">Jan Smolik</a> 11:12, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not "color". It is <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeans.html" title="Jeans">Jeans</a> Revolution (джинсовая революция). In Soviet Union jeans were an item of Western culture; "pants of the most probabale military adversary", as a <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_joke.html" title="Russian joke">Russian joke</a> say. So Jeans Revolution is supposed to mean "anti-Soviet Revoluiton", a hint to the Soviet ways of Bat'ka Luka. By the way, in Russia this definition is snickered upon, because in the most recent Russian slang "джинса" means "bullshiting". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 05:59, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And Mikka, were jeans an "American" item that was usually sold on the Soviet black market? As for my comment on the cornflower revolution, that was what I saw one time when I did some google searching, mostly promoted by the opposition parties or by bloggers. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 06:01, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As for opposition parties, unfortunately they are laughable so far, and not because of dictator Luka killing and arresting them. the reason is much more reasonable: no real economical interests under them.

<dd>This quote is ignorance as well. You yourself wrote an article about Belarussian emblem and in=t is flax. The term "васильковая революция" is indeed in circulation, even in Luka's texts (it will be funny if he will turn out to the creator of the word: "Запад денег на это не жалеет. Они считают, что Беларусь созрела для некой оранжевой или васильковой революции"). But at the moment it would be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> to trace the origin of the term. AFAIK "джинсовая революция" was used first. "cornflower color" is a reference to bright blue denim. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 06:44, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I remember that. BelMonk corrected me and told me that it was cornflower (though, Luka's website on the emblem gave the blue flower as flax, so that is where the error came in). While I do agree it could be original research, we could use this as a starting point if something does happen in Minsk (TB is showing protests in Minsk, but only in passing; including the display of the Pahonia flag). About the Belarusian emblem article, I was wondering if there is anything else that needs to be done to that article or is it ready for FAC, again? <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 06:48, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did Lukashenko write this article himself? The Russian reaction to the OSCE report is mentioned before the report itself! May I remind you that the internet is one of the few connections many Belarusians have with the free world, and that as one of the busiest websites in the world we have a responsibility to give a truthful representation of international events. This is where we can actually make a difference, this is where we can show that free information can actually be a force for good in the world.

<dd>Belarus is already out of the Council of Europe since 1997, so Belarus has more to lose than Mugabe (who cannot join the Council anyways). So, Belarus, IMHO, has nothing to lose at all (and, if these sanctions have been in play for over 10 years and things have not changed, then I guess no amount of sanctions will take Batka down). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 22:06, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This assessment comes from the mainstream media - GU. IMO, political bias is the only reason to remove it since opposite views are already perfectly represented. Also, special section "discussion" can be introduced to take care of different POVs on this issue. <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccuserpens_55cf.html" title="User:Occuserpens">Occuserpens</a> 00:18, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Generic "patriotic" is non-neutral, non-informative and ideologized. But source and author are important! <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccuserpens_55cf.html" title="User:Occuserpens">Occuserpens</a> 03:04, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's so bad about "patriotic"? I guess we can agree that "liberal opposition" is a good, neutral term precisely describing a sector of society. "Patriotic" there was supposed to mean basically the sector of society which is not liberal opposition, and furthermore leans to supporting the state and opposing US/EU interference (in Russia and in its neighbours). Why it's not informative? It surely is more informative than just writing that the author said so and so. Otherwise the reader will wonder "So what? Why is this author from Rian.ru important?". This version explains that it's not just about one author, but this author exemplifies reaction from the patriotic sector of society in Russia.--Poison sf 12:36, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that there has been some disagreement over what to call media in Russia that supports the position of Putin on the Belarusian election. In my opinion, "patriotic" is, if not POV, at least emotionally biased (<a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotism.html" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a> being positive to most people, unlike <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>). "State-controlled" would often be factually inadequate and also poses the question of what "controlled" means. Is the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> state-<i>controlled</i>? I think "pro-government" is a good NPOV term, just like "opposition" and should be used for refering to such media. <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamino_6066.html" title="User:Tamino">Tamino</a> 14:21, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If "pro-government" is more acceptable than "patriotic" then fine. To be fully precise, there're some people who are ambivalent about or even highly critical of Russian government and view Lukashenko positively / dislike West-sponsored "orange revolutions", that's why I've used "patriotic" first. But, if we consider the mainstream, "pro-government" is probably a reasonably precise term to use.--Poison sf 15:16, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
