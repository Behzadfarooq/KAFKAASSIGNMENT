<dd>The name (usually just the last name Hooks / hooks) is capitalized at the start of some paragraphs and not others in the article. A common noun is capitalized at the start of a sentence. It seems to me that when a person has deliberately chosen a lowercase typography, that the lowercase should be used throughout but I have zero style-guide quotations to back me up on that idea. Is there a standard for this? Paulc206 02:10, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the standard is English typography, in which the first word of a sentence, title, or sub-title is always capitalized. E.g.,
<dl>
<dd>Da Vinci (i mean Leonardo da Vinci) is a figure in the back-story of Brown's "Da Vinci Code" novel.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The function of the capital and the period, question mark, or exclamation point, is to clearly demarcate the beginning and ending of every sentence, so that readers effortlessly (and unconsciously, usually) focus on whole sentences, and experience greater comprehension. Whether she chooses to lower-case her name to honor her mother, or to draw undeserved attention to herself, or both, her desire loses to the fundamentals of English (and of every other language i know enough about to have a hint).<br />

<dd><s>Indeed.</s> Contrary to the material i am removing&#160;:
<dl>
<dd>The title of this article is incorrect because of technical limitations. The correct title is bell hooks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>there is nothing wrong with spelling her name with a capital B in a title, or at the start of a sentence: she can flout the convention of each word of a proper name starting with upper case (and when it doesn't have the stunning impact she presumably seeks, TSK) because that is a loose convention with all sorts of exceptions (even if essentially for prepositions and articles, outside <a href="../../../e/2E/e/E.E._Cummings_490d.html" title="E.E. Cummings">E.E. Cummings</a>'s publishers). But she doesn't get to change the rules of English, or the conventions of WP. (Well, she can hack her own copy of MediaWiki, as <a href="../../../d/k/o/DKosopedia_2838.html" title="DKosopedia">dKosopedia</a> <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/dKosopedia:Help" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/dKosopedia:Help" rel="nofollow">did</a>, as long as she can pay for her own server.)<br /></dd>
<dd>However, <s>as Bam suggests</s>, there are plenty of workarounds available that enhance rather than detract from the functions of the article, which include making clear that she wants her name spelled entirely lower-cased. I'm implementing one of them.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have struck thru my confused impressions that Bam agreed w/ me. The doctoring of the <i>title</i> to achieve that inappropriate casing is <i>such</i> a bad idea that i blindly assumed Bam wanted to change the first word of the <i>article</i>, to get lower case B out of the position of first word of a sentence, where it is ugly, distracting, and stupid. On the other hand, i don't mind if Bam thinks i have hijacked their idea of getting the B away from the head.</dd>

<p>Sorry about my change that you reverted, I failed to notice the discussion here. Nonetheless, I disagree with your premise. Just like bell hooks, other entities also choose to "flout the convention of each word of a proper name starting with upper case"—for example, <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id_Software_9f51.html" title="Id Software">id Software</a> and Apple's <a href="../../../i/b/o/IBook_e557.html" title="IBook">iBook</a> and <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>. But we place the <a href="../../../w/r/o/Template%7EWrongtitle_7b78.html" title="Template:Wrongtitle">wrongtitle template</a> on their pages without objection. Why is bell hooks any different? Just because she's a person, while <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id_Software_9f51.html" title="Id Software">id Software</a> and <a href="../../../i/b/o/IBook_e557.html" title="IBook">iBook</a> are corporate trademarks? I think this is precisely the situation for which the wrongtitle template is intended. —<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesura_ad40.html" title="User:Caesura">Caesura</a><a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaesura_b24c.html" title="User talk:Caesura"><sup>(t)</sup></a> 05:49, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>_ _ I find that your understanding of the template is supported at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28technical_restrictions%29_3627.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (technical restrictions)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (technical restrictions)</a>, contrary to my confident expectation.</dd>
<dd>_ _ (As i think i've already adequately argued, also contrary to common sense. I expected that the "technical restrictions" would refer to the issues discussed at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Special_characters#ISO-8859-1_Characters" class="extiw" title="meta:Help:Special_characters">meta:Help:Special characters#ISO-8859-1 Characters</a> as they are in practice applied here, e.g., while there's no reason to pipe <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_hooks.html" title="Bell hooks">bell hooks</a>, <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguy%E1%BB%85n.html" title="Nguyễn">Nguyễn</a> gets coded in WP instead as <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen.html" title="Nguyen">Nguyễn</a> (or for that matter <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen.html" title="Nguyen">Nguyễn</a> which looks different only when you see the wiki markups, with N and n respectively). My interpretation is that <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen.html" title="Nguyen">Nguyen</a> should have the template (and that being a person makes no difference), and that the template is misplaced when used on the two trademarks as well, since the capitalization of titles (while enforced by the technical measures) is not a "technical limitation", but conformity with the English rule that sentences and titles of works begin with caps, no exceptions. If i want to discuss de Sade's madness or iPod features, i begin "De Sade's madness is questionable" or "IPod features are numerous", and title the works <i>De Sade's Madness or de Sade's Gladness?</i> and <i>IPod features for New iPodders</i>: there's nothing "incorrect" abt that, and the fact that the technology enforces it is not the reason that the first cap is there.)</dd>
<dd>_ _ But the intention of the template seems clear, and i was mistaken about it. The fact that i find that intention bone-headed is off-topic on <a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBell_hooks_0adc.html" title="Talk:Bell hooks">this talk</a>, and i expect, after some mulling, to reduce this discussion (via strike-thru?) to roughly this 'graph and a lk to a more appropriate forum where i shall raise this concern. Thanks for your very correct behavior in this. (The summaries above my "see talk" were distracting, and my failure to lk that phrase didn't help any.)</dd>
<dd>_ _ I trust you'll forgive my not "fixing the damage i've done", as i prefer in this case to leave it to a <i>supporter</i> of the policy to implement it. Thanks again.<br />

<li>[[Nguyen]] was the article, instead of (as now) a rdr to it.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>My impression at this point is that the primary objection to having <i>ễ</i> in the title was that it is not a legal character to appear in literal form in a URL (and must be encoded as %E1%BB%85), so the new URL is not legible at a glance (i expect even by experts), and may have some alienating effect for some users. I think the <a href="../../../z/%C3%BC/r/Z%C3%BCrich.html" title="Zürich">Zürich</a> debate may have been the turning point about considering such hazards justified by the ability to use the diacritic.<br />

<p>The illogical thing about people who claim to use lower case to deflect attention from their names is that it has the exact <b>opposite effect of drawing more attention</b> to their name, <b>and they know it</b>, so I find it disingenuous and to be discouraged.

<dd>What if someone who has a Wikipedia article suddenly decides that from now on their name can be written only with pink letters on a blue blackground? Or with letters so big that it doesn't fit on the screen? Or that the letter i should be dotted with little flowers or hearts in their name? Will we respect their preferences too? If we write everyone's name the way they do, will we write Julius Caesar as JVLIVS CÆSAR and Mao Tse-tung as 毛澤東? Tutankhamen with hieroglyphs? If the subject of an article was illiterate, we won't write down their name at all? If <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_%28artist%29.html" title="Prince (artist)">the artist who was formerly knows as the artist who was formerly known as Prince</a> were still using that unpronouncable symbol as his name, what would we do?</dd>
<dd>I think this whole lowercasing is cheap attention-seeking. I already corrected this mess in the article <a href="../../../a/i/k/Aiko_%28singer%29.html" title="Aiko (singer)">Aiko (singer)</a> because it was tiresome to read that aiko this and aiko that; I thought that maybe she is uncomfortable with uppercase because Japanese language doesn't have it or whatever; so it was strange to find the same in the article of an American person. Not to mention that when I was reading the article where she was mentioned, I stopped, wondering what a <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_bell.html" title="Church bell">bell</a> <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing_hook.html" title="Fishing hook">hook</a> is and what has it do with feminism. It is confusing.</dd>
<dd>My 2 cents on the issue. – <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlensha_9238.html" title="User:Alensha">Alensha</a> 22:29, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you've read any scholarly work within the last maybe 15 years (?) you'll note that the third person pronoun of choice has changed genders. <i>One</i> might find this "attention seeking" but <i>she</i> would recognize, every time <i>she</i> came across the pronoun that there is a certain rationale and deliberacy behind it. (Though I haven't read anything about this, I think that the argument is that, since the choice is arbitrary and the rule has long gone to the male gendered pronoun just as a matter of course, switching the genders is a subtle but significant realignment of a scholar's writings to go contrary to a system where male is the default.) I think its safe to assume that Ms. hooks, an academic, has a similarly convincing reasoning behind her choice. This should be respected. Caesar and Mao don't really bear on the issue because they would write their name in their own language, and we don't seem to be talking about translation. Pink letters on a blue blackground also confuses the issue by taking too strong an extreme and asking to apply it to a much less extreme example. -Terin <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 75.3.178.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.3.178.151_53a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.3.178.151">contribs</a>) 12:16, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I have upcased the names, because we want the <i>result</i> of the Cat's alpha sort to be the same as that of a case-insensitive sort/indexing.

Hooks". This can be accomplished only by directing the (case-sensitive) sort/indexing to base her position on "Hooks, Bell". If i had left the <i>h</i> she'd have appeared after Z names, and if i'd upcased that but left the <i>b</i>, she would be after anyone else named either "hooks" or "Hooks".

<h3><span class="mw-headline">new grammar edits</span></h3>
<p>I just edited this page to conform with accepted English practice while maintaining as much idiosyncratic spelling as possible, as well as fixing numerous instances of the misused singular possessive. When "bell" or "hooks" began a sentence, that word was captitalized. No individual is so important as to rewrite English grammar on their own whim. All mentions of "hooks'" have been changed to "hooks's", as this is how we spell in English. Also, "Black" and "White" were changed to "black" and "white" as this is also standard English practice.<br />

<dd>I don't know where you learned your "English" but "hooks's" is completely incorrect. "Hooks'" is correct.<br />

<dd><s>"Hooks' may be correct, however that is not the light that the author wishes to be seen in, more importantly, names aside. I believe that it is her work, not her name or the spelling of it that should be addressed.

<dd>I totally agree with <a href="../../../b/2E/_/User%7EB._Phillips_496b.html" title="User:B. Phillips">B. Phillips</a> that, hook's name capitalization preference notwithstanding, first words of English sentences are capitalized, period (pardon the pun). Whether the possessive form for "hooks" should be <i>hooks'</i> or <i>hooks's</i> is a bit stickier. Outside of wikipedia's rules I have seen it written that either form is acceptable depending on how the word sounds after adding an " 's ". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Usage_and_spelling" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Usage_and_spelling" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's rules for the possessive form</a>, in keeping with this, state: <i>Possessives of singular nouns ending in s may be formed with or without an additional s. Either form is generally acceptable within Wikipedia. However, if either form is much more common for a particular word or phrase, follow that form, such as with "Achilles' heel" and "Jesus' tears".</i> So, I am changing all instances where hooks' name begins a sentence to be capitalized, but will not change any possessive forms, pending further discussion.<br />

<dd>I am reversing my opinion. Names should be written as they are, including an initial lower case letter, even at the beginning of sentences. eHarmony chooses to spell its name with a lowercase initial letter and it not capitalized at the beginning of sentences -- neither should hooks'.<br />

<dd>_ _ She's being granted the indulgence of her casing of her name being followed in all but one usage, despite the fact that those who cite her works are at least as likely to upper-case both parts.</dd>
<dd>_ _ Good practice suggests avoiding the occasion for upper-casing a proper name that begins with a lower case, and i've restored (without inves<s>i</s>tigating who trashed it) the mechanism for doing that in the lead sentence, for the simple reason that it reduces confusion. (... about what we are saying. It's not the purpose of this article to teach English usage, so there's no need to make sure we use it at least once at the start of a sentence, to demonstrate the prinicipal we apply.)</dd>
<dd>_ _ If we do have it at the start of a sentence, it must be capitalized. That's how written English works, and while languages change, she and a handful of rock bands don't yet amount to a constituency for change.</dd>
<dd>_ _ "EHarmony", BTW, if you can't find a syntax for moving it away to where you can help them make their point. "eHarmony" at the start, of course on your own Web site, but you don't get a license to look like an ignoramus in front of <i>our</i> public with your editor's registration.<br />

<li>About a month later, <a href="../../../b/2E/_/User%7EB._Phillips_496b.html" title="User:B. Phillips">User:B. Phillips</a> (as they state in the previous section) upper-cased the first word in sentences and lower-cased Black. About 17 days later, a new IP made their only edit, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=45063464&amp;oldid=44940984" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=45063464&amp;oldid=44940984" rel="nofollow">downcasing two first-word references</a> to her name, including the lead-sentence one.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">Six days later</a>, a long-term reg'd ed made an edit upcasing "Hooks" (as <i>second</i> word in the lead), and reverted himself in the next minute; 40 hours later, a new IP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=46215717&amp;oldid=45937799" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=46215717&amp;oldid=45937799" rel="nofollow">downcased 6 first-word references</a>, and 15 minutes later made their only other two edits, the msg in the previous section that i struck thru as incoherant whenever on-topic. (I did the strike thru over 12 hours ago, in an edit-screen that i lost, without any thot about whether the contrib had edited the article or not; i reconstructed the strike-thru a few hours ago, before undertaking this investigation to test my hypothesis that the visual awkwardness of having a ref to the pen name start the article was an incitement to "vandalistic advocacy" by random registered and IP editors, in contrast to "The person..." or "Gloria Watkins". The common authorship of the three edits is something i discovered only in the last half hour (the one before reaching this point in the edit).</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">Nine days later</a>, a reg'd ed'r (for the preceding 23 days and 4 edits; they've edited twice more since, each after a month or two without) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=47698256&amp;oldid=46857768" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bell_hooks&amp;diff=47698256&amp;oldid=46857768" rel="nofollow">took</a> the s off one instance of "hooks's".</li>
<li>Another 14 days later, an IP with 29 months and 80 edits thru a few days ago downcased 2 first-word refs to her, and unwikified 7 presumably blue lks. (2 of these, after someone restored them and i noted them in the course of an unrelated edit, needed piping away from rdrs that led to dict-defs, but most seem desirable to me.)</li>

<li>Not quite 6 hours later, an IP editor newly minted 32 seconds before up-cased her surname as the <i>second</i> word of a sentence, reverts, and does their 4th &amp; final edit at the 1 minute, 38 second mark.

<dd>The ref'd page is titled
<dl>
<dd>Postmodern Blackness [Bell Hooks]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>A heading, presumably documenting its submission via EMail, reads
<dl>
<dd>Date: Tue, 19 Apr 1994 12:35:31 -0700 (PDT) From: "Arthur R. McGee" Subject: Postmodern Blackness (bell hooks)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The next two headings would seem to be either transcriptions of the author's title and copyright pages, or her functional substitutes for them:
<dl>
<dd>POSTMODERN BLACKNESS by BELL HOOKS</dd>
<dd>Oberlin College Copyright (c) 1990 by bell hooks, all rights reserved _Postmodern Culture_ vol. 1, no. 1 (Sep. 1990).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><b>Summarizing:</b>
<dl>
<dd>Hooks apparently followed the usual convention of cover and title-page emphasis via all-caps (and apparently gives the lie to the assertions that she
<dl>
<dd>seeks to avoid the conventional emphasis on names, and</dd>
<dd>intends the name to be written only with lower-case letters).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The submitter (McGee) used the two lower-cased names.</dd>
<dd>U of P both indexed and headed its page without using a leading lower-case letter, and in one case ("[Bell Hooks]") made use of upper-case H in a situation justifiable only by either</dd>
<dd>-- construing as applicable something along the lines of the rule of style that says "First <i>and last</i> words of a title (or sub-title) are always capitalized, or</dd>
<dd>-- an editorial principle like "We'll reflect bizarre casing submitted to us, to the extent of printing it as we receive it, but that doesn't obligate us to utter the same bizarreness when <i>we</i> say something about what we got."</dd>

<dd>Beyond cross-references from pages that are part of the same collection of seven (each concerning a "major thinker in contemporary educational thought") the <i>site</i> references the ref'd page on a "Home Page" for the seven, with a lk labeled "Bell Hooks".</dd>
<dd>A similar page on the site lks to has broken lks to 17 presumably similar pages. (Seven of these are for the same seven thinkers.) This is apparently a related and earlier version:
<dl>
<dd>as to relatedness, there is common wording, including the redundant "an effort to try to provide";</dd>
<dd>as to order:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>all 17 lks are now broken;</li>
<li>it appears less edited (a misspelled course name; the cut-and-paste-like garble (emphasis added) "a<i>th</i>t econclusion" for "at <i>th</i>e conclusion"; punctuation typos);</li>
<li>it has less polished formating;</li>
<li>it describes of the de novo production of the collection)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It has lks labeled with names, including the same 7 -- but the "bell hooks" lk is labeled in lower case.</dd>
<dd>As to the referenced page:
<dl>
<dd>It uses "Bell Hooks" in both the heading and (as do the other 6 pages) in the bank of lks;</dd>
<dd>It comprises:
<ul>
<li>A biographical section of six 'graphs, which
<dl>
<dd>uses "bell hooks" in the first and "hooks" (or "hooks/Watson's") once in each of the rest. (Three of these start paragraphs.)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>A poorly defined section of a transitional sentence, the 3 external-lks it segues into, and a recommendation of starting with a book -- which is asterisk linked to bibliographic entry in the succeeding section, with
<dl>
<dd>each of those five items using a form of ther name, lower-cased;</dd>
<dd>-- one follows the style of McGee's in citing "Postmodern Blackness";</dd>
<dd>-- two do so as subsequent words of sentences;</dd>
<dd>-- one does at the start of a title, and</dd>
<dd>-- one does within a title that upper-cases nearly every other word.</dd>
<dd>(However, the last of these is no longer a valid lk to such an article, but redirects to the top of the site; the title given suggests the reference was to <a href="http://www.shambhala.com/html/learn/features/pema/interview/index.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.shambhala.com/html/learn/features/pema/interview/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">"the Shambhala Sun magazine" interview with Pema Chödrön</a>, which -- at least on that Web page -- is headed "Pema Chödrön &amp; bell hooks talk over life and all its problems" (in accordance with a popular "capitalize only the first word and proper names" style-rule rather than the cited "Pema Chödrön &amp; bell hooks Talk Over Life and All Its Problems", which suggests a "hooks big-words style".)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Three media-/biblio-graphic sections, each with a heading and (unless they reflect more than one style among the three headings) formatted according to a "hooks big-words style".
<dl>
<dd>Two of these headings include "bell hooks". These also correspond to the books, and the titles use "first and proper style"; entries for hooks's works cite her name as "Hooks, Bell", and her name begins one title: "Bell Hooks' engaged pedagogy&#160;: a transgressive education for critical consciousness", which is "first and proper". These repeatedly imply simply treating "Bell Hooks" as her name, and "bell hooks" as not her name, but at most a peculiarity of her and some other authors' style in writing her name.</dd>
<dd>The last section does differ; the Home pages hint at why:</dd>
<dd>both say
<dl>
<dd>[The thinker pages linked] include... detailed bibliographies of their [book] works. When available media sources are listed as well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The early "Home" says
<dl>
<dd>The bibliographies were created in most instance [sic] by online searches through the Library of Congress.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>while the later one omits "in most instance". This suggests that the instance(s) where a student working on one thinker's page didn't use LoC were later standardized to LoC, and that the same may not be the case for "media", e.g. the hooks video. In the two strict-sense bibliographical sections, we are told we are seeing LoC entries; in the case of "bell hooks: Cultural Criticism &amp; Transformation", we can see on the cover (BTW, this time belying at least her <i>enforcing on her publisher</i> the de-emphasis of her name)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Casing yet again</span></h2>
<p>I read though the prior discussion of casing, which has grown inconsistent again. What I believe is the prior consensus—and what I also believe is correct—is to use hooks' preferred lowercasing as the rule, but to still follow English orthographic conventions about word-initial capitalization. This rule is completely consistent with other non-upper names such as "da Vinci" and "van Rossum", which likewise become upper-cased in sentence-initial position ("Da Vinci was an artist..."; "Van Rossum created the Python programming language..."). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 21:22, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">You CANNOT begin a paragraph with a lower-case letter!</span></h2>
<p>The practice of beginning a name (an immature call for attention, no doubt) or any proper noun with a lower-case letter defies one of the most basic rules of standard written English. It can simply not be done. Wikipedia is supposed to follow the rules and style of standard English. Why does this specific person have the right to not only have her name written in all lower-case letters, but to have paragraphs and sentences that begin with her name also begin with lower-case letters, breaking yet ANOTHER rule of standard English? I find it absolutely absurd that Wikipedia allows this.--<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrant007_a2de.html" title="User:Tyrant007">Tyrant007</a> 00:25, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Listen, I dislike hooks, but I think she (like anybody else) should be able to choose their own name (including its spelling). eBay chose to name itself with a proper name beginning with a lowercase letter. Should sentences begin with "Ebay"? What about eHarmony? If the National Review thinks you can begin a sentence with a lowercase letter <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWVjZDBhYzhiZDdlYTNhNjk5MDk1MjFkNjVkMTYyNjI=" class="external autonumber" title="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWVjZDBhYzhiZDdlYTNhNjk5MDk1MjFkNjVkMTYyNjI=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, that's good enough for me. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b-blp_dd60.html" title="User:Lawyer2b-blp">Lawyer2b-blp</a> 04:35, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is there (or ought there to be) a Category for "Celebrity names that affect unconventional typography", to facilitate comparisons by readers?

<dd>Since this article exists solely to provide information about bell hooks, I feel that her choice in pen name should be respected, regardless of its non-conformity with standard convention.
