	    <p>The main belief of The Nation of Islam and its followers is that there is no God but Allah. Their most important worship is praying five times a day. The official beliefs as stated by the Nation of Islam have been outlined in books, documents, and articles published by the organization as well as speeches by <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah_Muhammad_463d.html" title="Elijah Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Farrakhan_10e0.html" title="Louis Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>, and other ministers. These include inflammatory statements as well as the pejorative use of the term “white devils” to refer to <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white people</a>. Many of Elijah Muhammad's teachings may be found in <i>Message to the Blackman in America</i> and <i>The True History of Jesus as Taught by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad</i> (Chicago: Coalition for the Remembrance of Elijah, 1992). Many of Malcolm X's teachings of NOI theology are in his <i>The End of White World Supremacy</i>, while a later more critical discussion of those beliefs can be found in <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i>, co-written with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Haley_c108.html" title="Alex Haley">Alex Haley</a>.</p>
<p>Passed down via written lessons from 1930-1934 from W. Fard Muhammad to his student, Elijah Muhammad, referred to and titled, <i>The Supreme Wisdom</i> the Nation of Islam continues to teach its followers that the present world society is segmented into three distinct categories. They teach that from a general perspective, 85% of the world's people of all races and faiths are the <i>deaf, dumb and blind</i> masses of the people who <i>are easily led in the wrong direction and hard to lead in the right direction</i>. These 85% of the masses are said to be manipulated by 10% of the people who are referred to as <i>the rich slave-makers</i> of the masses of the people. Those 10% rich <i>slave-makers</i> are said to manipulate the 85% masses of the people through ignorance, the skillful use of religious doctrine and the mass media.</p>
<p>The third group referred to as the 5% <i>poor righteous teachers</i> of the people of the world who know the truth of the manipulation of the 85% masses of the people by the 10% and that 5% <i>righteous teachers</i> are at constant struggle and war with 10% to reach and <i>free the minds</i> of the masses of the people. (<i>Assignment of Mr. Elijah Muhammad, The Supreme Wisdom</i>, February 20, 1934; <i>Power at Last Forever</i>, Minister Louis Farrakhan, Madison Square Garden, New York, October, 1985)</p>
<p>The official platform of beliefs as stated by Elijah Muhammad in <i>Message to the Blackman in America</i> published in 1965 are as follows verbatim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>1. WE BELIEVE In the One God whose proper Name is Allah.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2. WE BELIEVE in the Holy Qur'an and in the Scriptures of all the Prophets of God.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>3. WE BELIEVE in the truth of the Bible, but we believe that it has been tampered with and must be reinterpreted so that mankind will not be snared by the falsehoods that have been added to it.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4. WE BELIEVE in Allah's Prophets and the Scriptures they brought to the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5. WE BELIEVE in the resurrection of the dead--not in physical resurrection--but in mental resurrection. We believe that the so-called Negroes are most in need of mental resurrection; therefore they will be resurrected first.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, we believe we are the people of God's choice, as it has been written, that God would choose the rejected and the despised. We can find no other persons fitting this description in these last days more than the so-called Negroes in America. We believe in the resurrection of the righteous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>6. WE BELIEVE in the judgment; we believe this first judgment will take place as God revealed, in America.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>7. WE BELIEVE this is the time in history for the separation of the so-called Negroes and the so-called white Americans. We believe the black man should be freed in name as well as in fact. By this we mean that he should be freed from the names imposed upon him by his former slave masters. Names which identified him as being the slave master's slave. We believe that if we are free indeed, we should go in our own people's names--the black people of the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>8. WE BELIEVE in justice for all, whether in God or not; we believe as others, that we are due equal justice as human beings. We believe in equality--as a nation--of equals. We do not believe that we are equal with our slave masters in the status of "freed slaves."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>We recognize and respect American citizens as independent peoples and we respect their laws which govern this nation.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>9. WE BELIEVE that the offer of integration is hypocritical and is made by those who are trying to deceive the black peoples into believing that their 400-year-old open enemies of freedom, justice and equality are, all of a sudden, their "friends." Furthermore, we believe that such deception is intended to prevent black people from realizing that the time in history has arrived for the separation from the whites of this nation.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the white people are truthful about their professed friendship toward the so-called Negro, they can prove it by dividing up America with their slaves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not believe that America will ever be able to furnish enough jobs for her own millions of unemployed, in addition to jobs for the 20,000,000 black people as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>10. WE BELIEVE that we who declare ourselves to be righteous Muslims, should not participate in wars which take the lives of humans. We do not believe this nation should force us to take part in such wars, for we have nothing to gain from it unless America agrees to give us the necessary territory wherein we may have something to fight for.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>11. WE BELIEVE our women should be respected and protected as the women of other nationalities are respected and protected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>12. WE BELIEVE that Allah (God) appeared in the Person of Master W. Fard Muhammad, July, 1930; the long-awaited "Messiah" of the Christians and the "Mahdi" of the Muslims.<br />
<br />
We believe further and lastly that Allah is God and besides HIM there is no god and He will bring about a universal government of peace wherein we all can live in peace together.</b></p>

<p>The NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_slave_trade.html" title="Atlantic slave trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> they were systematically denied knowledge of their past history, language, culture, and religion and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Central to this doctrine, NOI theology asserts that Black people’s experience of slavery was the fulfillment of Bible prophecy and therefore, black people are the seed of <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham.html" title="Abraham">Abraham</a> referred to in the Bible, in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis.html" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> 15:13–14:</p>

<p>The Nation of Islam teaches that Black people were the original humans. Louis Farrakhan has stated that "White people are potential humans…they haven’t evolved yet." (Philadelphia Inquirer, 3/18/00).</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The Blackman is the original man. From him came all brown, yellow, red, and white people. By using a special method of birth control law, the Blackman was able to produce the white race. This method of birth control was developed by a Black scientist known as <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakub.html" title="Yakub">Yakub</a>, who envisioned making and teaching a nation of people who would be diametrically opposed to the Original People. A Race of people who would one day rule the original people and the earth for a period of 6,000 years. Yakub promised his followers that he would graft a nation from his own people, and he would teach them how to rule his people, through a system of tricks and lies whereby they use deceit to divide and conquer, and break the unity of the darker people, put one brother against another, and then act as mediators and rule both sides." (Elijah Muhammad, <i>Message to the Blackman in America</i>, Muhammad's Temple No. 2, 1965 &amp; Dorothy Blake Fardan, <i>Yakub and the Origins of White Supremacy</i>, Lushena Books, 2001)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In an interview on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meet_the_Press_18af.html" title="Meet the Press">Meet the Press</a>, Louis Farrakhan said the following in response to host <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Russert_bbee.html" title="Tim Russert">Tim Russert</a>'s question on the Nation of Islam's teachings on race:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"You know, it’s not unreal to believe that white people—who genetically cannot produce yellow, brown or black—had a Black origin. The scholars and scientists of this world agree that the origin of man and humankind started in Africa and that the first parent of the world was black. The Qur'an says that God created Adam out of black mud and fashioned him into shape. So if white people came from the original people, the Black people, what is the process by which you came to life? That is not a silly question. That is a scientific question with a scientific answer. It doesn't suggest that we are superior or that you are inferior. It suggests, however, that your birth or your origin is from the black people of this earth: superiority and inferiority is determined by our righteousness and not by our color." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Pressed by Russert on whether he agreed with Elijah Muhammad's preaching that whites are blue-eyed devils, Farrakhan responded:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Well, you have not been saints in the way you have acted toward the darker peoples of the world and toward even your own people. But, in truth, Mr. Russert, any human being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be considered a devil. In the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, it talks about the fall of Babylon. It says Babylon is fallen because she has become the habitation of devils. We believe that that ancient Babylon is a symbol of a modern Babylon, which is America."</dd>
</dl>
<p>While <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> was a member of the Nation of Islam he also preached that black people were genetically superior to white people.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Thoughtful white people know they are inferior to Black people. Even Eastland knows it. Anyone who has studied the genetic phase of biology knows that white is considered recessive and black is considered dominant." (<i>The Playboy Interview: Malcolm X</i>, interviewed by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Haley_c108.html" title="Alex Haley">Alex Haley</a>, <i>Playboy Magazine</i>, May 1963).</dd>
</dl>
<p>He later repudiated this belief, as a result of embracing orthodox Islam.</p>

<p>Elijah Muhammad taught his followers about a Mother Plane or Wheel, a UFO that was seen and described in the visions of the prophet <a href="../../../e/z/e/Ezekiel.html" title="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> in the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezekiel_8d65.html" title="Book of Ezekiel">Book of Ezekiel</a>, in the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Hebrew Bible</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beryl.html" title="Beryl">beryl</a>. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezekiel_8d65.html" title="Book of Ezekiel">Book of Ezekiel</a> Chapter 1:15-18, Bible, English Standard Version</dd>
</dl>
<p>Louis Farrakhan, commenting on his teacher's description said the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad told us of a giant Mother Plane that is made like the universe, spheres within spheres. White people call them unidentified flying objects (UFOs). <a href="../../../e/z/e/Ezekiel.html" title="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, in the Old Testament, saw a wheel that looked like a cloud by day but a pillar of fire by night. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that that wheel was built on the island of <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nippon.html" title="Nippon">Nippon</a>, which is now called <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, by some of the Original scientists. It took $15 billion in gold at that time to build it. It is made of the toughest steel. America does not yet know the composition of the steel used to make an instrument like it. It is a circular plane, and the Bible says that it never makes turns. Because of its circular nature it can stop and travel in all directions at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. He said there are 1,500 small wheels in this Mother Wheel, which is a half mile by a half mile (800 m by 800 m). This Mother Wheel is like a small human-built planet. Each one of these small planes carry three bombs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said these planes were used to set up mountains on the earth. The Qur'an says it like this: We have raised mountains on the earth lest it convulse with you. How do you raise a mountain, and what is the purpose of a mountain? Have you ever tried to balance a tire? You use weights to keep the tire balanced. That's how the earth is balanced, with mountain ranges. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that we have a type of bomb that, when it strikes the earth a drill on it is timed to go into the earth and explode at the height that you wish the mountain to be. If you wish to take the mountain up a mile (1.6 km), you time the drill to go a mile (1.6 km) in and then explode. The bombs these planes have are timed to go one mile (1.6 km) down and bring up a mountain one mile (1.6 km) high, but it will destroy everything within a 50-square-mile (130 km²) radius. The white man writes in his above top secret memos of the UFOs. He sees them around his military installations like they are spying.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“That Mother Wheel is a dreadful-looking thing. White folks are making movies now to make these planes look like fiction, but it is based on something real. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that Mother Plane is so powerful that with sound reverberating in the atmosphere, just with a sound, she can crumble buildings.”</dd>

<p>The NOI has been seen by some as attempting to be its own religion separate of Islam. The first book analyzing the Nation of Islam was <i>The Black Muslims in America</i> (1961) by C. Eric Lincoln. Lincoln describes how religious services use myths and over-generalizations to indoctrinate NOI adherents.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Often the minister reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous references to the Blackman’s true history in the world.... Occasionally the minister chides the audience for its skepticism: “I know you don't believe me because I happen to be a Black man. Well, you can look it up in a book I’m going to tell you about that was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis of a wide range of generalized <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non_sequitur_%28logic%29.html" title="Non sequitur (logic)">non-sequiturs</a>. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (<i>The Black Muslims in America</i>, pp. 120–121)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is also to be observed that the Qur'an does not teach the superiority of any race. The Quran in 49:13 (Arberry's translation) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O mankind, We have created you male and female, and appointed you races and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely <i>the noblest</i> among you in the sight of God is the most godfearing of you. God is All-knowing, All-aware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equally unorthodox is the claim that a true prophet can be sent after Muhammad. One of the earliest believers was Bilaal, an Ethiopian emancipated slave, but neither he nor did the Persian Salman form any political or religious parry.</p>

<p>Members of The Nation of Islam have long held that Elijah Muhammad did not die, but instead escaped a death plot, was restored to health, and is aboard “that huge wheel-like plane that is even now flying over our heads.” Among Muhammad's passengers on the so-called Mother Wheel is the mysterious figure named W.D. Fard. The Mother Wheel is based upon the biblical wheel of Ezekiel .</p>
