<p>Circeus, I appreciate your concern for the referencing system, but please don't change it, at least not before the article is a bit nearer completion. The main author Giano, who is still working on the article, likes it as it is, and so do all the copy-editors who have commented, including ALoan, who is by way of being a footnote guru. I'm the one who introduced it, and my reasons for preferring single notes over combined notes is:</p>
<ul>
<li>it gives <i>consecutive</i> note numbers in the text. This is universal practice in the academic world, in fact I've never seen non-consecutive note numerals outside Wikipedia. Do we really want a home-rolled system of numerals appearing in any old order, which will look unfamiliar and weird to anybody who's ever written, or read, an academic paper?</li>
<li>It leaves us free to write a separate <i>alphabetical</i> list of the sources used. The reader who is looking for a particular book will find it easily in such a list. By contrast s/he'll have a lot of trouble navigating the random-order list which combining references and footnotes into one list automatically produces.</li>
<li>I have used my preferred system (actually not mine, but standard in my field) in a number of FA's, and never had anybody object to it. People aren't keen to try it for themselves--I suppose it sounds complicated when I explain it--but they do appear to like the result. On my latest FAC, <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897_30ad.html" title="S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897">S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897</a> none of the twenty or so FAC "voters" had any problem with this notes+references system..</li>
<li>It's so intuitive to use that there's no learning curve at all: the &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tags are self-explanatory. That's far from the case with the combined-note code, in fact I don't understand it very well.&#160;:-/ <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:49, 18 June 2006 (UTC).</li>

<dd>Sorry - I don't entirely agree with Bish (and I would not claim to be a footnote "guru" - far from it!) - I think there are two things being confused here. First, where the footnotes refer to separate pages in a few references, I agree that it makes good sense to have a "notes" section, separate from the references. However, where the same page is referred to more than once, I disagree, in that I think it also makes sense to combine the notes (so footnote [1] say always refers to page x of a particular book). In a way, this is like the traditional <i><a href="../../../o/p/2E/Op._cit..html" title="Op. cit.">op. cit.</a></i> <i><a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibid..html" title="Ibid.">ibid.</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../l/o/c/Loc._cit..html" title="Loc. cit.">loc. cit.</a></i> thingies. Is this too confusing? -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 09:02, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is for the man writing the page! let me finish it, and ref it then you can do what you like. I must say though with all due respect ALoan, I do think the abcde system is complicated, and also confusing what with all that 13623 business in no order. It also makes it harder for another edit to just pop in (as f one would dare) with a few facts. I just like to things very simple. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 12:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry I said there was consensus, I thought there was.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=59010695&amp;oldid=59004719" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Giano&amp;diff=59010695&amp;oldid=59004719" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Three things in reply to ALoan:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I don't see a nostalgic harking back to the over-complicated old we-the-incrowd-only <i><a href="../../../o/p/2E/Op.cit.html" title="Op.cit">op.cit</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibid.html" title="Ibid">ibid</a></i> system as an actual advantage, now that academe has streamlined its own practices.</li>
<li>Cite.php gives non-consecutive note numbers in the text, which makes it a lot different from anything used elsewhere, whether traditional or current. I would rather see Wikipedia join the rest of the world in this respect. Being different is often a great thing, but actually not when it comes to these superfices of style. The more like the practice of everybody else they are, the less conspicuous they will be, and the less they'll distract from content.</li>
<li>There's no need to have a lot of low-value footnotes such as "Nicolson, 148"--that was an intermediate step. As I've been saying, for an example of the end product, please take a look at <a href="../../../s/2E/_/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_balloon_expedition_of_1897_30ad.html" title="S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897">S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897</a>. Having a separate references section allows for replacing many footnotes with parenthetic references in the text (which are IMO less distracting to the reader than footnotes that tease you to follow them to the bottom on the page, because who knows if it was about something interesting for once?). I've just now done that step, to have the system look its best before it's jettisoned.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not in any case going to spend the (ahem) flower of my youth repeating these arguments, as I did with <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Byrne_6884.html" title="Simon Byrne">Simon Byrne</a>. I'd rather actually copyedit the article, which fiddling with the referencing minutiae has been keeping me from, so, meh. P.S, though: I notice that the formulaization of the simple alphabetical "References" section I'd made now restricts additions to it to the minority that knows how to handle the formulas (say 1% of editors? Not me, anyway.) Is this really desirable? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 13:34, 18 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, I don't find the non-consecutuve numbers confusing (I have seen scientific papers using this style - when you see [3], you know that it is the third reference being used again, whether it come immediately after [1] and [2], or between [19] and [20]), nor the abcde thing (you know that 3(e) links to the fifth use of the third reference), nor adding a new reference (just add in a new &lt;ref&gt; tag in the right place and &lt;references&gt; catches it and adds it to the notes/references section for you).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But Giano is right - this is just fiddling. Feel free to ignore what I say, and please don't let me stop you doing it however you want. There is no right answer. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 14:12, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bishonen what is this edit summary supposed to mean " . Belton House‎; 22:36 . . Bishonen (Talk | contribs) (→References - Please add full references in the reference section, not as notes. Must it use this horrible code that makes it so difficult? I've asked that before, please see talk page.)" - What do you want me to do, it looks OK to me - I no understanding you <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 22:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's not that I want you to do anything, Giano. The edit summary refers to my own P.S. above: "<i>I notice that the formulaization of the simple alphabetical "References" section I'd made now restricts additions to it to the minority that knows how to handle the formulas (say 1% of editors? Not me, anyway.) Is this really desirable?</i>" It's not about how it looks on the page — both versions look the same — it's about how easy/difficult it is to add to. What I would <i>like</i>, since you ask, is for whoever made the references section unmanageable for all casual editors (and unmanageable for the man who wrote the article, I see) to revert it back to the simple way it was. But I was just grumbling, I don't imagine that's going to happen, since it's a bona fide and recommended kind of formula. (<i>Why</i> we recommend a nerdfest over simplicity remains a mystery to me, but oh, well.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 09:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

The National Trust. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1843592185</a>."? But perhaps an earlier addition? If so then we should add Chesshyre, J.F. as the author to the work listed in the references, and change the cites from "<i>Belton House</i>" to "Chesshyre". Also does the 1984 edition need to be cited in note 12, or can we use the 2006 edition? Lastly what is the page number for note 12? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 15:31, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, that would be helpful, "Chesshyre"'s obviously a better cite.

<dd>The J.F.Chesshyre booklet was one which the National Trust produced when it first took over the house. The last paragraph of its introduction (p.5) says "A full guidebook will be published in 1985; this guidebook has been produced for the 1984 season. The National Trust is particularly indebted to Mrs Rosmary Joekes and Mr Anthony du Boulay for help in its preparation. J.F.Chesshyre May 1984" This is where the name comes from as there is no other statement of the authorship except that it was "designed by James Shurmer". I guess this means that he did the layout, chose the type faces and so on.</dd>
<dd>The information relevant to note 12 comes on the first page of the same introduction, p.4 - "In 1984, Lord Brownlow gave the house, together with the garden, a great quantity of garden sculpture and some of the contents of the house to the Trust, while the park and a substantial proportion of the contents were purchased with a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund." The introduction does not carry that title but "Belton House", though introduction is what it is and what it is called in the Contents list.

<p>I can't immediately find a larger version - but I meant how about changing the sentence to read "the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_signs_in_the_United_Kingdom_a373.html" title="Road signs in the United Kingdom">British motorway signs</a> (<a href="../../../h/h/_/Image%7EHH_icon.png_c241.html" class="image" title="Image:HH icon.png"><img src="../../../upload/f/fd/HH_icon.png" alt="Image:HH icon.png" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../h/h/_/Image%7EHH_icon.png_c241.html" /></a>) which give directions to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stately_home.html" title="Stately home">stately home</a>" - that is, adding the image in the middle of the text. -- ~~</p>
<p>Good idea, I've just put it in. I looked for an image when I was writing it, but couldn't find one, I'm sure though I have seen another similar sign even more like Belton though.

<dd>Good point. However - what about Jacobean style? Was this really less vernacular than Carolean? And even if one discounts Jacobean, is this really a notable claim? After all, the Tudor period only ended in 1603, and sixty years is not very long in terms of architectural history.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonemad_GB_6d25.html" title="User:Stonemad GB">Stonemad GB</a> 19:01, 6 September 2006 (UTC).

<dd>It was (albeit in a very bastardised and idiosyncratic form), but then Carolean architecture was based on Dutch and French influences.

<dd>Dunno take it up with Nicolson, Nigel (1965). Great Houses of Britain. Hamlyn Publishing Group. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-600-01651-X</a>. Page 148. He said it! Seriously though I think Carolean is subtly different from the French and Dutch architecture of that time and did evolve in Britain. Whereas the Renaissance influences were clearly imported quickly rather than evolved here so were in reality a pastiche, all that ballustrading for example, the loggias massquerading as porches etc. I see where you are coming from but the problem is here we are not allowed own re-search, and I did not disagree with the statement enough to omit it. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 20:26, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the attention to this sentence. Before I changed it, it was: "Belton was designed in the restrained almost <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladian.html" title="Palladian">Palladian</a>-inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque."; I changed it to "Belton was designed in the restrained, almost <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladian.html" title="Palladian">Palladian</a>-inspired architecture of its time."; it was later changed to "Belton was designed in the restrained, almost <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladian_architecture.html" title="Palladian architecture">Palladian</a>-inspired architecture, popular immediately before the emergence in England of the ornate Baroque". When I read this sentence originally, I found it very hard to understand; the wording seemed quite unclear. I thought quite hard about how to best improve it. I wasn't entirely satisfied by what I changed it to, but I thought it was at least an improvement. I was willing to remove the "immediately before the emergence in England of the ornate Baroque" phrase because it seemed to be mentioned above, and I couldn't find a way to gramatically incorporate it into the sentence. Using "popular" is good, but then the first clause: "Belton was designed in the restrained, almost <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palladian_architecture.html" title="Palladian architecture">Palladian</a>-inspired architecture" becomes gramatically incomplete. The "in the restrained" could be changed to "in a restrained", but that might have other problems. I've made that change, feel free to further edit.

<dd>You have completely lost me, so long as we have a mention of the Baroque that was succeeding the Palladian is fine, that is important because it helps to bang home why Belton was not up to date when it was built, in fact it was considered old fashioned. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiano_dc9f.html" title="User:Giano">Giano</a> | <a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiano_a5ff.html" title="User talk:Giano">talk</a> 20:53, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
