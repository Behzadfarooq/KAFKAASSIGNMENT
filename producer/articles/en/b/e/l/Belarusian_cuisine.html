<p>Although <b>Belarusian cuisine</b> derives from the same common sources as those of its neighbours - <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanians.html" title="Lithuanians">Lithuanians</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainians.html" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a>, and in later times <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russians.html" title="Russians">Russians</a> - it is sometimes considered as somewhat less rich and impressive than those of its imposing neighbours.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> In fact, however, this may result from the general lack of national identity which still continues to hold back the development of a nation and also led to the loss of many culinary traditions in the last 100 years. Yet the history of <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastronomy.html" title="Gastronomy">gastronomy</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> reveals a highly exotic rather than a poor cuisine.

<p>Aside from its predominantly Ruthenian roots, Belarusian cuisine is very close to <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_cuisine.html" title="Lithuanian cuisine">Lithuanian</a>: the first Belarusian state entity, the Polatsk principality, conquered <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuania.html" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> back in <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_century.html" title="11th century">11th century</a>, and remained the core and center of the state for some 200 years. In the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13</a>-<a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14</a> centuries, however, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanians.html" title="Lithuanians">Lithuanians</a> gained the upper hand, and gradually took over today’s Belarus, as well as much of today’s <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, creating a huge <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania_4695.html" title="Grand Duchy of Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> which at one time in the 15th century extended from the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a> to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sea_23fa.html" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> to form <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>’s largest state. The majority of its citizens were Belarusian-speaking, and <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Belarusian_language_6afa.html" title="Old Belarusian language">Old Belarusian language</a> was the main official language. After the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Lublin_ff99.html" title="Union of Lublin">union with Poland in 1569</a>, Polish influence became strong in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Though both the Polish elite and the Belarusian nobility borrowed much from <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_cuisine.html" title="Italian cuisine">Italian</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_cuisine.html" title="German cuisine">German</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_cuisine.html" title="French cuisine">French</a> cuisines, this influence hardly made itself felt in the diet of the serf peasant majority until the abolition of serfdom in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Some of the borrowed dishes, however, spread throughout the society, such as <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazanki.html" title="Lazanki">lazanki</a> (a mixture of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flour.html" title="Flour">flour</a> <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumpling.html" title="Dumpling">dumplings</a> and stewed <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat.html" title="Meat">meat</a>, related to Italian <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lasagna.html" title="Lasagna">lasagna</a>) and, above all, various dishes made of grated <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html" title="Potato">potato</a>, typical for German cuisine.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheat.html" title="Wheat">wheat</a> does not grow well in a cold and wet climate <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarusians.html" title="Belarusians">Belarusians</a> were always fond of a kind of somewhat sour <a href="../../../r/y/e/Rye_bread.html" title="Rye bread">rye bread</a>, and the most traditional hard drink, harelka, closely related to Russian <a href="../../../v/o/d/Vodka.html" title="Vodka">vodka</a>, was distilled primarily from a rye malt.</p>
<p>Like other Slavonic peoples, Belarusians could boast of a huge variety of <a href="../../../b/l/i/Bliny.html" title="Bliny">bliny</a> (pancakes) of various thickness, plain and filled, made mostly of wheat or <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckwheat.html" title="Buckwheat">buckwheat</a> flour, but also using <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oatmeal.html" title="Oatmeal">oatmeal</a> (tsadaviki).</p>
<p>Various kinds of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cereal.html" title="Cereal">cereal</a> especially <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barley.html" title="Barley">barley</a>, oatmeal and buckwheat were common. Belarus was the likely centre of Europe’s buckwheat culture, and dishes made with this healthy grain used to be very popular: various kinds of <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bun.html" title="Bun">buns</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/k/Cake.html" title="Cake">cakes</a> and dumplings which, except for the well-known "<a href="../../../k/a/s/Kasha.html" title="Kasha">kasha</a>", no longer exist today.</p>
<p>The main <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetable.html" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a> were <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabbage.html" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a> (often made into <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauerkraut.html" title="Sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a>) and <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beet.html" title="Beet">beets</a>, while <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnip.html" title="Turnip">turnips</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutabaga.html" title="Rutabaga">swedes</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsnip.html" title="Parsnip">parsnip</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrot.html" title="Carrot">carrots</a> both stewed and boiled (with the addition of a small amount of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milk.html" title="Milk">milk</a>) were somewhat less popular. As elsewhere in Europe, <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legume.html" title="Legume">legumes</a> were the main source of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein.html" title="Protein">protein</a>, mainly in the form of kamy (puree of <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pea.html" title="Pea">peas</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bean.html" title="Bean">beans</a> with melted lard).</p>
<p>The word <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soup.html" title="Soup">soup</a> was not known in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus.html" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> until the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> when the nobility borrowed it from German, but soup as a type of dish clearly existed centuries earlier. The common name for most traditional Belarusian soups was poliuka, except for those based on and named after that vegetable which was the main ingredient: kapusta (cabbage soup), buraki (beet soup), gryzhanka (swede soup). For a typical poliuka the major ingredients (<a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a> or <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mushroom.html" title="Mushroom">mushrooms</a> during fasts) are first boiled with <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spices.html" title="Spices">spices</a>; cereals such as barley or <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millet.html" title="Millet">millet</a> are boiled in the stock, and then flour blended with water, bread <a href="../../../k/v/a/Kvass.html" title="Kvass">kvass</a>, beet juice or <a href="../../../b/u/t/Buttermilk.html" title="Buttermilk">buttermilk</a> are added to the stock. Black poliuka, made with <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose.html" title="Goose">goose</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pork.html" title="Pork">pork</a> blood are closely related to <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_cuisine.html" title="Swedish cuisine">Swedish</a> <a href="../../../s/v/a/Svartsoppa.html" title="Svartsoppa">svartsoppa</a>. Offering a matchmaker black poliuka was the polite way for the bride’s parents to decline a young man’s proposal. (A ruder gesture was to hand him a raw <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pumpkin.html" title="Pumpkin">pumpkin</a>). Like the Ukrainians, Russians and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poles.html" title="Poles">Poles</a>, Belarusians are fond of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borscht.html" title="Borscht">borscht</a>, a thick and rich beet and cabbage soup made with grains, potato and meat.</p>
<p>Haladnik, a cold sour soup of beet, beet tops or <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumex.html" title="Rumex">dock</a> (a sour plant of the buckwheat family, growing everywhere in the wild) served with <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sour_cream.html" title="Sour cream">sour cream</a>, boiled <a href="../../../e/g/g/Egg_%28food%29.html" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a> and potatoes) for a long time was the subject of jeers from Belarus' Polish neighbours – until they borrowed this dish in the late 18th century, when it became a fixture in Polish cuisine.</p>
<p>A traditional peasant or merchant's dinner consisted of just two dishes: soup and a main course. A special kind of pot, the sparysh, with two compartments, was used by farmers' children to bring lunch to their father working in the fields. Prior to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salad.html" title="Salad">salads</a> or other zakuski were not very common, and recipes based on Russian models tended to appear in modern Belarusian postwar cookbooks. <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmer_cheese.html" title="Farmer cheese">Farmer cheese</a> and various kinds of cold meat (usually smoked) were usually available, however, at least on holidays.</p>
<p>Meat was in rather scarce supply for most people, and was primarily eaten only on the main <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christian</a> holidays. Avid consumers of pork, Belarusians are less partial to <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutton.html" title="Mutton">mutton</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">beef</a>. Most common was raw pork <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sausage.html" title="Sausage">sausage</a> (so called ‘shoved-with-a-finger’); kishki, or kryvyanka, was a local black pudding made of <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">pig</a>’s blood and buckwheat grain; škalondza, or kindziuk, a particular kind of round sausage made of pig stomach filled with pork minced with spices – a relative of Lithuanian skilándis – were known throughout the country. Borrowed from Italian cuisine by nobility in 16th century, cold meat rolls, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salceson.html" title="Salceson">salcesons</a> and balerons were common to all of society by the 19th century, and are still very popular. The local dish pauguski, cold rolls made of halved goose breasts, however, which were once the pride of middle-class cuisine, no longer exist today.</p>
<p>Veraščaka, an 18th century thick meat gravy with pieces of meat and sausage used as a dip for thick pancakes, is still one of the most popular specialties of Belarusian restaurants today, although it is more frequently called mačanka (a dip). Also popular are <a href="../../../z/r/a/Zrazy.html" title="Zrazy">zrazy</a>, chopped pieces of beef twisted into a sausage shape and filled with vegetable, mushroom, eggs, potato etc.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalduny.html" title="Kalduny">Kalduny</a>, small boiled dumplings related to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_cuisine.html" title="Russian cuisine">Russian</a> <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelmeni.html" title="Pelmeni">pelmeni</a> and Italian <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravioli.html" title="Ravioli">ravioli</a>, were produced in endless combinations of dough, filling and sauce. Especially popular were Count Tyshkevich’s kalduny (filled with a mixture of fried local mushrooms and smoked <a href="../../../h/a/m/Ham.html" title="Ham">ham</a>). In the late 19th century kalduny began to be made with grated potato rather than with a flour-based dough and, unfortunately, the former huge variety of fillings shrank considerably. Today, kalduny have to struggle vigorously to regain their former popularity, now overtaken by Russian pelmeni. Sadly, this is true of many traditional Belarusian dishes which lost their places both on tables and in minds to the standardized and faceless cuisine of the Soviet period.</p>
<p>The main <a href="../../../d/a/i/Dairy_products.html" title="Dairy products">dairy products</a> include a kind of <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottage_cheese.html" title="Cottage cheese">cottage cheese</a>, once a common offering to <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">pagan</a> deities, and sour cream which is widely (if not ruthlessly!) used in cooking. Only in the mid-19th century was fermented <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese.html" title="Cheese">cheese</a> was borrowed from the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and the local version of <a href="../../../e/d/a/Edam_%28cheese%29.html" title="Edam (cheese)">Edam</a> was very popular for decades in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>. Sour <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butter.html" title="Butter">butter</a> from the former Dzisna county was proudly exported to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, where it continued to be the most expensive variety up to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Today, however, these traditions have become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Traditional drinks include biarozavik, a fermented <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birch_sap.html" title="Birch sap">birch sap</a>; thick saladukha, made of <a href="../../../r/y/e/Rye.html" title="Rye">rye</a> floor and <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honey.html" title="Honey">honey</a>; <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kisiel.html" title="Kisiel">kisiel</a>, the traditional jelly drink of all Slavonic peoples, previously made of oatmeal floor, now is made with potato flour flavoured with pulp of various forest berries.</p>

<p>Belarusian cuisine owes much to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_cuisine.html" title="Jewish cuisine">Jewish cooking</a>, since for centuries <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> had a virtual monopoly on inn-keeping. In the 19th century Jewish influence was especially noticeable in bringing in potato dishes of German origin, such as <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babka.html" title="Babka">babka</a> (the <a href="../../../k/u/g/Kugel.html" title="Kugel">kugel</a> of the Jewish cuisine). This was a two-way gastronomic street, for the famous bulba latkes, the potato pancakes of the East European Jews, bear a Belarusian name, since Belarusians prefer to call them draniki; both draniki and bulba <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latkes.html" title="Latkes">latkes</a> are Belarusian words, but "latkes" is now primarily used to describe the dish in Jewish cuisine. The potato became so common in 19th century – there are some 300+ dishes recorded in Belarus – that it came to be considered the core of the national cuisine. In the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, Belarusians were scornfully called bulbashi, potato-eaters; today this humiliating cliché of the Soviet times is beginning to fade. Another important minority ethnic group which influenced Belarusian cuisine were the <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tartars.html" title="Tartars">Tartars</a>, whose cuisine was especially strong in various cakes with fillings, mutton and vegetable dishes.</p>
<p>The political upheavals of the 20th century completely wiped out the former privileged classes, gentry and bourgeoisie, the bearers of more sophisticated and western-oriented spiritual and material culture. Many traditional upper and middle class dishes went down the path of oblivion. The very idea of a separate Belarusian cuisine was treated with suspicion. Only after World War II did it occur to the communist authorities that the proclaimed ‘flourishing of national culture’ (<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> even thrust Belarusian puppet ‘state’ upon the founders of the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>) should also be evident in the cuisine. The only source which was permitted for such a culinary reconstruction, however, was the heritage of the poorest peasants as of the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a>, a time when primitive rural lifestyle was already on the wane. Chefs were instructed by the Party, however, to create the new Belarusian cuisine from scratch. And so it was. Dish names, recipes, kitchenware – all were reinvented anew, as though ten centuries of history had never existed. Only the sudden and (for many) unexpected advent of independence in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> brought an opportunity to restore these lost traditions, and a great deal still remains to be done here.</p>
<p>Modern Belarusian cuisine is still heavily influenced by its recent Soviet past, and many local restaurants feature Russian, or Soviet dishes rather than true specialties of local cuisine. Belarusians are far are more concerned with getting to know Italian, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_cuisine.html" title="Chinese cuisine">Chinese</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_cuisine.html" title="Japanese cuisine">Japanese</a> cuisine than with the careful restoration of their own culinary heritage. However, draniki (both plain and stuffed), boršč, haladnik, mačanka, zrazy, cold meat rolls, eggs stuffed with mushrooms, halubtsy, fried ‘shoved-with-a-finger’ pork sausage and bliny are likely to be found everywhere, as well as sour rye bread.</p>
<p>Typical salads are made of a fairly short list of ingredients: endless combinations of boiled beef or <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken.html" title="Chicken">chicken</a>, potato, beet, carrot, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herring.html" title="Herring">herring</a>, diced cheese, canned <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pea.html" title="Pea">peas</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweetcorn.html" title="Sweetcorn">corn</a>, canned fish, ‘crab fingers’, <a href="../../../o/n/i/Onion.html" title="Onion">onions</a> and mushrooms, and are generously seasoned with <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayonnaise.html" title="Mayonnaise">mayonnaise</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunflower_oil.html" title="Sunflower oil">sunflower oil</a>. Soups are much more authentic, both hot (<a href="../../../s/h/c/Shchi.html" title="Shchi">shchi</a>, boršč, <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorrel.html" title="Sorrel">sorrel</a> soup) and especially cold sour soups which provide cooling relief during the hot summer. Pork dishes are usually fried or stewed, with cheese or mushrooms seasoning. Beef steaks are also quite frequent, but mutton, once very popular, is almost entirely limited to Caucasian or Central Asian restaurants.</p>
<p>Historically, Belarusians had little contact with fish from the sea, and this is still evident in the cuisine. The most common sea fish (after herring, which has been the most common appetizer all along the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a> coast and its vicinity ever since the 14th century) are <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hake.html" title="Hake">hake</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/d/Cod.html" title="Cod">cod</a> and there are relatively few dishes with such fish. Much more traditional and common are lake fish, notably <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zander.html" title="Zander">zander</a>, cooked in endless ways, and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carp.html" title="Carp">carp</a> (especially the famous stuffed carp, the gefilte fisch of Jewish cuisine). <a href="../../../e/e/l/Eel.html" title="Eel">Eels</a>, smoked or stuffed, are the specialty of the lake country in the northwestern part of Belarus, adjacent to <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latvia.html" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> and Lithuania.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/r/Garnish.html" title="Garnish">Garnishes</a> are usually boiled, fried or mashed potatoes, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice.html" title="Rice">rice</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasta.html" title="Pasta">pasta</a>. Meat dishes are frequently served with bliny or draniki in rounded clay pots. While Belarusians consider kasha (cereals) as rather ordinary dishes and cook them frequently at home, they are more rarely found in restaurants.</p>
<p>Kvass is still the main local soft drink, although it is increasingly made of <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugars</a> and flavorings which imitate natural flavorings rather than with genuine rye malt. Every small town boasts a local variety of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mineral_water.html" title="Mineral water">mineral water</a>, which is probably the country’s main mineral resource. Belarusians prefer carbonated water. Local harelkas (vodkas) are very good, notably those with birch sap or various forest <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb.html" title="Herb">herbs</a>, and are popular with lovers of strong drink. Mead and many other similar drinks made of honey and spices, which were very common up to the 19th century, and then were more or less rarely found until the present, are mainly represented by krambambula, perhaps better known for its odd name than for its specific taste.</p>
