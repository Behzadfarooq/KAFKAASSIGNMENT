<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this really a "Bell inequality"</span></h2>
<p>As a mathematician, I don't know much about the physics underlying quantum mechanics. However, I believe statistics would show that the example cited has a basic flaw, viz:</p>
<p>"Each row describes one type of electron pair, with their respective hidden variable values and their probabilites N. Suppose Alice measures the spin in the a direction and Bob measures it in the b direction. Denote the probability that Alice obtains +1/2 and Bob obtains +1/2 by"</p>
<pre>
   P(a+,b+) = N3 + N4 
</pre>
<p>The probability of two independent statistical measurements is not the sum of their individual probabilities, it is their product:</p>
<pre>
   P(a+,b+) = N3*N4
</pre>
<p>An analogy can be made when Alice and Bob each have a coin. These are independent statistical devices with probability 1/2, similar to the quantum mechanical case. The probability that Alice and Bob both flip heads is not 0.5 + 0.5 as stated in the article, but 0.5 * 0.5, or 0.25.</p>
<p>With this correction, Bell's inequality would hold true in all cases, even when the directions of a, b, and c are not orthogonal.</p>
<p><a name="Probabilities" id="Probabilities"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Probabilities</span></h2>
<p>It is right that the probability of two events related by <b>AND</b> is the product of their individual probabilities. But these probabilities are the Nk (k=1,...,8) and not the P(x,y), which are related by <b>OR</b> and therefore give the sum. Let's consider P(a+,b+), for which there are the events e3 and e4 (line 3 and 4 of the table) that Alice mesures + in direction <b>a</b> and Bob + in direction <b>b</b>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>e3 = Alice mesures + - + <b>AND</b> Bob mesures - + -</dd>
<dd>e4 = Alice mesures + - - <b>AND</b> Bob mesures - + +</dd>
</dl>
<p>From that follows:</p>
<p>P(a+,b+) = P(e3 <b>OR</b> e4) = P(e3) + P(e4) = N3 + N4.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Loopholes</span></h2>
<p>I made a few edits the other day to correct the impression that experiments had conclusively backed QM. However, some more radical revision is needed. The article ought to start by saying what "Bell's Theorem" is! The section labelled Hidden Variables is really the derivation of just one version of the inequality. Somewhere in the article we need a statement of Bell's original version and of at least the main one used in actual experiments (the <a href="../../../c/h/s/CHSH_inequality_cb5c.html" title="CHSH inequality">CHSH inequality</a>). The CHSH inequality page, incidentally, might need re-writing from scratch. (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 10:27, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC))</p>
<hr />
<p>Looking at the inequality derived here, I notice that it is not the one Bell derived, nor one that is in fact used in any experiment I know of. Moreover the assumptions behind it make it completely unusable in practice. They include the assumption that there is <i>never</i> a non-detection. If the table of possible outcomes and their relative frequencies were to be expanded to include zero outcomes it would not be possible to derive the inequality. I can't prove this directly (too much algebra) but used to have a nice diagram illustrating a local realist case in which it failed. The diagram was a trivial application of my [<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9611037" class="external text" title="http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9611037" rel="nofollow">Chaotic Ball model</a>].</p>
<p>Does anyone even begin to understand the derivation of the QM formula? Could it not just be taken as read, since Bell's arguments concerned only what happens under local realist assumptions.</p>
<p>I think the article should:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. State what "Bell's Theorem" is, admitting the definition is ambiguous since Bell himself never called his result a theorem and there are many different inequalities masquerading as his.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Sketch the basic setup of a two-channel experiment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. State the critical assumption:
<dl>
<dd>There exist hidden variables set at the source and the probability of registering a + count for a given particle is determined by the hidden variable value together with the detector setting. The detection events themselve are independent, so that the probability of detection of both particles can be obtained by multiplying individual probabilities. (I need to check back to what Bell actually said here. I'm probably influenced by Clauser and Horne's 1974 paper.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4 Give Bell's own derivation of his inequality, as per the 1964 paper.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5 List other "Bell inequalities", with links to where they are derived and comments on where used, if at all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>6 Tests of Bell's theorem.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Might need another section or two. The whole task looks quite hard work. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 09:13, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've replaced the page as promised. I think I've included all significant content from its predecessor, except that I've relegated the quantum-mechanical derivation of the prediction to a separate page, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanical_Bell_test_prediction_9ae1.html" title="Quantum mechanical Bell test prediction">Quantum mechanical Bell test prediction</a>, and used the version in Shimony's new article <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/" class="external autonumber" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This uses less specialised jargon than the version in the original paper. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 09:00, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Move here:</p>
<p>I don't think most physicists find accepting the consequences of Bell's theorem to be difficult.</p>
<p><a name="Living_with_.22Bell_test_violations.22" id="Living_with_.22Bell_test_violations.22"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Living with "Bell test violations"</span></h3>
<p>Though most accept that experiments have indeed violated Bell's inequalities, few are finding it easy to live with the consequences. There are currently two main ways whereby reconciliation can be attempted between local realism and the facts. The logic of Bell's theorem itself can be disputed, or the experimental evidence challenged.</p>
<hr />
<p>I like some of the new information, however I do have two problems with the new text....</p>
<p>1) First of all, the really, really important thing that Bell showed was that quantum mechanics was incompatible with local realism. This demonstration is theoretically very important not withstanding the experimental issue over which is correct.</p>
<p>2) Second, there is the wiki rule "no original research"</p>

<p>Roadrunner: I've edited your contributions slightly. Hopefully I have not changed the meaning too much, just clarified things. There was a reason for the short introduction in my version: I wanted the table of contents to be sure of displaying on the first page when printed. It only just does so now.</p>
<p>I don't think I've included any actually "original" research. I've merely tried to tell the world some less well known facts. These days you can find experts in, say, "quantum information", who know all about the aspects of their subject that they want to use and yet have never looked at the details of a Bell test experiment and take it for granted that the basic "resource" they employ — quantum entanglement — really exists. My own studies have strongly suggested that though the correlations they use are very real, the explanation of what is happening is incorrect. See for example <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912082" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912082" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912082</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 12:27, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can't make latex use smaller fonts, but you can turn off latex. just go to your preferences. (I feel like i just finished saying this). Here is a more detailed set of instructions: click on "preferences". then click on "rendering math". then choose from among a variety of options, for example, if you choose "HTML if possible", and then the wiki will only show you rendered latex equations whenever possible. Using math tags allows everyone the maximum flexibility, so please don't revert such changes. They are useful for the wiki. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">Talk</a></dd>

<p>In reading this page, I'm struck by the same reaction I often have to Wikipedia articles - we aren't thinking enough about writing for our (non-specialist) audience, as opposed to the (specialist) writers of the article. This article remains heavy going for me, even though I have a technical education, and have been interested in the whole Bell/EPR/etc are for some decades now. I would like to draw people's attention to the following article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>N. David Mermin, <i>Is the moon there when nobody looks? Reality and the quantum theory</i>, in <b>Physics Today</b>, April 1985, pp. 38-47.</dd>
</dl>
<p>which to me remains, almost 20 years later, the best introduction to the issues at hand, and the one that best combines rigour and understandability. I would really encourage the maintainers of this article (and no, I don't have time to do it myself!) to obtain this work, review it, and see if they can't get to this level of approachability here. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 16:55, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid that you can either have "approachability" or something near to the true facts, which are complicated. Yes, I'm aware of Mermin's article, and, in its way, it is very good. But it is wrong! His thought-experiment does not allow for the kind of "stochastic" model (one in which the hidden variables predict probabilities rather than actual results) that is relevant to the real experiments. He introduces Aspect's experiments, complete with photo of the apparatus, but nowhere mentions the fact that not all "photons" are detected. The reader is left to assume that the real experiment produced infringements of Bell tests and followed the same, deterministic, rules as the thought-experiment. Yesterday I checked a more recent article by him: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207140" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207140" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207140</a>. He is still, I'm afraid, disseminating a misleading picture in which it is implied that an experiment with no non-detections has been conducted and has infringed a rigorous Bell test.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Caroline Thompson's POV and Self Promotion in this topic</span></h2>
<p>Caroline Thompson has added references to her own papers in Bell's Theorem, even though the papers have little to do with Bell's Theorem. This smacks of self-promotion.</p>
<p>In addition, she has modified the thrust of the Bell's Theorem topic to match her own non-mainstream point of view, violating Wikipedia's NPOV policy. Specifically, she states that there are no experiments supporting the quantum mechanical position over the local realistic position she espouses. In fact, the Aspect experiment (and others following) are considered definitive by most scientists in the field.</p>
<p>These deficiencies should be corrected as soon as possible.</p>

<dd>Hi DrChinese</dd>
<dd>I have never made any secret of the fact that my point of view is a local realist one, but nor have a I made any secret of the fact that I have read Aspect's PhD thesis and discovered that the raw data from one of his experiments does <b>not</b> support quantum theory. I have received no response from him to various requests for raw data from other experiments, but it is clear from the published facts that the data adjustment in his third (time-switching) experiment would be even greater, so that I can confidently predict that here too, the claim that the experiment vioates the Bell inequality is, to a local realist, suspect. The accepted point of view is based on inferior information -- just the published papers and the opinions of a very few quantum theorists and experimenters who, for reasons best known to themselves, never seem to have looked into the question of the legitimacy of his adjustment to his data. The result has been a very serious bias on behalf of the establishment in favour of quantum theory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But this is not really, I take it, what you are challenging? You are simply pointing out that I have presented the local realist point of view. [I don't think your statement that I have not discussed "Bell's Theorem" is really justified, but let that ride.] Perhaps the solution is to preface the page by a statement of my identity and point of view?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason why I reference several of my own papers is that, although they cover facts that are already available in the literature (in, for example, Pearle's 1970 paper and Clauser and Shimony's 1978 report), they explain things more clearly, as far as possible intuitively, so that considerably less specialist knowledge is needed to understand them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, though I consider it only right and proper that the Bell's Theorem page should be written by a local realist, I have left the <a href="../../../e/p/r/EPR_Paradox_e34b.html" title="EPR Paradox">EPR Paradox</a> with its quantum-theoretical bias.</dd>

Thank you for your honesty in admitting your biased POV. In addition, none of your work adds anything to understanding Bell - your work involves the postulation of significant loopholes in Bell test experiments and more significantly, denial of the existence of photons. Despite your strongly helds views, this topic should follow mainstream science. I will be reverting this topic to an earlier version prior to most of your edits this week after consulting with others on an appropriate version. I would ask you to refrain from interfering with this process.--DrChinese 00:24, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have gone ahead and placed a POV warning on the page. As it is, this page has almost nothing to do with Bell's Theorem. I count perhaps 3 good paragraphs about Bell and his famous paper. There really isn't even any meaningful presentation of the derivation of his conclusions.</p>
<p>Instead, this page is currently focused on: a) presentation of alternative formulations of the Bell Inequalities, and their deficiences; b) tests of Bell Inequalities, and their deficiences; c) the failures of the mainstream physics community, especially in regards to ignoring the local realistic view; and d) references to Caroline Thompson's non-mainstream work having nothing to do with Bell's Theorem at all.</p>
<p>I would like to solicit assistance from others out there who would be interested in helping to locate a suitable version of the page for reversion.--DrChinese 04:16, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

People ought at least to be told that when they read about a test of Bell's inquality the experiment is not in fact testing Bell's original inequality under the original restrictive conditions. The distinction between Bell's original test, or the effectively similar Wigner-d'Espagnat test, and the CHSH or the CH74 tests, and the adjustments and assumptions made in actual experiments, are critical.</dd>

<p>Interpretation is deemed necessary (by some, although there are or were notable exceptions such as perhaps <a href="../../../a/s/h/Asher_Peres_4041.html" title="Asher Peres">Asher Peres</a>) for the same reason that <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modal_logic.html" title="Modal logic">modal logic</a> might need interpretation: The abstract formulation of QM is sufficiently different form the formal structure of the physical theories preceeding it that some kind of interpretation (in the sense of semantics) is necessary. Interpretation can itself be a formal activity, in the sense that the defining semantics can be itself be given formally, such as is commonly done with programming languages or mathematical languages. To see what this means for physical theories look at for example the formal semantics that is given by the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Many-worlds_interpretation.html" title="Many-worlds interpretation">Many-worlds interpretation</a>.</p>

<p>That sounds good to me. We will probably need to take a fuller inventory of the related pages, determine which are the most significant, which have had the most damaging revisionism, and then work from there. The first clue is that there are references to Caroline Thompson's papers. It shouldn't be too hard to locate those references. I believe most of those should be removed as they do not meet Wikipedia guidelines. --DrChinese 20:39, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do hope, DrChinese, that you will allow references to my work in the Bell Test Loopholes page and a few others, or is it now your aim to suppress all information regarding loopholes? I trust not, since you have previously given me a measure of support!</dd>
<dd>How can a valid "encyclopaedia" be built if certain classes of information are excluded solely on the basis of the belief of a group of people that they are unimportant? They are nonetheless facts, and readers should surely have the right to know these facts so that they can judge their importance for themselves. Facts are facts. They are not just points of view. To suppress them is, I think, to support the quantum theory point of view to the exclusion of the local realist one, which is contrary to wikipedia policy.</dd>

<p>Caroline:</p>
<p>I personally think it makes sense for you to provide input in the Bell Test Loopholes article; you are pretty familiar with these and you could probably make your POV fit with it if you will simply restrain yourself a bit. I do not understand why you use such charged language in your presentation, basically saying you are right and everyone else is wrong. Examples: NO EVIDENCE FOR BELL VIOLATION, etc. There is plenty of evidence, not all of it is of equal caliber. Maybe there are even loopholes. Can you accept that?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, DrChinese, but the answer is "No!". On the basis of what I know there is no room for doubt: the QM claims of "violation of Bell inequalities" are effectively false since no valid inequality has ever been tested. I use charged language because this matter is of such critical importance. Theoretical physics has taken a wrong path that must be corrected otherwise it has reached a dead end. Students these days are being taught that Bell tests have been violated and, in consequence, forced to make valiant attempts at understanding the impossible. This it cruel to them, and wasteful of their intellects! It would only be justifiable if the evidence was incontrovertible and it is not.</dd>

<p>I am not trying to suppress anything, much less your voice. But Wikipedia has a POV policy for a reason; Wikipedia's says that you should sometimes write what is generally believed, not what is right. It is not the purpose of Wikipedia to act as a spot to debate (which should be done in academic circles), it is educational. All articles are summaries and putting in all POVs equally is not the purpose. There are plenty of other opinions out there besides yours and there simply isn't space to include them all. If you have a problem with the Wikipedia editorial policy, you should discuss it with them. It makes perfect sense to me.--DrChinese 23:08, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

We reduce the "Bell's Theorem" page to a very short one just stating the definition (if this can be agreed!) of the basic theorem followed by two links, one clearly labelled QM, the other local realism. These would cover the two opposing views of its current experimental status, its role in theoretical physics, its applications and philosophical consequences. I don't know what the QM pages would say, but the local realist ones would cover the actual experiments and their local realist interpretations, allowing for the loopholes.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 21:56, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He said he is willing to work with you if you stick to "an accepted account of the accepted fact". You have repeatedly said you will not do so, and so I do not see a role for you in the re-vamping process. There is NO BURDEN OF PROOF on our backs. In fact there is no burden of proof on the LR position either because it is not generally accepted. We are not going to debate you, and we do not need to "compromise" a generally accepted position. We plan to present material as you would expect it from a college textbook on the subject, in suitable summary form as to make it of use to someone who would come to Wikipedia. Since none of your own work has been accepted by the scientific community at large, there should be no references to it. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but Wikipedia is not the place for self-promotion.

Nobody, to my knowledge, disputes the content of any of my papers. Indeed, one of the main reasons given by the editors of PRL for rejecting <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903066" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903066" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903066</a> was that I was not saying anything that was not already well known! It is not yet in the text books, but would you really like to see wikipedia propagating false claims? If you restrict information relating to the loopholes, you leave the way open for convinced quantum theorists to simply say that "general opinion" is that local realism is no longer an option, and the reader has no way checking for himself. And if you don't include quite a few refs to my work, you won't be providing anywhere near as much information as he needs. As I think you realise, what I have to say about the loopholes is fact. What I have to say about the actual Bell inequalities used is also fact. Fact, not opinion, is what ought to be in both wikipedia and the text books.</dd>

<dd>Excellent, CSTAR. I noticed that the article is weighted heavily towards a discussion of the various inequalities that can be derived from Bell, as well as tests of these inequalities. There is a lot about the debate on local reality vs. QM which is probably over-emphasized here and should be largely moved elsewhere. There is relatively little about the historical context, EPR, Von Neumann, Bohm, etc. The Theorem is important, as you point out, on its own and regardless of the experimental tests. I would also like to see a little more on Bell, his comments on the paper, and its enduring value (how many times has this been cited, for example).--DrChinese 17:50, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, CSTAR. You've clearly put a lot of work into this, but the page is about Bell's Theorem, not about abstract quantum theory! The theorem does not depend on any of the special QM ideas on correlation that you introduce. When Bell says the correlation is the expectation value of the product of the outcomes, he means the ordinary statistical expectation, i.e. the sum of the probabilities times the product of "outcome values". I haven't time right now to check all your sections but feel that they add totally irrelevant QM spin to the matter. The theorem is <b>essentially</b> a local realist one. The only link with QM is in the fact that the inequalities conflict with it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 09:13, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, CSTAR. Bell and Clauser <i>were</i> dealing with standard statistics. Try re-reading their papers. But the most important thing about their inequalities was that they were concerned with how they applied in real experiments in the presence of real hidden variables. Your two sections on "correlation" and "correlation in quantum mechanics" are irrelevant to Bell's Theorem. Quantum-mechanics ideas, I repeat, don't come into the story except when you come to very end.</dd>

<dd>That's point one. Point two is that your discussion of the CHSH inequality, restricted as it is to cases where every measurement produces an outcome of +1 or -1, is no use in practice. Bell proved it in a more general form, and omitting his original assumption that correlations had to be perfect when detectors were parallel, in his 1971 paper, and this proof is reproduced in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality</a>.</dd>

<dd>Possibly you are assuming that your definition of "realism" enables the CHSH inequality to hold even when some measurements do not produce an outcome, but this is a crazy way of going about things! It completely misses the point about the function of hidden variables, and reveals, I'm afraid, ignorance re the fact that all later versions of Bell inequalities in fact apply to "stochastic" hidden variables -- ones that do not (in conjuction with the detector setting) completely determine the outcome, only its probability.</dd>

As I said, they are effectively incomprehensible. They are designed for those with a background in quantum theory. Bell's theorem was designed for realists, and his papers are not filled with QM jargon.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Standard statistics</span></h2>
<p>If the variables in the CHSH were defined on single underlying sample space, then as I pointed out the CHSH inequality is trivial. More significantly, the CHSH inequality in this case has nothing to do with locality. It doesn't matter whether Alice or Bob are sitting at the same bistro table or in different galaxies, it still is true. To emphasize the point about the single sample space, I referr to Shimoney's Stanford encyclopedia article <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/" class="external autonumber" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, he produces a model with system state (defined in some abstract way, and not as a probability measure) and several associated transition probabilities resulting from measurement. This is one formalization of locality and realism.</p>

<dd>More importantly, though, we need to say clearly what method we propose to use to estimate the various E terms. This is an issue that Bell did not address in his 1964 paper. Clauser and Horne addressed it indirectly in 1974 by saying, in effect, don't use the CHSH inequality unless you estimate the terms by dividing by the number of <b>emitted</b> pairs. But applications ever since Aspect have used an estimate in which division is by the total number of <b>detected</b> pairs. The CHSH inequality does not hold for these unless we make the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_test_loopholes.html" title="Bell test loopholes">fair sampling assumption</a>, which, as has been known since 1970 or ealier, is liable to introduce bias.</dd>

<dd>There is a difference between time averages and spatial averages; as you know this was one of initially recognized problems in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_mechanics.html" title="Statistical mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>. Besides the interesting mathematics, this also had a philosophical importance at the turn of the century because of the emergence of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operational_definition.html" title="Operational definition">operationalism</a> in works Bridgman, and earlier of Mach. Operationally, spatial averages make no sense or so at least it was thought.
<dl>
<dd>The "fair sampling" loophole in those Bell test experiments that use the CHSH inequality has absolutely nothing to do with whether we're looking at time averages or spatial ones. It has to do with the fact that when we use detectors that don't detect every single particle, the ones that are missed out may not be a random sample. When the CHSH test is used in the accepted manner, estimating each term by a ratio in which the sum of <b>observed</b> coincidences is used as denominator, we are using a "post-selection" method that can easily involve a biased sample. Please do read one of my Chaotic Ball papers (e.g. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210150" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210150" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210150</a>), or, if this goes against the grain, go back to Philip Pearle's original. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 20:41, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly. This means that a subsequence of a time averages is skewed! As I was trying to point out, in a classical probability setting this "sampling loophole" is usually accounted for by arguing that for almost all infinite sequences of trial runs, there is no sampling bias. This is the law of large numbers. However, it is still possible to argue that classically, in some weird run, there could be sampling bias. This "loophole" is hardly a serious criticism, although it does merit academic study. <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 22:54, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many of the problems in (classical) probability reduce to determining properties of spatial averages or of the state of the world by using time averages. This is even true for instance in econometrics. The issue of sampling fairness for time averages I only partially addressed that in my discussion of classical sampling where "almost all" repetitions of the experiment are fair samples by the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_large_numbers.html" title="Law of large numbers">law of large numbers</a>. In the general case, the fair sampling assumption must be made explicit: this has to be formulated as a strengthening of the assumption that the limit of averages exists; the stronger assumption is that for almost all trials the limit exists and is equal to the limit of taking a subsequence of trials.</dd>

He was saying that any "reasonable" (in the old-fashioned sense of obeying local causality) theory had to obey his inequality. Quantum mechanics is merely an <i>example</i> of one that does not. Just how and why QM fails to agree with the inequality is not that important! What matters is whether or not the real world does. It is therefore absolutely crucial to know what has been tested, and your new sections are not relevant to this.

<dd>As for whether QM is "only an example" or the case of most interest to most people is a matter of opinion. The importance of how QM fails to satisfy Bell (i.e. the nonlocality of QM) is also a matter of opinion. Just because what <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> thinks is important is different from what you think is important does not mean he is ignorant, and is no excuse for you to impugn his edits, which I think have been of high quality. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig">Talk</a> 03:09, Jan 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lethe, I appreciate your support. Indeed, I thought carefully about what I wrote and didn't much appreciate CT's reversion.</p>
<p>Comments and revisions to what I wrote are welcome. However (and this is directed to CT) please read what I wrote before plunging into reversion. Please note that many of your criticisms are baseless, and reflect the fact (which you seem to admit) that you didn't actually read what I wrote. I have already given some examples of how your comments are without any merit. Here is another one:</p>
<p>You say above</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The theorem is <b>essentially</b> a local realist one.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well yes, and if you read what I wrote, I stress that point! I thought I went to great lengths to distinguish the classical stochastic model in which CHSH can be trivially proved (and which is mostly irrelevant for this discussion) and the operational interpretation in which CHSH is true only under local realist assumptions.</p>

<p>Note that CT's earlier comments about her not interfering in other pages related to QM are irrelevant (it is my understanding that there are to be no private "preserves" in WP -- e.g., the local realist preserve and the QM preserve) and in some cases these remarks about non-interference are not true. For instance, a similar conflict occurred on the <a href="../../../e/p/r/EPR_4a87.html" title="EPR">EPR</a> article over a period of several months.

<p>What's going to be done about this page? As it is, it is nonsense! Whilst correcting a spelling mistake, I came across the following sentence in "my" part -- a sentence that, if you look at Bell's original papers, clearly expresses what Bell intended his theorem to be all about:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"If the world has underlying local hidden variables, then Bell's inequalities must be obeyed by the "coincidence counts" from a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_test_experiments.html" title="Bell test experiments">Bell test experiment</a> such as the optical one shown in the diagram ..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Compare with the present introductory sentence by CSTAR:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In foundational studies of quantum mechanics, Bell's theorem refers to a class of inequalities about correlations of real-valued random variables defined on probability spaces and extensions to other contexts where real valued-variables satisfy assumptions of locality and realism."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which is nearer to what the theorem is all about? It was never intended as an abstract mathematical theorem but as a practical tool for testing experimentally between QM and local hidden variable theories.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 17:36, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, your claim that I regard Bell's inequality as an "abstract mathematical theorem" is neither true nor relevant. Again this is a red herring.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, the sentence in "your part" doesn't say what Bell's inequalities are! The sentence you chose to criticize says exactly what it is. Moreover, it is followed by a clear example of one of those inequalities. In fact look at Shimony's opening sentence n the encyclopedia article.</dd>

<dd>Most of the above concerns second-hand <i>opinions</i> by quantum theorists about Bell's theorem. You have not addressed the fundamental reason why the world was so pleased with it -- that it provided a means for an <i>experimental test</i> of QM versus hidden variable theory. It does this by putting limits on what can be done with hidden variable theories. Your new introductory sections involve several pages of quite heavy maths that is not relevant to hidden variable theories and is sufficient to deter many readers from even attempting to understand the issues involved. They give the impression that you have to understand QM in order to understand the theorem, and this is simply not true!</dd>

<p>All you need to understand the inequalities is some basic logic and ordinary properties of probabilities.

<dd>Re the "second hand opinions" remark, I'm sorry. I was -- and still am -- frustrated by the failure of Bell's followers to take account of what both Bell in 1964 and Einstein in 1935 were trying to do. This was to find a test that discriminated between the QM nonseparable formula and the local realist separable one, preferably a test in the form of an actual experiment, not just a thought one.</dd>

<dd>Re my point about not needing to know about QM, it does not follow that you don't need to know where Bell's inequalities came from. The test between the two theories has no value unless everyone agrees it is valid test, and to decide this you need to know what assumptions were made and how it was derived. The assumptions and method behind the inequalities are purely local realist ones.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 18:47, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CSTAR, I'm afraid you still have't got anywhere near to what Bell's work was all about! In your opening para you imply that he produced an inequality that was purely of mathematical interest. No! Others did this! Kolmogorov and the like have produced mathematical inequalities, and though Bell's in fact follows from these, what he was talking about was random variables that were the <b>outcomes of Bell test experiments</b>. He was a <b>physicist</b>, not a mathematician. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 22:02, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Caroline - as I understand this discussion, you have points to make about Bell's intention in developing this kind of inequality. This would be quite legitimate content; but needs to be supported by some material reporting those intentions, rather than just imputing them to him. I haven't gone back through the page history, to see if such things have been edited out; probably you know though what has been here. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 12:11, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Reply_to_Charles_Matthews" id="Reply_to_Charles_Matthews"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply to Charles Matthews</span></h2>
<p>Charles, the problem here, is that CT makes different assertions, which all of us have been trying to address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bell's "real" intentions about his result</li>
<li>Bell's theorem has nothing to do with QM and in particular my discussion of Bell test violation is irrelevant</li>
<li>Bell's theorem is not mathematics</li>
<li>Bell's inequality has never been refuted</li>
<li>QM is not science is not ultimately supported by the evidence</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me address these briefly again:</p>
<p>1) Who knows what Bell's real intentions were. However, if you look a t the papers written in the 60's and early seventies (all his papers related to Bell's theorem and QM are available in a single volume) it's absolutely clear that QM was a central issue. His insight was to have understood that the reason QM is different is because of correlations. In th e1964 paper which intriduces his inequality, the intro specifically raises th issue of Hidden variables and interpretation of QM</p>
<p>2) ET's assertions that Bell's theorem has nothing to do with QM is an extremely unusual one, certainly not a view which is available in almost all the peer-reviewed scientific literature. As you are well aware, NPOV does <i>not</i> mean saying "some believe the moon is made of green cheese, some don't".</p>
<p>3) I never said Bell's theorem is mathematics, but certainly mathematics is relevant to physics and has been for hundreds of years. ALso I discuss the measning of probability carefully as used experimentally. My idscussion on that is based on (Readhead, 1986).</p>
<p>4) That Bell's inequality has been shown to be violated, is shown by virtually all experimental tests. CT claims that the reports of these tests incorrectly interpret the experimental evidence e.g., this quote from her:</p>

<p>Now what does CT mean by that? Is she accusing the authors of lying in their papers? Is she some kind of scientific whistleblower? If that's the case, she should stop working on WP and immediately contact the authorities. This would be one of the major crimes of the last centuries.</p>
<p>5) QM is not science but belief. Well this assertion is not directly atttributable to this dialogue, but it is a paraphrase of CT's comment on one of the Bell-related artciles talk pages (possibly CH74). Do I need to answer this? Are we going to allow Green cheesers and flat earthers and <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archimedes_Plutonium_ac8f.html" title="Archimedes Plutonium">Archimedes Plutonium</a> a forum? <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 14:59, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I suppose I was singling out #1 of these points. For myself, I'm quite happy that anything called 'theorem' be treated as mathematics. If there were some good quote from Bell, giving the context of his work as he saw it, why not have it here? I'm not in a position to comment on whether the experimental interpretation is correct. It is a familiar remark on some pieces of mathematical physics that they don't 'say' exactly what many people think they say. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 15:17, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Charles,</p>
<p>If any of us thought there was a legitimate point in looking at Bell's personal position - which is interesting - that would be fine. But CT tries to find any angle which supports her POV and emphasize it excessively. Bell probably started off a local realist... I mean, don't we all when it comes down to it? It has never occurred to me that Bell questioned what the results of actual experiments would be. If he *had* questioned what they would be (i.e. supporting LR or not), that would not make his theorem any better or any worse. CT would like us to believe that Bell's position therefore supports her POV. As CSTAR stated, it is possible to selectively quote Bell and get a wide variety of positions, all of which ultimately have nothing to do with his legacy.--DrChinese 15:38, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A small comment on "refuted": AFAIK most experiments have only ruled out the "natural" lhv theory. As explained in the paper, I mentioned on one of these zillion talk pages, unless the detector efficency can be improved, a highly contrived looking lhv theory can explain the outcome. Some progress on killing this last doubt has been made recently.</dd>
<dd>But even without these refined experiments, most physicists would judge the evidence as sufficent.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that reference. I did look at this paper. As you point out, and the authors themselves emphasize, (a) that the example is artificial (b) there purpose is to eventually construct completely airtight experimental support for Bell test violations. But the WP Bell theorem article, as it stands, very clearly acknowledges that these loopholes exist. Moreover there already is a Bell test loophole article in WP (who knows maybe even more than one). Any further discussion should be put there.<a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 18:30, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would also like to point out another element of the bias present in the article, and how it is affecting our discussions. It makes sense to reference tests of Bell's Theorem in this article. But WHY would it ever make sense to reference "loopholes" in those tests here? It is of little consequence to the Theorem itself what the actual results are! And it makes all the sense in the world to reference the "loopholes" a single time in the Bell Tests article. Harping on it here is a remnant of CT's influence. I will be making adjustments accordingly.--DrChinese 18:21, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh dear! What is science all about? All I'm saying is that the experimental facts and also Bell's inequalities are part of our common heritage, not the private property of quantum theorists! Bell's inequalities put limits on what <b>local realism</b> can achieve. They put no limits on QM.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And, of course, is it not possible that you are suppressing the very information needed by a new Keppler? As I see it, the situation parallels that in cosmology, where way back before Christ we had Aristarchus, with his modern, heliocentric, universe. Then we had Ptolemy with his epicycles and whatever. Had Keppler not returned to Aristarchus' idea and gone back and checked the facts -- discovered that the orbits were, after all, not circles but ellipses -- we'd have been stuck with Ptolemy to this day.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I know QM has, in most areas, a lot more experimental support than Ptolemy's theory ever had, but it shares the property of failing to provide causal explanations. And, as it happens, in this key area of quantum entanglement, the experimental support is inconclusive.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Anyway, to conclude my lecture, I suggest you think hard about whether or not you are really acting as scientists when you defend "entanglement". As Koestler wrote re Aristarchus (p 51 of “The Sleepwalkers: a history of Man's changing vision of the Universe”, Penguin Arkana 1989):
<dl>

<dd>The issue at stake here is whether or not the real world makes sense! I think you will find that a majority of scientists in fact take that for granted. However, if you persistently misrepresent Bell's theorem and the experiments that are supposed to support it, you will be preventing the said majority from access to the facts that would enable them to make sense of it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">But in real experiments outcomes are more often zero than +-1</span></h2>
<p>CSTAR, I started to edit the page to replace the term "correlation" (which necessarily means the standard statistical kind) by "quantum correlation", but came across statements that are either just plain false or (as I've tried to say many times) irrelevant. They hinge around the fact that in real experiments outcomes are often zero, which is the reason Clauser and Horne in 1974 produced what should have been the definitive version of the Bell test -- one in which non-detections simply don't matter. If you read the 1969 CHSH paper carefully, you will find that test they actually recommend is not what is now known as the "CHSH test" but the 1974 version, relying on comparing counts with polarisers both sides with those with one or other or both absent.</p>
<p>Anyway, the relevance of the above to your two sections is that the following is wrong:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Notice however, that the definition of quantum correlation makes sense more generally, regardless of whether or not there is an underlying probability space on which the variables <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> are defined. The important conditions are that</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The experiment which produces the values <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> be repeatable;</li>
<li>That on each trial of the experiment, both variables <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> can be observed."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I added the qualification "[which is not actually the case in real optical Bell test experiments]" then realised that the result was complete nonsense! What's the point of making this condition only to say that it is <b>never</b> met?</p>
<p>Your section goes on to say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The proof of the CHSH inequality for random variables taking only values -1 or +1 is trivial: for each sample point,</dd>
</dl>

We don't need either a lecture on statistics, especially when that statistics contains unreasonably abstruse jargon, concepts that are not covered in any of the standard expositions of Bell's theorem, and generally serves no purpose other than to mislead the reader into thinking he can't hope to understand what the theorem is all about.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks CSTAR, I'll have to rephrase this. What I mean is that <b>once the hidden variable has been fixed</b>, that covers all the correlated factors. Given lambda, this determines the probability of detection at A and the probability at B. The detections at A and B are conducted independently, i.e. by detectors that have no connection with ("are independent of") each other. The consequence is that you can apply the usual rule of probability theory and multiply the two singles probabilities to obtain the joint probability. This is the standard assumption underlying hidden variable theories. Bell explains very carefully in one of his papers just what assumptions are involved. I haven't got it to hand but will look it up. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 22:08, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

And, incidentally, Bell's description of his basic experiment is not restricted to just the two setting on each side! Some versions of Bell test (the "visibility" test, for example) require that you look at the whole "coincidence curve", i.e. the plot of coincidence rates for a range of values for the settings on each side. [Strictly speaking, we should be speaking not of coincidence <b>curves</b> but coincidence <b>surfaces</b>, to allow for the possibility that we don't have "rotational invariance" -- See <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_test_loopholes.html" title="Bell test loopholes">Bell test loopholes</a>.] Additionally, if you don't investigate more than just the "Bell test angles" (two on each side) there is no way you can test for fair sampling by the only method agreed by both quantum theorists and local realists, by checking for constancy of the total coincidence counts.</p>
<p>And, while I'm about it, what does the following mean?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There remain a number of technical details that need to be attended to. The first one is that the subsequences of actual measurements taken have the same limits of averages as the entire sequence. Since in each one of these averages, only a subset of values is actually observed, we need to assume that the each expression has the same value when taken on the subsequence of observed values.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I take it that what you mean is just that "<a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_test_loopholes.html" title="Bell test loopholes">fair sampling</a>" assumption has to be made, i.e. we have to assume that the sample of detected pairs is a fair sample of those emitted. Why not say so? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 12:05, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Well yes, that's what I tried to explain in one of these zillion talk pages. It is the fair sampling assumption. That's why in one earlier version I discussed at length the probabilistic (= global hidden variable) fair sampling assumption. Fair sampling should link to some notion of fair sampling in <i>statistics</i>, <b>not</b> to Bell test loopholes. That's why the concept is not mentioned.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this is just not appropriate! "Fair sampling" in the context of the Bell tests has nothing to do with the ordinary selection of a fair sample by a statistician! The samples are selected by Nature, and the experimenters have little control over them. The failure of the assumption is due to the failure of real detectors to "fairly" (with respect to the hidden variable space) record detections. The detectors are being asked to decide whether they are receiving a signal with a higher '+' component or a higher '-' one, and when the signal is weak they are more likely to be unable to decide, i.e. to register nothing. The unfairness does not show up in the singles counts since we can't look at just one hidden variable value at a time, but it does leave a trace in the coincidence counts: it causes the total to vary as you vary the detector settings. <b>This</b> is what "fair sampling" is all about in the Bell tests. I don't know of any parallel to this in ordinary statistical sampling.</dd>

<p>You really are confused about the interpretation of X and Y! Look at the text preceding your first equation. You say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As an example consider a composite system consisting of two photons prepared in a special state one of which is sent to Alice and the other to Bob. Alice and Bob then each measure polarization of their photon along one of two perpendicular axes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is simply not true. In CHSH tests that use polarisation the angles used are, e.g., 0 and 45 deg for Alice, 22.5 and 67.5 deg for Bob. X and Y are not orthogonal. They <i>would</i> be orthogonal in tests using spin-1/2 particles but you are not talking about these.</p>
<p>In other words, a change of notation is <i>essential</i>. X and Y are not suitable for the job.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. I changed <i>the example</i> to conform to the EPR example that follows below in the article. The notation remains unchanged. <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 13:59, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In answer to your question in the discussion in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_test_experiments.html" title="Bell test experiments">Bell test experiments</a> as to what is wrong with using X and Y, one part of the answer is that you <b>can</b> use it but only if you give the proper definition at the time. It is only later, when we come to the section on the derivation of the quantum-mechanical formula, that we have it clearly stated that:
<dl>
<dd>"The operators XB, YB correspond to B's spin measurements along skew directions in the xz-plane."</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But therein lies the rub! XB and YB are essentially <i>quantum mechanical</i> concepts. What is needed in an introduction to the Bell inequalities is just ordinary angles. We're talking about ideas that are intended to be applied to real experiments in which detectors are physically set at particular angles.</dd>

<dd>Surely the requirement to write the page from the QM point of view is not so strong that we have to make it <b>completely</b> inaccessible to local realists!

The page as it stands does not even introduce the <a href="../../../h/i/d/Hidden_variable_theory.html" title="Hidden variable theory">hidden variables</a> that were an essential feature of his model.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Effect of zero outcomes on formula</span></h2>
<p>We all seem agreed the CHSH inequality holds equally when there are some zero values, but it is clear that it assumes the use full value for 'N' in estimates based on formula (2). It assumes we divide by the number of pairs we attempt to measure, not the number that we measure and which give a non-zero outcomes for both Alice and Bob. [The notation is still, incidentally, very confusing!] This, of course, is what lies at the heart of the detection loophole and I don't understand the explanation given of how to get around it -- how to justify use of formula (2) using the total observed coincidences (i.e. just the non-zero outcomes when both sides are non-zero at once) instead of N.</p>
<p>In their 1974 paper, Clauser and Horne say firmly that their CHSH test cannot be used unless N is known. As has been known since Pearle's time (1970), it can only be used replacing N by the observed coincidence total if it can safely be assumed that the non-detections all occur purely at random. This, to a local realist, is incredibly unlikely!</p>
<p>I don't see what can be done about it in the page, since the policy seems to be to avoid mention of "hidden variables" and the whole issue of fair sampling revolves around the concept. What we are talking about is whether or not we have a fair sample of the hidden variable values. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 10:27, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am unaware of having deleted anything on this talk page! If I did it was entirely unintentional. I'm sorry, too, about the personal reference in my last entry. It just happened to be the most relevant place to comment further on the use of X and Y. Where did you get the idea from? What have you got against using Bell's own notation? I don't much like that either but at least it does not come accompanied by any firm conventions! X and Y do. When talking about directions (which is the case here), they are <i>assumed</i> to be orthogonal. Indeed, when you come to the QM section, you take this for granted: clearly x, y and z are an orthogonal set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unless a few changes are made (as a minimum, inclusion of at least one derivation by something like Bell's own method, i.e. a method involving hidden variables, and inclusion of a statement of the actual formula used in the CHSH test, i.e. one dividing not by N but by the total coincidence count) the current page deserves a pov tag. It is strongly biased towards QM -- so strongly that it no longer represents "human knowledge". It does not at present satisfy the wikipedia requirement set out in the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a> page:</dd>

<dd>Caroline, why are you continuing this debate when it was already resolved against you and your biased POV? QM is the standard for the science of electrodynamics and physical theory. Therefore, it is in fact a neutral POV by definition. Your attempts to insert your revisionism into this area of Wikipedia are not welcome, as should be evident to even the most obtuse person. Attacking CSTAR's hard work - which was required as a direct result of your actions - is not only wrong, it is the ultimate irony. If some fine-tuning of the presentation is required, that would be normal and can be done more efficiently once you back off. Maybe you should get involved in the debate about whether the speed of light is a constant... anything that results in your leaving this area alone so we can finish cleaning up the mess you created.--DrChinese 16:12, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The facts I'm asking to be included are just facts, essentially neutral, and in any event, as I've said many times, surely a neutral point of view is not the same thing as one that is unintelligible to anyone other than a trained quantum theorist? Don't we want wikipedia to be as far as possible accessible to the general reader? Bell's own work was. The reader of his papers is free to skip the QM parts and will still come away with a clear idea of what his theorem is all about. And, in case you hadn't noticed, it's all about hidden variables. Where do these feature in the current page? Only as casual links to other pages. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 09:20, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Not only bad notation: the derivation of the CHSH inequality is wrong!</span></h2>
<p>The derivation currently presented for the CHSH inequality entirely misses the point and is wrong. It does not apply either to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell%27s_original_inequality.html" title="Bell's original inequality">Bell's original idea</a> or to the actual <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_test_experiments.html" title="Bell test experiments">Bell test experiments</a>! [I had been concentrating my attention on the use of poor notation and have only just got around to looking at the logic.]</p>
<p>The statement that Bell test trials consist of "An infinite sequence of values XAn, YAn, XBn, YBn, where n denotes the trial number" is simply not true, and cannot legitimately be used as a starting point.</p>
<p>Bell's idea was that by assuming <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_hidden_variable_theory.html" title="Local hidden variable theory">hidden variables</a>, with the source being at any one time in a given state and with a fixed probability distribution for those states, one can derive the inequality as a statistical result. The discussion currently given can at best be regarded as an argument for its plausibility, since in the actual experiments there is no meaning to the index n. As implied under "Remark 1", the actual Bell tests comprise a set of subexperiments, each investigating one setting for detector A, another for detector B. It is physically impossible to look at all four combinations of settings at once. [Even in Aspect's or Weihs'experiments, where the choice between the two settings on each side is random, they cannot physically be observed simultaneously.] The idea that we can somehow ensure that all the expressions have the "same value when taken on each one of the ... subsequences" is just wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Valid derivations are given in the <a href="../../../c/h/s/CHSH_inequality_cb5c.html" title="CHSH inequality">CHSH inequality</a> page. They employ (as far as possible) the standard notation -- that of Bell, Clauser and Horne's original papers -- which differs markedly from that of the current page.</p>
<p>Other faults with the page that urgently require correction include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bell's orginal inequality is not even stated</li>
<li>The diagrams print poorly</li>
<li>Some of the Latex expressions over-run the line so the end is not printed</li>
</ol>
<p>Drastic revision is needed. My own suggestion remains that we base the new version on the one before CSTAR's intervention. I don't know where CSTAR got his material from but it is evidently not an authoritative one. No authoritative version would attempt a derivation based on an index n and not on hidden variables. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 09:08, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've looked over some of this talk page change history and found that your problem edit made at 08:56, 29 Mar 2005 almost certainly occurred because you started editing on a very outdated revision of the page, that of 20:28, 9 Feb 2005 rather than the current version of the page (which was 10:09, 20 Mar 2005).

<p>On the <i>article</i> page itself you have had similar problems (one symptom of which was your "links jinx"). At 18:40, 16 Feb 2005 you made an edit based on the out-of-date revision of 23:10, 9 Feb 2005, thus losing these edits:</p>

<dd>As CT fails to understand, there are many different formalizations of local realism. However, it should be now abundantly clear that it is pointless to maintain any discussion on the matter.

<dd>CSTAR, the issue is far from resolved. All that has happened is that a few people who, for one reason or another, believe quantum theory to be correct have failed to look carefully at the logic in your "correlation" section and failed to answer my point re the impossibility of defining your index 'n'. Nobody has commented at all. I assure you that whatever your source for this "derivation" it is in error. Valid derivations of the <a href="../../../c/h/s/CHSH_inequality_cb5c.html" title="CHSH inequality">CHSH inequality</a> are available, so there is no justification for including this invalid one.

<dd>

<dd>The article by Streater adds nothing new, merely re-iterating what we already know: that Bell's theorem proves QM to be incompatible with the existence of hidden variables. He is wrong, though, in saying:
<dl>
<dd><i>" ... the work of Aspect, Dalibrand and Roger (1982) shows that for some systems of two correlated photons, the best experimental estimates for certain spin correlations violate the Bell inequalities, and so cannot be explained by classical probability theory, with or without hidden variables"</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>without qualifying this by mentioning the existence of loopholes. As was at one time (in wikipedia pages now effectively erased) made clear, one of Aspect's experiments (his second) was subject to the fair sampling loophole, the remaining two at risk of severe bias due to the <a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903066" class="external text" title="http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903066" rel="nofollow">subtraction of accidentals</a>. If these factors are taken into account, we see that it is possible that QM is in fact wrong in this area and that the opinion that <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_hidden_variable_theory.html" title="Local hidden variable theory">hidden variables</a> have been ruled out does not rest on solid experimental evidence. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 10:33, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fear that though the page is now more accurate, it is far from deserving inclusion in an encyclopaedia. It needs drastic tidying up. And that notation is doomed to cause endless confusion! Why use X and Y as if they are going to correspond to the two sides when defining correlation, then switch back a few lines later to XA and YA corresponding to two different settings on the <i>same</i> side? Why use X and Y here at all, when there is later a further cuase for confusion, with x, y and z assumed to be orthogonal axes? Though Bell's notation may not have been the best possible, it was better than this. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 08:58, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dr Chinese, you may well not care about my POV, but a considerable number of people do! <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stewart_Bell_a43b.html" title="John Stewart Bell">John Bell</a> himself would have been among them. He knew what he was doing when he derived his inequality on the basis of the assumption of hidden variables. As I see it, there were two reasons for requiring them:
<ul>
<li>the whole debate, ever since the <a href="http://fangio.magnet.fsu.edu/~vlad/pr100/100yrs/html/chap/fs2_14005.htm" class="external text" title="http://fangio.magnet.fsu.edu/~vlad/pr100/100yrs/html/chap/fs2_14005.htm" rel="nofollow">1935 EPR paper</a> had been about the existence of hidden variables (Einstein's "elements of reality"), and</li>
<li>he was creating an inequality that would be <i>testable</i> and he knew that it would only be possible in any one trial to measure one property on each side.</li>
</ul>

<dd>As it happens, it is possible that he himself never quite understood what the detection loophole was all about (witness his much-quoted statements about not thinking higher efficiency would fail to support QM), but others such as Philip Pearle did (see Physical Review D, 2, 1418-25 (1970)), and the only way to understand the problem is in relation to hidden variables. This, I'm sure, is the reason why many people dismiss it: they cannot understand it because the only derivation they have seen of a Bell inequality is one such as that in the present page, which CSTAR states follows Peres and others. It seems clear that these people were wrong. Since Bell was right and this is supposed to be about his theorem, wikipedia surely <i>must</i> present a correct derivation? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 09:11, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She appears to understand his thinking from the grave. And it doesn't matter, because there is really no issue with Bell's Theorem. It is the experiments CT has the problems with. So leave this area alone, Caroline, we have already settled the issue and further interference is not appreciated. Cstar, I didn't mean to interrupt your development of the topic but I don't see any reason to give Caroline any free advertising in this area. I am certainly happy to make sure the material follows Bell if that is a question, but Bell's Theorem has nothing to do with purported loopholes.--00:16, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pardon me, but Bell's theorem surely has everthing to do with Bell's inequality, and it surely makes a difference whether you talk about a valid version or one that is valid only under assumptions that can easily be shown to be unreasonable. This is what I'm concerned about -- that the present page does not give Bell's original test, does not give a valid derivation of the test it does give (the CHSH test) and does not explain properly how the test is applied in practice or how the known loophole re fair sampling actually works. Of course, a lot of people don't know how it works, but this is no excuse in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 08:49, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough, but I thought you had agreed that the current derivation of the CHSH inequality should be replaced by one that everyone agrees is valid? While we're about it, we might as well improve the notation, get back to Bell's definition of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_correlation.html" title="Quantum correlation">quantum correlation</a> and make a few other improvements, possibly relegating the section on the quantum-mechanical prediction to a separate page. This would be in deference to Bell. His contribution was to provide the local realist inequality. The quantum-mechanical theory was already known.</dd>

<dd>What if I <i>have</i> created another page or two? Since the pages I create are factually correct and are more comprehensible than ones such as the current Bell's theorem page, I really don't see why I should help you to remove them! The quantum correlation page is neutral, merely stating Bell's own definition and giving a few words to put it in context. It is equivalent to that given in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell%27s_theorem.html" title="Bell's theorem">Bell's theorem</a> but put in words and so more readily digestible to the general reader. As you know, I consider the present page to be far too mathematical, most of the mathematics being irrelevant to Bell's theme, which was concerned with the fact that under <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_realism.html" title="Local realism">local realism</a> there are natural limits on the values of certain functions of coincidence rates in a suitably designed experiment. The mathematics needed to establish these limits comprises no more than a little basic probability theory, though, of course, it is the assumptions behind the maths that matters.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This Page Is Awful</span></h2>
<p>Although I don't agree with Caroline Thompson's cranky ideas, I do whole-heartedly agree with her on one point. This page is AWFUL. In fact, out of every page I've ever seen on wikipedia, the Bell's Theorem page is the worst, by at least an order of magnitude. Was this page supposed to be a practical joke?</p>
<p>First of all, you've lost all your readers who aren't physicists by paragraph 5. This is a shame. It's certainly possible to do a very respectable job describing Bell's Theorem that is both factual and accessible to the general public. Whoever wrote this nonsense has completely and utterly jettisoned the non-technical audience. No regard has been made for them.</p>
<p>Second of all, I have to say, even for a technical audience, it's really not well written. It's dry, mechanical, and uses godawful notation. Even I find it abstruse. You can pick up a copy of "Quantum [Un]speakables From Bell to Quantum Information", open it to any random page, and you'll find text easier to consume than this page. And those guys are world experts!</p>
<p>If you REALLY want to help wikipedia out, and benefit the internet community, toss the whole thing out. Contact Professor Shankar, Professor Griffiths, Professor Liboff, or Professor O'Hanian and ask them to donate a treatment for Bell's Theorem. Not only do those guys know how to write, but they know how to write TO AN AUDIENCE, which is completely lacking here.</p>
<p>If anybody wants THIS level of detail in Bell's Theorem, they either know the subject already, have a suitable book on their shelves, or can go to any number of excellent resources on the web that can be found via Google.</p>
<p>Please -- instead of arguing over the merits of Caroline Thompson's wierd ideas, why don't you:</p>
<p>1. Spend a LOT of time discussing who you want to write for. Who is your audience?</p>
<p>2. Make a draft of precisely which aspects of Bell's Theorem you want to cover, being mindful that this needs to be a general treatment for a wide audience.</p>
<p>3. Go ahead and write.</p>

<p>Hello. That's pretty strong criticism! Here are some comments in reply to your points, presented in no particular order:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Well I wrote much of the page, not I must say, with any great enthusiasm, as should be evident from the copious comments on this and related pages.</li>
<li>No, this page is not a joke.</li>
<li>Referring to something is nonsense is clearly not helpful; indeed if you think it is nonsense, delete it or shorten it to one or two sentences. I agree Wikipedia should not contain nonsense, but it would be more helpful if you supplied a more substantive replacement (at least in the near future-- see my suggestion in (7) below).</li>
<li>If anybody else wants to write the article, fine by me. But it appears that aside form Caroline Thompson, there haven't been may takers. I doubt Griffiths or any of the others you mentioned are salivating at the prospect of replacing this article, but who knows?</li>
<li>Re: Your comment <i>Even I find it abstruse.</i> Not knowing who <i>I</i> refers to in this case, or more to the point the backgound of <i>I</i> is hardly any help.</li>
<li>Re: Your comment <i>out of every page I've ever seen on wikipedia, the Bell's Theorem page is the worst, by at least an order of magnitude.</i> . Either you haven't seen many pages in Wikipedia, or you're exaggerating.</li>
<li>Re:<i>You can pick up a copy of "Quantum [Un]speakables From Bell to Quantum Information", open it to any random page,</i> That may indeed be the case. You could write a useable summary based on your reading to (eventually) replace the current article which I assume you will feel the urge to delete or drastically reduce as quickly as possible. I assure you I will not revert any reductions.</li>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Yes, you are right. I apologize</span></h4>
<p>Yes, you are right. My criticism should've been more constructive, and not contain hyperbole, which is completely inappropriate. I do apologize. But honestly, this IS one of the more technically "out there" pages I've seen on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should strive to write an article that would be of benefit to a high school student doing a report on quantum mechanics can understand. I'm not advocating free of detail, but the notice at the top of the page should really be changed. Some of the technical details _need_ to go.</p>
<p>I'll put my money where my mouth is. I'm handing in my dissertation Monday, and will probably spend (no more than) a month dealing with edits. When I'm done, I'll try edit this (off line because I don't know the protocol of changing the main page yet) and send a RFC.</p>
<p>Again, please accept my sincere apologies. Sometimes it's difficult to remember there are human beings on the other side of this monitor, and my dissertation has been one of the biggest emotional roller coasters I've ever seen. If I knew back then what a PITA it would be, I never would've done it in the first place.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Greetings and congratulations on your dissertation, may it go smoothly. This is a situation that often is reached in Wikipedia - namely, a subject that has a great deal more information than a basic article would have. What we may need is, in essence, an overview which would be the first section on the page, targetted, as you suggest, at someone who wants to grasp the idea and why it is important, and then the more technical presentation in the rest of the article. I'm sure that your efforts will be warmly supported in providing the "layman's introduction" that the topic desperately needs. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 17:51, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A major problem with any article on Bell's theorem is that the content does depend so much on the intended audience. One can write something that will help students with their essays at school level <b>or</b> something that will help them with essays at university <b>or</b> something that will enable them to make a reasonable stab at understanding the physics of the actual experiments. The latter is what I attempted, based on study of many experimental reports, including Aspect's PhD thesis coverage of his three famous Bell tests. If you want the first option, you can take something such as Nick Herbert's book. I haven't read this myself but gather that it makes the subject sound fairly straightforward. Unfortunately, though, it seems to be a poor introduction for anyone trying to understand what goes on in the actual experiments. For this, it would be better to stick to John Bell's own papers, and give a ref a comprehensible one on the detection loophole. For the latter, I would (of course!) recommend my own.

<p>Hate to agree with Caroline, but Bell's theorem is one of those topics that is of interest to both college students with no background in QM and also to PhD's who have years of experience. The technical content should not be gutted just so that some casual reader who hasn't a clue about quantum mechanics can read this. As to its being "too technical", that's unadulterated bunkum. There are many thousands of far far far more technical articles on WP; try <a href="../../../b/r/s/BRST_formalism_128b.html" title="BRST formalism">BRST formalism</a> on for size; any article under <a href="../../../q/u/a/Category%7EQuantum_field_theory_891f.html" title="Category:Quantum field theory">Category:Quantum field theory</a>, or, for that matter, almost each and every article under <a href="../../../m/a/t/Category%7EMathematics_3089.html" title="Category:Mathematics">Category:Mathematics</a>, with few exceptions. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:35, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea! Let's hope the introduction makes it quite clear that <b>Bell's inequality</b> is something that really, in itself, has nothing to do with quantum mechanics at all. It is simply a mathematical consequence of a few "local realist" assumptions. <b>Bell's theorem</b> states that this inequality can be violated under QM, but the casual reader does not, I think, need to know why. What he may well be interested in, though, is whether or not the experiments really do support QM, given that it conflicts with local realism. I trust the improved page will not play down the doubts on this score. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroline_Thompson_2b5e.html" title="User:Caroline Thompson">Caroline Thompson</a> 08:32, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
