<dd>The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 18 clear "delete" votes, 12 clear "keep" votes (2 anons and 1 probable troll discounted) and 2 "merge" votes. While there is a clear majority to delete, there is not the overwhelming concensus necessary for deletion. The decision defaults to keep in some form.</dd>

<p>GRider asked me to look at this article.</p>
<p>In terms of policy, there was no clear consensus to delete the article. The admin who deleted it did not act wrongly however, it was a judgment call, and there is no policy that says that once a non-frivilous article is deleted, an article of the same name can't be reposted with significant new material. Remember, there is a stated policy on Wikipedia not to delete if their is any doubt.</p>
<p>As to the article as it stands. it is pretty thin. I think GRider should have a reasonable opportunity to bring it up to a state where it tells us more than that the school is there and simple mundane details. Is the school significant in teaching any of its majors? Does it have special ed courses of significance? And so on. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 20:48, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the contrary, the admin who ignored the established procedural standards, which is to <i>keep</i> with such a vote, <i>did</i> act wrongly. Admins don't have the authority to delete articles at will. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 12:20, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>On the other hand, GRider was a sockpuppet created to vote keep on articles, wasn't he? That being the case, shouldn't the vote be re-counted? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:29, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In reply to Zero, Rossami did nothing wrong in being bold, and he did not delete the article--indeed he made it plain that his motive was to try to satisfy the majority opinion while not running the chance of losing information (which under GFDL includes editing history).</p>
<p>In reply to Jayjg, I think <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">User:Rossami</a> said that he discounted "2 anons and 1 probable troll" and ended up with 12 keeps and 18 deletes. Even if Rossami did count GRider's vote, this leaves 11 keeps and 18 deletes, which doesn't even satisfy a generous standard of 2/3 for rough consensus. In practice many of us would want considerably more than 2/3 in favor of deletion before we deleted any article on VfD. But I don't want to pre-empt Rossami, he may have an entirely different take on the matter. Why don't you contact him? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:46, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please stop redirecting this article, it is effectively deleting content contrary to the VfD decision that found there was no consensus to the delete the article.

<dd>As the article is now, it doesn't seem to me to be worthy of reinstatement. Can't the advocates of keeping it as a separate article do something to make the article more useful and worthwhile? There is a prejudice in Wikipedia against including high schools or below unless there is something that sets them apart from the tens of thousands of other high schools. Can we do better than the name of the principal and the majors that are like the majors of any other high school? We don't even have the school's address. Notable alumni: "Mr. Biggs" of one of how many "KISS-FMs" across the U.S.? We don't have Mr. Biggs' real name, when he graduated and why he is notable other than being a disk jockey. Compare with <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus_Hall_High_School_1262.html" title="Erasmus Hall High School">Erasmus Hall High School</a>. I don't mean to make people who go to the high school feel bad, but if you can't dig up more than you have, how can you expect the article to stay? -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia"><i>explains it all</i> ®</a> 16:31, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This article is not great, but it is more useful to an interested reader than a redirect to a page that has nothing on the school. Personally I don't have access to the resources to improve this article. When I write articles on high schools most of my information comes from newspaper archives, which are generally subscription services. I have access to pretty much all the Canadian sources, but not U.S. ones. If anyone has access to the <i><a href="../../../o/m/a/Omaha_World-Herald_2b02.html" title="Omaha World-Herald">Omaha World-Herald</a></i> archives I'm sure they could create a decent page. Anyone from the area could also probably find material at their local library. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 17:00, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am okay with you contesting the decision to redirect the article but it is not appropriate to say that the redirect was in any way "contrary to the VfD decision". Redirects do not destroy content. Content is preserved in the page history. The fact that the decision defaulted to "keep" says nothing about which form of "keep" is best for this particular article. Redirect is a form of keep. We do not ask VfD voters to explicitly vote between "keep as is" or "keep as modified". Some voters volunteer that information but it's not a requirement and, as such, should be used very cautiously when cited outside the strict context of the specific VfD discussion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 17:23, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A redirect and merge is a form of keep, redirecting to an article but adding none of the content is a form of deletion. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 20:41, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>At the time the re-direct was done, the information in the article <i>was</i> merged. Subsequent to that people undid the re-direct and added to this article, rather than putting new information in the re-direct article as they should have. If it's a form of deletion, it's a self-inflicted one. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:19, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
