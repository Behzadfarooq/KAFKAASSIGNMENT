<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fair use rationale for Image:Jdodge.jpeg</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Jdodge.jpeg</b>. The image description page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Linking to Categories</span></h2>
<p>I made a small edit to your userpage and feel that as it's a little unusual to do this, you should be told <i>why</i> some complete stranger edited your userpage:</p>
<p>When you hard-link to a category (such as: [[Category:Albums]] your page gets included into that category. You need to soft-link to it like this: [[:Category:Albums]]. The colon keeps your page from being auto-included into the category.</p>
<p>Just a small thing. Happy editing.--<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherjs_dca5.html" title="User:Fisherjs">Fisherjs</a> 18:59, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! The only info in the infobox was her birth date (which is in the text of the article) and age (which will change for as long as she lives, necessitating annual editing). It simply gave the article a cluttered look, so I removed it.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm opposed to the use of infoboxes in general. If Wikipedia truly is to be considered an encyclopedia, then the articles should contain all the necessary data. An infox reminds me of <i>USA Today</i>, with its charts and graphics designed for people too busy to read the complete articles. If a Wiki article includes all the pertinent details, why include an infobox? It seems redundant and not in keeping with the concept of an encyclopedia. I'm very sorry they weren't nipped in the bud when first introduced. But that's just my opinion . . . <a href="../../../s/f/t/User%7ESFTVLGUY2_becf.html" title="User:SFTVLGUY2">SFTVLGUY2</a> 17:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IMDb template</span></h2>
<p>Hi -</p>
<p>I notice you've been using the {{<a href="../../../i/m/d/Template%7EImdb_b0cc.html" title="Template:Imdb">imdb</a>}} template on some articles lately. Some of the links you've tried to create won't work; the ID number should just be the <i>number</i>, don't include the "<tt>nm</tt>": <tt>{{imbd|0816669}}</tt>. You also don't have to include the name unless you want it to appear differently in the link than it does for the title of the article; for instance: <tt>{{imdb|name=José Molina|0596711}}</tt> is useful, as the article title is <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Molina_%28writer%29_5b85.html" title="José Molina (writer)">José Molina (writer)</a>.</p>
<p>You might also want to review <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion</a> (pay particular attention to criterion #7 under "Articles") and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> before you create any more "stub" articles for actors. Unless you specifically assert the importance of the subject in the article, the article could be deleted quickly by any administrator.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Editors that don't provide an edit summary tend to look like vandals</span></h2>
<p>I have noticed you commonly don't enter an edit summary. This causes me problems. When I patrol for vandalism, I use the summary to make a preliminary decision on whether or not the post is a vandal edit or not. If the summary is present (or at least a section header, the part inside the /* */), I commonly decide the edit is legit and move on.</p>
<p>However, if no edit summary is available, I typically resort to loading the diff for the edit. This takes time. For that reason, if your edits are all valid, I ask that you provide edit summaries. For more on how to enter an edit summary, please read <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">Help:Edit summary</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is not just me that appreciate having edit summaries. When you omit your summary, you may be telling various bots that you are vandalizing pages. For this reason, please consider providing that summary. It is very important.</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent posting of an anonymous editor to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">Administrators intervention against vandalism</a>. In the future though, when reporting IP addressed to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, please make sure that they have had a final warning in the recent past. Due to the nature of IP addresses, spans of time between edits may indicate different users. Being it is possible that the currently vandalizing user did not get a true final warning they are often not be blocked. To remedy this, please make an effort to ensure that all vandals reported to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> have an appropriate, and recent, final warning. The most common final warnings are {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../b/v/_/Template%7EBv_74e1.html" title="Template:Bv">bv</a>}}.

<dd>As a genearl rule, if there is more than a 12 hour gap between there last final wrnings and the most recent edit, i will very often not block. IP addresses can change frequently and there is no assurance that it is the same person. In short, make sure they vandals have had at least 1 final warning in the current calendar day before reporting them to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>.

<dd>No problem. it generally is not alot harder but a vandal is more likley to slip through the cracks. When the <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> gets back logged i go through them fast and if they havent been warned, they most often get thrown out!

<p>I just read your post at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> talk. Named editors and anon editors are very different. Named editors we know they are the same person. In the case you provided that named editor could have been report for a number of reasons and a final warning may not have been required (especially because of there username). With anon users, it should be required (although some administrators choose to enforce blocks without them). If you have any further questions I would be glad to answer them for you! Hope this helps.
