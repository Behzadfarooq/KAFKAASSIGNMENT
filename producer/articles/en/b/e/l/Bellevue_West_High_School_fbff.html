<p>The school's Marching Band, the Thunderbirds, is under the direction of Byron Braasch. Under the direction of Braasch, the band has become one of the top bands in the region. For example, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> it won 5 competitions: Starfest in <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux_City%2C_Iowa_16af.html" title="Sioux City, Iowa">Sioux City, Iowa</a>, the Festival of Bands in <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux_Falls%2C_South_Dakota_748a.html" title="Sioux Falls, South Dakota">Sioux Falls, South Dakota</a>, Valleyfest in <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moines%2C_Iowa_3123.html" title="Des Moines, Iowa">Des Moines, Iowa</a>, <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omaha%2C_Nebraska_e00c.html" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha</a> Public Schools invitational overall sweepstakes, and the Festival of Champions at <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Missouri_State_University_9f6c.html" title="Central Missouri State University">Central Missouri State University</a>.</p>
<p>The 2001 show was "Live From the Casbah!" The band won all five regional competitions they competed in (Sioux City, Des Moines, Omaha, NSBA in Omaha, and Warrensburg). Their final performance was at Bands of America Nationals in Indianapolis. They reached the semi-finals and finished 32nd in the country. The band also won the Espirit de Corps award for sportsmanship at the National competition.</p>
<p>The 2005-2006 show was called "<i>Marching Band for Dummies</i>" based on the <a href="../../../f/o/r/For_Dummies_4a03.html" title="For Dummies">For Dummies</a> series of books. It features songs such as the National Emblem March, University of Nebraska Fight Song, Shining Star, Malagueña, and Snow Caps. Each song represents a distinct era of marching history.</p>
<p>The 2006-2007 show is titled Bandancing. Songs are from the musical piece Bugs, Bandancing, Dance Mix, and New Era Dance. These songs contribute to an overall dance theme. In 2006 the band finished at the Bands Of America Regional finishing second in their division with a 81.5.</p>
<p>The music department also has three concert bands, two jazz bands, five choral groups, and several other musical activities.</p>
<p>On January 2, 2007 after nearly 20 years of service to excellence, Mr. Braasch announced that he will be stepping down as the director of bands and begin teaching at the new Lewis and Clark middle school. The new director has been found. More information soon to be announced.</p>
<p><br />
The school's varsity choir, West High Singers, has been invited several times over the past few years to perform with the Omaha Symphony. In 2006 they are performing <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdi%27s_Requiem_b6f2.html" title="Verdi's Requiem">Verdi's Requiem</a> with the Symphony. They compete at District Music Contests regularly and consistently receive superior ratings.</p>
<p>Don Reimer, Bellevue West's main vocal music teacher/director, has been teaching choral music at the school since it's opening in 1977, and retired at the end of the 2006 school year. He is known across the state as a very successful vocal music director, and he was recently inducted into the Nebraska Music Educators Association Hall of Fame. He attributes his successful choral program to the level of music he teaches and the methods by which he teaches them. Beginning as freshmen, the students are taught to sight-read music and determine musical keys as well as count complicated rhythms. Reimer uses methods such as the "Merriwhether Technique" and demonstrating good costal muscle usage to coach his students on importance of tonal resonance and proper breathing. His son, A.J. Reimer, has succeeded him as head of the vocal department.</p>
<p><br />
Each year, anywhere from 10-20 students are selected for the Nebraska All-State Chorus, All-State Band, and All-State Jazz Band.</p>

<p>The Bellevue West Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps Program is also one of the best in the nation, and is widely considered to be the top unit in the midwest. They have, as of April 28, 2006, been awarded the title of National Honor Unit 11 years in a row. They are one of the most active groups in the school as pertains to community service, having participated in Hurricane Katrina relief, stocking a local food pantry, spear-heading the local Mothers Against Drunk Driving campaign in Bellevue as well as numerous other community outreach programs.<br />
Outside of the Omaha Metro area the Bellevue West AFJROTC program is known for one thing: Drill Team. Bellevue West's two Varsity Silent Sentry Drill Teams - one Men's and one Ladies' - are among the most elite Drill Teams in the country and are a standard of measurement in the midwest.<br />
<i>History of the Silent Sentry approach</i><br />
Bellevue West's "silent" form of drilling was initiated in the Men's Varsity team during the 1990-1991 school year by the team commander with the aid of a drill coach and input from the team. It differs from the "call and response" drill technique (used in previous years to floundering success) in that no commands are used during the entire performance. The team relies on an internal count, or beat, to guide the drill. The idea was so revolutionary in the area at the time that the Men's team took home the 1st Place trophies for every meet they traveled to, going as far as the Denver meet. Plans to travel to Daytona for the National Championship were abandoned when permission could not be obtained from the school administration. A video prepared by a member of and showcasing the 1990-91 Men's drill team can be found here: <a href="http://www.royal-orleans.com/1990-91mensdrill.wmv" class="external text" title="http://www.royal-orleans.com/1990-91mensdrill.wmv" rel="nofollow">1991 Drill Demonstration</a> But, in 2007 they have received permission and will attend if funding permits.</p>
