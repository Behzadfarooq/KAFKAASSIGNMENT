<p>I changed the spelling of "gym" to "gymnasium," as "gym" is an informal form of the word.</p>

<p><b>Car Wash</b></p>
<p>Selections have been taken out of the Country Car Wash bullet, as the information provided about fights at the location is mostly informal and more importantly does not show Belgreen in a good light.</p>
<p>While the above presented information may have been "informal," we must keep in mind that Wikipedia is not a local newspaper. It is meant to be an unbiased source of historical, cultural, economic, etc. information. While such information may not have "[shown] Belgreen in a good light" it is culturally relevant, as it has made a great impact on the students of Belgreen High School. May I also point out, a great deal of the information in this article is both informal and unsourced. If the portion being discussed is "informal" enough to necessitate deletion, should the rest of the page be treated in the same manner? If so, this should be done soon. Additionally, please sign your username after an edit of this page. <a href="../../../n/1/k/User%7EN1kk0_4c36.html" title="User:N1kk0">N1kk0</a> 17:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nicholas, you know as well as I do that neither you or I, both Belgreen natives, are going to delete this page. Idle and baseless threats will do you no good. All of this information is inherently relevant, yet impossible to source. Again, as we both know. The information regarding fights is largely colloquial in nature and is only relevant to those who participate in said act. Virtually all of the information on the other parts of the entry is relevant to the entire populace that the article describes. Any addition concerning these activities will be edited or deleted on sight.</p>
<p>No "idle threats" were made, you must have misunderstood what I posted. My intent was to obtain clarification of the reasons for your original edit. I was concerned that the article was being held to a double standard, but based on what you have said, it is clearly not. Still, I disagree with your interpretation of the information as being irrelevant, but I cannot refute your logic. Your point is valid. Of course, I would not stoop so low as to make petty edits solely to spite you. There is no need to warn me of deletion on sight. It is your right as a Wikipedian to make changes that you feel are necessary, and I support that right. But again, let me reiterate: I misunderstood your reasons behind your original edit, but now I understand. <a href="../../../n/1/k/User%7EN1kk0_4c36.html" title="User:N1kk0">N1kk0</a> 18:00, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>While not fully agreeing, I understand your points. Virtually everything presented, and anything that can possibly be presented in this article is impossible to cite. As somewhat of a special case, set standards should ideally be set into place for this particular case. I think that information present and to be added should remain in generalities, and specifics should be avoided when possible. The only specifics that should be used are those that are commonly accepted knowledge. (i.e. Dates of building completion, locations) Specifics that would be unacceptable under this standard would include details of fights at the Country Car Wash and Rook games at the Fire Hall (which I've removed, following this new standard). While this is fun information that anyone from Belgreen will be well aware of, it's informal and impossible to cite. Perhaps when the "History of BHS" is finally published, this information can be adequately posted and cited. Until then, as the originator and major contributer of this Wiki, this is the standard I will be following and regularly enforcing.</p>
<p>I agree with you on all points. This is proof that the system works. <a href="../../../n/1/k/User%7EN1kk0_4c36.html" title="User:N1kk0">N1kk0</a> 19:38, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Images</b></p>
<p>With the exception of the BHS crest, I am the photographer and originator of the photographed images as well as the map and give all permissions for their use. The incorrectly deleted image of CJ's Gas and Grocery also falls into this category. Deleted images will be replaced. -Danielrh9</p>
