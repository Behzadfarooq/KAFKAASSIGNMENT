<p>The date shown on the Profile says 196X/01/01 in Manga Vol. 1.However, in the chapter where Peorth got shrinked back to a kid after the Welsper event, Belldandy claimed that they have eternal life and have already saw a lot of lives and deaths. This became quite mysteries since she cannot lie but somehow she can fake the Profile.</p>

<dd>This is unknown, but I just reread that part and the claim of eternal life came from Peorth instead of Belldandy. The Birthday date in vol. 1 might just be forgotten by the author like the octopus monster and the other demon that takes away luck.</dd>

<dd>Fujishima, back in his Taihou Shichauzo and early Aa! Megam-sama! days was not known for being able to write a continuous story. A lot of plot elements would get scrapped, without any explanation, after only a few chapters. This could very well be one of them: perhaps originally the Goddesses were like humans, but that did not fit his later vision. I would not put it past him to do this! <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElric_of_Grans_aa53.html" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a> 05:47, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, Belldandy clearly does it herself, in person. It is unlikely he would ever have Belldandy lie --- Fujushima was never <i>that</i> bad. It is quite likely she was orignally meant to be 'born' then, but he later scrapped that idea and made all the Goddesses eternal. <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElric_of_Grans_aa53.html" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a> 22:55, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>hmm... This one is kinda fun... On the cover pic of the manga, Vol. 3, 7 got brown eyes(actually not very clear), most of the others are blue (or not using Belldandy's pic and one is all sepia coloured) But the pic <i>Goddess with sunflowers</i> in Vol. 10 got her eyes kinda brown.

<dd>I have an enormous archive of AMG images and Belldandy's eyes commonly vary between brown and blue, with occasional appearances of shades like violet.

<p>From the first chapter, the few coloured panels from the original manga is a mix of brown and blue (more brown than blue). However, Keiichi asked her to change her <b>clothes</b> not <i>hair colour</i> in chapter 2 and she did what he said, chanded her <b>clothes</b> by reconstructing the particles. The picture showed during the change is a picture of her naked during the reconstruction. Proving that she did not change her hair colour but changed her clothes only. (if she changed both at the same time with the same method, she would have to be shown bald, too.) She did not provide extra explanation of any colour change of her hair and Keiichi did not ask or focus on it. I went through the later volumes(which should be <b>after</b> the change), and all the colour of the front pages which should be showing her with brown hair gives the same blueish brown for at least volume 2 and 3. This should be enough to prove that to be just a printing problem due to the colouring of the original script being so dated. In volume 4, the colour took a shape change and a lot of lighter colours were used instead. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a> 09:07, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the manga, she originally had black hair which she changed to brown when she tried to make her appearance more acceptable for Earth. This fact was not reflected in any of the adaptations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have some superb scans of AMG Complete, which was a re-release of the manga with <i>more color panels</i>. In fact, the panel where Bell pops out of the mirror is a two-page spread that was beautifully colored with what appears to be watercolor (incidentally I spent hours piecing this spread together). Bell's hair is actually a melange of brown, blue, and gray shades. In the grayscale panels, Bell's hair is not black like Skuld's but rather a mix of black and white (unshaded) strands. Thus it is wrong to say that Belldandy's hair was originally black. In chapter two, Belldandy transforms her clothes and does in fact change the nature of her hair. Instead of the black and white strands, it is now colored with a uniform screentone pattern. This brings the question of what the new color is. In chapter 7 (the next chapter with ANY color pages aside from the first), Bell is shown shown with brown-gray hair in the cover, but in the succeeding color pages it's a silvery gray.</p>
<p>The bottomline is that there <i>is</i> a change in hair color that accompanied Belldandy's transformation. I can see why it was claimed to be brown, being the universal color of Belldandy's hair later. However, the remaining color panels clearly show more of silvery gray than brown so it can be argued that the initial transformation was: brown/blue/gray shades ---&gt; silver-gray, then evolving to brown later on.</p>
<p>I feel that these kinds of details are best left to hardcore fans and is inappropriate for the general page on Belldandy. Consequently I have edited this bit of trivia out. --<a href="../../../p/e/o/User%7EPeorthmegami_caa1.html" title="User:Peorthmegami">Peorthmegami</a> 07:10, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the article the Author makes this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She is also rather self-reliant, in a sense. She will not tolerate people interfering in a situation she already believes that she has control over, although this often causes her to respond in a mild statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What scene in the manga or anime illustrates this statement?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. I have no idea where the author got this from; after reading the entire manga (and scanlating a good part of it) plus watching all the animes, I'm still hard-pressed to recall any instances supporting this statement. I'll edit this out until the author defends this statement as I believe it is misleading (especially the "will not tolerate people interfering in a situation...") --<a href="../../../p/e/o/User%7EPeorthmegami_caa1.html" title="User:Peorthmegami">Peorthmegami</a> 06:13, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Following that statement is this one, presumably by the same author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly of all, Belldandy is also extremely possessive of her own happiness. However, her innate character wouldn't allow her to be happy when anybody else is unhappy, so she does her very best to ensure everybody's happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, I believe this is misleading. The statement at <i>face value</i> gives the wrong impression that Belldandy is selfish of her own happiness and maybe even hedonistic! The second line apparently tries to clarify (or even negate) the unsavory connotations of the first sentence, but frankly, fails in it's purpose of clarifying Belldandy's "selfishness." (not to mention the repeated use of "happy" and it's other forms is awkward). The other paragraphs regarding Bell's selfishness for K1 is sufficient to present the picture; there is no point in adding something that muddies the already clear water. Move to strike this out. --<a href="../../../p/e/o/User%7EPeorthmegami_caa1.html" title="User:Peorthmegami">Peorthmegami</a> 06:28, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The liner notes to the AnimEigo release of the OAV implies that the romanization "Belldandy" came from the original creators, not AnimEigo.
