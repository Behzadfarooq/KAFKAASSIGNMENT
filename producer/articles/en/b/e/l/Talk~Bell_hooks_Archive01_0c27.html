Family money?</p>

<dd>I now note that i erred in thinking i had seen the whole article, when i read (and edited) only the opening graphs and scanned only the (IMO) mislocated book list: my section edit did not expose me to the section (also in need of editing IMO) devoted to one book. I cannot assert that "There's no content here but slogans and book titles", as i've only glanced at that final section; nor do i know whether that section answers the questions i put forth above.</dd>
<dd>Also, i do now note her co-authorship with <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornel_West_bc12.html" title="Cornel West">Cornel West</a>, which IMO is not decisive but is to me the most encouraging sign that i've noted so far.<br />

<dl>
<dd>Jerzy, outside of wikipedia I understand and agree with your concerns. However, I think that wikipedia is not the place to decide if a famous scholar is deservedly famous. For the record, <i>I</i> think that bell hooks is slightly more deservedly famous than most scholars, while I also think that most scholars are more famous than they deserve (I found <i>Ain't I a Woman?</i> articulated many of the points Judith Butler makes in the beginning of <i>Gender Trouble</i> and much of <i>Bodies That Matter</i>, but in an understandable way and coming from experience, not theory).</dd>
<dd>If your concern <i>is</i> that some rabid bell hooks fan created this page to inflate the reputation of an unknown scholar, I assure you this is not the case and hooks is relatively well known. If your concern is that she is incorrectly well known the best you can do is find criticism of hooks and include it in the article, which I encourage you to do. <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 23:58, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thanks, Hyacinth, and sorry not to have made myself clearer. I agree that the quality of her scholarship is not at issue -- except in the sense that in the absence of other evidence, absence of quality scholarship would be an additional problem. "Talk is cheap", and slogans are even cheaper than scholarship, in the sense that people enunciating slogans that no one listens to are "a dime a dozen", i.e., even less famous than the people who do excellent scholarship that no one cares about (and are about "a dollar a dozen").</dd>
<dd>As i noted, the association with West makes it more likely that someone cares enough about her (perhaps for her slogans, or better yet, by a little, for her scholarship).</dd>
<dd>I'm afraid Butler's name means nothing to me, which in a sense is one of the reasons that i edited the Talk rather than considering putting hooks on VfD. I don't mean to claim expertise re this article.</dd>
<dd>I'm also reassured somewhat by your fairly non-sloganistic defense of her significance, tho i <i>do</i> continue to be concerned (at least as much in terms of the incompleteness of the article, as in terms of how correct its inclusion is) about the silence about the two-decade-wide elephant in the living room:
<ol>
<li>Has she turned down academic appointments bcz she considers academic life some form of sellout (or perhaps just boring to tears)?</li>
<li>Or because she gains more money and/or influence thru her publications than she could hope for academic life to provide?</li>
<li>Is she unable to get an academic appointment, and if so what are the various views on why?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Reason #1 would make her idiosyncratic but contributes a little to evidence of fame; reason #2 would be significant evidence of fame; reason #3 wouldn't prove non-fame, but (at least in the absence of explanatory details) it is part of a pattern that may or may not, in her case, add up to a failure to overcome the presumption (to which everyone is subject) of non-fame.</dd>

<p>bell hooks is currently on the faculty at Berea College in Kentucky as Distinguished Professor in Residence, which lists her in that capacity since 2004. I have updated the page to account for that. She is referred to on that website only as bell hooks, not as Gloria Watkins. I am not sure why she left academia, if that indeed is the case, or if there is any reason that she returned to Berea in particular. What remains unclear is the nature of her role at Berea: She is affiliated with some activities of the Women's Studies Department (e.g. "Monday Night Feminism") but there are no references to any courses being taught presently or previously.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Buddhism</span></h2>
<p>I would say that very little of bell hooks work makes reference to buddhism except in articles she writes specifically on the topic (e.g. The Shambhala Sun articles I have the wikipedia entry linking to). When she does speak of buddhism it is often about socially engaged buddhism, a term coined by Thich Nhat Hanh (a Zen master she know studies under) but which as a movement has taken on a signifigance far beyond his work alone. I plan to make the change article to mention that it is only some of her work that deals with Buddhism and wanted to give y'all a heads upParrhesiastes <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Parrhesiastes (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Parrhesiastes_0038.html" title="Special:Contributions/Parrhesiastes">contribs</a>) 17:02, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
