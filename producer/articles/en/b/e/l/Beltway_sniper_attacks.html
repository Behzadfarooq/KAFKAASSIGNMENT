<p>The <b>Beltway <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">sniper</a> attacks</b> took place during three weeks of October 2002 in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-Atlantic_7418.html" title="Mid-Atlantic">Mid-Atlantic</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Ten people were killed and three others critically injured by two males in and around <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in various locations throughout the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore-Washington_Metropolitan_Area_a015.html" title="Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area">Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area</a> and along <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_95.html" title="Interstate 95">Interstate 95</a> in <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>. It was later learned that the rampage apparently began the month before with murders and robbery in Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia which had resulted in 3 deaths. An earlier spree by the pair had killed victims in California, Arizona, and Texas, for a total of 16 deaths so far.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The shootings finally ended on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">October 24</a>, when police <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrest.html" title="Arrest">arrested</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Allen_Muhammad_08f8.html" title="John Allen Muhammad">John Allen Muhammad</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Boyd_Malvo_dce7.html" title="Lee Boyd Malvo">Lee Boyd Malvo</a> at a <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">highway</a> <a href="../../../r/e/s/Rest_area.html" title="Rest area">rest area</a> off of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_70.html" title="Interstate 70">Interstate 70</a> near <a href="../../../m/y/e/Myersville%2C_Maryland_65b7.html" title="Myersville, Maryland">Myersville, Maryland</a>, after receiving two telephone tips from a trucker and another alert motorist. It was later learned that the three-week-long rampage was motivated, at least in part, by a plot to extort $10 million from the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Charges in Virginia against the pair were tried first. In 2004, Muhammad was sentenced to death and Malvo to several sentences of life imprisonment without parole in Virginia for several of the attacks. Many more criminal charges are pending against each man, although a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_b835.html" title="Supreme Court of the United States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruling in <i><a href="../../../r/o/p/Roper_v._Simmons_c906.html" title="Roper v. Simmons">Roper v. Simmons</a></i> in March 2005 effectively precludes a death penalty for Malvo. Muhammad's death penalty was affirmed by the Virginia Supreme Court on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. While Muhammad was awaiting <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_%28legal%29.html" title="Execution (legal)">execution</a> in Virginia, in the fall of 2005, he and Malvo were extradited to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_County%2C_Maryland_ce0d.html" title="Montgomery County, Maryland">Montgomery County, Maryland</a> where the most incidents took place to face trial, after which, they will be returned to Virginia under an agreement between the two states.</p>
<p>Civil legal action also resulted. Neither shooter was legally allowed to acquire firearms in the U.S. The dealer responsible for the rifle used in the attacks had an extensive record of firearms violations, and had not reported the gun missing (after it had apparently been shoplifted by Malvo) as required by law. A civil lawsuit alleging <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negligence.html" title="Negligence">negligence</a> against both the gun dealer and the manufacturer who made and distributed the weapon resulted in a US$2.5 million <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-of-court_settlement.html" title="Out-of-court settlement">out-of-court settlement</a> for survivors and families of victims.</p>
<p>In May 2006, after over 3 1/2 years of discovery of partial facts and widespread speculation, at Muhammad's Maryland trial, Malvo revealed many details of their three-phased plan, which was far more elaborate than had early been thought by many observers. If carried out, the pair would have recruited a small army of alienated youths, used Muhammad's U.S. military training to instruct and indoctrinate them in Canada, and then mount coordinated <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a> attacks on the entire United States.</p>

<p>Authorities initially attributed the attacks to a lone <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">sniper</a>, dubbed by journalists the "<a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_Beltway_bb1b.html" title="Capital Beltway">Beltway</a> Sniper," the "D.C. Sniper," the "Washington Sniper," the "Serial Sniper" or the "Tarot Card Killer."</p>
<p>After their capture, there was much confusion about the names of the two men. The older of the pair, born John Allen Williams, age 41 at the time of capture, had joined the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_86de.html" title="Nation of Islam">Nation of Islam</a> some years earlier and changed his name to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Allen_Muhammad_08f8.html" title="John Allen Muhammad">John Allen Muhammad</a> in October 2001. The younger man was born <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Boyd_Malvo_dce7.html" title="Lee Boyd Malvo">Lee Boyd Malvo</a>, but also calls himself John Lee Malvo and had posed as Muhammad's son (17 years old at the time of his arrest). Malvo's actual relationship with Muhammad was initially unclear, although it was later learned that Malvo's mother had been involved in some illegal activity with Muhammad in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antigua.html" title="Antigua">Antigua</a>.</p>
<p>The two men practiced shooting in the backyard of the 3300 block of South Proctor Street in Tacoma, WA, according to investigators, and studied the Oliver Stone film <i><a href="../../../s/a/v/Savior_%28film%29.html" title="Savior (film)">Savior</a>.</i></p>

<p>The shootings began <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, with a series of five fatal shootings in 15 hours in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_County%2C_Maryland_ce0d.html" title="Montgomery County, Maryland">Montgomery County, Maryland</a>, a suburban county north of Washington. They continued for the next three weeks in the Washington metropolitan area and along <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_95.html" title="Interstate 95">Interstate 95</a> south to within 15 miles of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. Police received messages left at the murder locations and believed, correctly, that the killer worked in concert with another person.</p>
<p>The shootings occurred at gas stations and in parking lots outside supermarkets, restaurants, and schools in a rough circular pattern around Washington. The victims were apparently selected at random, crossing racial, gender, and socioeconomic categories. The locations of the attacks always had close freeway access. It is believed the shooter used the circular <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_Beltway_bb1b.html" title="Capital Beltway">Capital Beltway</a> to get from place to place, although several of the attacks occurred along <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_95.html" title="Interstate 95">Interstate 95</a> south of the Beltway in Virginia.</p>
<p>The attacks were carried out with a stolen <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushmaster_XM-15_c8d7.html" title="Bushmaster XM-15">Bushmaster XM-15</a> <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-automatic_rifle.html" title="Semi-automatic rifle">semiautomatic</a> <a href="../../../2E/2/2/.223.html" title=".223">.223</a> caliber <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifle</a> equipped with a red-dot sight at ranges of between 50 and over 100 yards. It should be noted that this rifle is not generally considered a <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper_rifle.html" title="Sniper rifle">sniper rifle</a> even though it is used in long distance shooting competitions for ranges up to 600 yards. The ability and distance of the shots do not meet the skill sets of a military <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">sniper</a>. None of the shots involved in the killings were particularly difficult and many professionals in the law enforcement and military communities resented the use of the term "sniper" to describe the shooters. The XM-15 rifle came from <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull%27s_Eye_Shooter_Supply_b837.html" title="Bull's Eye Shooter Supply">Bull's Eye Shooter Supply</a> in <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma%2C_Washington_361e.html" title="Tacoma, Washington">Tacoma, Washington</a>. Bull's Eye had been noted for violating firearms regulations in the past. It had not reported the rifle as missing, as required by federal law.</p>

<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Moose_4cb9.html" title="Charles Moose">Charles Moose</a></div>

<p>The investigation was publicly headed by Montgomery County, Maryland Police Chief <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_A._Moose_2552.html" title="Charles A. Moose">Charles A. Moose</a>, with assistance from the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> and police departments in other jurisdictions where killings and woundings had taken place.</p>
<p>Police responded within minutes to reports of attacks during the three weeks of the sniper attacks, cordoning off nearby roads and highways and inspecting all drivers, thereby grinding traffic to a halt for hours at a time throughout parts of one of America's largest metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts of the attacks were mostly confused and spotty. Hotlines set up for the investigation were flooded with tips, as was the post office box set up for tips by mail. The most common tip was that the shooters were driving a boxy white van, which ultimately proved erroneous.</p>
<p>The shooter attempted to engage the police in a dialog, compelling Moose to tell the media cryptic messages intended for the sniper. At several scenes <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarot.html" title="Tarot">Tarot</a> cards were left as <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calling_card_%28crime%29.html" title="Calling card (crime)">calling cards</a>, including one <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28Tarot_card%29_a293.html" title="Death (Tarot card)">Death card</a> upon which was written "Dear Policeman, I am God. Do not tell the media about this." This information was leaked to the press. Later scenes had long handwritten notes carefully sealed inside plastic bags, including a rambling one that demanded $10,000,000 and threatened the lives of children in the area.</p>
<p>At one point, a telephone call from the shooter(s) was traced to a pay telephone at a gasoline station in <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henrico_County%2C_Virginia_3f62.html" title="Henrico County, Virginia">Henrico County, Virginia</a>. Police missed the suspects by a matter of a few minutes, and initially detained occupants of a van at another pay telephone at the same intersection.</p>
<p>During the period of the attacks, the North American media devoted enormous amounts of air time and newspaper space to news of each new attack. By the middle of October 2002, all-news television networks were providing live coverage of the aftermath of each new attack, with the coverage often lasting for hours at a time. The Fox show "<a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Most_Wanted_519b.html" title="America's Most Wanted">America's Most Wanted</a>" even devoted an entire episode to the shooters in hopes of aiding in their capture.</p>
<p>Despite an apparent lack of progress publicly, federal authorities were making significant headway in their investigation and developed leads in Washington state, Alabama, and New Jersey. They learned that Muhammad's ex-wife, who had obtained a protective order against him, lived near the capital beltway in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton%2C_Maryland_26ab.html" title="Clinton, Maryland">Clinton</a>, a community in suburban <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George%27s_County%2C_Maryland_53d8.html" title="Prince George's County, Maryland">Prince George's County, Maryland</a>. Information was also developed about an automobile purchased in New Jersey by Muhammad. Much to their shock, police discovered that the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> license plates issued to Muhammad on the 1990 <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Caprice_a066.html" title="Chevrolet Caprice">Chevrolet Caprice</a> had been checked by radio patrol cars several times near shooting locations in various jurisdictions in several states, but the car had not been stopped because law enforcement computer networks did not indicate that it was connected to any criminal activity.</p>
<p>Authorities were quick to issue a media alert to the public to be on the lookout for a dark blue <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Caprice_a066.html" title="Chevrolet Caprice">Chevrolet Caprice</a> sedan. For the public, as well as for law enforcement agencies throughout the region, this was a major change from the mysterious "white box truck" earlier sought based upon reported sightings.</p>
<p>On October 24, police arrested Muhammad and Malvo at a rest area on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_70.html" title="Interstate 70">Interstate 70</a> near <a href="../../../m/y/e/Myersville%2C_Maryland_65b7.html" title="Myersville, Maryland">Myersville, Maryland</a>, after receiving two separate tips from citizens who reported seeing a parked, occupied car that matched the description distributed by the media. The former police car, referred to as a "killing machine" by senior law enforcement officials, Col. Robert J. Smaegelov and Maj. Richard M. Spencer. <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/South/10/24/sniper.shootings/" class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/South/10/24/sniper.shootings/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, had been specially configured with a firing port so that the killer could shoot inconspicuously while lying with his lower body in the cabin and his upper body in the trunk.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 15th, Malvo dialed <a href="../../../9/-/1/9-1-1.html" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a> and briefly spoke with a Rockville, Md. police dispatcher. "Good morning," a male's voice began. "Don't say anything. Just listen. We're the people that are causing the killing in your area. Look on the tarot card. It says, 'Call me God. Do not release to the press.' We have called you three times before, trying to set up negotiations. We have got no response. People have died ... "</p>
<p>"Sir, Mont ... ," the dispatcher interjected. "Get your people ... ," the man continued. "We're not investigating the crime," she said, referring the caller to police in Montgomery County, where the sniper task force was based. "Do you want the number?" Malvo then hung up.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Beltway_sniper_attacks.html" title="Edit section: Virginia trials">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Virginia trials</span></h4>
<p>Virginia authorities were selected for initial prosecutions. In accordance with United States law, each man was provided free legal counsel at public expense since they were both indigent. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Change_of_venue.html" title="Change of venue">Change of venue</a> requests by defense attorneys were granted, and the first trials were held in the independent cities of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake%2C_Virginia_f264.html" title="Chesapeake, Virginia">Chesapeake</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Beach%2C_Virginia_caa0.html" title="Virginia Beach, Virginia">Virginia Beach</a> in southeastern Virginia, more than 100 miles from the closest alleged attack (in Ashland, Virginia).</p>
<p>During their trials in the fall of 2003, involving two of the victims in Virginia, Muhammad and Malvo were each found guilty of murder and weapons charges. The jury in Muhammad's case recommended that he be sentenced to death, while Malvo's jury recommended a sentence of life in prison without parole over the death penalty. The judges concurred in both cases. Alabama law enforcement authorities allege that the snipers engaged in a series of previously unconnected attacks prior to <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">October 2</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery%2C_Alabama_2176.html" title="Montgomery, Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>. Other charges are also pending in Maryland and other communities in Virginia.</p>
<p>After the initial convictions and sentencing, Will Jarvis, a Virginia prosecutor in Prince William County, stated he would wait to decide whether to try Malvo on capital charges in his jurisdiction until the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruled on whether juveniles may be subject to the penalty of <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_%28legal%29.html" title="Execution (legal)">execution</a>. While that decision in an unrelated case was still pending before the high court, in October 2004, under a plea-agreement, Malvo plead guilty in another case in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spotsylvania_County_5ac0.html" title="Spotsylvania County">Spotsylvania County</a>, Virginia for another murder to avoid a possible death penalty sentence, and agreed to additional sentencing of life imprisonment without parole. Malvo had yet to face trial in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_William_County_dece.html" title="Prince William County">Prince William County</a>, Virginia.</p>
<p>In March 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in <i><a href="../../../r/o/p/Roper_v._Simmons_c906.html" title="Roper v. Simmons">Roper v. Simmons</a></i> that the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_9fac.html" title="Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Eighth Amendment</a> prohibits execution for crimes committed when under the age of 18. In light of this Supreme Court decision, the prosecutors in Prince William County have decided not pursue the charges against Malvo, after all. Prosecutors in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> were still interested in putting both Malvo and Muhammad on trial. As Malvo was 17 when he committed the crimes, he will no longer face the death penalty, but still may be extradited to Alabama, Louisiana, and other states for prosecution. At the time of the <i>Roper v. Simmons</i> ruling, Malvo was 20 years old, and was held at Virginia's maximum security Red Onion State Prison in <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound%2C_Virginia_bdd6.html" title="Pound, Virginia">Pound</a> in <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wise_County%2C_Virginia_375e.html" title="Wise County, Virginia">Wise County, Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>Muhammad's death penalty was affirmed by the Virginia Supreme Court on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, when it ruled that he could be sentenced to death because the murder was part of an act of terrorism. This line of reasoning was based on the handwritten note demanding $10,000,000 dollars. The court rejected an argument by defense lawyers that Muhammad could not be sentenced to death because he was not the triggerman in the killings linked to him and Malvo.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Muhammad, with his sniper team partner, Malvo, randomly selected innocent victims"</i> Virginia Supreme Court Justice Donald Lemons wrote in the decision. <i>"With calculation, extensive planning, premeditation and ruthless disregard for life, Muhammad carried out his cruel scheme of terror."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>There has also been speculation that authorities in Virginia may proceed with what is termed a "backup case" against Muhammad. The death sentence is under appeal. It is not clear how many other jurisdictions will be allowed to try him on the capital charges they have pending before he is <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution_%28legal%29.html" title="Execution (legal)">executed</a>. Prior to extradition to Maryland, he was held at the maximum security Sussex I State Prison near <a href="../../../w/a/v/Waverly%2C_Virginia_9529.html" title="Waverly, Virginia">Waverly</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex_County%2C_Virginia_d7fe.html" title="Sussex County, Virginia">Sussex County, Virginia</a>, which houses Virginia's <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_row.html" title="Death row">death row</a> inmates.</p>

<p>In May 2005, Virginia and Maryland announced that they had reached agreements to allow Maryland to proceed with prosecuting charges there, where the most shootings occurred. There were media reports that Malvo and his legal team have been willing earlier to negotiate his cooperation, and he waived extradition to Maryland.</p>
<p>Muhammad and his legal team responded by fighting extradition to Maryland. Muhammad's legal team was ultimately unsuccessful, and extradition was ordered by a Virginia judge in August 2005.</p>
<p>Maryland has agreed to transfer Muhammad and Malvo back to the Commonwealth of Virginia after their trials. A date for Muhammad's pending execution in Virginia has not been set.</p>
<p>Malvo pled guilty to six murders and confessed to others in other states while being interviewed in Maryland and while testifying there against Muhammad. Malvo was sentenced to six consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Beltway_sniper_attacks.html" title="Edit section: The Real Plan (Updated from the May 2006 Maryland Trial of Muhammad)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Real Plan (Updated from the May 2006 Maryland Trial of Muhammad)</span></h4>
<p>In John Allen Muhammad's May 2006 trial in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_County%2C_MD_6cea.html" title="Montgomery County, MD">Montgomery County, MD</a>, Lee Boyd Malvo took the stand and confessed to a more detailed version of the pair's plans. Malvo, after extensive psychological counseling, admitted that he was lying at the earlier <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> trial where he had admitted to being the triggerman for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this in order to protect John Allen Muhammad from the potential death penalty, because it was more difficult to achieve the death penalty for a minor. Malvo said that he wanted to do what little he could for the families of the victims by letting the full story be told. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined many very detailed aspects of all the shootings.</p>
<p>Part of his testimony concerned John Allen Muhammad's complete multiphase plan. His plan consisted of three phases in the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_MD_ff95.html" title="Baltimore, MD">Baltimore, MD</a> metro areas. Phase one consisted of meticulously planning, mapping, and practicing their locations around the DC area. This way after each shooting they would be able to quickly leave the area on a predetermined path, and move on to the next location. John Allen Muhammad's goal in Phase One was to kill 6 people a day for 30 days. Malvo went on to describe how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway at different locations.</p>
<p>Phase Two was meant to be moved up to <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_MD_ff95.html" title="Baltimore, MD">Baltimore, MD</a>. Malvo described how this phase was close to being implemented, but never was carried out. Phase Two was intended to begin by killing a pregnant woman by shooting her in the stomach. The next step would have been to shoot and kill a <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_City_07fc.html" title="Baltimore City">Baltimore City</a> police officer. Then, at the officer's funeral, they were to create several improvised explosive devices complete with shrapnel. These explosives were intended to kill a large number of police, since many police would attend another officer's funeral.</p>
<p>The last phase was to take place very shortly after, if not during, Phase Two. The third phase was to extort several million dollars from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> government. This money would be used to finance a larger plan. The plan was to travel north into <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Along the way they would stop in <a href="../../../y/m/c/YMCA_8c40.html" title="YMCA">YMCAs</a> and orphanages recruiting other impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. John Allen Muhammad thought he could act as their father figure as he did with Lee Boyd Malvo. Once he recruited a large number of young boys and made his way up to Canada, he would begin their training. Malvo described how John Allen Muhammad intended to train all these boys with weapons and stealth, as he had been taught. Finally, after their training was complete, John Allen Muhammad would send them out across the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> to carry out mass shootings in many different cities, just as he had done in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_MD_ff95.html" title="Baltimore, MD">Baltimore, MD</a>. These attacks would be coordinated, and were intended to send the country into chaos.</p>

Premkumar Walekar) as well as two victims who survived the shooting (Rupinder "Benny" Oberoi and 13-year old Iran Brown) filed a civil lawsuit against Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushmaster_Firearms%2C_Inc._8ab0.html" title="Bushmaster Firearms, Inc.">Bushmaster Firearms, Inc.</a> of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windham%2C_Maine_2713.html" title="Windham, Maine">Windham, Maine</a>, the gun distributor and manufacturer that made the rifle used in the crime spree, as well as Borgelt, Muhammad and Malvo. Muhammad, who had a criminal record of domestic battery, and Malvo, a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_%28law%29.html" title="Minor (law)">minor</a>, were each legally prohibited from purchasing firearms.</p>
<p>The suit claimed that Bull's Eye Shooter Supply ran its gun store in Tacoma, Washington, "in such a grossly negligent manner that scores of its guns routinely 'disappeared' from its store and it kept such shoddy records that it could not even account for the Bushmaster rifle used in the sniper shootings when asked by federal agents for records of sale for the weapon." It was alleged that the dealer could not account for hundreds of guns received from manufacturers in the years immediately prior to the Beltway sniper attacks. It was also claimed that Bull's Eye continued to sell guns in the same irresponsible manner even after Muhammad and Malvo were caught and found to have acquired the weapon there. Bushmaster was included in the suit because it allegedly continued to sell guns to Bull's Eye as a dealer despite an awareness of its record-keeping violations.</p>
<p>The case had been set for trial in April 2005. After losing several decisions as the case made its way through the courts, Bull's Eye and Bushmaster contributed to an <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-of-court_settlement.html" title="Out-of-court settlement">out-of-court settlement</a> of US$2.5 million. Bushmaster also agreed to educate its dealers on safer business practices.

<p>After the settlement was announced, WTOP radio in Washington, D.C., reported that Sonia Wills, mother of victim Conrad Johnson, said her family took part in the lawsuit more to send a message than to collect money.

<p>During the weeks that the attacks occurred, fear of the apparently random shootings generated a great deal of public apprehension, especially at filling stations and the parking lots of large stores. People pumping gas at gas stations would walk around their cars quickly, hoping that they would be a harder target to hit. Some gas stations put up tarps around the awnings over the gas pumps so people would feel safer.</p>
<p>After the specific threat against children was delivered, many school groups curtailed field trips and outdoors athletic activities based upon safety concerns. Extra police officers were placed in schools because of this fear. In addition to this, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Schumacher_bb0d.html" title="Joel Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a>'s film <i><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phone_Booth_%28film%29_958c.html" title="Phone Booth (film)">Phone Booth</a></i> was deemed potentially upsetting enough that its release was delayed for months, although it bore little resemblance to the shootings beyond the villains being a sniper. Reportedly, when news of a sniper attack made the nightly news, people that had been "hiding" in their homes would make a large exodus to their local gas station, which they had been avoiding as long as possible in order to not be a target. It is not known if this is an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a>, or an actual change in behavior for a significant portion of the local population during the affected time.</p>

<p>Of longer impact, the Beltway Sniper Attacks may have permanently damaged the perception of mass murderers as primarily disgruntled and/or mentally unbalanced middle-aged white men. Eyewitness reports gave descriptions as "a crazy white guy armed with an AK-47, driving about in a boxy white van," when in fact the shooters were two black men armed with an XM-15 (which is a civilianized derivative of the <a href="../../../m/1/6/M16_rifle.html" title="M16 rifle">M16</a> that bears only a very superficial resemblance to an <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a>) driving about in an old blue Chevy sedan. There were even reports that police were searching for a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacist.html" title="White supremacist">white supremacist</a><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/oct2002/snip-o15.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/oct2002/snip-o15.shtml" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michelle/malkin101102.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michelle/malkin101102.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>
