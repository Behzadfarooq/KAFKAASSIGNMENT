<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old discussions archived</span></h2>
<p>I have <a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBelgaum_Archive_0_7bda.html" title="Talk:Belgaum/Archive 0">archived</a> the old Talk page for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was huge (125 kb+)</li>
<li>It really had nothing in it that contributed towards the improvement of the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's use this space from now on to discuss factual improvement of the article, and not indulge in politics or speculation.</p>
<p>For starters, I think this article needs some updates to information related to Belgaum</p>
<ul>
<li>Connections (air, rail, broad, bus)</li>
<li>Rise of importance as an "education city"</li>
</ul>
<p>and let's try and clean out political commentary and editorialization.</p>
<p>Let's make this a great article!</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 04:51, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Make sure to keep its <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> intact.Glorification of either side's stand will lead to conflict.Thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 04:59, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Recent_Developments" id="Recent_Developments"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent Developments</span></h2>
<p>I would like to recommend that the section "Recent developments" be removed or extensively edited to be more concise. It is the largest section in the article and reduces the readability and interest-worthiness of the article, by introducing needless detail and analysis, none of which add value to the article. This is really not a cricket match where we have to report ball by ball.&#160;:)</p>
<p>I would suggest removal of this section, and updating the previous section ("Border problems") with only a <i>few</i> lines about the current developments, with links for further off-site reading.</p>
<p>I volunteer to do this if the suggestion is acceptable.</p>
<p>This suggestion is neither an endorsement nor a condemnation of any viewpoint - I am concerned about the readability of the article and the value it offers to readers.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 05:59, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have created <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_Belgaum_draft_c9da.html" title="User:Achitnis/Belgaum draft">a draft</a> to replace the current text. I have tried to keep it as neutral as possible. Non-political comments are invited. Please note that Wikipedia is neither a newspaper nor a repository for future information, and does not chronicle <i>every</i> fact in existence. We should use links to off-site information to avoid distracting readers from the main article.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 06:34, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since there haven't been any objections, I am replacing the above sections with the contents of my draft.</p>
<p>I would again remind everyone that this is an encyclopedia, not a newspaper or a political propaganda vehicle. The idea behind this rewrite was to depoliticise the overall article, and I am going to be pretty ruthless about enforcing this. Belgaum's page on Wikipedia deserves better than being an unreadable collection of political statements by rivalling factions. Worst case situation, I will propose a "Belgaum Border Dispute" article, move the border dispute issues to that article, and link to it from the main Belgaum article.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 07:19, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have reverted to the admin's version.I had urged u to keep the NPOV intact and include all details about Maharashtra's stand which was in the old version.It seems u have not read the old version properly.Centre has cancelled his anti-Maha stand long before.There was too much emphasis on Karnataka assembly in ur version.I request u to brief the existing matter rather than reword it.Maharashtra's stand also be given importance as karnataka's.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 09:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can see that we are going to have a battle on our hands unless you accept the fact that this is an <b>encyclopedia</b>, and that this is an article about the city of Belgaum, not about interstate politics.</p>
<p>You are doing exactly the thing that you are accusing others of doing - you are flooding this article with completely irrelevant political details and propaganada, all of it Maharashtrian. Can you count how many times you refer to to Maharashtra in that section, <b>maha</b>wiki? I <b>am</b> a Maharashtrian, but I care more for the effectiveness of an article about my hometown than politics. That section you are protecting there is ugly, meaningless, distracting and completely irrelevant to the city of Belgaum. If you want that text to remain on Wikipedia, please move it to an article named Belgaum Border Disputes, and we can link to that from the Belgaum article.</p>
<p>Would you like to take this to arbitration?</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 11:22, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just for the record, 31% of the article is dominated by the border dispute text, which is also extremely badly written and has no precedent on Wikipedia. And I am not saying that the border dispute does not exist - I am saying that it doesnt belong into an article about a city that has a lot more to offer than politics. According to me (as a person <i>actually</i> from Belgaum), this entire border dispute text should be made a separate article.</p>
<p>In addition, you have wiped out all other edits from the article, including my work in other sections such as on educational institutions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 12:01, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear achitnis, I appreciate ur views.For god's sake dont threaten me about arbitration etc as I have gone beyond it.U say there's many mentions of Maharashtra here,dont u see the Kannada POV pushing in other articles.I mean see the archived talk.I am sick of POVs.I request u to keep the border dispute section <b>BRIEF</b>,<b>BALANCED</b> AND <b>NEUTRAL</b>. I dont want to push Maharashtra's POV here.So i request to go through the old Border dispute article,summarise it and make sure u keep it neutral and balanced.I have no intentions of pushing Maharashtra's POV.Of course u can make a new article outta it. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 12:28, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You have gone "beyond arbitration"?&#160;:) Could you show me where? If you can show me that you have had this article in arbitration and were successful, I will back off. If not, I am afraid I will not change my stand about this matter.</dd>
<dd>Just out of curiosity - where in Belgaum do you actually live? I am from Anagol/Bhagyanagar.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 13:08, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mahawiki says "U say there's many mentions of Maharashtra here,"! his/her english grammar/spellings are below the standards expected at wikipedia. Regardless of which political side he/she is taking, use of such english is certainly questionable.</p>
<p><a name="Professional_Educational_Institutions" id="Professional_Educational_Institutions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Professional Educational Institutions</span></h2>
<p>I suggest that this section be redone. It is really of interest only to very few people in a global readership context.</p>
<p>Instead of just listing out a number of institutions, I suggest we replace this section with some text about the growth of the professional colleges, with a few examples in terms of genre (engineering, medicine, etc.) rather than trying to make this a place to list every institution of note in Belgaum. Please understand that every institution is of note to people associated with it, so this could become a never-ending story.&#160;:)</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 06:44, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have rewritten this section, and provided links to the VTU and KU, which is a more logical place to list affiliated institutions.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Industry</span></h2>
<p>Belgaum is a very important centre for industry. Yet this article hardly touches upon this. We need to fix this. Any volunteers from Belgaum knowledgable about this who could provide information in the <b>Industry</b> section?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arbitration</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> has violated rules far too many times with this article to be allowed to continue the politicization of this article.

<p>I have tagged this article as disputed, for attention of admins. The dispute is about the large amount of politically motivated material introduced by <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a>. I had forked out that material to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_border_dispute.html" title="Belgaum border dispute">Belgaum border dispute</a> to avoid further issues and linked to it from the main article, but he has repeatedly reverted out all my edits.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 14:34, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The matter appears to be resolved at this time. <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 15:10, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tourism and attractions</span></h2>
<p>This section is a thorough mess! We need to do better than this if we ever want this article to get nominated for article of the day.&#160;:)</p>
<p>The first para is so 19th century (except for the last sentence referring to Sambra).</p>
<p>The list is a mess as well - some of the links are plain wrong (like <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamia_Mosque_0d9d.html" title="Jamia Mosque">Jamia Mosque</a>!), others are 404, etc.</p>
<p>Should we clean up the list and then start adding things in a slightly structured and verified manner?</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 16:11, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am deleting all the content for now. Editors please add only attractions in city of Belgaum (+may be places in 20km radius), not places around it. Also whenever you add some place please include some details, dont just list them. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotolstoy_c8d2.html" title="User:Leotolstoy">Leotolstoy</a> 21:49, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Suggest we put the old list of places here in the talk section (cleaned up of course), so that people can pick from that and add to the article along with descriptions. Makes it easier for people to get started.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing links</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>Hi I removed a external link which was a kannada fanatic news item irrelavant to this article.If anyone includes it again,I am ready with many pro-Marathi links.The neutral editors are requested to ask KNM and other kannada editors to not place it again.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 06:15, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mahawiki - provide evidence that the article linked to is inaccurate before removing again. This link has been in place for a long time but has never been objected to by you. It has therefore stood the test of time and scrutiny - including by you. And I have warned you about trying to politicize this article. The only fanatism I see here is yours. <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 08:00, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>For starters, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hindu_e4f3.html" title="The Hindu">The Hindu</a> is not even a newspaper <i>of</i> Karnataka for you to call it a Kannada fanatic source. Even otherwise, The Hindu is a far more notable, credible and reliable source compared to your unabashed <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. You are <b>nobody</b> to give a certificate for a source. The Hindu is accepted as a notable, credible and reliable source and it is cited in countless articles on Wikipedia. If you have problems with it, go get an admin. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 08:03, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Mr.Achitnis,I would request u to be civil and refined.I have not objected before because pro-Marathi links have been transfered by <b>Belgaum border dispute</b> move.Before even commenting on this just see the link and answer me why it should be there.Of course if u want it there,I can get a pro-Marathi link too.I have told u N no of times that the Belgaum article has to be <b>balanced</b>.It will be nice if u dont go sarvagnya's way.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 11:47, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Mahawiki - I have certainly not been uncivil, but I find your fanatism deeply offensive. I have asked you to stop politicising this article. As I have said, there is *no* proof whatsoever that the Hindu article is inaccurate, and the very fact that it is from the Hindu is enough proof that research has gone into it. But nevermind all that - this link has been in the article for a long time - how come you wake up only *now* and try to remove it?</dd>
<dd>The reality is that it opposes <b>your</b> POV, and therefore, by your logic, it must be inaccurate.</dd>
<dd>I have told you before that unlike you, I *am* from Belgaum. I know the people of Belgaum, and the situation there. I do not deny that there is a dispute, but the Government of Maharashtra is honourably disputing it in court, why are you bringing disrepute to all us Maharashtrians by going around spitting on people? We are not like that!</dd>
<dd>Unlike your other "targets", I *am* a Maharashtrian, many people here know who I am and will vouch for this fact (and you can easily google for it, too). I don't have to prove myself to you - but do you even have the guts to state your real name? How do we know who you are, and what your motives are behind all your fanatism?</dd>
<dd>Please let people of Belgaum speak for themselves, don't attempt to become their spokesman - you are not qualified to be that.</dd>
<dd>Just leave us alone!</dd>

<dd>I was opposing the link because it is irrelavant to this article.Never mind,let that link be there,I have added 2 Marathi links too.So that wiki users can also able to know whats Maharashtra's POV.</dd>
<dd>BTW,the way ur speaking about the border issue tells ur story.I dont care to google ur name etc.If u want my name I can surely give it to u.What fanaticm,mind ur words?Did u notice how ur Kannadi friends are deleting 'unrest' mentions from the dispute article and adding unnecessary details about Mahajan report?</dd>
<dd>The way R.R Patil was received in Belgaon and the way Kannadi goons disrupted Belgaon during Bandh is known to all.My aunt is from Dharwad who's a tulu and do u know she talks about Tulu nadu everytime.get this into ur head and ur Kannada friend's head too.</dd>
<dd>BTW I reallty dont need ur permission to edit Belgaon article.Dont think ur the representative of Belgaonkars.In fact i dont care if u r from belgaon or no.</dd>
<dd>So cut the crap and limit ur talk to relavant topics.I dont care if ur a celebrity or a clerk.</dd>

<p>My friend <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> you should try to gather some info about the previous discussion before calling someone fanatics or deluded. It seems you are unaware of the troubles of users <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> and others. Read the previous discussions, you will see a lot of users pushing Karnataka POV in belgaum article. User <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> has been showing his/her expertee in all karnataka, maharashtra, India, marathi, kannada, related articles. As for as user <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> is concerned, I think he/she is trying to counter the pro-karnataka POV included by others. Read this article <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri_River_Water_Dispute_a09a.html" title="Kaveri River Water Dispute">Kaveri River Water Dispute</a> and see if you can understand what POVs these users are pushing. Now coming to belgaum article, did you read the Hindu article properly. Is it so difficult to find the entire article is the POV of one person, that is, lok Sabha member from Karnataka, A.K. Kotrashetty. What one can expect from a Karnataka politician? Refer to R. R. Patil's statement on Mahajan. Mr. Patil said, Mahajan went in favor of Karnataka because he did not get Idali in breakfast and a good place to stay in Pune. How about giving reference to that link. This incident is not even very old compared to pre-peshwa history. As for as I understand user Mahawiki is not opposing the mention of Shrihari mandir. Additinally, I observed you discussing other users that Mahawiki is not from belgaum, ask the people you are discussing with and see how many who are editing are from belgaum. I can prove you that I am from Belgaum. Additionally, I can tell with confidence that you know nothing about the border dispute. --Sandipani 02:12, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ROTFL&#160;:D.. A supreme court chief justice couldnt find a good place to stay!! LOL!! No Idali(do u mean Idli??) for breakfast in Pune so gave belgaum to Karntaka.

And if he resists, please call in the admins. <b>The Hindu link is about Belgaum's history and is as relevant as an external link can get on this page</b>. Hell, if we can have a link on a <i>Srihari Mandir</i> and one on job seekers!!

<dd><b>Sri Harimandir</b> is a an important landmark of Belgaum, and many people actually know Belgaum because of it so it is completely valid. (This is of course something Mahawiki doesn't know about since he has nothing to do with Belgaum, and probably has never been there&#160;:) BTW - I lived for many years in the house next to Harimandir, waking up every morning to "Om Namaha Shivaya" chanted by hundreds of people, some of them sitting in our garden.</dd>
<dd>The jobseekers link was a bit over the top and I agree that it had no place there.</dd>
<dd>The Hindu link talked more about the Border Dispute, but from the Karnataka perspective, which was what of course triggered off our fanatic friend. Let's move it to the Belgaum Border Dispute article (where it makes more sense), and be done with it.</dd>

<dd>I wasnt sure about Harimandir and that is why I didnt remove it. And The Hindu link discusses the border dispute from a historical perspective. And so it is perfectly valid. Just because history says that it was Kannada dominated doesnt mean it becomes biased. If mw finds a historical article on Pudari or Ladari or whatever, he can feel free to put it there. Infact, the Hindu link becomes all the more valid coz., this article talks about both the history of Belgaum as well as the border dispute. So the link is definitely not out of place. Like I said, we cant keep chipping away at the quality of the article coz a self styled politician and historian(rolled into one) objects to it. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 11:29, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Proposal to make Belgaon 2nd capital cancelled!</p>
<p>Bangalore Their is no proposal to make Belgaon the 2nd capital revealed home minister S.P.Prakash on Saturday. This has shut the mouths of so-called Kannad leaders.Prakash talked to reporters after a meeting regarding Suvarna Karnatak year .The idea of 2nd capital itself cannot be supported,he said.During Karnataka legislative session from(from 25 sep onwards) some people had proposed about the 2nd capital and it was not govt's decision.in J&amp;K this idea was implemented due to weather.Maharashtra also helds legislative assembly in Nagpur but it has not appointed as 2nd capital.These examples were put forth by Prakash to reporters.</p>
<p>Kannad leaders get a bang During the legislative assembly session in Belgaon dep.CM yediyurappa had himself announced about making Belgaon a 2nd capital.Within just 15 days coalition govt's (BJP's partner) JD(S) leader and Home minster Prakash have taken a U-turn.This has exposed the disagreements in coalition govt.Home minsiter's announcement has banged Kannad leaders and their faces are worth watching. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 08:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mahawiki: when are you going to realise that Wikipedia is not your private propaganda playground, but an encyclopedia? And that in an encyclopedia, articles have to have structure be readable? I have not removed any facts, I am rearranging text to make the article more readable. Is this so difficult to understand?</p>
<p>And as for your mindless putting in text into the References section - do you even understand how the references system works? You can't just go and put in some random, uncited and unverifiable text there.</p>
<p>And kindly stop using sentences like "Make sure that wikipedia is not OWNED by you and I am not <b>answerable</b> to u." to try and justify your actions. That sounds childish.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Importance of border_dispute section</span></h3>
<p>Chitnis is being making a issue out of non-issue. For him Belgaum dispute may be nothing but for lakhs of Maharashtrians in border region it is the question of life and death. Morever take this into account- two of Indian states are vouching for Belgaum, matters are with Supreme court, K'taka talks of making Belgaum the 2nd capital and Maharashtra HM attends convention. U like it or not, border issue is indeed a important issue here and hence a sub-section that links the main article and that too in top of (below history) this article is needed. As i mentioned above border dispute article was formed on his insistance and he wanted 'to improve and expand his hometown article'.But as u can see he hasnt done much here and just want to show off his liberal attitude about the issue. Whereas the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaon_border_dispute.html" title="Belgaon border dispute">Belgaon_border_dispute</a> is indeed expanded.</p>
<p>His allegations of me being political is frivolous.His insistance of (ONLY HE SHOULD be)editing the article just because he claims himself of from belgaum is also hillarious.He is being a dictator here.Everything cannot be arranaged and done as per his requirement.His tendency of considering others inferior and being too much proud of himself (If u dont know who I am u r certainly not of Belgaum...google my name and see who i am...etc etc) talks about his 'attitude' in volumes.In fact this guy doesnt even know that the centre of controversy is Belgaum city! Its high time that chitnis stops his dictatorship and expecting others to follow his footsteps. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 13:08, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can u explain me what was ur intention by ur statement 'if u dont know me so u r not a Belgaumkar!'.

Have u read the earlier discussions on the same page before u make such allegations which are utter false.</dd>
<dd>Above all do u know <i>what u want</i>? Are u creating a scene just because u love controversies? What is ur problem when Border dispute section is placed above all (but below history)? Do u have any justification to prove that there is no <i>border dispute</i> or it is very weak 'political movement'? <b>It is ur POV</b>.

<dd>Perhaps u are not aware- Belgaum Tarun Bharat is a reputable source. A reputable source can be offline(a book for eg) or online and both are valid. The citation which I am talking about is sent to me by none other than editor of Tarun Bharat. Morever the admin has looked into it. If u can understand Marathi I would be happy to email it to u.

First of all nobody knows what Tarun Bharat is and your ref doesnt explain it. Nor does your ref give the date of publication, the edition, the author of the article... NOTHING!!

<p>Sarvagnya and others, why are you making a issue out of a non-issue. Mahawiki has given a valid citation and it is perfectly alright. He has e-mailed me the file, and I have myself read it. But, comin' back to the point, let me point out that all citations cannot be online. Offline citations are allowed in Wikipedia. If you still want to remove the citations, then it's your prerogative. But then rest assured, your Kannad author Mr.Kamat's references from all the articles that Kannambadi has kannadized will also be removed. So, please cool down your rhetorics as they ain't gonna scare Mahawiki or me. By the way, Sarvagnya, I must point out that what you're doing is Wikistalking&#160;! Isn't it&#160;? I must also point out that Mahawiki has been extremely civil and all you guys are doing is provoking him by raising a non-issue just because he is related to that issue. Please, stop this. And remember, <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. <span class="plainlinks" style="border: 2px solid #0001DC; padding: 1px;"><b><a href="../../../a/r/y/User%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_6561.html" title="User:Arya Rajya Maharashtra"><font color="green">Arya</font></a></b></span><a href="../../../a/r/y/User_talk%7EArya_Rajya_Maharashtra_43c8.html" title="User talk:Arya Rajya Maharashtra"><b><font style="verdana" color="BROWN">Raj</font><font color="Magenta">ya</font></b></a><b><a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra"><font color="#FF5900">महाराष्ट्र</font></a></b> 07:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I personally do not think that the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkanization.html" title="Balkanization">balkanization</a> attempts by him and his friends are going to go unnoticed for much longer, but at the same time, any attempt by the other side to counter their attempts using "counter facts" really doesn't provide any value, just more fuel to a fire that will consume both sides (see "<a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_Assured_Destruction_e2c4.html" title="Mutual Assured Destruction">Mutual Assured Destruction</a>" for more details).</dd>

<dd>We all know as well as I do that mailing you a PDF, or uploading it to Geocities, or anything else, is not valid verifiability according to WP - a link to the Tarun Bharat site would be. The primary issue here is <i>not</i> whether you or I know that the material is valid - it is about other readers of the article who know neither you nor me. Wikipedia is not about truth, but about verifiable facts - by anyone.</dd>
<dd>And in any case - does this kind of material belong in this article, when there is a separate article about <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_border_dispute.html" title="Belgaum border dispute">Belgaum border dispute</a>, which this article links to? This looks like a deliberate attempt to migrate material/issues from that article to this article.</dd>
<dd>I would be perfectly content if both "pro-Maharashtra" and "pro-Karnataka" material were removed from this article, after all this article is <i>not</i> about the border dispute. But MW would have to point out what he considers "pro-Karnataka" in the article <i>on this talk page</i>, and allow other editors to evaluate that. He has never done that - he uses his favourite figleaf - "NPOV" (or hiding behind admins - notice how <b>you</b> are now his primary verification source?)- and reverts at will. <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchitnis_f5ca.html" title="User:Achitnis">Achitnis</a> 08:17, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Tomorrow if I create an article in pdf and use it as a source is that acceptable? Why should anyone believe Mahawiki saying some editor has mailed him? Considering the highly chauvinistic nature of that article, I doubt it was ever published. This issue need to be addressed or else I'm going to report this to concerned admins. I'm fairly new to wiki and I'm not really sure who to complian.

<dd>This so called reference is a joke. Like Gnanapiti says it doesnt have any details that will give it any credibility. It reads like some MES pamphlet. Infact, there is nothing in the pdf to even prove that it is indeed from a newspaper or magazine. btw, is tarun bharat a newspaper or a magazine? the pdf doesnt even have the logo of TB. I will give another 24 hours for mw to come up with a better citation or I will bulldoze it from this article. Also, I want to ask the admin how he cleared the use of a reference like this - one that is devoid of <i>any</i> details except some disgusting venom against Karnataka. Endorsing MW's translation is one thing, but endorsing the use of references like this is totally another thing.

<dd>Hello Mahawiki,<br />
I think the article in question is already mentioned on the border dispute page. It would be best to remove the citation from here, for the simple reason of keeping this article free from any bias. The border dispute article seems to be the place where there are POVs upon POVs and clearly partisan newspaper references from both sides heaped together (although ideally, the border dispute article can be written in a MUCH cleaner way without a semblance of partisanship, but that article seems to be as inviting to touch as an active volcano right now so let's leave the thought aside). Coming back to this article, it is my sincere request to you to consider deleting your reference and maybe putting a more NPOV source in its place. You may say that there are two Deccan Herald references cited on this page, and that DH is a pro-Karnataka paper. It may be true but if you look at those links, the content is quite bland. The cited DH pages do not seem to have anti-Marathi, anti-Maharashtra rhetoric. However, the same cannot be said about the PDF that you have provided.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In conclusion, to keep the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> page free from controversies and edit wars and to prevent more bad blood between editors, please consider deleting your reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And this is to everyone: Guys, relax! We're all from the same country remember? I hate to sound like I'm giving a sermon but do you look at whether the guy next to you on the road is Marathi or Kannada when you celebrate and shout and dance after India beats Pakistan in cricket? Maybe you guys should read <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikistress" class="extiw" title="m:Wikistress">this</a>. It seems most of you are suffering from it&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>hi maxim,</dd>
<dd>finally a neutral voice!!</dd>
<dd>maxim please delete the reference urself,i had added the reference to justify my '1951 census 'edit in border_dispute section. (this is the figure taken from mahajan repository) These people are fighting for nothing. All they want is have bash.However whichever citation i have used in<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_border_dispute.html" title="Belgaum border dispute">belgaum_border_dispute</a> i feel i have taken care to write the facts and not the POV which they might carry (unlike sarvangya and his 'friends').The citation i gave has FACTS and figures about all the problem.It is not at all anti-karnataka. i mean disclosing the facts which unfortunately goes against karnataka doesnt mean that the source is biased. All know Karnataka's decision to stop Marathi schools and make kannada compulsory to all non-kannadas.</dd>

<dd>Hi Mahawiki,</dd>
<dd>I can understand what you're saying, but the thing is that such a sensitive issue naturally sees passions being inflammed on both sides. References for the border dispute article are primarily Marathi or Kannada newspapers. Newspapers can be some of the most biased forms media if they want to be. Marathi newspapers will carry pro-Maharashtra news, and Kannada newspapers (or even English dailies like DH for that matter) will do the same for Karnataka. Facts and figures may be challenged depending on which source/newspaper you're citing. This is how edit wars escalate, which is the cause for much distress and, as I mentioned, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikistress" class="extiw" title="m:Wikistress">Wikistress</a>. I'm not saying that the facts you mentioned are false, but that they can just as well be countered using the facts and figures quoted in pro-Karnataka media. Who decides what is right then?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What would be immensely more preferable is if someone rewrites the border dispute page by quoting more from relatively neutral sources, such as Outlook (<s>which I believe is cited</s> <small>It is Frontline which is cited, not Outlook. Sorry. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximvsDecimvs_b00c.html" title="User:MaximvsDecimvs">MaximvsDecimvs</a> 10:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</small>) or India Today or for that matter, a newspaper which does not get published from the feuding territories (e.g. Asian Age or Dainik Jagran). It is foolish to expect rags from both states to remain neutral. They will <b>never</b> be neutral. The border dispute page can be made better than what it is right now. Unfortunately my knowledge of the issue is limited and until I read more, I will be reluctant to edit it.</dd>

<dd><b>Hi Max</b>, pray tell me, how is frontline or the Hindu or Indian Express <i>not</i> neutral? All are from a publishing houses in Tamil Nadu. Also, why should we trash Deccan Herald just because somebody is prejudiced against it. We arent using any tabloids. We hadnt even used any Kannada sources until Mahawiki conjured his flimsy Pudari and pdf from somewhere. Let him use TimesofIndia - what prevents him? But suddenly, Times of India becomes a Delhi newspaper for him!!! He cant trust Delhi newspapers, he cant trust Bombay newspapers, cant trust Bengaluru, cant trust Madras... all he can trust is Pudari and his own pdf, supposedly sent to him by some obscure editor!! And the problem with using sources like Outlook and India today is, most of the times you need subscriptions to read the whole article and that hinders verifiability. But even if we were to do that, there's no guarantee that he wont call Outlook or IT a 'Kannadi fanatic magazine'(sic). <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 16:34, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's extremely sad how these Kannada gang takes on the lone Marathi warrior Mahawiki. I was busy for quite some time, so couldn't get time to reply. But now, I have come back. OK, Kannada editors, please tell me how is this reference unverifiable and blah....blah...&#160;?? I can say the same about Suryanath Kamat. Mahawiki has even provided the pdf file. Alright, you remove the material and then I ask about verifiability of Mr.Kamat. You can do one thing - Mail me Suryanath Kamat's book. Or as Achittnis says, provide me an online link. Then it can be agreed that the citation is verified. Otherwise I am going to clean up <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/j/Vijayanagara.html" title="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> and whatever else where the book is cited.</dd>

<dd>Secondly, if you are "trashing" Tarun Bharat, and you are saying Frontline isn't neutral 'cause it's from Tamil Nadu, then what about Deccan Herald. I ask admins to remove all citations from Deccan Herald and Kannada newspapers. BTW, I have the subscription of India Today and I am gonna start an article on Kannada which is very well detailed in the last issue of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India_Today_c149.html" title="India Today">India Today</a> as well as many <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> newspapers and books.

<dd>I wonder why editors are even using expressions like "Warrior", "Battle" etc. Please try to understans guys. We are not fighting any battle here. Don't turn this article into a boxing arena. We are all in good faith and shall continue to be in good faith.</dd>
<dd>I never denied the reputation of Tarun Bharat. It might well be an established news paper, I don't know. My only concerns are over the so called "mailed by editor" article depicting chauvinism of nth grade. I can say that the article very much looks like a self created one. Providing the pdf doesn't make the citastion valid. It doesn't take only editor of Tarun Bharat to create a pdf file. Even if we assume that it is "mailed" by the editor, why doesn't the article carry any information on author, date, publication or atleast whether the article was ever published or not? I don't trust the article. That's it. The very fact that editors are comparing this funny looking pdf which is nothing but a joke to trusted and highly reputed newspapers like DH, The Hindu, shows the attitude of editors towards this article. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnanapiti_b22e.html" title="User:Gnanapiti">Gnanapiti</a> 17:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since, you guy(s) have questioned the verifiabiltiy of the citation, you may please do the same.

<dd>sarvagnya, Tarun Bharat is the most widely circulated newspaper in belgaum.Do u understand this? We all know that u know very less about belgaum etc.No English newspaper (forget about Kannadi newspapers!!!) is as popular in belgaum as tarun Bharat.</dd>
<dd>Pudhari newspaper is reknowned and extremely popular in western maharashtra esp. And why dont u do one thing,yeah!,lets talk about Suryantah kamath. I think his book not verifiable,he us controviersial which is being proven, he writes nonsense which we have seen by Dinesh's editing where he labels every historic empire as kannadi! (sarvagnya are mughals kannadi BTW????) I think we should bulldoze that kamat and Dinesh pseudo-history at once. I AM GIVING 12 HOURS TO SARVAGNYA (AS U AND DINESH ARE QUITE FRIENDLY PLZ PASS ON THIS MSG TO HIM).They should bring a neutral and verifiable source. NO KANNADA fanatic material.I will have to delete all the stuff which was cited by that childish and hillarious source.</dd>
<dd>Deccan herald which is obviously pro-karnataka and anti-Maharashtra and has published nonsense about Belgaum issue,is needless to say, is not acceptable in these articles.TOI, IE and other NATIONAL MEDIAS should only be used.It is nice that we are trashing out fanatic sources.</dd>

Naveenbm and KNM(it seems u have no other work than to impose ur language.I am amused to find that u ppl 'come' unitedly wherever u need to push ur POV). Read <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=109230" class="external text" title="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=109230" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html" class="external text" title="http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> to ascertain the majority of Maharashtrians and their 'opposition' to Kannada. Belgaum has 3/4th of population of Maharashtrians. They care less about Kannada. The order of transliteration is not followed as u said. U can find many articles which doesnt go alphabetically. Sanskrit is placed before <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">kannada</a> at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic_music.html" title="Carnatic music">Carnatic_music</a>. technically though Kannada should find here, at the ground zero there are no takers for kannada. yesterday's Black day has ascertained it.Stop ur POV pushing and taking advantage of 3RR rule. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 16:41, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand why people rake up a new issue each day. The transliteration order was this way all these days and there was no problem with it. All of a sudden, Bereft of any chauvinistic citations, this seems to have been raked up. Please let people contribute productively on wikipedia article pages, rather than waste their time on meaningless discussions on article talk pages. Request some admin to please take note of this. <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENaveenbm_8d5d.html" title="User:Naveenbm"><font color="blue"><b>Naveen</b></font></a> <sup><i>(<a href="../../../n/a/v/User_talk%7ENaveenbm_b53b.html" title="User talk:Naveenbm">talk</a>)</i></sup> 16:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have requested Blnguyen's intervention. And btw please dont blame all on me. Your Kannada friends are being chauvinist and dont assume good faith. U might be knowing the all fuss about my Tarun Bharat citation was all unnecessary and childish. The citations I gave now are far from being chauvinist. The transliteration was that way because I didnt have any citations. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 17:02, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Misuse of 3RR rule</span></h3>
<p>Naveen has reverted the article even though I gave him citations and told him to wait for admin's intervention. This shows the Kannada users are in no way of Good faith edits and unnecessarily provoke. naveen was prompt to wake up to help POV pushing here after 2-3 hours wikibreak as soon as KNM had his first revert here.(see-Belgaum page history and Naveen's contribs) These people's action makes me paranoid!</p>

<dd>Clearly they are misusing 3RR rule and using 'mob' power to push their POV. I await admin's verdict. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 17:11, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Literacy</span></h2>
<p>I think the literacy numbers are incorrect. If 54% of men are literate and 45% of women, then how come total literacy is 78%??.</p>
