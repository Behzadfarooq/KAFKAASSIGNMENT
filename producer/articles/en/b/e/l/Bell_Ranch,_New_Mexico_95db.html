<p>The <b>Bell Ranch</b> originated with two Spanish land grants to Don Pablo Montoya in 1824. Lying along LaCinta Creek near the Canadian River, the historic Bell Ranch is bordered by present day Conchas Lake about 60 miles from <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucumcari.html" title="Tucumcari">Tucumcari</a> in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_County_03f9.html" title="San Miguel County">San Miguel County</a>. The land originally totaled 719,000 acres of rolling grasslands bordered by red rimrocked canyons and flat topped mountains called "mesas". This included the bell shaped mountain for which the ranch was named and the distinctive bell brand fashioned. This well known brand was first registered in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_County_03f9.html" title="San Miguel County">San Miguel County</a> in 1875 by then owner, Wilson Waddingham. The brand has been in continuous use on the ranch since that time.</p>
<p>This land holds a fascination by all who have passed through. The Native Americans, Comanche, Kiowa and Apache, hunted the buffalo and ground their corn in the well placed grinding holes where they could scan the horizon for friend and foe. Pictographs, carved in the red cliffs indicate the native Americans may well have been living there a long time before the 1500s. The Spanish rule would be followed by the Mexicans and then to be taken in by the US. Upon acquisition of the New Mexico territory, the U.S. Cavalry established a temporary post at the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Ranch_Headquarters_9c1d.html" title="Bell Ranch Headquarters">Bell Ranch Headquarters</a> for a time, using a part of the manager's house as a "map room" and post office while surveying the surrounding area. Even the famous Charles Goodnight of the Goodnight Cattle trail utilized one of the prominent mesas of the ranch, Gavilan, to navigate on the way to Colarado with his cattle herds.</p>
<p>The ensuing century brought a line of unique pioneering individuals. One interesting example, British born John H. Culley, came as a young man to learn about ranching in northeastern New Mexico. He served as assistant manager in the late 1800s. Educated at Oxford, he eloquently recorded the ranch life in his book "Cattle, Horses and Men". He wrote "It is -for I know it- a world where the summers are long and hot and if in winter a flurry of snow comes, it is gone by noon; where things grow readily in the loose red soil and the rim rocks are vermilion. A world where few pines are to seen, but the hill and mesa sides are covered with juniper and the flats with mesquite, and the sunflowers grow higher than a man on horseback in the bottoms." Later, Albert K. Mitchell, a man of significant distinction was to serve as manager. His long list of accomplishments included President of the American Hereford Cattle Breeders Association, an elected member of the New Mexico State House of Representatives, President of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association and a founder of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Quarter_Horse_Association_c6d8.html" title="American Quarter Horse Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a>. Mitchell, understandably busy with all these responsibilities, utilized a small plane to commute to all his activities. He had built a hanger &amp; runway at the Bell which stands today. He certainly was one of the first to use airplane flight to commute for agricultural pursuits.</p>
<p>In 1947, the ranch went through a significant re-division with the Bell Ranch headquarters, the name, and brand being retained with approximately 130,000 acres near the center of the Montoya grant and five other portions sectioned off. This was purchased by Harriet Keeney of Connecticut and her family. Ranch historians have said that before the '47 re-organization, the Bell Ranch was the largest single ranch in New Mexico and at one time was "the oldest deeded ranch built in a single operation in the entire Southwest."</p>
<p>In more modern times, the Bell Ranch has been known for the quality of beef cattle produced and the pioneering concepts that went into those herds. The concepts of "beef production testing" were laid down at the Bell under the guidance of long time manager, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_F._Ellis_927e.html" title="George F. Ellis">George F. Ellis</a> (manager 1946 to 1970). Over time, the purebred hereford stock where measured and selected to improve desirable inherited traits. The proven performance advances were significant and groundbreaking. Ellis would be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Beef Cattle Industry and honors from a host of other established organizations for his work. Ellis wrote about his experiences in the book, "The Bell Ranch As I Knew It" covering the Bell operations during his tenure. The book itself turned out to be an outstanding endeavor, winning the '74 Wrangler Award for Best Western Book of the Year from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Cowboy_%26_Western_Heritage_Museum_ba29.html" title="National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum">National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum</a>. He wrote " The Bell is a good ranch - one of the best in the Southwest. Cattle people and college people from all over the world came to visit there." He lists countries represented by these frequent visitors from an impressive five continents. He concludes "The demands and privileges of the Bell touched all our lives - and left them richer."</p>
<p>Over the centuries, the Bell Ranch has attracted many notable artists and writers with its beauty and unique qualities. Renowned Canadian artist <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lougheed_8471.html" title="Robert Lougheed">Robert Lougheed</a> visited the ranch numerous times taking inspiration from the horses, people and places to create a significant body of work recognized by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Cowboy_%26_Western_Heritage_Museum_ba29.html" title="National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum">National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum</a> and numerous other organizations. In the 40's, famed photographer Harvey Caplin took many well known images in black and white. Some of these have been extensively used by the Stetson Hat Company for promotion since that time as the quintessential western iconography. The '50's television show "Rawhide" also utilized Bell Ranch panoramas in their scenes. In 1975, a film called "Cowboy Heaven" was filmed by David Ellis about the true western cowboy featuring the ranch and the then current cowboys of the Bell. Further the list of published books and articles about the Bell is significant. The American Quarter Horse Journal has published well illustrated articles about the ranch on several occasions as had the "Western Horseman" magazine. In addition to the works by Culley and Ellis already mentioned, Martha Downer Ellis, wife of Manager George Ellis, found subject for her historical inquiries and poems in her published books.</p>
<p>On The Ranch</p>
<p>Caught in a dream are we who live here -</p>
<p>Bound by a magic that no man knows.</p>
<p>all the bitter winds of winter,</p>
<p>All the burning winds of June,</p>
<p>Lie clean forgot</p>
<p>When we ride forth on a fair and sunny day.</p>
<p>written by Martha Downer Ellis</p>
<p>In 1970 ownership of the largest-single chunk--so large it has its own Zip Code, 88441--was acquired by William N. Lane II of Chicago, chairman and CEO of publicly traded General Binding Corp., a maker of office supplies and equipment. Further purchases of the original grant land have fleshed out the holding to its present size. Lane himself died in a 1978 car accident on the ranch. The ranch is now owned by a trust for Bill Lane's five children. A non-family member manages the ranch, although one son, Jeff, raises his family on the Bell.</p>
<p>Today the Bell Ranch stands at 250,000 of the original 719,000 acres of a century and a half ago. The white faced red hereford cattle of Ellis' tenure are gone. The present day herds feature of a cross consisting of the original Hereford, Red Angus, Gelbvieh, Brahman to create the "Red Bell" herd. These animals must be hardy on a grassland which averages 16 inches of rainfall per year and perform in the competitive marketplace. The ranch currently runs 3,000 breeding cows in their primary breeding herds.</p>
