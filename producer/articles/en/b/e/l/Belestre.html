<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belestre.html" title="Edit section: Biography:">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography:</span></h2>
<p>1716: November 17 (but some archives report 1719) Belestre was born in Lachine (Qc), part of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>.</p>
<p>1738: Francois-Marie Picoté, sieur de Belestre, married Marie Anne Nivard Saint-Dizier (daughter of de Pierre Nivard Saint-Dizier), at Montreal in Notre-Dame Parish on July 28. They had six children. François - Louis (born in 1739) (ref: Joachime Coulon de Villiers in 1762 in Fort Chartres), Marie-Joseph (born in 1741), Etienne (born in 1742), François-Xavier (born in 1743), Anne (born in 1746) &amp; Marie-Archangel (born in 1748).</p>
<p>1739: like his father, François-Marie de Belestre starts his military career in the French Marine troops of the colonies of New France. He served in the Chickasaw Indian campaign which is said to be his first battle. At about 20 years old, Belestre is an ensign engaged in fighting the Iroquois Nation.</p>
<p>1741: He was quickly promoted to an ensign “en second”.( A N Colonies C11A 75:239v)</p>
<p>1746: He takes Fort Louisburg back from the English.</p>
<p>1747 (May or August until 1748): He was installed in command of Saint-Joseph Fort (ref: Ibid., 116:160 ). Belestre assited Pierre-Joseph Celoron, Sieur de Blainville, in escorting convoys from Montreal to Detroit.</p>
<p>1749: he is sent to France to provide account of the situation to the Royal Marine Minister. 1749 to 1759: he is given the responsibility to look after and maintain the trade of fur in Michigan.</p>
<p>1751: he is asked to carry out a punitive raid on “La Demoiselle” village (ref: post, 417, 419, 444).</p>
<p>1751 (Fall) to 1752: he is sent to France to be cured of a wound and report of the situation. (A N Colonies C11A 97:198).</p>
<p>1751 (end) or 1752: Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.</p>
<p>1752: he is back in Canada, in charge of Wabash Post (ref: Ibid., 119:316).</p>
<p>1753: On January 29, following the death of his wife, Belestre married Marie Ann Magnan also in Montreal.</p>
<p>1754: He was recommended for promotion to ensign “en pied”. (ref: Ibid, 99:282v.)</p>
<p>1755: Belestre commanded a troop of colonial marines and Indians, decisive in Braddocks defeat. For his contribution to the defeat of Braddocks forces, Belestre was awarded with the Royal Military Order of Saint Louis (Chevalier de St Louis).</p>
<p>1756 (April): Leading a raiding party to the Carolinas, Belestre takes the command of a troop of 20 French, 150 Miami, Ouiatonon &amp; Shawnee, in the battle of Fort Duquesne (Pittsburg) during which he is wounded in the arm. He participated in Montclam's victory at Fort George in New York, On the same year, Belestre was placed in command of the “Fort de <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a>”, where he is lieutenant.</p>
<p>1757: In the summer, he then receives the order to launch a new raid on the English Fort of <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> in Virginia, with the troops of the “Marine du Belestre”, with 12 French soldiers, 40 allied natives and 300 men but they were attacked on their way back.</p>
<p>1757 (May 30): Belestre was captured by Edmund Atkyn, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for St George, with a party of Cherokees and British troops. Belestre’s nephew, Philippe Dagneau of Saussaye, St.Ours and three French soldiers are killed.</p>
<p>He was questioned by Atkyn in the presence of Colonel <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and George Croghan, Deputy to Sir <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Johnson_3abd.html" title="William Johnson">William Johnson</a>. The history files did not say if he was released or if it is escaped, but he succeeded in finding his way towards <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> by start of the fall of 1757. On November 28, he takes what remains of his troops –about 300 Canadians and Indians soldiers from <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> - towards Fort Frontenac (now Kingston, Ontario). They move East towards the Mohawk Valley. Captain Belestre received the order –probably from Vaudreuil, Governor of New France, to attack the Palatine settlement of “German Flats”, where they destroy the place, kill 50 English settlers and make 150 prisoners (men, women and children). Most of the houses and buildings were burned. Using this “hit and run” tactic, common during this war, the damage caused was important. This last raid was regarded as a considerable victory for France, by the fact that this relatively small team had succeeded in penetrating in a part of what is now New York, without much opposition. They took what remained of the food, horses and cows, which they carried back to Montreal.</p>
<p>1758: and until 1760, Belestre is recorded of holding the rank of Captain and became the 13th official commander of Fort Ponchartrain du Detroit (ref: P R O CO 5, 219-222.), originally founded by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_de_Lamothe_Cadillac_da21.html" title="Antoine de Lamothe Cadillac">Antoine de Lamothe Cadillac</a> in 1701. This happened after the death of the Detroit commandant, Nicholas D'aneau, Sieur de Muy in 1758. Assisted by Pierre Passerat de La Chapelle, he commands a small army in a Fort which was more of a fur center than a military Fort. Because of the great numbers of Indian Allies camped around the fort, it was not considered necessary by the French Army to garrison the post with many troops like it was in the past. But it soon became a warehouse of supplies and equipment for the troops of the North West. 1759: Belestre is made Knight of the Military Order of Saint-Louis in January. As the French settlements in the east started falling to the British Crown, few of the citizens of New France went to Detroit to seek protection. He participated in the French effort to relieve Fort Niagara that same year.</p>
<p>1760: More Colonial Troupes of France are sent to fortify the Fort Detroit Garrison (founded in 1701 and also named <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontchartrain.html" title="Pontchartrain">Pontchartrain</a>, in honor of Comte de Pontchartrain, Marine Minister of Louis XIV). But in the late summer of 1760, French Governor Vaudreuil surrendered Montreal and the rest of French Canada to the British At that time, all communications with France and the rest of the French troops are broken, and Detroit is totally isolated. Belestre had heard nothing of the French capitulation.</p>
<p>General Amherst ordered Major <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Rogers_ddaa.html" title="Robert Rogers">Robert Rogers</a>, (soldier, (1731-1795), 18th century American colonial officer, explorer and playwright) to ascend the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, and surrender Fort Detroit, Michillimackinac (presently named Mackinaw) and other French forts in the area. Major Robert Rogers was also given instructions to avoid a battle on Detroit unless necessary. On September 13, 1760, with “two hundred Rangers in fifteen whale-boats” (some archives mention the 60th Royal Americans troops and Rogers’ Rangers), Rogers leaves from Montreal, in charge of taking Detroit off the French and raising the British flag over key enemy’s fort. Rogers had previously created a unit called Rogers' Rangers in 1756 (the first Rangers). On November 7 the contingent reached a river, named by Rogers in his books “the Chogage” (now named the Cuyahoga), south shore of Lake Erie.</p>
<p>Legend tells that close to the Detroit River, near the present day city of Trenton, Michigan, Ottawa Chief <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiac.html" title="Pontiac">Pontiac</a> confronted the British party by the following "By whose permission do you dare to enter my country". After explaining to Pontiac about the French defeat, and that Detroit was British, Pontiac allowed the Rogers’ forces to proceed in the morning. History tells that Rogers offered Pontiac a peace-belt, and asked the Ottawans to go with him to Detroit, in order to take part in the surrender Pontiac said that he would get an answer the next morning; following traditions, they smoked the calumet in turn; but Rogers was suspicious of the Indians. In the morning, Ottawans accepted Rogers’ offer, and the younger Indian warriors agreed to accompany the British. A week of stormy weather kept them on site while the Indians fed the camp with venison and turkey, paid by Rogers. Rogers' Rangers, by then a famous body of British &amp; Indian-fighters, moved forward towards Detroit on November 12. But faithful to his word, Pontiac had however sent a messenger to Belestre to convey the message from the British, hoping that the French &amp; Indian troops would get ready to fight or escape. Ottawans then removed their protection to their French allies. When Belestre heard of the news, he ordered his troops and other Indian Allies – mainly Pottowatomiws &amp; Hurons - on full alert. Belestre also sent small French detachments to other French posts, to get help and find out if the capitulation was true.</p>
<p>Approaching the fort, Rogers sent a runner to Detroit with a letter for Belestre, notifying him that the western posts now belonged to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_George_1dd9.html" title="King George">King George</a>. His messenger explained Belestre that Rogers had a letter from the Marquis de Vaudreuil and a copy of the capitulation. Beletre got very upset, irritated by the defeated, the idea that he could lose his post and had strong doubts about the message. Could he trust Rogers, an enemy and his messenger? No real proofs were given. Four hundred soldiers were stationed at the entrance of the Detroit River to obstruct any further advance from Rogers’ troops. Belestre intended to fight and arrested the officer who provided Rogers' message. Beletre's doubts were reinforced by the fact that no French officers had confirmed the situation in Montreal and he sent messengers to try and find out the truth. The next morning, near to what is now Ecorse city (Michigan), the British troops approached Fort Detroit and Rogers sent Captain Donald Campbell with a small party to Belestre, carrying an official copy of Montreal’s capitulation together with Vaudreuil's letter instructing Beletre to surrender his fort to him. These documents were convincing enough, and Beletre capitulated. On November 29, Rogers took possession of Fort Detroit. A ceremony followed, assembling some seven hundred Indians ever ready to take sides with the winning party, painted and plumed in honour of the British victory. Indians expected fabulous presents, clothing, ammunition, and alcohol from the new comers. Lilies of France got lowered and the cross of St George went up the flagstaff. The remains of «&#160;Les Soldats de la Troupes de la Marine de la Compagnie du Fort de Détroit&#160;» was small, only made of 35 soldiers, including three officers: Captain Francois-Marie Picote de Belestre, Lieutenant Beranger, Ensign D'aneau, as well as Surgeon Major Christopher Gabriel Le Grande. They were against Rogers’ two hundred men and their allied Indians. The French got disarmed and obliged to reluctantly pledge allegiance to the British King.</p>
<p>Captain Campbell took over command of the fort, while Belestre and his soldiers were made prisoners of war and sent to Philadelphia in chains, escorted by two officers under the command of Lieutenant Holmes and twenty men. Belestre’s French carrier ended at this time. He is sent off England</p>
<p><br />
1763: Although Beletre was in bitter spirit about the defeat, he was also very disappointed about the French Crown, letting New France and his <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acadians.html" title="Acadians">Acadians</a> down. He then found out that the French government was closed to bankruptcy after the Seven Years War, and had no choice but to stop all fights. He also realised that the party was definitely lost and he became reconciled to British rule. Born American more than French, his aim was to stay in Montreal where he was born, with his family.</p>
<p>1764: He was released in England and returned to Canada via France. He then became a highly respected citizen of Quebec.</p>
<p>1767: Belestre was a part of the Jury during Thomas Walker’s affair.</p>
<p>24 June 1771: Belestre took part in St. Peter's Lodge (Provincial Grand Lodge of Quebec) as "Premier Surveillant" with Pierre Gamelin. (ref: Historique de la Grande Loge du Québec, Francs-Maçons)</p>
<p>1775: during the American invasion, he was voluntary took up arms again to the defence of his friends of fort Saint-Jean (St John’s fort), on the Richelieu river and was made prisoner of war in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><br />
1776: on May 1, he was named “Grand Voyer” of the Province of Quebec and as recognition for his services in the Revolutionary War, has was made provincial lieutenant-colonel in the Québec Militia on July 12, 1790.</p>
<p>1775: Member of the legislative Council on August 17.</p>
<p>1784: appointed as member of the executive Council.</p>
<p>1789: Some files report that he was in Paris the very same day of the execution of Louis XVI (to verify).</p>
<p>1792: He was decorated with the medal of Saint Helene.</p>
<p>1792&#160;: from January - to March 30 1792 when he became too weak, he was appointed a member to the first Legislative Council of Lower Canada for 3 months.</p>
<p>1793 (March 30): he dies in Montreal, at the age of 76 years and 4 months. He was buried in the parish of Notre-Dame, April 2 193.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Paris, signed by the United Kingdom, France and Spain on February 10, 1763, will put a term to the 7 year old war (1754-1763). France yielded Canada and its territories, the East of Mississippi to England, and Spain gave Florida to England. France kept the island of “St Pierre &amp; Miquelon” in the Gulf of St Laurent.</p>

<p>Belestre’s family comes from the French nobility and their line can be traced back to France in the 1400's. The family played a significant role in the affairs of the French regime, New France and subsequently after the English takeover in about 1760. Belestre’s father bears the same name - Francois Marie Picote, Sieur de Belestre I (born in Montreal 1677 - 1729). His father was described as an officer or garrison commander of the fort of Ville-Marie (now Montreal), a title that he shared with <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Dollard_des_Ormeaux_8e09.html" title="Adam Dollard des Ormeaux">Adam Dollard des Ormeaux</a>, (1635 – May, 1660). His father was also governor of the Detroit fort as acting Commandant in de Tonty's absence, in 1721/22 (winter) (ref: Detroit’s archives). His mother was Marie-Catherine Trottier des Ruisseaux de Beaubien (1681-1731). Belestre is a descendant of “Pierre Picotté, Sieur de Belestre” (as listed within the «&#160;Recensement de Montréal en 1666&#160;» when he was 39 years old). François-Louis, Francois Marie‘s oldest son by the first marriage, followed his father into les troupes de la marine and later settled in Louisiana." Francois Marie’s sister, Marie-Anne Picoté de Belestre married a close friend of the family, “Louis Cesaire Dagneau de Douville, Sieur de Quindre dit Fontenay”, a prominent merchant and trader in what is now Michigan and the Ohio Valley’s south. After the massive Acadian’s forced exodus, descendants of Belestre (or Belletre, Bélêtre) are found in city and parish registries across North America, Germany and France.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belestre.html" title="Edit section: Character:">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character:</span></h2>
<p>Belestre had the reputation of a courageous, resistant &amp; brave fighter and it has been written that “Belestre has surmounted all the obstacles which arose before him at each instant.” Belestre was considered a capable and efficient warrior by his superiors and a frightening threat for his enemies. It is surprising that he never got killed while fighting, or executed once made prisoner of war on several occasions. According to reports found in the Quebec Historical Society: ”After the capture of Fort DuQuesne in 1758, General Forbes planned an attack on Detroit. Sieur de Belestre, having heard that the enemy was marching, put himself at the head of the Hurons and other Indians to give an attack to the advance guard, which he defeated.” Belestre was also said to write “French with an inimitable German phonetization” in a Paris journal.</p>
