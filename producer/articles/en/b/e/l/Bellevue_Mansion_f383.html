<p>Bellevue remained in the Wharton family for more than 60 years.

Paralleling the creek nearby was Nicetown Lane, leading about a half mile down to the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schuylkill_River_bf9c.html" title="Schuylkill River">Schuylkill River</a>.</p>
<p>William and <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_Fisher_Wharton_30a4.html" title="Deborah Fisher Wharton">Deborah</a> were heavily involved in religious affairs of their <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker_Meeting_9606.html" title="Quaker Meeting">Quaker Meeting</a> and in the period 1825-1840 depended on Bellevue with its house-mistress to keep their children occupied during the summer months. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wharton_87a4.html" title="Joseph Wharton">Joseph</a> and his brother Charles and their siblings often walked down Nicetown Lane to the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schuylkill_River_bf9c.html" title="Schuylkill River">Schuylkill River</a>, where they cooled off during the summer.</p>

<p>Starting in the 1840s, Bellevue was threatened by local development. In 1839, the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_Railroad_7f6f.html" title="Reading Railroad">Reading Railroad</a> built its main line from Philadelphia to Norristown and north to Reading. The line ran about 30 yards from Bellevue Mansion on the north. The surrounding land, between <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germantown%2C_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_b585.html" title="Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Germantown</a> and the city limits of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_PA_052f.html" title="Philadelphia, PA">Philadelphia</a>, today's <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Philadelphia_561c.html" title="North Philadelphia">North Philadelphia</a>, was relatively undeveloped, and in the period <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a> entrepreneurs bought up many of the old estates for industrial sites and housing developments. To the younger generation of that time, the railroads represented progress, allowing anyone to travel quickly and boosting the economy of the region. This was especially true for <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wharton_87a4.html" title="Joseph Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a> and his siblings, who accepted such worldly improvements, and became immersed in the industrial economy. The trains were convenient, with a "Bellevue" station within a short walk of the mansion. But they also carried huge loads of coal, thundering by the house at inconvenient times, and the constant noise was annoying for guests staying at Bellevue. Although still a beautiful estate, its utility as a respite from city life would be limited.</p>
<p>In 1854 <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Consolidation%2C_1854_86df.html" title="Act of Consolidation, 1854">Philadelphia expanded its borders</a> to include the surrounding suburbs, and after the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> its <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html#Demographics" title="Philadelphia">population</a> swelled to several hundred thousand. By 1870 the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centennial_Exposition_0807.html" title="Centennial Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a> was upcoming, and Philadelphia was rapidly changing. It was suffering from a water crisis because it required more water, but there was no appropriate method for water purification and the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware.html" title="Delaware">Delaware</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schuylkill.html" title="Schuylkill">Schuylkill</a> rivers were heavily polluted. Philadelphia's <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhoid_fever.html" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> rate was among the highest in the nation, and most well-to-do families drank bottled spring water.</p>

<p>Although Bellevue had been threatened since the 1840s by the proximity of the nearby railroads, it was now threatened more directly. In the 1870s the entire Bellevue estate, then owned by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wharton_87a4.html" title="Joseph Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a> and his siblings, along with several other estates nearby that had been annexed into the city, was threatened with condemnation by the city for the construction of the proposed Cambria Reservoir to hold <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potable_water.html" title="Potable water">potable water</a>. The Wharton siblings were angry and frustrated that there seemed no recourse when the city chose their estate on which to build.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wharton_87a4.html" title="Joseph Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a> saw a potential solution to the water problems. He started purchasing land in southern <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> in the 1870s, eventually acquiring 150 square miles in the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_Barrens_%28New_Jersey%29_23dc.html" title="Pine Barrens (New Jersey)">Pinelands</a> which contained an <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquifer.html" title="Aquifer">aquifer</a> replenished by several rivers and lakes. The water from the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_Barrens_%28New_Jersey%29_23dc.html" title="Pine Barrens (New Jersey)">Pinelands</a> was relatively pure and he planned to export the water to Philadelphia. Wharton suggested that a city-controlled company could develop the necessary <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_mains.html" title="Water mains">water mains</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pumps.html" title="Pumps">pumps</a>, funded by public purchase of stocks and bonds. There was opposition to the plan by others in Philadelphia and in New Jersey, and eventually a law was passed in New Jersey preventing the export of water.</p>

<p>The Bellevue estate was taken by the city, but the planned reservoir was never constructed, because of local politics and also because by 1890 water could be <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_purification.html" title="Water purification">purified</a> by filtration, obviating the need for an extra reservoir. Instead Bellevue was sold to developers. It sat unmaintained and boarded up for a decade, and was finally demolished in construction of new housing for the newly organized industry nearby in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Philadelphia_561c.html#Early_history" title="North Philadelphia">North Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the location of Bellevue Mansion is a small playground between N Marston and N Etting Streets, just north of Allegheny Avenue in North Philadelphia.</p>
