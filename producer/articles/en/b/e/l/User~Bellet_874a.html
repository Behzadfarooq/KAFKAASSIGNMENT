<p><b>Isabelle Turell - National Level Bodybuilder</b> Vital Statistics:</p>
<p>Full Name: Isabelle Selena Turell (a lot of people know me as Belle)</p>
<p>Height: 5-4</p>
<p>Weight: 175</p>
<p>Birth date: 10-22</p>
<p>Birth place: Tampa,FL</p>
<p>Age: 27</p>
<p>Current living: Orlando, FL</p>
<p>Current profession: Full time student, business owner(Signiture Fitness) , Personal trainer, nutrition counselor, rejuvenation specialist and writer</p>
<p>What did I do before body building? I played a lot of sports in high school. My favorite was soccer. I played Soccer for nine years competitive. I loved the sport. I played center defense. Awesome position. I loved getting dirty and slide tackling. But I had to stop for a while because I tore a ligament in my knee. I was going to have surgery. To be honest I chickened out. The sports doctor was going to put screws in my knee or someone else's ligament. Just talking about it gives me the chills.The other sports I played was softball,wrestling, volleyball, and track.</p>
<p>How and when I got involved into bodybuilding/lifting weights? This is a good question, of course I played sports so I had to be fit to play my role in the game. I do admit I was a fatty little thing. I had a little belly and huge thighs. I was nicknamed “thunder thighs”. Anyway, once in a while I lifted weights but I didn't’t know nothing about how to lift a weight or exercise with weight training. My whole life did a 360 when I was 20 yrs old. I really wasn't’t a fan of muscles and bodybuilding. I thought it was silly. I used to watch a lot of Saturday night live, where they had this skit of dana Carvey and another guy making fun of bodybuilding. The skit was 2 guys named “hans and franz”. I laughed my but off. Anyway, I was really in the middle of a bad relationship. This guy constantly put me down, saying that I would never be anything, and that I would be a loser. Well this guy was the real loser. He had a bad insecurity problem. I dropped him real fast. At that point I wanted to do something that I never done before. I ran into an old friend that was a bodybuilder. I don’t know what happened. I just decided “what the hell, you live only once”. I gave her a call and we hooked up. This was the biggest and best change of my life and eventually a meaning to what I was meant to be. I strongly believe that anyone can be successful and achieve there goals if they out there mind to it. Some people say “I can’t do it or I could never achieve that” Never say never or you can’t do something. Of course you can. I don’t just mean bodybuilding, I mean everything. Trust me, I know this from experience. Bodybuilding is not the Easiest sport, and it sure at the most inexpensive one either. I believe that to be successful in bodybuilding you have to do a couple of things 1. Think positive 2. stay on your diet (this is critical) If you make one little mistake on your diet it could set you back. 3. be dedicated and determined to be the best 4. don’t slack cardio 5. don’t skip meals and most of all training 6. be strong minded</p>
<p>First Competition: June 7, 2000 Orlando Classic: 1st middleweight ( 119 lbs ) Tied overall 2nd Competition June 14, 2000 Mid-Muscle Classic: 2nd heavyweight 3rd competition December 6, 2003 Excalibur: *1st and overall heavyweight</p>
<ul>
<li>this was a big unexpected success for me, I had a goal to do a show for 2003 and I only had one option left California. I really didn't want to go, but I had to. I had to know my outcome. It was a rough ride starting out with the diet. I forgot how bad the diet can be. I messed up on the diet a little bit. I could have came in a lot more better. But you can only look back and fix those little mistakes so you can be better the next time.</li>
