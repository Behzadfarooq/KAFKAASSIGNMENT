<p>The history reads as if the world went directly from step (or at least crossbar) directly to digital. The 1A ESS deserves a significant discussion (there's a Wikipedia stub for ESS, but no history of the Bell Labs/WeCo product) as an intermediary. The article cites the SP-1, but not its predessor, the 1ESS.</p>
<p>BNR got into the next-gen switching world when it first became feasible to digitize voice samples and thereby treat the data plane as a digital machine as well as the control plane, and to a lesser extent, the signalling plane, which had already been pioneered by others.</p>
<p>I would write this up myself, but I don't know the dates and details of the No. 1 ESS. It would be very helpful if someone who does know this would add a brief discussion here and perhaps expand it in a separate article.</p>

<p>Edward G. Nilges spinoza1111 spinoza1111@yahoo.com added information based on employment at BNR 1981-1986<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 09:56, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Love the old rune, "build it stroong, build it stoot, oot of things ye know aboot", for it reminds me of the old (pre-1984) Canadian BNR. It seems to have been replaced by "borrow money from your honey, and send it oot of the hoose for assembly".<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 10:09, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBell-Northern_Research_48d1.html" title="Edit section: Speculative and inappropriate statements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Speculative and inappropriate statements</span></h2>
<p>The sentence in the first paragraph on BNR losing its innovative and successful organization after being absorbed into Nortel is speculative. The statement about John Roth perceiving the use of proprietary technology as being part of "the problem" isn't really true, to my recollection. RISC and CISC technology doesn't play a role in the overall layering of the architecture (it is only at the microprocessor level, and the distinction pretty much went away during the 1990s), and in fact the traditional DMS product software loads underwent evolutionary changes that increased their layering, in order to improve maintainability.</p>
<p>219.77.104.213 04:35, 5 November 2006 (UTC)It's not speculative. What the hell is this, The Great or Bolshoi Soviet Encyclopedia? I'm talking about what happened to people. Shall they be erased in the name of the "scholarship" of Nortel moles, religious lunatics and convenience store clerks, destroying Wikipedia?</p>
<p>219.77.104.213 04:35, 5 November 2006 (UTC)Note that "RISC and CISC technology doesn't play a role in the overall layering of the architecture (it is only at the microprocessor level, and the distinction pretty much went away during the 1990s), and in fact the traditional DMS product software loads underwent evolutionary changes that increased their layering, in order to improve maintainability." is negative, therefore proof against discussion or refutation by design, and poorly written in corporate-obfuscate style.</p>
<p>219.77.104.213 04:35, 5 November 2006 (UTC)If you believe that "RISC and CISC technology doesn't play a role in the overall layering of the architecture", you're a tech too narrow to see the ideological and technical war that was declared on layering by the RISC kiddies.</p>
<p>The next to last sentence in the article mentions outsourcing for the first time, which doesn't really match the previous sentence talking about BNR being absorbed into Nortel (although there may be common underlying causes, one doesn't directly imply the other). I propose removing this sentence, since this part of the story is not part of the history of BNR, but instead that of Nortel.</p>
<p>219.77.104.213 04:35, 5 November 2006 (UTC)This is nonsense. BNR was reabsorbed into Nortel because Roth's strategy was completely opposed to inhouse development. I was there, and I heard the vile things that were said to people who developed in house or insisted on anything but a shoddy job, but clearly, here, a Nortel mole is proposing this ugly history and its victims, now in some cases part of the long term unemployed as a result of what Nortel did to them, be erased like Stalinist purge victims...along with the financial manipulation that occured at the same time, and which destroyed Nortel and its shareholder's value.</p>
<p>219.77.104.213 04:35, 5 November 2006 (UTC)Clearly Wikipedia has become the tool of corporate moles, religious lunatics and underinformed convenience store clerks.</p>

<p>As a co-op student at BNR in 1990, I often heard the place referred to as the "Big Nerd Ranch".</p>
