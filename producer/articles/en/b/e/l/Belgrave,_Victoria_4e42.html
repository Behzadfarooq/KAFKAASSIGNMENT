<p>Belgrave fell within the pastoral run of early pioneer <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Clow_cd65.html" title="James Clow">James Clow</a>. The initial settlement was built in the area now known as <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecoma%2C_Victoria_0dba.html" title="Tecoma, Victoria">Tecoma</a>. The area now known as Belgrave was settled as the railway line was established. The township was named after the property of local councillor E. W. Benson, itself probably named after the town of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrave%2C_Leicestershire_3de4.html" title="Belgrave, Leicestershire">Belgrave</a> in <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicestershire.html" title="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.

<p>A <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrow-gauge.html" title="Narrow-gauge">narrow-gauge</a> <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railway</a> was constructed in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, with the station in Belgrave initially called Monbulk.
