<p>Belal usually cuts his own hair. His preferred style is number one all over.</p>
<p><a name="Schooling" id="Schooling"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelalHaniffa_58c9.html" title="Edit section: Schooling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Schooling</span></h2>
<p>Belal began schooling many years ago. The exact nature of his initial schooling is unknown. However the earliest school he <i>does</i> remember going to is the Crescent Muslim Nursury School in Colombo, Sri Lanka. He attended it with a few of his maternal cousins. Initially they would all be sent in an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_rickshaw.html" title="Auto rickshaw">auto rickshaw</a> but later they were sent in a hired van. The van driver is remembered only as "Van Uncle."</p>
<p>Around 1993 he went to kindergarten in the Fahaheel English School, a private school run by the wretched English. It was there that he befriended Christian. He recalls entering a race in a sports meet and coming first because everyone else fell. He still has the medal.</p>
<p>Belal moved to the Jabriya Indian School around 1995, another private school, this time run by Indians. His first teacher in UKG (Upper Kindergarten, equivalent of prep in Australia) was Mrs Dicoto, who he remembers as a "good teacher." Next in grade one he had Ms Anne or Ms Anita or something, he doesn't remember.</p>
<p>In grade two he had Mrs Thomas, a cruel teacher who made him copy out a passage from some textbook about society.</p>
<p>Mid-grade two he changed schools again, this time to Delhi Public School (DPS), a branch of a school in Delhi, India. The school was later known as Fahaheel al-Watany Indian Private School (FAIPS). He had to sit an entrance exam for this school. It was here that he first encountered a worded problem in mathematics. His first teacher in this school at grade two was Ms Anita or Mrs Anne or something.</p>
<p>In grade 3 he had Mrs Chopra, a teacher who had taught another grade 2 class the previous year, and was loved by many of her students. That was a good year.</p>
<p>In grade 4 he had yet another teacher but he does not remember her name. He left Kuwait early 1998 and went to Sri Lanka before arriving in Australia in September 1998. In Sri Lanka he attended Crescent Boys School, run by the same people who ran his kindergarten. He did not enjoy it much there.</p>
<p>After arriving in Australia in September 1998 he was enrolled in Rosewood Downs Primary School, the school attended by his maternal cousins already living in Australia.</p>
<p>He currently goes to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_High_School_5f28.html" title="Melbourne High School">Melbourne High School</a> where he tries his best to fit in and look cool, doing a fairly good job. He is known for his love of <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tuna.html" title="Tuna">tuna</a> and also for his failed attempt at proclaiming himself world <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatboxing.html" title="Beatboxing">beatboxing</a> champion, which only failed because nobody believed him. He is a very diligent student and will consider donations to help fund his appetite.</p>
<p>Melbourne High School is the school where Belal has spent the most number of years schooling at. (feel free to restructure that sentence).</p>

<p>Belal sat his entrance examination in 2003. He made it via the normal way, i.e. straight in a.k.a. the respectable way. However he does not discriminate against those who got in other ways because he believes in equal opportunity and things like that.</p>
<p><a name="Year_9" id="Year_9"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelalHaniffa_58c9.html" title="Edit section: Year 9">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Year 9</span></h2>
<p>In year 9 (2003) he was in form 9G. This form was headed by Mr M Roberts who also tried to teach teh form science. The other teachers for the form were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr J Dovey - Mathematics</li>
<li>Ms J Randall - History</li>
<li>Mr R Pask - Geography</li>
<li>Mr N Fairlie - English (Replaced by Ms V Karvelas for semester 2)</li>
<li>Mr T Goodwyn - PE</li>
<li>Mr S Chua - Music (S1)</li>
<li>Ms M Poletti - 'Art' (S2)</li>
</ul>
<p>There were also elective and language subjects which varied among students. These are who taught Belal in year 9:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ms Kusack - Indonesian</li>
<li>Dr D Vine - Philosophy (S1)</li>
<li>Mr S McComb - Software Design (S2)</li>
</ul>
<p>In year 9 at MHS it is compulsory to do at least one extracurricular activity. The fact that Belal is more than just man manifested itself in the fact that he did three. He was part of the school's army cadet unit, in section 1 of &amp; Platoon, Ramsay Coy. This was under CPL S Ho who was under SGT S Clark who was under CUO I Leong.</p>
<p>Belal was also a member of the Reptiles, Amphibians and Fish club (RAF) where he he oversaw the death of the school's bluetongue and its subsequent replacement with a pair of bearded dragons (Graemie and George). At the end of teh year he recieved a merit certificate for his involvement.</p>
<p>He was also in one of the school's D-Grade debating teams. He maintained a consistent score of 75 across three debates. The first was against macrob, second against Melbourne Girls Grammar and third against Loretto Mandeville something. Belal quit the debating team at the end of the year because he didn't make it to the photo.</p>
<p>Belal attended the year 9 Milgrove Camp at Milgrove. He ended up in the cabin with the asians and Jarrod.</p>

<p>In year 10 Belal was in form 10C, headed by Ms Watterson who also taught him Visual Communication and Design for the first term. In the second term he had Ms Schubisefsky or something like that. His other teachers were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr M Yarrussky - Maths</li>
<li>Mr N Fairlie - English</li>
<li>Mr N Fairlie - Indonesian</li>
<li>Mr S Huysing - Science</li>
<li>Mr D Veale - PE</li>
<li>Mr C Axup - History (S1)</li>
<li>Ms Sturzacker - Geography (S2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Electives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ms T Fry - Photography (S2)</li>
<li>Mr I Dowling - Business Management (S1)</li>
<li>Mr M Roberts - Science Engineering (S2)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this year Belal was still part of RAF. He was also still in the cadet unit, having being promoted to the rank of Lance Corporal (LCPL) after completing an 8-day Junior Leadership Course at Puckapunyal, Victoria. He thought the course was rather depressing because he only got cheese sandwiches for lunch. As LCPL his post was "Storeman of Q Store" which was under the management of the Quartermaster, Captain Huysing, as well as the Assistant Quartermaster, CUO Alex Sloan. In this year Belal befriended fellow Q Worker, the Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant, SSGT Josh Slocombe. The two would end up in the same biology class the following year. Belal frequently got in trouble for not turning up to Q Store enough.</p>
<p>Belal also started doing Taekwondo for school sport at the suggestion of his slave, Jason Lai (who himself was a blackbelt). Belal was already doing taekwondo outside school and was a Yellowbelt at that stage. Belal took part in the interschool Taekwondo tournament with Trinity Grammar, but he didn't get very far.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelalHaniffa_58c9.html" title="Edit section: Year 11">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Year 11</span></h2>
<p>In year 11 Belal was in 11J with the form teacher being Ms Merkt, a rather cheerful woman. Her cheerfulness is popularly attributed to having Belal in her class although other factors may have had possible influence. Belal was deputy form captain of this form after losing the election to Jarrod O'Connell.</p>
<p>This was the first year of <a href="../../../v/c/e/VCE_392b.html" title="VCE">VCE</a> for Belal. His subjects were as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Units 1&amp;2 English - Ms S Merkt</li>
<li>Units 1&amp;2 Indonesian - Ms P Capon</li>
<li>Units 1&amp;2 Mathematical Methods - Mr J Tsinidis</li>
<li>Units 1&amp;2 General Mathematics (2) - Mr I Bull</li>
<li>Units 1&amp;2 Physics - Mr P Keyte</li>
<li>Units 3&amp;4 Biology - Mr J Tsinidis</li>
</ul>
<p>Belal's parents were very happy with his mid year report which only contained 2 B's, the rest being A's and A+'s. Thus they let him get an Xbox. This was the beginning of the demise of his education.</p>
<p>Also this year Belal continued on with Cadets and RAF. In cadets he was initially left unpromoted to be as a Langley Coy Section 2IC. He found this rather demeaning and complained to the CUO at the time, DuPlessis, who arranged to have him promoted to the rank of CPL. Later on he transferred from Langley to HQ but he never lost the Langley spirit.</p>
<p>In this year Belal's love for mathematics was greatly deepened, even though he could not ascertain it's gender. "We're just friends for now," he claimed.</p>
<p>Belal achieved A+'s for both his Biology exams but got an A for his SACs. Ultimately he got 39 which was "disappointing, yet real."</p>
<p>In this year Belal also made many new friends, such as Arnav Dayal and Martin Won.</p>
<p><a name="Year_12" id="Year_12"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelalHaniffa_58c9.html" title="Edit section: Year 12">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Year 12</span></h2>
<p>In 2006 Belal was in form 12F which was taken by Ms J Morgan. Belal got deputy form captain again but was later promoted to form captain due to unstated reasons. His teachers are as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Ms J Morgan - Units 3&amp;4 English (EN)</li>
<li>Ms P Capon - Units 3&amp;4 Indonesian (LN)</li>
<li>Ms F Petrie - Units 3&amp;4 Matehmatical Methods (MM)</li>
<li>Dr L Gunatilake - Units 3&amp;4 Specialist Mathematics (MS)</li>
<li>Mr S Kemp - Units 3&amp;4 Physics (PH)</li>
</ul>
<p>Belal attempted to run for SRC executive. He has some decent posters, even if he says so himself, but he came third in the election (which is not a race). Therefore he did not get the position. The previous year he had applied for SRC secretary but did not get that either.</p>
<p>Belal only had one midyear exam (physics) for which he got an A+. Belal also did well on the UMAT, with raw scores of 64, 57 and 61 in sections 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In terms of percentiles that translates to 94, 86 and 87. However Belal cannnot do any of the subjects which require the UMAT as they also require chemistry, which he did not study.</p>
<p>Belal obtained the following raw-scaled study scores in his subjects:</p>
<p>EN 40-39.58</p>
<p>LN 41-46.43</p>
<p>MM 43-46.99</p>
<p>MS 41-50.87</p>
<p>PH 42-44.71</p>
<p>BI 39-39.71</p>
<p>These scores gave Belal an aggregate of 192.3 and an ENTER of 98.85. What a gangster.</p>
<p>It was later discovered that VCAA actually calculated Belal's spec score wrong, and that he got 42 raw instead of 41, scaling to 51.5, giving him an aggregate of 192.9 giving him an enter of 98.90</p>

<p>Belal regularly interacts with fellow MHS students, however he is not known for interacting with much else apart from his computer, which notably lacks a graphics card, restricting his gaming experience to the 90's.</p>
