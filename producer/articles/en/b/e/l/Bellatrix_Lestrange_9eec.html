<p>Bellatrix Black was born in 1951 to Cygnus and Druella (Rosier) Black. She is related by blood and marriage to many characters in the novels: she has two younger sisters, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andromeda_Tonks_fe92.html" title="Andromeda Tonks">Andromeda</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissa_Malfoy_7b3c.html" title="Narcissa Malfoy">Narcissa</a>. Andromeda married a muggle-born, Ted Tonks, and was subsequently disowned by the Blacks; Narcissa married <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucius_Malfoy_8c5d.html" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a>, heir of a wealthy <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_purity_%28Harry_Potter%29_0a5e.html#Pure-blood" title="Blood purity (Harry Potter)">pure-blood</a> family. She is also a first cousin to <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sirius_Black_7a35.html" title="Sirius Black">Sirius</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regulus_Black_2a9a.html" title="Regulus Black">Regulus Black</a>, and an aunt to <a href="../../../n/y/m/Nymphadora_Tonks_248d.html" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draco_Malfoy_96c5.html" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>. Bellatrix married <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Dark_wizards_in_Harry_Potter_31ae.html#Rodolphus_and_Rabastan_Lestrange" title="Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter">Rodolphus Lestrange</a> after leaving <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogwarts.html" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a>. It is implied that she has no children. For more information on Bellatrix's pure-blood pedigree, see the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_family_tree_%28Harry_Potter%29_c1f0.html" title="Black family tree (Harry Potter)">Black family tree</a>.</p>
<p>At school, we are led to believe Bellatrix associated with a group of students - including <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Dark_wizards_in_Harry_Potter_31ae.html#Avery" title="Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter">Avery</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Dark_wizards_in_Harry_Potter_31ae.html#Rodolphus_and_Rabastan_Lestrange" title="Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter">Rodolphus Lestrange</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Dark_wizards_in_Harry_Potter_31ae.html#Evan_Rosier" title="Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter">Evan Rosier</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severus_Snape_75dc.html" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Dark_wizards_in_Harry_Potter_31ae.html#Wilkes" title="Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter">Wilkes</a> - who all nearly became <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Eaters_2d4b.html" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. It is assumed Bellatrix was at least initially drawn to <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Voldemort_f4c6.html" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> because they both believe in an ideology that favors pure-bloods over other members of the wizarding community. This elitism, shared by the Malfoy and Lestrange clans, was instilled in Bellatrix since childhood. The Black family motto, "toujours pur" (<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> for "always pure"), reflects this steadfast belief in blood purity.</p>

At their trial, Bellatrix proudly and defiantly proclaimed, "The Dark Lord will rise again, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barty_Crouch_Sr._f476.html" title="Barty Crouch Sr.">Crouch</a>!

<p>Fourteen years later, Bellatrix was one of the many Death Eaters who escaped Azkaban and rejoined Voldemort in January 1996. Over the years, her good looks were reduced to a remnant of their former beauty, making her appear gaunt and skeletal in mug shots printed in <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_newspapers_and_magazines_a848.html#The_Daily_Prophet" title="Harry Potter newspapers and magazines">The Daily Prophet</a></i>.</p>

<p>Bellatrix was present, in June of 1996, at the battle of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Magic_a2b4.html#Department_of_Mysteries" title="Ministry of Magic">Department of Mysteries</a>, in which a group of Death Eaters attempted to steal <a href="../../../s/y/b/Sybill_Trelawney_82df.html" title="Sybill Trelawney">Sybill Trelawney</a>'s prophecy pertaining to Voldemort's downfall. During the mission she proved her magical prowess by defeating two Aurors (<a href="../../../n/y/m/Nymphadora_Tonks_248d.html" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsley_Shacklebolt_8d49.html" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a>) in one-on-one duels, killing her cousin Sirius by knocking him through the Veil in the Death Chamber, and deflecting one of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albus_Dumbledore_087b.html" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s spells as she made her escape. Bellatrix was the only Death Eater to evade capture after the fight in the Department. However, she was subdued by Dumbledore in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Magic_a2b4.html" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>'s Atrium after duelling with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_%28character%29_66bc.html" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter</a>. Voldemort interceded on her behalf, grabbing her and taking her with him as he <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28Harry_Potter%29_3001.html#Apparition_and_Disapparition" title="Magic (Harry Potter)">Disapparated</a>.</p>
<p>Following Dumbledore's surmise of the Black family's inheritance tradition, as next of kin Bellatrix should have inherited her cousin Sirius' estate (including <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_12%2C_Grimmauld_Place_dd37.html" title="Number 12, Grimmauld Place">Number twelve, Grimmauld Place</a>) after his death (suggesting that the Common Laws preventing material gain through murder do not apply to wizards, or at least to the Black Family). However, Sirius willed his estate to his godson, Harry Potter. To make sure there would be no dispute over the legal ownership of Sirius's property (and prevent the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Phoenix_162f.html" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>'s headquarters from falling into enemy hands), <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kreacher.html" title="Kreacher">Kreacher</a> was brought before Harry to see if the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House-elf.html" title="House-elf">house-elf</a> would obey him. Despite Kreacher's intense hatred for Harry and fondness for Bellatrix, the magic that binds house-elves to servitude proved the legality of Harry's inheritance.</p>
<p>In July of 1996, Bellatrix attempted to keep Narcissa from confiding Draco's secret mission to Severus Snape at <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinner%27s_End_6e22.html" title="Spinner's End">Spinner's End</a>. She mistrusted Snape not only because of his low birth, but also for many valid questions about his loyalty to Voldemort. Snape surprised Bellatrix by asking her to bind him and Narcissa with an <a href="../../../u/n/b/Unbreakable_Vow_2fd0.html" title="Unbreakable Vow">Unbreakable Vow</a> to assist Draco. Later, Snape implied that Bellatrix was skilled in <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occlumency.html" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a> and had instructed Draco in the art to aid her nephew in his plan.</p>

<p>However, Bellatrix played a major role in the <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> novel and, consequently, the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_%28film%29_b646.html" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)"><i>Order of the Phoenix</i> film</a>.

<p>With the release of the first teaser trailer for the film came the first look at Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix. Bonham Carter can be seen wearing an all-black ensemble, sporting frazzled hair and heavy make-up.</p>
<p>In early December 2006, US Television network <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> aired behind-the-scenes footage and interviews from the upcoming film, including an interview with Bonham Carter. In the interview, she stated that Bellatrix is "sexy" and that she had "great fun" creating the character's look for the film.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellatrix_Lestrange_9eec.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>It has been suggested at several points in the narrative that Bellatrix is either unbalanced or insane. For example, in the Department of Mysteries, she is described as having "mad eyes" and has a "fanatical glow" in her face; she loses all self-control whenever Harry "besmirches" the name of Voldemort. In <i>The Half-Blood Prince</i>, she is described as "snarling," "passionate" and it is said that "in her fury she looked slightly mad." She also has a fierce and dangerous temper, a trait she shares with her cousin Sirius, her aunt Walburga, and - it is discovered in <i>The Half-Blood Prince</i> - her sister Narcissa. She also has paranoid tendencies (killing a fox for fear that it is a spy) and is easily distracted when riled (e.g. in the Department of Mysteries).</p>
<p>Bellatrix is fanatically devoted to Voldemort (who in turn uses her pet name, Bella). For example, she proudly boasts to Harry of having been personally taught the Dark Arts by Voldemort himself; she comments that, if she had a son, she would willingly give him into the service of the Dark Lord; and, most notably, she was willing to boast of her service to him even as she was being sentenced to Azkaban. She also splutters in her meeting with Snape at Spinners End that "The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious-", though she never clarifies this further. Though Dumbledore points out that many Death Eaters see themselves as Voldemort's "closest" servant, Bellatrix's devotion and service may well make her worthy of that title, though Voldemort, of course, does not repay her the same level of love as she gives to him.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bellatrix was the first female Death Eater introduced in the series. She remained the only woman explicitly identified as such until <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Dark_wizards_in_Harry_Potter_31ae.html#Alecto_and_Amycus" title="Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter">Alecto</a> was introduced in <i>Half-Blood Prince.</i></li>
<li>Bellatrix's name translates exactly as the feminine of "warrior" (noun) in Latin, though the abbreviation <i>Bella</i> also suggests beauty.</li>
<li>Like many members of the Black family, Bellatrix is named after a star. Bellatrix, also known as <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_Orionis_abae.html" title="Gamma Orionis">Gamma Orionis</a>, is one of the brightest stars in the constellation <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28constellation%29.html" title="Orion (constellation)">Orion</a>.</li>
<li>Bellatrix's name has been translated into other languages in a variety of ways. Many of the changes accentuate the evil nature of her character, such as the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_language.html" title="Norwegian language">Norwegian</a> "Bellatrix <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">DeMons</a>" or <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> "Bellatrix <a href="../../../v/e/n/Vendetta.html" title="Vendetta">van Detta</a>".</li>
<li>A trophy awarded to "Bellatrix Black" can be seen in the "Fan Sites" section of J.K. Rowling's official website (<a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Flash_4bba.html" title="Adobe Flash">Flash</a> version only).</li>
