<p>Belizeans <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_Belize_unrest_4309.html" title="2005 Belize unrest">protested</a> for most of 2005 over the conditions of the country and the seeming ignorance of the ruling People's United Party toward these conditions. Toward the end of 2005 the PUP and the Opposition UDP turned their attention to preparing for the municipal elections in 2006.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belizean_municipal_elections%2C_2006.html" title="Edit section: UDP preparations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">UDP preparations</span></h2>
<p>The UDP held their convention to select candidates in Belize City on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">October 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, with winner Zenaida Moya doubling up her three male competitors, Bernard Watler, Rudolph “Sir Andie” Anderson, and Ernesto Torres in the mayoral race, and a field of 22 councillor candidates being narrowed to ten, those ten being: Laura Esquivel, Hyacinth Latchman, Leila Peyrefitte, Anthony Michael, Phillip Willoughby, Dean Samuels, Mark King, Calvert Quilter, Gilroy Middleton, and Wayne Usher. (Channel 5, October 24) Moya possessed a strong resume and support from various sectors of society which pushed her over the top. The UDP subsequently selected candidates for the other councils between mid-November 2005 and February 2006. One convention of note happened in <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benque_Viejo_del_Carmen_3c1d.html" title="Benque Viejo del Carmen">Benque Viejo</a>, where sitting Mayor Said Badi Guerra was unseated in conventions in December in favour of former Mayor Marconi Sosa. (Channel 5, December 12) Another incident came on February 10, when <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dangriga.html" title="Dangriga">Dangriga</a> mayoral nominee Frank Mena was injured in a freak accident and confined to his hospital bed through election day. Mena was nominated on and won election from his hospital bed for the UDP.</p>
<p>The UDP released its manifesto for Belize City and the other municipalities on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Its adopted slogan was "Life Haad Out Ya! Vote UDP 7/11 for Change Now!"</p>

<p>In Belize City, the slate of eleven was selected on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. Sitting councillor Marshall Nunez was elevated to Mayoral aspirant and joined by three other sitting councillors and seven new ones (Channel 5, November 14). The full slate is as follows: Marshall Nunez (Mayor), Eloisa Trujeque, Jacqueline Welch, Yasmin Shoman, Anthony Mahler, Keith Acosta, Sharrett Yearwood, Oscar Rosado, Albert Vaughan, Shanine Campbell, and Carolyn Trench-Sandiford. Two term mayor David Fonseca declined re-election. The PUP campaigned on the slogan "There for You", signifying their long association with Belize City government. Manifestos were released on February 6. Other council selections were announced prior to Nomination Day on February 14, 2006.</p>

<p>The elections were supervised by Stuart Leslie in his capacity as Chief Elections Officer of the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elections_and_Boundaries_Commission_5ee4.html" title="Elections and Boundaries Commission">Elections and Boundaries Commission</a>. Leslie met repeatedly with media houses and political parties to make plans for the conduct of the elections and assure that voting rights would not be violated. This was Leslie's first (and only) supervisory role in an election since he assumed the post from Myrtle Palacio midway through 2005.</p>

<p>Belize's media houses always say that politics is often the only news in Belize. The expected election proved no different. Election related stories topped all local newscasts from the announcement of the UDP Belize City 11 in October until practically the last vote had been counted, and even after that.</p>
<p>Local news powerhouses <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Belize_Television_6ab4.html" title="Great Belize Television">Channel 5</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_Vision_Limited_06fb.html" title="Tropical Vision Limited">Channel 7</a> teamed up with, respectively, <a href="../../../l/o/v/LOVE_FM_d6f2.html" title="LOVE FM">LOVE FM</a>/<a href="../../../r/s/v/RSV_Media_Center_1691.html" title="RSV Media Center">RSV Media Center</a> and <a href="../../../k/r/e/KREM_Radio_e216.html" title="KREM Radio">KREM Radio</a>/<a href="../../../k/r/e/Krem_Television_2994.html" title="Krem Television">Television</a> to provide coverage of the actual election day. Channel 5/LOVE FM used Channel 5's Regent Street studios while Channel 7/KREM operated from Albert Street.</p>
<p>Election stories appeared in nearly every weekly newspaper from October to March.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belizean_municipal_elections%2C_2006.html" title="Edit section: The campaign">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The campaign</span></h2>
<p>Campaigning was, as ever, cutthroat and ruthless. No holds were barred as the 153 candidates scrambled for the over 70,000 votes available to them.</p>
<p>The UDP sought to present the PUP as heartless, corrupt, greedy and incapable of responsibility. In the case of Belize City, which the UDP had not won for over twenty years, mayoral candidate Nunez was presented as symbolizing the problems of the City and the PUP's supposed incompetence, with opponent Moya portrayed as the solution. UDP commercials typically featured poor conditions, frustrated City residents and smug PUP officials, accompanied by songs of protest, most notably <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanya_Stephens_d1c8.html" title="Tanya Stephens">Tanya Stephens</a>' "Turn the Other Cheek". The <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamaica.html" title="Jamaica">Jamaican</a> artist made an appearance in Belize in February for a concert and was interviewed on <a href="../../../w/a/v/WAVE_Radio_9fe1.html" title="WAVE Radio">WAVE Radio</a> but did not expressly support the UDP.</p>
<p>The PUP, for their part, claimed Moya and her crew were political unknowns, not ready for the responsibilities of city management. Their commercials featured singers chanting "We noh wan Zenaida/Vote for Marshall", trumpeting Nunez's experience. Another set of commercials featured Belizean entertainers making pitches to voters to support the PUP, who would be "there for you." The UDP countered this by changing the slogan to "There for Who?" and proceeded to name who the PUP were supposedly there for: their own political operatives and supporters.</p>
<p>Commercials and advertisements by both parties frequently took up TV time in the evenings and could be recognised by the preceding and ending phrase: "The following/preceding is/was a paid political announcement." Nothing escaped scrutiny; even the Party Leaders were vilified.</p>
<p>Official organ of the PUP, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Belize_Times_bb42.html" title="The Belize Times">The Belize Times</a></i>, even printed a rumour that UDP Leader <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Barrow_638f.html" title="Dean Barrow">Dean Barrow</a> had resigned-one day before elections. This rumour was promptly quashed by Barrow on local TV newscasts prior to the election. Barrow had suggested he might step down from his post a few weeks earlier.</p>

</ul>
<p>Attention was paid to the unusually high number of women participating in the elections. This was interpreted as a sign that Belizean women were beginning to step forward and take a more active role in politics.</p>

<p>The most surprising results came in Punta Gorda, where 5 UDP candidates were elected but not Mayoral nominee Charles Selgado; and in Benque Viejo, where the PUP's Armando Chulin snuck on to the council by 17 votes. In the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amandala.html" title="Amandala">Amandala</a> of Sunday March 5, 2006, publisher <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_X_Hyde_2122.html" title="Evan X Hyde">Evan X Hyde</a> called the Punta Gorda result "crazy" and said it showed the maturity of Belizean voters.</p>
<p>A total of nineteen women were elected, easily the highest such total ever. At least one woman was elected in each municipality except for Punta Gorda, where no women were nominated.</p>
<p>The UDP controlled all municipal boards for the first time ever (they previously came close in 1994 by winning all the municipalities after losing Belize City in 1993) and regained Belize City for the first time since 1986. Zenaida Moya became Belize City's first female Mayor and one of two female mayors in Belizean municipalities (joining the reelected Elsa Paz in San Pedro). The Amandala termed the victory a "blowout" while the Reporter called it a "landslide".</p>

<p>Crowds lined the streets in each municipality to welcome their new elected leaders. In Belize City, during the midst of the counting, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_Vision_Limited_06fb.html" title="Tropical Vision Limited">Channel 7</a> cameraman Alfonso Noble and Assistant Commissioner of Police, Eastern Division, Crispin Jeffries got into a tangle when Noble and other media personnel would not leave the counting station immediately. As Noble was being forcibly removed, Jeffries was heard to threaten Noble with future harm if they ever met again. This incident eventually faded.</p>
<p>Media across the nation began speculating whether the vote was not an indication of dissatisfaction with the PUP administration; most seemed to think it was. Most political analysts credited the UDP with smart selection, timely deduction and ruthless campaigning, whereas the PUP did not seem to put their all into the campaign, perhaps wiped out from the protests the previous year.</p>
<p>Most of the new administrations found irregularities in accounts when they got into office; in Belize City, the Council was set back BZ$9 million in debts and loans, and outgoing Mayor David Fonseca was fingered for having misappropriated monies controlled by the Council, though he claimed it was used to assist the poor.</p>
<p>Author Stephen Okeke has recently published a book called <i>The Psychology of Belize Politics</i>, that attempts to explain the mechanics behind the UDP's victory at the polls.</p>
