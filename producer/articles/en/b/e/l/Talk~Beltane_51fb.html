<p>Beltane was originally a big holiday not only dealing with fire-jumping and bonfires, but of fertility. Couples would go to have sex in plowed fields to encourage crop fertility. In addition, communities would raise a maypole as a symbolic action of coupling as well, again to encourage fertility. St Patrick wrote of it, as did cùChuliann, who complained of the people of Ireland ever quitting this particular ritual.

<dd>In Irish, <i>Oíche Bealtaine</i> is May Eve, and <i>Lá Bealtaine</i> is May Day. <i>Mí na Bealtaine</i>, or simply <i>Bealtaine</i> is the name of the month of May. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 10:14, 2004 Dec 16 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-- I will do a Samhain on it (tomorrow, I'm off out for dinner with my wife) and root out this undue emphasis on Neopaganism. It is an old Celtic festival and deserves better treatment than this. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>

<dd>Thanks, sjc. I'm all for the neopagan component of the article (living with a neopagan will do that to a guy, so I thought I should register that vote) but I do think that it is a bit misbalanced.--<a href="../../../t/r/i/Trimalchio.html" title="Trimalchio">trimalchio</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>Neopagan or not neopagan? I recall dancing around a <i>Maypole</i> of sorts in first grade, at age 6. Our teachers took a bare pole onto the playground, we affixed strips of green crepe paper to the tree and we danced in circles around it. We saw nothing particularly pagan about it at the time, and this was a public high school in Alabama in 1964. - <a href="../../../d/w/m/User%7EDwmyers_463f.html" title="User:Dwmyers">Dwmyers</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It is traditionally pagan, and has been revived or preserved by the Neopagan tradition. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 10:14, 2004 Dec 16 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Sounds more like May Day. May Day and Beltaine are two very different things. Beltane isn't neopagan IT SELF, althought some neopagans celebrate it or holidays they call Beltane. I think that is an important thing some people need to learn. Beltane is a Gaelic holiday, that some neopagans celebrate. Just like I'm a Gael that celebrates some Norse and Asian holidays, that doesn't ever make those holidays Gaelic.</p>
<hr />
<p>Maypole dancing is a component part of the pre-christian Celtic phallic/fertility cults. If you like I'll do an article on it. <a href="../../../s/j/c/User%7ESjc_c65f.html" title="User:Sjc">sjc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Maypole dancing is *Germanic*, the Scandinavians, English, Germans and other continental Germans (Dutch, Austrians etc) do it, Celts have never did it.:] Well, maybe some Irish or Scots that don't speak Gaelic anymore, but it's not Celtic.
<dl>
<dd>No more so than any of the many other assorted folk customs from pre-Christian roots. I assume you received presents from an elf and carved lanterns from fruit too. - <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">Montréalais</a></dd>

<p>Clarification needed: is Beltane a single day or a "season", as the opening line seems to say (or both?) -- <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 17:27 Apr 30, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Beltane is a single day.</p>
<hr />
<p>I deleted some glaring factual errors (e.g., the Vernal Equinox may be celebrated the world over, there is no evidence beyond modern era Neopagan books that the Celts ever celebrated it. For further information, visit www.adf.org.) I also deleted some creative spellings, some Wiccan-centric explanations for the holiday and my own smart assed comment about the creative spellings. I did all this so that the file could accurately represent several different paths (Wiccan, Neodruids, Mesodruids, etc.). The focus was a little heavy on the One Great Goddess theory stuff before. Amarshall</p>
<hr />
<p>Hmmm. Just because the Neopagan Beltane derives from numerous sources doesnt mean that there should not be an article about it (given that a good number of folks do observe it). Perhaps there should be seperate sections in the article for the Gaelic Beltane and the Neopagan one. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogotu_210d.html" title="User:Logotu">Logotu</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Maybe someone would like to something on May Eve? It is my understanding this is the original name given to the neopagan holiday that has often become confused with Beltane. A whole article on it, what neopagans believe about it and do, linking to the Beltane article saying that some celebrate it instead, or mix the two (along with May Day, the neopagan celebration is a combination of Germanic maypole and fertility-focus, Gaelic need fire and purification-focus, and the Wiccan idea about a dying God and his consort/mother, which seems to be the most common form, which is why I think it should go back to just being called May Eve, since it's so different from Beltane, and not just regular Beltane being celebrated by neopagans), would be in order?</p>
<dl>
<dd>While being a purist is all very well, it's sometimes not practical. Beltane seems to be the most common name for the Neopagan Spring festival (and yes, it combines elements from May Day, May Eve, Beltane, and probably some garbled anthropology, in an attempt to create a generic non-Christian Spring observence; live and deal). -- <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogotu_210d.html" title="User:Logotu">Logotu</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Beltane is Gaelic, as a word, but there's evidence in the Coligny calendar that it was part of the Gaulish year as well, and additional evidence from Welsh texts that May Eve/May 1 or calen Mai had particular associations with the Otherworld, much as Beltain in Irish medieval texts is used. It would be almost impossible to "filter" the various influences out. Certainly the vernal equinox is not something that seems to have been marked on the Coligny calendar, nor was it important to the Irish until they began to use Christian calendar-keeping. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalMedievalist_fc15.html" title="User:DigitalMedievalist">DigitalMedievalist</a> 16:22, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC) Lisa</p>

<p>Note: I have been English-speaking for some 50 years, but I'm quite sure that the Irish for "fire" was "teine," not tane. So the feast, the "fires of Baal" is spelt Bealteine. Inserted by Sylvester O'Farrell "sofarrell@sympatico.ca"</p>
<p>The article immediately launches into two paragraphs of etymological analysis.

<p>I've added the derivation of the word from the Oxford English Dictionary. I left in the comment about "The word Beltan in Wicca means 'Fire in the sky.'"

<p>The reason I shifted the etymology of the word into a separate section is so that the first paragraph explains, in a direct and concise manner, to the reader <b>what Beltane actually is</b>, rather than launching straight into a lengthy discussion about how it is spelt in which language, where it came from, what it originally meant, and so on. Please refrain from cluttering up the introduction with even more of it, and please consider editing the Etymology section.</p>
<p>I've reshuffled again. Hopefully this is clearer, the first paragraph now concisely explains what Beltane is. Moved most of the rest of it to Etymology, which is now bigger than the rest of the article. Not sure how much of it is truly noteworthy, but it will do for now I suppose. Also, we need a citation for the Wicca thing, otherwise it probably should go. Nothing against Wicca really, but we're editing an encyclopaedia and claims need sources and references.

<p>The following has been added by at least one editor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The original root of the term Beltaine is descendant from the early iron age Canaanite name Ba'al meaning God, which evolved from the proto-Semitic word El for "strength" or "power", used as "lord" or "ruler" that originally referred to a primary sun god deity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ba'al and El were names for henotheistic fertility gods in the Canaanite and Phoenician religions that were tied to the start of agricultural cycles of the seasons, later being disseminated along early Mediterranean trade routes. The concept of a single diety such as the Hebrew God Elohim and Allah for Islam developed from these earlier sources.</dd>

<p>I’ve located an early reference regarding a Celtic - Semitic language connection.</p>
<p>"One of the 19th centuries' most notably famous language experts was James Cowles Pritchard, who lived from 1786 to 1848. Called 'the founder of modern anthropology,' one modern reviewer stated that he had "unquestionably done more than any other single individual to place Ethnology on a scientific basis." In his "Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations" (1857), he says that there is "a remarkable analogy" between the Hebrew-Semitic languages and the Celtic (which he spells old-style with a 'k' as in 'Keltic'). He further states that the Celtic language "forms an intermediate link between [the Indo-European] and the Semitic, or perhaps indicates a state of transition" from Semitic to European languages. (p.349) Dr. Pritchard prepared a three-page chart tracing word origins showing his readers the connection between Celtic and Semitic, and states, "it does not appear probable that the idioms of North Africa are even so nearly related to the Semitic, as the latter are to the Indo-European languages."</p>
<p>I will continue to search for other corroborating citations to substantiate the linguistic source of Celtic Beltaine to the Semitic deity of Ba'al. However, I do not believe that a linguistic connection is necessarily mandated.</p>
<p>The god Ba'al was the primary deity of the Phoenician people. The Phoenicians were the earliest known maritime traders whose travels extended to establishing colonies in the Celtic areas of Galician Spain and the British Isles to obtain tin, essential for bronze production as well as silver, iron and lead. The extensive contacts between the Semitic Phoenicians and their Celtic trading partners had to seed religious beliefs of the more advanced Semitic Mediterranean culture into the more primitive Celtic Atlantic counterpart.</p>
<p>There is substantial evidence of Semitic Phoenician influence on Celtic culture extending back at least four millennia. The separate linguistic origins of the rapid expansion in trade in and around the Mediterranean basin had already begun to meld together through regional contact before the thrust of Celtic expansion across Western Europe had even begun 3,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That Celtic growth was heavily influenced by Greek culture from its inception in central Europe. The Greeks were the earliest trading partners of the Phoenician sea traders. It is impossible that Phoenician culture had not made a substantial impact on the development of the newly emergent Celtic society.</p>
<p>Absent any further documented references, the logic of a Beltaine – Ba’al connection is difficult to dismiss. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gabel (<a href="../../../g/a/b/User_talk%7EGabel_4c49.html" title="User talk:Gabel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gabel_665c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gabel">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Greetings, Gabel. I'm honestly not sure of where you are getting your information: Prichard's work <i>Eastern Origin of the Celtic nations</i> made connections between the Celtic languages and Sanskrit, not Semitic languages. Please see <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cowles_Prichard_e139.html" title="James Cowles Prichard">James Cowles Prichard</a> for more information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The supposed connection between Ba'al and Beltane starts not with Prichard, but with <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cormac_MacCuilenan_0040.html" title="Cormac MacCuilenan">Cormac_MacCuilenan</a>. However, this etymological connection has been rejected since at least the early 20th century. The theory is mentioned but explicitly refuted in the <a href="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/BEC_BER/BELTANE_BELTENE_BELTINE.html" class="external text" title="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/BEC_BER/BELTANE_BELTENE_BELTINE.html" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Brittanica 1911</a>: "Following Cormac, it has been usual to regard it as representing a combination of the name of the god Bel Baal or Bil with the Celtic teine, fire. And on this etymology theories have been erected of the connexion of the Semitic Baal with Celtic mythology, and the identification of the beltane fires with the worship of this deity. This etymology is now repudiated by scientific philologists, and the New English Dictionary accepts Dr <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitley_Stokes_ecbd.html" title="Whitley Stokes">Whitley Stokes</a>'s view that beltane in its Gaelic form can have no connexion with teine, fire." <a href="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/BEC_BER/BELTANE_BELTENE_BELTINE.html" class="external text" title="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/BEC_BER/BELTANE_BELTENE_BELTINE.html" rel="nofollow">source</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is, this "folk etymology" is popular in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_apologetics.html" title="Christian apologetics">Christian apologetics</a>, and many modern apologetics sources will mention the theory, yet omit any mention that it has been refuted. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 15:23, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>in west germany (west of cologne) they celebrate by putting a MAIBAUM (a decorated tree/branch) on houses .. usually men put there to houses were their adored women live. They white tiny furry willow tree thingies are used and there is probably more customs similar to celtic.. hence I think you are safe to assume that these are pre-christian rites</p>

<p>I have removed the "Sabbats" box that was recently placed at the top of this article. I feel it is misleading in that it re-instates the POV that Beltane is primarily a Wiccan or Neopagan thing. We have worked hard to make this and the other Gaelic fire festivals more historically accurate, and more reflective of the spectrum of people who observe the festival. We have a Gaelic festivals nav box at the bottom, and links in the body to the Wiccan "wheel of the year"; we do not need an additional nav box for the Wiccan sabbats. --<a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna">Kathryn NicDhàna</a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a> 20:39, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yow. OK. I've compressed it some, and cut what seemed like OR. It may still be more than we need in terms of etymology. I mean, I'm into etymology, but what we had there was making me glaze over. I'd also appreciate it if someone else would source that section. I can source the Irish and Gaelic, if needed, but I'd prefer someone else to tackle the P.I.E. Argh. <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 05:42, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Surprised no info on the heavy emphasis this holiday has, anciently, traditionally, and currently, on fertility and sexuality. Beltane was a celebration of and invocation of fertility and abundance and sexuality ("the lusty month of May"), and was traditionally a time/night of continuous all-night sexual coupling by most everyone, even to the point of choosing someone fairly at random to couple with if one was not in relationship. I'm just surprised this article doesn't mention sexuality. <a href="../../../s/o/f/User%7ESoftlavender_03c0.html" title="User:Softlavender">Softlavender</a></p>
