<p>I just noted the reference which someone added to this page on July 24, and which jdfwolff deleted the same day. It seems that most of the Wikipedia entry was lifted from this article on HasidicNews.com! Exact wording was repeated in the History, Controversy, and Belz Today sections. When I first read the Wikipedia article, I wondered why the Controversy was mentioned so briefly and out of context, and now I see why: the whole section was simply lifted verbatim from this HasidicNews.com article. What do we do now?<a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYoninah_ec9f.html" title="User:Yoninah">Yoninah</a> 19:19, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would it perhaps be a good idea to divide up some of the history sections and place them as additional background in each of the rebbe's biographies? In particular, discussing Aharon's wartime escapades seems more appropriate for his own page rather than a page on Belz Hasidism. Ditto for some of the modern-day Belz/Satmar wars which seems to have more to do with Yissachar Dov Rokeach than Belz, per se, although obviously the two bleed into each other.</p>

<p>I've reverted the HasidicNews reference. Seeing as how a great deal of the article seems to come from there as a source (see first entry on this talk page), it seems appropriate to cite it. Is there a specific reason it was removed?<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalomShlomo_a45e.html" title="User:ShalomShlomo">ShalomShlomo</a> 20:48, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>REPLY: Yes, there is. That site is about as Jewish as 'jewsforjesus.com'. It's an Islamic missionary site which mixes positive and (VERY) negative information. If you check the site a bit further (the links etc.) you'll realize. There is nothing Jewish about that site and I don't want other Jews to reach that site. Hope you understand. I'll remove the link again - I'm sorry, but I hope you can agree with me now. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> 21:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still disagree. Much of the material seems to have come from there; therefore it should be cited. Are you going to go to every Hasidic page that cites this place and remove them, too? Just because you don't like the place doesn't mean it can be used without citation. Should we not cite <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> on the page about Hitler because someone might read it? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalomShlomo_a45e.html" title="User:ShalomShlomo">ShalomShlomo</a> 11:04, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it's a plain fact. The site gives VERY negative information, plain lies, about Hasidism. Have you ever read it's FAQ section? Try it. You'll be shocked. It consists of lies, lies and lies. If you post any links to that site here on Wikipedia, non-suspecting people from this forum will go there, will think that it is an honest serious site which is perfectly fine to read and that the information there can be trusted. Someone who knows nothing about Hasidism will read that site and believe what it says. It's a hate-sowing site that should not be linked anywhere. I hope you can understand, please, that it is a site that does not belong anywhere on Wikipedia. I've been following that site for a while -- once, a few people posted on it's message board (forum), and they discovered together that the site was a fake, a set-up intended to spread a very negative image of Hasidic Judaism (and Orthodox Judaism in general), and subsequently the forum was closed, as you will see if you try to open it now. Doesn't that say enough? Once people discovered it, the forum was closed, and the site is also no longer maintained. If you will look at the 'News' section, you will see that it is all only lashon hara, hate-sowing, spreading horrible bad tales about chassidim, so that other people will be scared away from chassidus and have a very negative image of chassidus in general. Please spend some more time investigating the site, I'm sure you'll agree with my assessment then. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> 20:54, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But, AGAIN, it is a major source of information for the early history section. Per the rules, it HAS to be cited. Otherwise it's stealing that place's info (which you don't seem to have a problem being here) without crediting it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalomShlomo_a45e.html" title="User:ShalomShlomo">ShalomShlomo</a> 18:20, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Most of their information is probably also simply copied from other sources, I don't know from where. Have you taken a closer look at the site by now? Don't you see what I see? Perhaps it's because you're not so much familiar with orthodox Jewish life (since you're agnostic, according to your profile). I can assure you that the site is full of dirty lies, trying to spread a hateful and negative message about orthodox Jews. Which is not in line with what Wikipedia stands for. According to your logic, why not include a link to Stormfront on the website on Marten Luther King and call it a reliable independent source of information? Would you do that? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> 19:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the information is bad, find it somewhere else. I've taken a look at the site before and concurr that quite a bit of it is unflattering, but their history sections seem pretty reliable (I notice that you have yet to challenge this point, or attempt to lobby against the sections of the article that were obviously lifted from it in its earliest stages). As to your example- I would have avoided using information from Stormfront in the first place, and if I wanted to avoid citing it, would do the grunt-work to find the information elsewhere. I would not support cutting-and-pasting large sections of an internet page and then refusing to cite it. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalomShlomo_a45e.html" title="User:ShalomShlomo">ShalomShlomo</a> 17:10, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also changed "Qiriat Belz" to "Kiryat Belz" since that is the more common, more logical and easier to use spelling. And "Beit hamedresh" should be "Beit HaMidrash" (actually everyone there calls it "Beis HaMidrash", I'm not sure on whether to write Beit or Beis). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> 21:39, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed the Machnovka rebbe from the succession list. I feel that we're better off referencing to Machnovka in the main body of the article, presumably a short paragraph describing the split which I'm guessing occured after Y.D.I's death. If anyone can put some information up here or in the article itself, I'd be happy to write it up. Google was not particularly successful in obtaining information about the Machnovka dynasty, other than corroborating that it exists, Yehoshua Rokeach is its rebbe (as of aprox 10 years ago), and that he and Y.D.II are indeed second cousins. Was Avrohom Twersky the previous M. rebbe? What is his relationship to Y. Rokeach? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShalomShlomo_a45e.html" title="User:ShalomShlomo">ShalomShlomo</a> 01:23, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>84.9.49.114- Considering that at the time of the Belzer's immigration to E.Y., the region was still legally known as the British Mandate of Palestine, I think that it would be more appropriate to refer to it as such. British Eretz Yisrael makes no sense.

Famous curse: there is a story that when Joseph Kennedy just before WWII used his influence as the U.S. Ambassador to the UK to prevent Jews in German held territories being granted visas (and safety) to the US, the Rebbe cursed him and his entire family for his actions - many believe that the problems of the family (down to the drunk driving accident of Patrick Kennedy) all date to that curse - does anyone have a source for that and want to place that in the story?Incorrect 01:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>hello everyone</p>
<p>Since the Bach was Rabbi in the city of Belz before rabbi Sholom Rokeach (the sar sholom), the minhagim of the belzer chassidus in many cases are according to the pesaqim of the bach- such as having the sefrei torah laying flat in the ark instead of standing up.</p>
