	    <p><b>Belford C. Hendricks</b> (<a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>) was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Composer.html" title="Composer">composer</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pianist.html" title="Pianist">pianist</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arranger.html" title="Arranger">arranger</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conductor_%28music%29.html" title="Conductor (music)">conductor</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a>. He used a variety of names, including Belford Hendricks, Belford Cabell Hendricks, Belford Clifford Hendricks, Sinky Hendricks and Bill Henry. This was primarily to avoid competition between his own compositions at the height of his prolific career, but the result today is uncertainty about what the C in his official name really stood for - if indeed it stood for anything at all.</p>
<p>Hendricks is primarily remembered as the co-composer of numerous soft-<a href="../../../r/_/%26/R_%26_B_d032.html" title="R &amp; B">R &amp; B</a> songs of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, many in collaboration with <a href="../../../c/l/y/Clyde_Otis_5c7b.html" title="Clyde Otis">Clyde Otis</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brook_Benton_92de.html" title="Brook Benton">Brook Benton</a>, and as an accomplished arranger, whose versatility allowed him to write in various styles, from <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_band.html" title="Big band">big band</a> <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing.html" title="Swing">swing</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Basie_19a6.html" title="Count Basie">Count Basie</a>, through bluesy ballads for <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Washington_ffcb.html" title="Dinah Washington">Dinah Washington</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Vaughan_ac88.html" title="Sarah Vaughan">Sarah Vaughan</a>, <a href="../../../r/_/%26/R_%26_B_d032.html" title="R &amp; B">R &amp; B</a>-influenced pop for Benton and <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_and_western.html" title="Country and western">country and western</a> numbers for <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_King_Cole_7fef.html" title="Nat King Cole">Nat King Cole</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Martino_54b1.html" title="Al Martino">Al Martino</a>, to early <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> for <a href="../../../a/r/e/Aretha_Franklin_5ce5.html" title="Aretha Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>.</p>

<p>Hendricks was born in <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evansville.html" title="Evansville">Evansville</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>, in May <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> to Frank Hendricks, a lifelong learner with an eighth-grade education, and Melissa Logan Hendricks, a graduate of Evansville's Frederick Douglass High School. His love affair with music began when his father brought home a piano, quickly learning how to play additional instruments. In high school, he participated in band.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, Hendricks was graduated from the town's then-segregated Douglass High School, later rebuilt and renamed Lincoln High School. After taking several years off, working at local establishments, he enrolled at the Indiana State Teachers' College, now known as Indiana State University, in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terre_Haute_7c51.html" title="Terre Haute">Terre Haute</a>. Often diverted from his education for semesters at a time by a need to earn money and a desire to practice his musical craft, Hendricks' decade-long road to graduation was long. As well as taking jobs in local restaurants and hotels, Hendricks was able to play piano with bands in the area. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, he joined the elite one percent of Black Americans with a college degree, having majored in science and music.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belford_Hendricks_ac78.html" title="Edit section: Marriage and army service">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage and army service</span></h2>
<p>Hendricks married North Vernon, Ind., native Mayetta Bean, a classmate studying to become an elementary school teacher. After spending a year in Maryland, Bean returned to Indiana. They divorced in the 1940s. Bean died in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Though these were considered plum jobs reserved for white people, Hendricks, with the help of relative William Fauntleroy, was able to secure a job as a postal carrier. On postal records, however, he is recorded as being white. At the height of The Great Depression, Hendricks earned nearly triple the the national average income.</p>
<p>In 1942, Hendricks was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving in a medical unit. He was stationed in New York, Arizona and Hawaii. A Jet magazine of the 1980s shows him accompanying popular songstress Lena Horne. Legend has it he also was photographed in a national magazine kissing American soil upon return from Hawaii.</p>
<p>After the war, Hendricks returned to Indiana to care for his aging parents. During this period, he co-hosted "Toast and Coffee," one of the first interracial radio programs in the United States, though most listeners were unaware he was Black. He often went home between the morning radio program to cook, clean and run errands for his parents before working gigs at local nightclubs.</p>
<p>During this period, he became acquainted with Emma Hendricks, a native of Texas, who worked for Jane Blaffer Owens, heir to the Humble Oil fortune. Humble now is known as Exxon-Mobil. The Owens family helped resettle the utopian community of New Harmony, Ind., north of Evansville, which fell into disrepair.</p>

<p>Hendricks quickly became a big fish in the little pond that was Evansville. Though he already was middle-aged, Hendricks decided to move to New York to pursue a fullt-time musical career. He continued his musical education, studying composition and organ at New York University. He knew a member of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Basie_19a6.html" title="Count Basie">Count Basie</a> Orchestra and was able to substitute for him on occasion.</p>
<p>By the mid-1950s, he met the man who was going to change his future. Clyde Otis, an ex-marine with a high school education, was a self-taught musician who was working his way up the ranks of the New York music scene. In 1957, he accepted a job as the first Black A and R man at Mercury Recrods and asked Hendricks to become his righthand man.</p>

<p>With Hendricks' talents on the radar at last, they were drawn upon more and more as the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> progressed.</p>
<p>Soon after arriving in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, he had met <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinah_Washington_ffcb.html" title="Dinah Washington">Dinah Washington</a>, then an up and coming vocalist. By <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, she was an established star and she asked Hendricks to arrange and conduct her album, <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_of_Me_dc1b.html" title="All of Me">All of Me</a>. Its success led to further work together, culminating in Hendricks becoming Washington's full-time arranger by <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>. Until the singer's death in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, they enjoyed numerous chart hits, the most enduring being <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What_a_Difference_a_Day_Made_bbad.html" title="What a Difference a Day Made">What a Difference a Day Made</a></i>, which reached number 4 in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a> <a href="../../../r/_/%26/R_%26_B_d032.html" title="R &amp; B">R &amp; B</a> charts and number 8 in the US pop charts in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> and which remains well-known through TV commercials and radio airplay to this day.</p>
<p>Even more successful were the light-hearted duets which Hendricks arranged for Washington and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brook_Benton_92de.html" title="Brook Benton">Brook Benton</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>. <i>Baby (You've Got What It Takes)</i> made <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chart-topper.html" title="Chart-topper">number 1</a> in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a> <a href="../../../r/_/%26/R_%26_B_d032.html" title="R &amp; B">R &amp; B</a> charts and number 5 in the US pop charts, earning over $1 million, whilst <i>A Rockin' Good Way (To Mess Around and Fall In Love)</i> also made number 1 in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a> <a href="../../../r/_/%26/R_%26_B_d032.html" title="R &amp; B">R &amp; B</a> charts and number 7 in the US pop charts. Both recordings were also notable for featuring a young <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Zawinul_1397.html" title="Joe Zawinul">Joe Zawinul</a> on piano.</p>
<p>Hendricks, in fact, had an even closer musical relationship with Benton than the one he enjoyed with Washington, for, in addition to arranging many of the popular <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baritone.html" title="Baritone">baritone</a>'s recordings, he also co-wrote numerous songs with him, often together with Otis. The Hendricks-Otis-Benton composition <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_Just_a_Matter_of_Time_f77c.html" title="It's Just a Matter of Time">It's Just a Matter of Time</a></i>, arranged by Hendricks and performed by Benton, went to number 3 in the US pop charts in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> and became a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_music.html" title="Country music">country music</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standard.html" title="Standard">standard</a>, with new interpretations reaching number 1 in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a> country charts twice: first in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, sung by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_James_c7d1.html" title="Sonny James">Sonny James</a>, and again in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, courtesy of [[Randy Travis]. The song remains one of the most-licensed compositions of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Other successful arrangements by Hendricks for Benton include <i>Thank You Pretty Baby</i>, <i>Kiddio</i>, <i><a href="../../../f/o/o/Fools_Rush_In_5f8d.html" title="Fools Rush In">Fools Rush In</a></i> and <i>The Boll Weevil Song</i>.</p>

<p>As Hendricks' stature as an arranger grew, it was inevitable that <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_Records_6082.html" title="Mercury Records">Mercury Records</a> would pair him with one of their biggest names, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Vaughan_ac88.html" title="Sarah Vaughan">Sarah Vaughan</a>, for some of the great <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> singer's forays onto more commercial territory. His arrangements for her produced one minor US hit, the <a href="../../../r/_/%26/R_%26_B_d032.html" title="R &amp; B">R &amp; B</a>-tinged <i>Smooth Operator</i>, written by Otis with Murray Stein and seductively sung by "Sassy", as well as some distinctive takes on older songs, such as <i>My Ideal</i>, <i>I Should Care</i>, <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irving_Berlin_13c5.html" title="Irving Berlin">Irving Berlin</a>'s <i>Maybe It's Because I Love You Too Much</i> and particularly attractive versions of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mack_Gordon_0972.html" title="Mack Gordon">Mack Gordon</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Revel_e603.html" title="Harry Revel">Harry Revel</a>'s <i>Never In A Million Years</i> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Chaplin_96fc.html" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>'s <i>Eternally</i>.</p>

<p>By now, Hendricks' arrangements had developed a recognisable style all of their own, typically featuring short-bowed strings, set over a gently <a href="../../../r/_/%26/R_%26_B_d032.html" title="R &amp; B">R &amp; B</a>-inspired beat and bassline. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_King_Cole_7fef.html" title="Nat King Cole">Nat King Cole</a> had already recorded some Hendricks co-compositions such as <i>Nothing In The World</i> and the hit <i>Looking Back</i> in the late <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, and when he and his producers at <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_Records_df10.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a> decided to record a brand new <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_and_western.html" title="Country and western">country and western</a> song, <i>Ramblin' Rose</i>, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, the Belford Hendricks sound fitted their requirements perfectly. The result was a worldwide smash hit and Hendricks was asked to submit arrangements for a full album in a similar <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_and_western.html" title="Country and western">country and western</a> vein, also entitled Ramblin' Rose. When that brought more success, Hendricks arranged a follow-up Cole-meets-Country album, Dear Lonely Hearts, whose title track became another singles chart hit.</p>
