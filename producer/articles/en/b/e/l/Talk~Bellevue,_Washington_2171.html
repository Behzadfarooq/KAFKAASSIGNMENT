<p>Truthfully, Bellevue is actually, the last time I checked, the FOURTH largest city in the state at this current time. As a resident of Bellevue, I'm trying not to be biased, but I seriously doubt that Bellevue can be considered a suburb of Seattle. Besides, you have to cross Mercer Island in order to get to Bellevue, which separates Seattle and Bellevue out in to two cities anyways. I don't know, feel free to give your opinion on this.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela267_57c8.html" title="User:Xela267">Xela267</a> (<a href="../../../x/e/l/User_talk%7EXela267_ea5a.html" title="User talk:Xela267">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Xela267_2c77.html" title="Special:Contributions/Xela267">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>HELLO, I found an article that cites Bellevue as a "boomburb". <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003476791_danny14.html" class="external free" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003476791_danny14.html" rel="nofollow">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003476791_danny14.html</a> IF SOMEONE WOULD PLEASE ADD THIS TO THE CITATIONS, IT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU. 128.180.196.229 20:10, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>HA! This discussion was mentioned in the paper! ^_^ However this article reflects Wikipedia, more than the other way around. If you can get a hold of some of his sources then you should reference them, but it seems illogical to cite his article when it wasn't used to make this article. (Could someone please respond to my point at the bottom of this section?) --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKraftlos_ae0b.html" title="User:Kraftlos">Kraftlos</a> 23:11, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was listed as a suburb on the Seattle page, then changed to city, then changed back. It is one or the other. I think this might be worth some discussion on the talk pages of both the Seattle and the Bellevue entries. I am curious why one would think Bellevue is a suburb of Seattle. It is listed on wiki as being the 5th largest city in WA. Even on the Bellevue page there is not a single mention of it being a suburb of Seattle. Perhaps that should be added in if it is listed on the Seattle page as such. Would like to get opinions and as a newbie would be interested in learning about how we decide what the final verdict is. Based on number of folks with the same opinion? By the way, I have cross posted this with the Seattle page as well.

<dd>Properly I'd call Bellevue an <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge_city.html" title="Edge city">edge city</a> (see book of the same title by Joel Garreau), which is a city that started out as a suburb (which Bellevue undeniably did) but became into a city of its own, which Bellevue is definitely doing. In fact Bellevue is listed as an edge city of Seattle on the edge city Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindall_055e.html" title="User:Kindall">Jerry Kindall</a> 00:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apropos of nothing, but somewhat related to the "is it a suburb" question, I was just reading the Wikipedia article on my hometown, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbus%2C_Ohio_64f3.html" title="Columbus, Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>. Check out the photo of its skyline (scroll down to Geography), which is eerily similar to the one in this article of Bellevue's skyline... it won't take too many more buildings to make Bellevue's look like that, really. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKindall_055e.html" title="User:Kindall">Jerry Kindall</a> 06:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Great city you guys have! If I ever make enough money, Bellevue is where I wanna be!</p>
<p>Bellevue really is not the city with all the rich people. The really wealthy live mostly in Medina, Yarrow Point, Clyde Hill, and Hunts Point) In fact, Bellevue itself is a very diverse city ranging from nice hilltop or lakeside homes to low to middle income housing in the east side of the city. Namely, in the Crossroads area it is largely lower income apartments. --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKraftlos_ae0b.html" title="User:Kraftlos">Kraftlos</a> 05:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Changed back to "city", it really isn't a suburb in any sense anymore. 128.180.196.229 04:36, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE it to 'SUBURB'. Thank you. 128.180.196.229 11:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look what I've changed it to now. I think it is a good compromise. Please post here before you change thank you. 128.180.196.229 11:22, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Webster Definition</b> Suburb 1 a&#160;: an outlying part of a city or town b&#160;: a smaller community adjacent to or within commuting distance of a city c plural&#160;: the residential area on the outskirts of a city or large town 2 plural&#160;: the near vicinity&#160;: Environs</p>
<p><br />
<b>Dictionary.com</b> Suburb 1. a district lying immediately outside a city or town, esp. a smaller residential community. 2. the suburbs, the area composed of such districts. 3. an outlying part.</p>
<p><b>AskOxford.com</b> suburb noun - an outlying residential district of a city.</p>
<p><b>American Heritage Dictionary</b> 1. A usually residential area or community outlying a city. 2. suburbs The usually residential region around a major city; the environs.</p>
<p><br />
Just because something is suburb doesn't mean that it can't be a city or can't have any serious commercial activity. A suburb is simply a community outside the main city. Sub (below, under) + urb (city).</p>
<p>It is true that Bellevue and other smaller communities existed on the east side in the first half of the 20th century, however when Bellevue incorporated in 1953, it was a direct result of population growth (and the creation of I-90). The Lake Hills community, one of the first GI Bill suburbs is often referenced when documentaries discuss suburbs or the GI-Bill.</p>
<p>Whether it has urbanized or not doesn't change the fact that Bellevue is a suburb of Seattle. A suburb will only cease to be a suburb when it has grown larger than it's parent city.</p>
<p>I'd also like to know if you people who are militantly defending this Edgecity or Boomburg idea actually took the time to look at a dictionary before you started this? And if you did, I would like to understand your reasoning on this; because by all these definitions,Bellevue is a suburb. --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKraftlos_ae0b.html" title="User:Kraftlos">Kraftlos</a> 05:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wouldn't say anyone is militantly defending the use of edgecity or boomburb. It was more a consensus agreement reflecting that edge city and boomburb are a subset of Suburb and that there are certain aspects of the suburb definition that do not apply to Bellevue. Think of it as all edge cities and boomburbs are suburbs, but not all suburbs are edge cities or boomburbs.

<dd>Ideally, anyone that has an article in Wikipedia or holds/held a prominent position in something with an article. As an example, the CEO of Safeco or member of a band with an article probably warrants mention, but a member of a local band that doesn't have an article probably shouldn't get a mention. Realistically, whoever doesn't get deleted by another editor warrants inclusion. May also consider removing the section complete and creating Category:People from Bellevue, Washington. Famous people sections are generally just filler in an article. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 22:31, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the crane accident because I don't feel it really tells you anything about the city. It really is a news item and belongs on <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/" class="external free" title="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/</a> However, its not really a news item either since it is written as history. I wouldn't make the event into its own catagory (NYC's article doesn't have a catagory for 9/11)</p>
<p>-- 2006 Crane Accident -- On the evening of November 16, 2006, a 210-foot tower construction crane toppled in downtown Bellevue, destroying much of the Plaza 305 building and causing extensive damage to an adjacent building and an apartment building across the street. The upper portion of the crane fell across 108th Avenue Northeast at Northeast Third Street and into a fourth-floor apartment at Pinnacle Bell Centre. Firefighters found the body of a man beneath the wreckage in the apartment. The crane operator escaped with minor injuries.</p>
<p>The crane, which had stood in an excavation pit at the site of the future Tower 333 at 333 108th Ave. N.E., fell eastward and bounced off the north side of Civica Office Commons before landing on top of the Plaza 305 building. <a href="http://www.kingcountyjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061117/NEWS/611170348" class="external text" title="http://www.kingcountyjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061117/NEWS/611170348" rel="nofollow">King County Journal Article</a></p>
