<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Stronach_50bc.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>Stronach is the daughter of the founder of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_International_9b0c.html" title="Magna International">Magna International</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Stronach_849d.html" title="Frank Stronach">Frank Stronach</a>. She graduated from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newmarket_High_School_3f95.html" title="Newmarket High School">Newmarket High School</a> and attended <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_University_8e71.html" title="York University">York University</a> in 1985, where she studied business and economics, but dropped out after one year to work at Magna. She speaks English and German fluently.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1988.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1988">1988 federal election</a> her father made an unsuccessful bid to win the riding of <a href="../../../y/o/r/York%E2%80%94Simcoe_3dca.html" title="York—Simcoe">York—Simcoe</a> (which at the time took up much of the territory of her current riding) as a Liberal.</p>
<p>In the 2000 <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_leadership_election_00e3.html" title="Canadian Alliance leadership election">Canadian Alliance leadership election</a>, she supported <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston_Manning_dbc6.html" title="Preston Manning">Preston Manning</a>. In his memoir <i>Think Big</i>, Manning recalls Stronach at his second-ballot campaign launch in Toronto delivering "a substantive introduction in which she clearly explained why she wanted the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Alliance</a> and my candidacy to succeed," and he later thanked her for "unflagging support" in that campaign.</p>
<p>Stronach was a member of the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_directors.html" title="Board of directors">board of directors</a> of Magna from 1988 until 2004. She became a vice-president of the company in 1995 and executive vice-president in 1999, until her appointment as president and chief executive officer. She has chaired the boards of Decoma International Inc., Tesma International Inc., and Intier Automotive Inc., all in the auto parts sector. She was a founding member of the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council and served on the Ontario Task Force on Productivity, Competitiveness and Economic Progress. She is a director of the Yves Landry Foundation, which furthers technological education and skills training in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>In February 2001, she was appointed chief executive officer of Magna, succeeding her ex-husband Donald J. Walker (who became CEO of Magna spinoff Intier Automotive Inc.), and in January 2002, she also became its president. While CEO, the company added 3,000 jobs in Canada, 1,000 of them being in the Newmarket-Aurora area she now represents in Parliament. In addition, under her leadership Magna had record sales and profits each year. Some attributed her success to her father's continued control of the company despite holding no formal operational role; during her reign at Magna, Frank Stronach remained as Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p>In 2001, the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Post_afd6.html" title="National Post">National Post</a></i> named Stronach as the most powerful businesswoman in Canada; and, in the same year, the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Economic_Forum_c210.html" title="World Economic Forum">World Economic Forum</a> named her a "Global Leader of Tomorrow." <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_Magazine_6069.html" title="Fortune Magazine">Fortune Magazine</a></i> ranked her #2 in its list of the world's most powerful women in business in 2002. She was also named one of Canada's "Top 40 Under 40." In April 2004, <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Magazine_89f3.html" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i> ranked her as one of the world's 100 most influential people.</p>
<p>Stronach is honorary chair of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southlake_Regional_Health_Centre_73a5.html" title="Southlake Regional Health Centre">Southlake Regional Health Centre</a> <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundraising.html" title="Fundraising">fundraising</a> campaign and a former honorary chair of the Howdown fundraising campaign. In 2003, she received one of Canada's oldest and most distinguished awards, the Beth Shalom Humanitarian Award, presented in recognition of outstanding achievement in <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarian.html" title="Humanitarian">humanitarian</a> service. She is a close friend of former U.S. President <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, former <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Canada_02d6.html" title="Prime Minister of Canada">Canadian Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Mulroney_5ffd.html" title="Brian Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a>, and former <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_Ontario_ab6d.html" title="Premier of Ontario">Ontario Premier</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Harris_6536.html" title="Mike Harris">Mike Harris</a>.</p>
<p>She is twice divorced; her first husband was current Magna CEO Donald J. Walker and her second was <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_skating.html" title="Speed skating">speed skating</a> legend <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Olav_Koss_3a48.html" title="Johann Olav Koss">Johann Olav Koss</a>. She has two children from her first marriage, Frank and Nikki.</p>
<p>In a <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Star_41f5.html" title="Toronto Star">Toronto Star</a></i> interview published <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Stronach confirmed that she was dating deputy Conservative leader <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_MacKay_a693.html" title="Peter MacKay">Peter MacKay</a>. After she left the Conservative Party, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Press_851d.html" title="Canadian Press">Canadian Press</a> reported that she and he are taking "a break from their relationship." The <i>National Post</i> reported that MacKay was "gobsmacked" by her decision to join the Liberals. In October 2006, there was further fallout from this relationship, when backbench MP <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Holland_e607.html" title="Mark Holland">Mark Holland</a> claimed he heard MacKay comment that his dog was now seated on the Liberal side of the house (paraphrased)....</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the <i><a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe_and_Mail_1d03.html" title="Globe and Mail">Globe and Mail</a></i> reported that Stronach has a relationship with former <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Maple_Leafs_bc61.html" title="Toronto Maple Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> hockey player <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tie_Domi_9dce.html" title="Tie Domi">Tie Domi</a>.<sup id="_ref-domi_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-domi" title="">[1]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, these allegations were also made by Tie Domi's ex-partner, who is seeking to recover in the civil courts.<sup id="_ref-accusation_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-accusation" title="">[2]</a></sup> Though Stronach has refused to comment on the issue, along with other alleged romantic partners, she has stated "Let's face it. I don't sit at home and knit on Friday nights."A decade before Belinda Stronach met Tie Domi, she had an affair with another ex-NHL player, Jerome Dupont; his ex-wife says. "It's obviously a pattern for her," said Caroline Dupont, who has two children, aged 15 and 17, with the former Leaf and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Blackhawks_a40d.html" title="Chicago Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawk</a>.<sup id="_ref-jdupont_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jdupont" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>On November 9, 2006 she co-chaired the Millennium Promise Convention in Montreal with Canadian Television personality <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Mercer_cac4.html" title="Rick Mercer">Rick Mercer</a>. This event was a national campaign to enlist Canadians to help protect children in Africa from the ravages of malaria.<sup id="_ref-malaria_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-malaria" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Stronach_50bc.html" title="Edit section: Conservative leadership race">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conservative leadership race</span></h2>
<p>Throughout the summer and into the fall of 2003, talks were undertaken by officials of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservatives</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a> with respect to a merger of those parties. Vote-splitting between the two right-wing parties had enabled the Liberals to dominate Canadian politics for a decade. Meetings between the parties were overseen by a facilitator, who was later revealed to have been Stronach. She was among many who had called for PC leader Peter MacKay and Canadian Alliance leader <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Harper_d9dd.html" title="Stephen Harper">Stephen Harper</a> to undertake the merger talks in the first place.</p>
<p>As a candidate for leadership of the new party, she drew a great deal of publicity to the race. However, many in the media saw her first foray into politics as sophomoric, flubbing obviously-practiced lines, and approaching the podium well before the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleprompter.html" title="Teleprompter">teleprompter</a> was ready. In one of her first appearances, Stronach stood before the microphone mute for several minutes before the prompter began.</p>
<p>Critics also accused her of being a "manufactured candidate," dependent on a high-priced network of professional campaign staff and Magna associates. Insinuations about her paid membership organizers in the province of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> hit particularly hard, recalling to some <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Long_%28politician%29_92fc.html" title="Tom Long (politician)">Tom Long's</a> controversial 2000 <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_leadership_elections_6414.html" title="Canadian Alliance leadership elections">Canadian Alliance leadership campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the media reaction to Stronach's candidacy was criticized. Casting Stronach as an "heiress" with a "coddled career" — to the point of joking comparisons to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> — and the attention paid to her physical appearance and personal life, was described by a commentator as patronizing and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">sexist</a>. <sup id="_ref-framed_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-framed" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Canadian media, though generally considered to exercise much greater reserve and discretion about the private lives of public figures than the media of other countries, paid considerable attention to rumours and innuendos about Stronach's personal life, particularly her relationship with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> - a story that has received the attention of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> following a dinner at B.L.T. Steak in Midtown Manhattan at which Clinton and Stronach attended.</p>
<p>Supporters touted her youth and style, corporate experience, private life as a "<a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer_mom.html" title="Soccer mom">soccer mom</a>", and her potential to win new and <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_vote.html" title="Swing vote">swing voters</a>, especially moderate, socially progressive voters in the province of Ontario.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_11.html" title="February 11">February 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, she declined to participate in a debate between the Conservative party candidates, leaving <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Clement_f2b8.html" title="Tony Clement">Tony Clement</a> and Stephen Harper to debate each other on the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> broadcast, Canada's national television station. She later also skipped a March 14 debate on the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Television_Network_3e1a.html" title="Global Television Network">Global Television Network</a>. She argued that she ought only to participate in party-sponsored debates, rather than picking and choosing among those organized by outside sponsors. Critics saw this as her way of avoiding a debate with the other two candidates.</p>
<p>In her major speech at the leadership convention on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">March 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, she promised to serve only two terms if she became Prime Minister, and to draw no salary.

<p>As a CEO, Stronach was more conciliatory to <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organized_labour.html" title="Organized labour">organized labour</a> than her father, who was noted for his strong opposition to unions at Magna.

<p>Before crossing the floor of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, Stronach represented the socially liberal face of the Conservative Party.

<p>Stronach was generally to the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">left</a> of her Conservative caucus colleagues.

During her Conservative leadership campaign, she called for a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_vote.html" title="Free vote">free vote</a> in parliament, with votes cast individually and not along party lines, on same-sex marriage. She spoke and voted in favour of same-sex marriage when the issue came to the House of Commons in 2005; a position she re-affirmed as a Liberal in 2006. <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_conservative.html" title="Social conservative">Social conservative</a> elements in Canada were critical of Stronach, calling her a "<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Tory_e7a4.html" title="Red Tory">Red Tory</a>".

</div>
</div>
<p>In May 2005, Stronach suggested publicly that forcing an early election, especially before passing <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_budget%2C_2005.html" title="Canadian federal budget, 2005">that year's federal budget</a>, was risky and could backfire on the Tories.<sup id="_ref-quickelection_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-quickelection" title="">[7]</a></sup> Harper wanted to force an early election in the wake of testimony at the <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomery_Commission_695c.html" title="Gomery Commission">Gomery Commission</a> damaging to the Liberals. The Tories planned to bring down the government by voting against an amendment to the budget that the Liberals had made to gain <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_ef87.html" title="New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) support. Since this would be a <a href="../../../l/o/s/Loss_of_supply.html" title="Loss of supply">loss of supply</a>, it would have brought down the government</p>
<p>However, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, two days before the crucial vote, Stronach announced that she was "<a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossing_the_floor.html" title="Crossing the floor">crossing the floor</a>" and joining the Liberal Party. Her decision to join the Liberals was facilitated by former <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Liberal_Party_2013.html" title="Ontario Liberal Party">Ontario Liberal</a> Premier <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Peterson_24eb.html" title="David Peterson">David Peterson</a>. Stronach immediately joined the Cabinet as Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister Responsible for Democratic Renewal. In the latter portfolio, she was charged with overseeing the implementation of the <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomery_Inquiry_2b19.html" title="Gomery Inquiry">Gomery Inquiry</a> recommendations, upon their release.</p>
<p>Her decision to leave the Conservative Party came after an uneasy relationship with Stephen Harper. In a press conference after leaving the party, she said that Harper was not sensitive to the needs of all parts of the country, and was jeopardizing national unity by allying himself with the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a> to bring down the government.<sup id="_ref-floorcrossing_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-floorcrossing" title="">[8]</a></sup> She also stated that the party was too focused on <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Canada_90a7.html" title="Western Canada">Western Canada</a> and "<a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_alienation.html" title="Western alienation">Western alienation</a>" instead of having broader focus. Her disdain for Harper was obvious in her press conference with Martin; she never once referred to him by name, only as "the leader of the Conservative Party."</p>
<p>Stronach's move shifted the balance of power in Parliament and allowed Martin's Liberal <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minority_government.html" title="Minority government">minority government</a> to survive. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">May 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, two crucial confidence motions were voted on in the House of Commons. The first vote, on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_C-43_7023.html" title="Bill C-43">Bill C-43</a>, the original budget proposal approved by all parties, was passed as expected, with 250 for and 54 against. The second vote was on a new budget amendment (<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_C-48_2a52.html" title="Bill C-48">Bill C-48</a>) that included C$4.6 billion in additional spending the Liberals negotiated with NDP leader <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Layton_4a4d.html" title="Jack Layton">Jack Layton</a>, to secure the support of NDP MPs. It was on this amendment that the Conservative/Bloc alliance planned to bring down the government. However, the initial vote resulted in a 152-152 tie. It then fell to the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speaker_of_the_Canadian_House_of_Commons_107d.html" title="Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons">Speaker</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Milliken_ba03.html" title="Peter Milliken">Peter Milliken</a>, to cast the deciding vote, which he cast in favour of continuing debate, resulting in the survival of the government. The vote carried with a final count of 153 for and 152 against.</p>
<p>Stronach's decision to cross the floor pleased Liberals and New Democrats, who have used the incident in their media efforts to paint the Conservative Party as being too extreme for moderate voters in Ontario. The Liberals enjoyed a modest upswing in the polls after earlier being damaged by the early testimony from <a href="../../../g/o/m/Gomery_Commission_695c.html" title="Gomery Commission">Gomery Commission</a>. Some political pundits suggested that shortly after Stronach's defection would have been the ideal time for the Liberals to call the election, as Stephen Harper had lost some of his momentum after narrowly failing to bring down the government. Instead, the Liberals were forced into an <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2006">election</a> when they were brought down by a vote of non-confidence later that year, after revelations from the Gomery Inquiry damaged their popularity.</p>

<p>Stronach's party switch mere days before the confidence vote made her the target of considerable criticism both within the Conservative Party and in the media in general. Many were cynical about her reasons for leaving and believed that her move to the Liberals was motived more by ambition than by moral or political principles. In a press conference following the announcement, Harper speculated that Stronach had left the party simply to further her own career. Some likewise accused her of being an opportunist who had never been a true conservative, but had been willing to use the party as a vehicle to achieve political prominence. During the confidence vote the Conservative caucus openly booed Stronach as she stood to show her vote of support for the Liberal government.</p>
<p>Considerable media attention was paid to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_MacKay_a693.html" title="Peter MacKay">Peter MacKay</a>, MP, and the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, with whom Stronach had a relationship of several months. Interviewed the day after Stronach's departure from his party, he stated that he had learnt of her intention to cross the floor mere hours before the public announcement. In an interview conducted at his father's farm, MacKay showed discernible emotion.<sup id="_ref-inthedark_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-inthedark" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>There was additional criticism of Stronach's attendance at a Conservative election strategy planning workshop on the weekend immediately prior to her switch of allegiance, prompting allegations of unethical behaviour from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Reynolds_%28Canadian_politician%29_a22e.html" title="John Reynolds (Canadian politician)">John Reynolds</a>, the Conservative campaign co-chair. Some even accused Stronach of being a Liberal mole.</p>
<p>The day after Stronach crossed the floor, the reaction in Newmarket—Aurora was mixed. Some of her constituents were upset and expressed a sense of betrayal. Protestors picketed her riding office for several days, demanding a <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a>. However some of her constituents supported her move because they did not want an election and supported the budget.</p>
<p>Stronach's defection to the Liberal Party and the speed with which she was given a senior-level cabinet position renewed calls from both parliamentarians and the general public for legislation to prevent such "party-hopping." One month after Stronach's defection, a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_member%27s_bill.html" title="Private member's bill">private member's bill</a> was tabled that would require a <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a> to be held within thirty-five days of a member of parliament quitting a party. According to this proposed legislation, the MP would have to sit as an Independent until the by-election.</p>
<p>NDP MP <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Martin_239f.html" title="Pat Martin">Pat Martin</a> requested an investigation of Stronach, speculating that she had been promised a senior cabinet post in return for her defection. The <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics_Commissioner_of_Canada_34f2.html" title="Ethics Commissioner of Canada">Ethics Commissioner of Canada</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Shapiro_fec0.html" title="Bernard Shapiro">Dr. Bernard Shapiro</a>, refused to investigate her floor-crossing, citing that it was a constitutional right of a Prime Minister to appoint opposition members to Cabinet.</p>
<p>The Conservatives targeted Stronach for defeat in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2006">2006 election</a> as part of their larger goal of a breakthrough in Ontario, especially in the Toronto suburbs (popularly known as the <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_905.html" title="Area code 905">905s</a>). However, while the Conservatives won a minority government, Stronach defeated her Conservative challenger, <a href="../../../l/o/i/Lois_Brown_0a66.html" title="Lois Brown">Lois Brown</a>, by an eight-point margin.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Strahl_6e11.html" title="Chuck Strahl">Chuck Strahl</a>, commenting on his party's <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2006">election victory</a>, called it "poetic justice" that Stronach and <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Brison_5b3f.html" title="Scott Brison">Scott Brison</a> would be going to the opposition benches. Strahl was referring to both politicians being rewarded handsomely following their defection from the Conservative Party, and he joked that they were "like fish out of water" when their party was defeated not long afterwards.</p>

<p>Some of the criticism of Stronach's party switching also came under fire. Political scientist Linda Trimble has argued that the reaction to Stronach's defection to the Liberals is "offensive and sexist", referring to the comments of two provincial legislature members <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_Party_d4fe.html" title="Ontario Progressive Conservative Party">PC</a> <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Provincial_Parliament_ca49.html" title="Member of Provincial Parliament">MPP</a> <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Runciman_1bc5.html" title="Bob Runciman">Bob Runciman</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_Progressive_Conservatives_3c77.html" title="Alberta Progressive Conservatives">PC</a> Tony Abbott. Runciman told the Toronto radio station <a href="../../../c/f/r/CFRB_fc8e.html" title="CFRB">CFRB</a> that, "She sort of defined herself as something of a dipstick, an attractive one, but still a dipstick."<sup id="_ref-runciman_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-runciman" title="">[10]</a></sup> He apologized for his comments and later elaborated, saying that Stronach failed to adequately express her reasons for defecting from the Conservative Party. Abbott said that Stronach had "whored herself out for power."<sup id="_ref-abbott_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abbott" title="">[11]</a></sup> He apologized for the statement the next day saying that the term "whoring" had been misunderstood from context, and noting that it could be equally used for men and women.</p>
<p>Women's groups argued that the media also unfairly characterized the transition. The <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Post_afd6.html" title="National Post">National Post</a></i> used the front page headline "Blonde Bombshell", and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_cartoon.html" title="Political cartoon">political cartoonists</a> made reference to Stronach prostituting herself to the Liberal party.</p>
<p>Stronach's critics downplayed the sexism of their remarks and they accused the Liberals of politicizing the issue in order to "legitimize" her defection. Stronach herself had stepped over several other women early political career so far. She had defeated <a href="../../../l/o/i/Lois_Brown_0a66.html" title="Lois Brown">Lois Brown</a> in the Conservative primary and barely won her seat in an extremely tight race against <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martha_Hall_Findlay_05e9.html" title="Martha Hall Findlay">Martha Hall Findlay</a>.

<p>Following the Liberal's defeat in the 2006 election, Paul Martin announced that he would be stepping down as party leader. It was widely speculated that Stronach would vie for the leadership. She was endorsed by such Liberals as <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reg_Alcock_8f5a.html" title="Reg Alcock">Reg Alcock</a> and Brigitte Legault, who heads the Quebec party's youth wing. However, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, she announced that she would not seek the leadership. Her stated reasons were because she did not like the delegate-based selection process. "I could have raised the money, I was working on my French, but I realized that I was not going to be free to speak my mind on party renewal," said Stronach. She said that renewal would involve giving all party members a direct vote on its direction and leadership, among other things. "If there was a one-member, one-vote system, I would run."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[12]</a></sup> However, a report by <a href="../../../c/t/v/CTV_2c92.html" title="CTV">CTV</a> reporter <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Fife_94e8.html" title="Robert Fife">Robert Fife</a> suggested that her candidacy was hampered by her weak grasp of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, one of Canada's <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilingualism_in_Canada_0e09.html" title="Bilingualism in Canada">two official languages</a>, and the fact that she believed the Liberals would be defeated in the next election. Several Liberal Party officials had also warned that they would enforce the new rules, which placed limits on donations and spendings by contenders, which would have nullified Stronach's largest advantage over other potential rivals.</p>
