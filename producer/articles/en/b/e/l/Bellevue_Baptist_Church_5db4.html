<p>Bellevue Baptist began in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> in a small, log cabin like facility. The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a> completed a 3,000 seat building in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>, which was one of the first <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air-conditioned.html" title="Air-conditioned">air-conditioned</a> churches in Memphis. Bellevue became one of the largest Southern Baptist churches in the United States in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> with more than 9,000 members. The church relocated to its current building (2000 Appling Road), which seats more than 7,000, on a 400 acre (1.6 km²) campus in Cordova, a <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburb</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. Current church membership is more than 27,000, making Bellevue one of the largest churches in the United States. The church's location near <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_40.html" title="Interstate 40">Interstate 40</a> is marked by a display of three crosses that are visible from several miles away. The center cross is 150 feet (45.75 <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meter.html" title="Meter">m</a>) tall, flanked by two 120-foot (36.5 m) crosses.<sup id="_ref-HV_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HV" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Lee was senior pastor from 1927 to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, and he was followed by Ramsey Pollard from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. The church's most well-known leader, <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Rogers_8eae.html" title="Adrian Rogers">Adrian Rogers</a>, was the senior pastor of Bellevue Baptist from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> until March <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. During this period, the church's membership grew from 9,000 to 27,000 and the church moved into a new facility.

Gaines previously served as pastor at First Baptist Church in <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardendale%2C_Alabama_6667.html" title="Gardendale, Alabama">Gardendale, Alabama</a> for fourteen years.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellevue_Baptist_Church_5db4.html" title="Edit section: Relocation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relocation</span></h3>
<p>After being located in the heart of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midtown%2C_Memphis_d248.html" title="Midtown, Memphis">Midtown, Memphis</a> for over 80 years, Bellevue relocated to its current campus in Cordova. Citing growth reasons, in 1983 the membership voted to move to the current campus, completing the move in 1989. Bellevue's main reasoning behind the move to the other side of the city, besides needing more room, was that its membership had changed, with the majority of it now located in the eastern part of the Memphis metro area. <sup id="_ref-Move1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Move1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The move created some controversy both in the city and church communities. Some saw it as Bellevue abadonding a community that could use the church <sup id="_ref-Move1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Move1" title="">[2]</a></sup> while others saw it as a growing issue of <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_flight.html" title="White flight">White flight</a>.<sup id="_ref-Move2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Move2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The former location has since been purchased by another local community church.</p>

<p>In September 2006, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Commercial_Appeal_bcb1.html" title="The Commercial Appeal">The Commercial Appeal</a></i>, Memphis' predominant newspaper, reported that recent changes at Bellevue have led to protests by some members.<sup id="_ref-CA_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA" title="">[4]</a></sup> A website, <a href="http://savingbellevue.com" class="external text" title="http://savingbellevue.com" rel="nofollow">savingbellevue.com</a>, contains allegations by some church members that the church is, under the leadership of Gaines, moving toward becoming part of the "<a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_growth.html" title="Church growth">church growth movement</a>", moving toward an elder-led (as opposed to congregation-led) form of governance, mismanaging its finances, paying its leadership too much, intimidating members that want the church's leadership to be more open, and otherwise "moving away from its traditional roots."<sup id="_ref-CA_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[5]</a></sup> According to Bellevue's leadership, information on the website has appeared and disappeared repeatedly, and quotes and information about church leadership decisions have been taken out of context.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[6]</a></sup> In response to the site's accusations, Gaines said that the church is not leaving its traditional roots, is not a part of the church growth movement, and that the website is creating confusion.<sup id="_ref-CA_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>On September 24, 2006, Gaines addressed the criticism during the evening church service.<sup id="_ref-CA2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA2" title="">[7]</a></sup> Other newspaper articles discussing subsequent developments followed in October.<sup id="_ref-CA2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA2" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CA3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA3" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CA4_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA4" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In November, 2006, the church formed a communication committee to address the controversy. In mid-November, a website was launched by the committee.<sup id="_ref-CommComm_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CommComm" title="">[10]</a></sup> The Communication Committee's site discussed recent reviews of the pastor's credit card expenses. According to the site, deacons from the church met on November 5 and reviewed Gaines' credit card charges, unanimously finding no inappropriate expenditures.<sup id="_ref-CommComm_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CommComm" title="">[10]</a></sup>. The Communication Committee's website has since been taken down.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2006, the church announced that Paul Williams, a minister and staffer at the church for 34 years, had been placed on leave with an investigation pending regarding a "moral failure," identified by Gaines and others as alleged <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexual_abuse.html" title="Child sexual abuse">child molestation</a> in the 1980s.<sup id="_ref-trust_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trust" title="">[11]</a></sup> The next day, December 19, Gaines released a statement that acknowledged that he had been aware of the allegation since June 2006 but that he did not address it for several months because Williams had been attending professional counseling, because of confidentiality concerns, and out of compassion for the staffer.<sup id="_ref-trust_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trust" title="">[11]</a></sup> The same day, Michael Spradlin, who is president of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-America_Baptist_Theological_Seminary_b850.html" title="Mid-America Baptist Theological Seminary">Mid-America Baptist Theological Seminary</a> (located across the street from Bellevue's campus), told the <i>Commercial Appeal</i> that "[i]f a minister has first hand knowledge of child molesting and does nothing about it then that minister should resign."<sup id="_ref-trust_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trust" title="">[11]</a></sup> Spradlin later noted that <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Dobson_fefe.html" title="James Dobson">James Dobson</a> supported his statement, with Dobson reportedly telling him, "[w]hen prominent leaders have no accountability and make these kinds of decisions, other prominent leaders must stand up and hold them accountable."<sup id="_ref-CA_reaction_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA_reaction" title="">[12]</a></sup> Conservative radio talk-show host <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Reagan_3cf7.html" title="Michael Reagan">Michael Reagan</a> discussed the situation on his show, noting that he thought that it was comparable to the Catholic sex abuse scandal and that he believed churches should deal with these types of allegations immediately.<sup id="_ref-CA_reaction_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CA_reaction" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>On December 20, 2006, Gaines addressed several hundred members of his congregation, saying he would like to remain pastor at Bellevue.<sup id="_ref-support_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-support" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>On January 28, 2007, a church committee released a report on its investigation of Williams' conduct and the staff's handling of Williams. The report alleged that Williams had sexually molested his son in the 1980s, that Williams and his wife had informed Jamie Fish, the church's minister of biblical guidance, of his past actions in May 2006, that Steve Gaines met with Williams and his wife in June 2006 to discuss the issue, a meeting that was kept confidential, and that Williams was retained on staff thereafter. In early December 2006, Williams' son, the target of the alleged abuse, met with Gaines to discuss why Williams was allowed to remain on staff. The report found that no other children were molested by Williams. The report criticized both Gaines and Fish for not immediately coming forward with the information related to the abuse, either to the church or to authorities as possibly required by Tennessee law.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>On January 29, 2007, a group of fifty Bellevue members formed a non-profit called "Integrity Does Count" with the aim of restoring more control of the church to the congregation.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>On February 21, 2007, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> reported that the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests was beginning a campaign to prevent sexual abuse within the Southern Baptist Convention, based in part on the recent allegations and purported cover-up at Bellevue.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
