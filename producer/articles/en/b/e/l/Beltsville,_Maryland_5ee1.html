<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Beltsville%2C_Maryland_5ee1.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Beltsville's rich history dates back to 1649, when the land was part of an 80,000 acre land grant given to Richard Snowden I by <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Baltimore_ceee.html" title="Lord Baltimore">Lord Baltimore</a> of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. Snowden and his family were planters who established large plantations on which they built comfortable manor homes. Soon after, other settlers also moved into the area, but they were farmers who could only afford a few acres of land and whose families lived in small cabins. The principal crop was <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco.html" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>, most of which was shipped to England. Because of the fertile soil and desirable growing conditions, the crops prospered.</p>
<p>Industry came to Beltsville in the early 1700s when iron ore was discovered in the area. The Muirkirk Iron Furnace on <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_1_81e1.html" title="U.S. Route 1">U.S. Route 1</a> was established by Andrew and Elias Elliott, who learned their iron-making skills in Muirkirk, Scotland. They produced some of the best-quality pig iron in the country and supplied the U.S. Army with cannons, shot, wheels, and other iron products during both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.</p>
<p>By 1730, Post Road (now called Route 1) was the main thoroughfare through Beltsville. Though crude, it made <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach.html" title="Stagecoach">stagecoach</a> travel possible. In 1783, Gabriel Peterson Van Horn established a stage line and built the Van Horn Tavern on Odell Road, where passengers could spend the night as they traveled between Baltimore and Washington. The trip took one and one-half days.</p>
<p>Beltsville boasts a distinguished <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_War_3268.html" title="Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a> hero as its native son. General Rezin Beall, who was born on Turkey Flight Plantation on Old Gunpowder Road in 1723, prevented a British invasion at Drum Point on the Chesapeake Bay with only 100 men. He is credited with the fact that there are no Revolutionary War battlefields in Maryland.</p>
<p>In 1835 one of the first rail lines in the country, the Washington branch of the <a href="../../../b/%26/o/B%26O_Railroad_6448.html" title="B&amp;O Railroad">B&amp;O Railroad</a>, was built through Prince George's County. Coming from Baltimore, the line entered the county at Laurel and ran southwesterly to Bladensburg, then into Washington DC. B&amp;O established a rail stop and freight depot on land purchased from a tobacco farmer named Trueman Belt, and they named the place after him. The new community of Beltsville was doubly blessed, for the Baltimore-Washington Turnpike crossed the rail line there. It soon became a thriving little trading center, eclipsing the older community of Vansville further north on the pike.</p>

<p>As the Federal Government grew, in 1910 the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture_db31.html" title="United States Department of Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) began to purchase land in Beltsville for its <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agricultural_Research_Service_bdc4.html" title="Agricultural Research Service">Agricultural Research Service</a> (ARS), the main in-house research arm of the United States Department of Agriculture. The land now houses the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_A._Wallace_Beltsville_Agricultural_Research_Center_1c7c.html" title="Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center">Henry A.

The Center eventually encompassed 14,600 acres and became the largest and most prominent center of agricultural science research in the world.</p>
<p>There are a number of historic homes and buildings still standing in Beltsville. The oldest home was built in 1773. One of the largest of the older buildings, built in 1880, was the three-story <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhphoto&amp;action=browse&amp;fileName=md/md1100/md1166/photos/browse.db&amp;recNum=0&amp;itemLink=D?hh:2:./temp/~pp_xxLs::&amp;title2=Ammendale+Normal+Institute,+6101+Ammendale+Road,+Beltsville,+Prince+George's+County,+MD&amp;displayType=1" class="external text" title="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhphoto&amp;action=browse&amp;fileName=md/md1100/md1166/photos/browse.db&amp;recNum=0&amp;itemLink=D?hh:2:./temp/~pp_xxLs::&amp;title2=Ammendale+Normal+Institute,+6101+Ammendale+Road,+Beltsville,+Prince+George's+County,+MD&amp;displayType=1" rel="nofollow">"Ammendale Normal Institute"</a> which was destroyed by fire in 1998. Beltsville has grown because of its location on the Route 1 corridor and because its residents have always been industrious and progressive. With churches of all denominations, schools, activity centers for both children and adults, and civic organizations, it continues to grow and prosper. Through all its growth, however, Beltsville continues to have a small-town feel.</p>

<p>Beltsville's public schools are a part of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_George%27s_County_Public_Schools_9f99.html" title="Prince George's County Public Schools">Prince George's County Public Schools</a> system.</p>
<p>Public elementary schools include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pgcps.org/~beltsvac" class="external text" title="http://www.pgcps.org/~beltsvac" rel="nofollow">Beltsville Elementary School</a> on Wicomico Avenue
<ul>
<li>Beltsville Elementary School was located on the corner of Powder Mill Road and Cedar Lane in what is now a commercial building housing TESST College and other businesses. While Powder Mill Road is now used by area motorists as an east-west link between major highways, it was once a safe road for hundreds of school children walking to and from school. School safety patrols were posted along Powder Mill Road from Emack Road to Howard Avenue, and also up Cedar Lane. School crossing guards were posted on Powder Mill Road at Cedar Lane and Ash Road. Students walked from their homes in Beltsville and were bused from Landover. The school mascot was the "Beltsville Bobcat", which was selected after a project led by the school music teacher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pgcps.org/~calvert" class="external text" title="http://www.pgcps.org/~calvert" rel="nofollow">Calverton Elementary School</a> on Beltsville Road
<ul>
<li>Calverton Elementary School is located on Beltsville Road but it is in the neighborhood of Calverton which is split down the middle by the PG/Montgomery county line. Because of that it is often forgotten by the rest of Beltsville and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.pgcps.org/~mlkms" class="external text" title="http://www.pgcps.org/~mlkms" rel="nofollow">Martin Luther King Middle School</a> on Ammendale Road and <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Point_High_School_9839.html" title="High Point High School">High Point High School</a> <a href="http://www.pgcps.org/~hpoint" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pgcps.org/~hpoint" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> on Powder Mill Road are in Beltsville.</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Luther King Junior High School, which is now known as Martin Luther King Middle School, was located in its present location on Ammendale Road. It was a new school at the time and served students living north of Powder Mill Road in Beltsville. The school mascot is the cobra.</li>
</ul>
<p>High Point High School is located on the highest point in Prince George's County, up the hill on Powder Mill Road past the Calverton Shopping Center. While a few students walk from their homes in the nearby Powder Mill Village apartments, most are bused from other Calverton neighborhoods, Beltsville, Adelphi, College Park, and Landover. The school mascot is the eagle.</p>
<p><br />
In the 1970s, there were six public schools in Beltsville: Beltsville Elementary School on Powder Mill Road, Chestnut Hills Elementary School on Sellman Road, Beltsville Junior High School on Wicomico Avenue, Martin Luther King Junior High School on Ammendale Road, High Point High School on Powder Mill Road, and Calverton Elementary School on Beltsville Road.</p>
<p>Chestnut Hills Elementary School was located on Sellman Road in what is now the site of the Beltsville Library, Prince George's County Police District VI Headquarters, and Ed's Tree Service.</p>
<p>Beltsville Junior High School was located on Wicomico Avenue in what is now Beltsville Elementary School. The surrounding residential area was largely the same as it is now, with the exception of the area down the hill on Howard Road and Yates Road. Yates was nothing more than a gravel road, and the area now occupied by large half-million dollar homes was once a large field where horses grazed. Across Yates Road was a wooded area and a creek, which was a safe shortcut for students living up Garrett Avenue and points north. Students walked from their homes in Beltsville (south of Powder Mill Road) and were bused from <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelphi%2C_Maryland_9330.html" title="Adelphi, Maryland">Adelphi</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Park%2C_Maryland_4c1b.html" title="College Park, Maryland">College Park</a>, and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landover%2C_Maryland_0f5a.html" title="Landover, Maryland">Landover</a>. The school mascot was the panther.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, changes in Beltsville's population resulted in the closing of Chestnut Hills Elementary School and Beltsville Junior High School. The former Chestnut Hills Elementary School has, since February 1984, been home to Beltsville's public library and police station.</p>
