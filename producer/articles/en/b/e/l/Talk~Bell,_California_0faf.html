<p>I have been a resident of the Bell Mobile Park in the City of Bell since 1995. My father and mother moved here from the City of Norwalk in 1993, when this park was mainly considered to be a senior citizens park. They sold there home when my mother found out she had cancer. They bought a small travel trailer and thought that they could travel some before my mother became to ill. Their plans never materialized because she became bed ridden almost immediately. Thats when I moved in sort of... I took care of my mother during the day, while my father, whose health was also failing, worked. I slept outside at night, as their was no room for me. She passed away in that trailor.</p>
<p>Afterward, I stayed on with my father in the trailor until he retired, about a year later, and decided to move to Texas. Still I stayed here in the city of Bell. I liked living here in the park, it reminded me of the camping trips my parents would take me on when I was younger. I enjoyed the people, and the small town feel. Even though I had isolated myself from all of my friends in Norwalk, I felt content.</p>
<p>In November of 1998, I saw my father for the last time at the trailor. He had come from Texas, and stopped by. I was surprised. He drove all the way here with 1 leg, the other had been taken off to the knee by dieabetes. He said he'd come to bring me the pink slip to the trailer and say 'hi' to some of his old friends. He didn't stay long. The same evening that he arrived back in Texas, (3 days later!) he passed away. I was completely heart broken. Im an only child, and was unable to afford the trip.</p>
<p>My friends here in the park helped me through that time. The manager and his wife would let me just sit in the office when I couldnt stand to be alone. Everyone including the seniors where great.</p>
<p>A few months later we formed our committee. Two women from the City, a very nice and knowledgible man from the main management company, both managers, and a few of us concerned residents had meetings every month for good communications. Things were great, I felt so lucky to live here, but I was still lonely needing to fill some lonely void in my heart. God blessed me with a small, black cat. He was only a month old and had just gotten hit by a car on Alameda Blvd. I named him Bucky after my dad (whose name was buster, but i called the cat Bucky cause he was so small). I took care of Bucky like a child, and spent alot ($2000,00) on all of his vet bills. Me and Bucky where insepabile. Anywhere in the park I went, Bucky went also. He even rode on my scooter!</p>
<p>My father left me a small inheritance of 20,000 dollars. I was always dreaming of something bigger, and saving things to furnish it with when I could finally afford it. Well after all the sadness, God smiled on me yet again! A old lady decided to move and was selling her trailor for a small amount. It was 10 times larger than mine, and was so greatful. My mind went wild with decorating ideas, and I had some money to do it. I wanted to do right by my father, so I was very selective about how I spent it. Buying that trailer was the beginning of my downward fall!</p>
<p>I will continue tomarro, Its very exhausting to think about all Ive been through the last 3 years. My heart is broken. This story does have a serious question, maybe someone else will understand and advise me on my future here in the Bell Mobile Park, the place Id been so happy and content and friendly living at for so many years.......</p>
<p>until tomarro, Sincerely, S.C. from Bell</p>
