<p>Wrong. We don't just accept what the subject says about themselves, though this can also be included. We look at what secondary sources say about them. I George Bush says he is Australian, we would still say he is an American.</p>

<dd>I have never suggested forcing anyone into a religion. Please don't put words into my mouth or anyone else's. It's not a good way to resolve issues. Nor have I ever mentioned a Jewish nation. I am talking about family background, i.e. elements of culture. Judaism can be religion and/or culture. There are plenty of Jews (by family background) who are not religious.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Germans claim General Kleber is a German, and this is stated in verifiable secondary sources, then this is a pertinent fact which should be mentioned, along with counter claims from elsewhere and any self-identification.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You seem to want to arrive at a definitive pronouncement and judge which of the claims should be used to the exclusion of the others. This is not how wikipedia works.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree not every claim by a secondary source should be used. Such claims should be used according to their importance and impact, and represented proportionately. The majority opinion should be stated as that, and any minority opinion given less weight and clearly indicated as a minority opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to whether the information is in the lead section, a category or in the main text, that has to be decided on a case by case basis, and from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. It seems that this issue is a contentious and emotional one, which can make that position difficult for some people. It is not such an issue for me.</dd>

<p>Already an overflow of information on his seemingly irrelevant Jewish descent, and now further attempts are being made to attribute that he was somehow described as Jewish more often than not, even though from the apparent footnote, he never said he was Jewish. Also, You should check the history of the article form of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_mathematicians_0047.html" title="Category:Jewish mathematicians">Category:Jewish mathematicians</a>.

<dd>Well, was he described as Jewish more often than not? This is entirely different as to whether he himself said he was Jewish or not. Please try to differentiate between the two aspects and treat them accordingly. Otherwise it is muddled thinking. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 19:30, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure why you're responding to my message to another user but ok. Furthermore no it's not. Unless somebody can unequivocally be proven as Jewish via descent, they are not Jewish unless they say they are. As far as I know, I've seen few if any reliable sources that explicitly call Georg Cantor "Jewish." but then again I'm not an expert on Georg Cantor. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELaGrange_b445.html" title="User:LaGrange">LaGrange</a> 00:52, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is not necessarily consistent across articles, or at least has not been in the past, though the Highways naming issue indicates it may be moving in that direction. Wiki works from secondary sources in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and, where they contradict each other, wiki does not usually seek to judge in order to reach a conclusion, but states the different point of view, so the reader can see what is being said in order to form their own judgement. Jewishness is something that attracts emotional and partisan reactions, leading to <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> editing, which is counter to wiki policies. If the policies are followed objectively, it usually makes the issue easy to resolve. What I see is people seeking to impose their own views on certain matters. This should be resisted. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't do much with categories, so you'll have to correspond elsewhere for that. Try <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuncorn_4389.html" title="User:Runcorn">Runcorn</a>. I'm more interested in the article text, although I have to confess very little interested in the subject under discussion.

<p>I am beginning to be rather concerned about your many edits removing ‘Jew’ and ‘Jewish’ related categories from articles. You do not even have a consistent reason. Sometimes you claim <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, which in and of itself is incorrect, otherwise the term “irreligious Jew” would be an oxymoron. Then you start removing the tag from dead people as well, such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_P%C3%B3lya_5a98.html" title="George Pólya">George Pólya</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lise_Meitner_d12c.html" title="Lise Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>. On the latter, your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lise_Meitner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75289298" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lise_Meitner&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=75289298" rel="nofollow">edit summary is particularly disturbing</a>. The only consistency in your actions and words that I have found, is that you have an issue with people being identified as “Jewish” on wikipedia, and there is something particularly disturbing about that fact, besides for which removing valid material from an article is always vandalism. I see no justification for such removal, from wither the living or dead, your arguments on the various talk pages notwithstanding. If you have a stronger argument, I would like to hear it; otherwise, please refrain from vandalising wiki articles in the future.

Anyway, the bottom line is Bellbird, this is what's going to happen if this escalates - the usual CFD discussion, the usual debates between these sides (well, you read the January one, so you know what I mean) with absolutely nothing new brought to the table. For the most part, as you've already seen, few people except for a few extremists agree with you and this is unlikely to change in any future debates. In the end, absolutely nothing would have changed, except the time of me and many other users - ranging from IZAK to everyone debating this on Jewish mathematicians and so on - users who do very useful things here when they are not bogged down in this - would be wasted. So I just don't see the point, when the conclusion of this is so pre-determined, to conintue this whole " "Jewish" is a four-letter word" thing. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 16:00, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to come out strongly in support of Bellbird. I have not to date seen categories for Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or atheist. What is it about Jewishness that needs to be labeled? Just looking back at the recent and current history of persecution of Jews, then that type of branding can only be seen as divisive. Jews were tattooed during WWII to make them easily identifiable, and this has the same disturbing echo about it. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_venter_0ade.html" title="User:Paul venter">Paul venter</a> 14:42, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Paul,I am really apprcieate your concern to us-the Jewish people. But, your past (i.e ,Europeans),at least, presecutions dont mean that we are not allowd to be Jewish ...its realy an oxymoron what youre saying-"dont say that some one is a Jew ,else where he will be hunted",or ,in other words:Jewishness is something that have to be wipe out because it put the Jewish people in danger....npw,do you realy think that we are that stupid to belive it? .More,most of the Jewish scientists that their own origins were emited by Wikipedia users -are allready died , so -how can they be in danger ??? ,and you should know that most of the holocaust servivors unwilling to remove the tatto they get by the European peopole that tried to wipe the Jewishness out of the world.They want the world to remmber what happend by this kind of people, which i heavly suspect as being ideology supported by some users in Wikipedia.What is it about Jewishness????well,you cant write about most of the great Jews,and there are numors of them ,that they were born in Israel,because -they were born in the diaspora...so,when you are writing about a Jew that he were born in Germany , its the same like sainig that he was German, but historicly ,geneticly,ethnicly and etc-its just dont true... the unik history of the Jews,put them as avery distinct group.Einstein said that a Jew will remain a Jew even if he is unpractising or even convert.This is somthing that most of the anti semits know very well, but they 'forgot' it when it comes to great ones...--<a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilisa_6281.html" title="User:Gilisa">Gilisa</a> 07:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Should we have cross-indexes for Jewish Bankers, say, or for Black Criminals, or for White people of Great Intelligence?</p>
<p>There are ways of classifying information that are simply not encyclopaedic (or civilized). The fact that tags can lend themselves to that is an argument against keeping such tags, not an argument in favour of keeping them.</p>

<dd>In theory, I do not have a problem with Jewish bankers. The latter category you bring is racially charged, and has its own issues that needs to be dealt with. And I know that Jews own the media, the banks, the seats of government, the press, and every third 7-11, but I do not think Jewish bankers would suffer from that the way "Bell Curve" related material would. But you would need to create Category:Bankers by religion first and then make a subcat. ;) -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 16:02, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"would you like an extremely rich label to be the first thing that a stranger finds about you"? Well, just so you know, ethnicity/religion is not supposed to be in the header of the article. So, i.e. Grigory Perelman, when his article said "Russian mathematician of Jewish origin", it should not have said that. The <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28biographies%29_010f.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (biographies)</a> basically forbids any ethnicity from header, which I fully agree with and have been enforcing. However, there's simply no reason not to mention ethnicity at later points in the article if it has been mentioned in a reliable source. We certainly do it in a large number of bios and it is information reported by reliable sources. So I wouldn't call it "the first thing" mentioned in the article, just one of several other things (remember, "Russian", "Mathematician", etc. are labels too, and these are even allowed in the header). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 16:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Meh, it's all fairly pointless and no big deal. If a reliable source said it, we can say it. That's really what it comes down to, and, in 2006, there is no reason not to mention someone's Jewishness, or Italian Americaness, etc. if we can verify it. In terms of inclusion in articles, there won't ever be a policy that forbids it because it seems to break the carnal rule that Wikipedia is not censored. As for your proposal for lists and categories to SlimVirgin, I'm automatically voting "Keep" on such nominations, until the day when ALL ethnicity/religion categories (yes, the Greek-Americans too) are nominated together. In fact, if I woke up one sunny morning and nominated the Greek, Greek-American and Greek-Orthodox (and all the other Greek-X categories and lists) for deletion, and then went around snuffing out mentions of the Greek descent of Americans from their articles because it may "inappropriately label" them, I would probably be blocked for disruption.

<dd>What the word "Jew" means compared to "Greek" is really a matter of one's opinion. I could easily make the claim that if we say someone is of Greek ancestry, a reader could assume they are Greek Orthodox and thus.... box them into a religion!! A person's reaction to all this probably says more about the person themselves then it does about what is stated. As for "Catholic because one of your ancestors was Catholic", that is a silly exaggeration (and besides, all that the article would say would be "Jack O'Lantern's grandmother was Catholic", which would be fact presumably, it wouldn't say "Jack O'Lantern is a Catholic"). If we strictly follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, such things should not occur. Remember, Wikipedia is the messenger and we trust the (reliable) source to get it right (which I hope most of the time they do...) But certainly you can not have mentions in an article that an American is of Italian heritage but not mentions that they are of Jewish heritage. Definitely not fair. Anyway, I didn't want to get bogged down in a discussion and I doubt you will change your mind (I certainly won't change mine). What it comes down to are sources. So, for example, if you're displeased with the statement that "Grigory Perelman comes from a Jewish family" or you don't understand in what terms that Jewishness is defined, your case is probably with the Daily Mirror (I think it was) or whichever national newspaper made that information public. There's hardly point in concealing certain information that's been made public through a major newspaper. We're not journalists, just, so to speak, messengers. That's really all I can say about the subject. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 16:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The whole "Jewish mother" thing is a set of beliefs which many people, and certainly even many Jews, do not share. As I said, what a person makes of a "Jewish mother" mention says more about the person then it does about the article. If Wikipedia flat-out say "Person X is Jewish because their mother is", that may constitute original research if a source hasn't said it and thus be POV. But mentioning a biographical fact is blameless. We can't remove information from articles because of what a reader may make of it based on their own beliefs. Definite no-no if that's the reason. Otherwise we would have to, say, remove accusations of whatever crime from people's article because the reader may dislike the person because of them. The crucial thing with Wikipedia is reporting the facts as stated in the source. Certainly we don't write articles from the point of view of what a person may or may not think if they read the article. We just report. And to the reader - draw your own conclusions based on what you think. As for the categories and lists, I have spent too much time sourcing them under WP:V and WP:NOR to nominate them myself. Like I said elsewhere though, I will vote Delete once I have made sure every single such category and list is included in the nomination. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 17:00, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, of course, I see this from the American point of view, and indeed the majority of the bio articles I edit are indeed of Americans. But like I said, I did not want to get bogged down in a discussion regardless, which is why I sort of stepped out of it and went with the "where is this going" thing with my first post to your pages, and what I said there hasn't really changed. I fully believe this is just a waste of everyone's time. When ethnicity and/or religion is unsourced it can and should absolutely be removed from the article, no argument there. But a source makes all the difference. A reliable one. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 17:31, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes that's actually exactly what Wikipedia is supposed to be doing. Report (or "soak up", if you will) other people's classifications. Not make our own or avoid them completely. As for a list of Jewish slave traders, I doubt it would be large enough to make up its own page. However, the whole "Jews were slave traders" thing should definitely be addressed and dispelled under the articles about slave traders and possibly about Jewish American history. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 17:44, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, if that article is notable enough it should be addressed in the appropriate Wikipedia articles, as well as, if we have it (and we should) an article on Black and Jewish relations in the United States. We can't just avoid touchy subjects because they are touchy. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 18:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Eh, in order to make a List of something on Wikipedia, you need the list subjects to have articles. I don't believe we currently have a large number of articles on slave traders who were Jewish. I can't name a single one. I'm sure, though, if we had an article on one of them (i.e. if they were notable enough) the article would mention that the trader was Jewish and he would be in that category. That person certainly can be listed under one of the lists of Jews, but again, I seriously doubt we would ever have an actual article on more than a handful of Jewish slave traders. We certainly have a list of Jewish American gangsters, and a category, and articles like <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugsy_Siegel_7b0a.html" title="Bugsy Siegel">Bugsy Siegel</a> certainly mention their Jewishness just like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Unabomber_6a9a.html" title="The Unabomber">the Unabomber</a> article mentions his Polishness. Even for people like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Berkowitz_7170.html" title="David Berkowitz">David Berkowitz</a>, it's mentioned. So I wouldn't say Wikipedia is too one-sided or anything like that to accentiate the "positive". <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 18:24, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well it's not before 1970 anymore, is it? Anyway, we're getting into a social discussion of some sort when in fact I hadn't wanted to get into a discussion at all. The bottom line is now basically the same as it was when I began this conversation on your page - aside from the fact that neither of us will change our mind - the status quo as it is right now on Wikipedia is highly unlikely to change and it is just a waste of hard-earned time to try, especially, as you must have noticed, that so many people disagree with you even if of course a few agree. What it comes down to is there is no reason to remove cited information as long as it is properly cited, but, I've already said that. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 18:30, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
