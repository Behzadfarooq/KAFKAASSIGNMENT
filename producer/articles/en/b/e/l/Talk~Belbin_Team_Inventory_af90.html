<dl>
<dd>How? This shows to me a fractured and incomplete understanding of the terms "personality" (as characterological, temperamental, behavioral and/or otherwise), "types" (as categorical -- categorizable), and the compound "personality types" (as categorizable descriptions of traits of [categories of] people -- which may or may not be dynamically interlaced with other types or partially available to those with another dominant type, thus giving the "strong tendencies toward multiple roles" which is mentioned) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Belbin_Team_Inventory#Footnote:_References_of_Potential_Interest" class="extiw" title="w:Talk:Belbin_Team_Inventory">§</a>. I think Belbin, while obviously smart enough to discern and create a test to distinguish roles people (innately!!) tend toward is unfortunately not smart enough (in the right way) to recognize that what he is doing is typing people/traits. (Hint: Not all traits can manifest outside of groups or working relations - simply <b>only</b> measuring these traits does not remove the resultant categorical entities from the domain of "Personality Types" [though obviously limits their role within that domain].)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not only that, but he also doesn't seem to realize that the Belbin categorical descriptions of motivations, roles, behaviours, and etc... do match the descriptions of such things in other categorical personality typologies (and also equal the absolute number of basic personality categories in the Enneagram typology).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm feeling my anger at the moment for personal reasons, else I would have couched this in more diplomatic language (especially since my anger isn't warranted at this statement of his). Still, it is preferable to me that idiocies such as this do not prevail, especially under those who seem to think they have a thing going and are trying to sell it to others.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Belbin has not actually made a statement of this sort, and the words have been put in his "mouth", I apologize to him (and reaim them toward the appropriate person[s]). If he seeks to get by with the nitpick "equivalent", then he's right, but this is a profoundly stupid nitpick to make given that as far as I can tell no putative personality typology covers the entirety of traits necessary for any one or more of it's types to be considered full "personality types".</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps he was referring to a specific personality typology?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps he thinks it may eventually be a personality typology but doesn't yet think it accurate enough to be considered such?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps he thinks the Überordnung "tendencies toward mulltiple Roles" is actually more apropos the label "personality types", thus the Roles are mere granular entities below that?
<ul>
<li>I do not disagree with this, but still recognize that most other typologies also greatly suffer from this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Are the "strong tendencies toward multiple roles" fully real, or perhaps somewhat an artifact of observer bias (the test and/or insufficient understanding in the human observer-evaluator)?</li>
</ul>

<dd>If people had an innate talent for magic, would not "Magician"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> be a Role people see as generally needed or helpful? Thus I posit that Belbin has identified roles that primarily exist not because they are "needed", but because they are what's currently greatly extent (and extant) in human capability, thus what we have grown accustomed to using. And these can obviously also be discriminated - 'typed' - or he wouldn't have been able to discriminate 9 different basic <b>types</b> of Roles. And at least some people (or clusters of people) generally prefer to utilize <b>one</b> of these types over the others, thus the specific traits of the types can be readily discriminated.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<ol class="references">
<li id="_note-0"><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> The error in a Role "Magician" is that it is a specific 'Type', such as a Cook would be. Belbin has made his Roles quite general, thus it seems probable they are general types that are not culturally created, but innate to humanity. Thus considering them "Personality Types", in addition to "Team Roles" is appropriate. When have humans not been, at least for the majority, in "Teams"?</li>
<li id="_note-1"><b><a href="#_ref-1" title="">^</a></b> If at least some people didn't have specific preferences even among a "handful" (strong tendencies toward multiple roles) of types available to them, any types (or anti-types - types which people have the <i>least</i> affinity for) gleaned from studying the people would be greatly diffuse - and perhaps this is the case, but if so, the 9 "diffuse" types are indeed still types.</li>

<p>People (replicating molecular reactions and above) wish to be useful to (and use) their surroundings (a matter of fitness and survival). This includes other humans. People will find the most easiest, efficient, or "proper" way to do this. They will do this by utilizing those parts of themselves they find (behaviorally) most easiest to access or relevant and use again over time (innate leading to learned conditioning). We will form roles. These roles will be perceived by the people who have them and by other people who interact with them as a large portion of "personalities". Some parts of these personalities will be idiosyncracies, and thus not classifiable. Others will be more general (including general kinds of idiosyncracies) and will thus be typable. The more general pieces of these Roles (/personalities) will be described and classified (typed). Fin.</p>
