Because "Perez Hilton" is a joke. Vacuous blogging and gossiping don't merit being recognized as noteworthy or remarkable. Putting that crap site in the same sentence as myspace or facebook makes your assertion even more absurd.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Lavandeira Jr.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why isn't Perez Hilton included? Perez Hilton (aka Mario Armando Lavandeira Jr.) - gossip columnist/blogger and founder of Perezhilton.com. His website gets 5 million hits per day. The estimated value of his site is close to $100 Million. I would not be surprised if Rupert Murdoch's News Corp or another media company acquires his site. He could stand to be the wealthiest alumn from Belen. If you consider the recent acquisition of Myspace and the suggested valuation of facebook.com, PerezHilton.com may be the next blockbuster site.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong, Cabrera graduated from Belen in '74. The same Cabrera who owned 250 Burger Kings and recently sold them. Consider what YOU erroneously deleted fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Al Cabrera" that was linked to under "Noteworthy Alumni" was the wrong Al Cabrera. Consider it fixed. Andre3k1 01:15, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Here's an idea: instead of fighting over which alumni we consider "noteworthy," why not just list ourselves? I consider my accomplishments great. Though my father is but a dentist and his father a pediatrician we are all alumni and men for others in our day to day lives. Here I dare you to list yourselves as noteworthy alumni!</b></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
-This is Wikipedia, not Wikiality. We should have some respect for the facts. Father Arroyo is rolling over in his grave, and Leo Nuñez should do a better job policing the ignoramuses this school is producing. So much garbage on the timeline. Inane cheerleading in the sports section. Mischaracterized "noteworthy" alumni. Guys there is something called Google today. Anthony Laurencio, by his own account is a member of Sueñalo Sound System, not Bacilos. Gaston Cantens was replaced in District 114 by Anitere Flores (Gsanta sez: hey her dada was an alum, doesn't that count?)</p>
<p>Also, is there no sense of pride of accomplishment instilled into students? Recognizing trivial politicos (e.g. the Florida House, a national laughing-stock), lobbyists and little-known actors (even if they are in the latest, and much-improved revival of Sondheim's Company). Come on, the Jesuit mantra is "give me the boy and I'll show you the man". Surely, Belen must have produced a more distinguished list of men than these displayed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Gsanta: Folks, please take your arguments to another forum. Wikipedia is not a forum for your personal opinions. If you have an opinion, take it to a blog - that's what blogs are for. You can add your blog to the links section of the page. Also, please don't modify my comments with editorial artifacts. It makes whatever argument you subsequently make sound biased.</p>
<p>In response to Gsanta: Hmm...I notice that along with my rant, alot of the facts used on this page had been deleted for a while. So, apparently, according to you, opinions are ok as long as they aren't expressed verbally. Ah well, I can see how open minded this school REALLY is, notwithstanding I placed a disclaimer saying I was NOT criticizing any particular school in favor of another, just chastizing the school need to have an enemy by showing that BOTH schools have pros and cons, NOT my actual opinions. Well, I at least hope some order can be found here.</p>
<p>72.153.64.188: Ive made a change to the amount of alumni, but I would like some verification. The Web address, that I translated from Spanish, where I got the extra names is: <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.vozcatolica.org/70/belen.htm&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DCarlos%2BFinlay%2BBelen%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DG" class="external autonumber" title="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.vozcatolica.org/70/belen.htm&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DCarlos%2BFinlay%2BBelen%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Embarrassed Alumni: That article explicitly states that Saladrigas was NOT a graduate of Belen. Miguel Diaz is Miguel Diaz de la Portilla a low-level Miami politico. The actor is an unknown, but we wish him great future success. Carlos Finaly predates the school. Here is his educational background if you care: "In 1844 Carlos was sent to France and studied in a school at the Havre until 1846 when he had to return to Cuba on account of an attack of cholera. This disease left him with a serious stoppage in his speech which was cured after a careful course of training instituted by his father. We notice to this day, however, a peculiar slowness and confusion in the enunciation of ideas through articulate speech, a defect that seems to be rather mental and in some way connected with his very decided absentmindedness.</p>
<pre>
   He returned to Europe in 1848 to complete his education in France, but the revolutionary movements of that year obliged him to remain for a short time in London, and during one year in a school at Mentz on the Rhine.  He entered college at last in Rouen where he continued his studies until 1851 when he returned to Cuba to convalesce from an attack of typhoid fever.  The
</pre>
<p>Spanish law at the time would not validate for the degree of Bachelor in Arts, the college courses followed in France, and he came to Philadelphia where the said degree was not necessary for the study of Medicine.</p>
<pre>
   He graduated in Medicine on the 10th of March 1855 from the Jefferson Medical College..."
</pre>
<p>Why do you cheapen your school with such low-light luminaries? Pompi cantens is a nice guy but, noteworthy? Bacilos doesn't consider the Belenite to be a member of the band...check out their website. Paris Hilton? Please. Look if really work together at this we can come up with a decent list of people who have made notable contributions to society, but this is a piss poor group.</p>
<p>I request this page be protected against vandalism. People keep changing the mascot from Donovan the Darky to other silly things. Donovan is a long-standing tradition we at the school are very proud of. Please protect this page. Thanks.</p>
