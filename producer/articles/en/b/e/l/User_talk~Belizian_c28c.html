<p>I live in the jungle of Belize, Central America. I am well educated but not knowledgeable about correct names of various plants and animals I take picutres of. I take pictures of what intrest me and have a large collection but no ideal of prper names. I know the pictures would enhance wikipedia but don't know how to post em properly. For example I have on of a multicolore lizard have no Ideal of it's scientific name so can't post it. General stuff I can do like pictures of goverment buildings, villages, and such and I have started doing so. I also will take pics by request if you explain what you want.</p>

<p>Good job on the pictures. I noticed that some of the pictures you have are identified. You might want to edit articles and add the pictures of plants and animals that you can identify to their respective article pages. Also, someone has registered concern over the pages in this series <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plants_and_animals_of_Belize_e986.html" title="Plants and animals of Belize">Plants_and_animals_of_Belize</a>. If you would write an article on that page giving an overview, it would sure help. &#160;:) <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 15:58, Aug 28, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please write on users talk pages, not their main pages. The concern regarding the pictures was minor -- a casual mention on the <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> channel. I was just suggesting that you might want to write something up on them. If you are taking pictures solely for the purpose of other users posting them on pages, then it may not be the best idea to put those as part of the main encyclopedia. The best thing to do would be to put them on your user page (or create a subpage of your user page, such as User:Belizian/photos and then post a message in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a> saying that you have pictures for other people to use.</dd>

<dd>Nobody is mad at you, and we all most definitely appreciate the great work and good pictures, but if you put them on your user page and then posted in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Wikipedia:Village pump</a> then a lot more people would find them and be able to use them. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> 16:54, Aug 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Iv'e been hanging them off of Belize page beacuse they are all taken in Belize and concering things in Belize. I'm hopeing to make kind of a virtual zoo of Belize, therefore It will only have pics of things that are in Belize though they may also be elsewhere. Main thing is I find it tedious to post to wiki though I love the concept and I'm trying my best to contribute when and as I can. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelizian_b4bb.html" title="User:Belizian">Belizian</a> 17:48, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where can I review this reqistered concern? Basicaly I take pictures I'm not a writer. I use this page to post my pics for others to identify and use in their articals. Putting them in one place like this makes it easier on me and since I'm giveing this pics to the world free I'd appreciate a little tolarence on this issue but if it's a big deal I'm willling to discuss it.</p>

<p>You're doing a fine job. But, for a matter of record, you have to put a copyright tag on your images. This can be done on the discussion page of each image. Since you are giving away your images, the best copyright tag would be {{GFDL}}, or 'GNU FDL Free Doc License'. This is necessary, otherwise in the future your images could be refused because of lack of a copyright tag. By the way, I have used already one of your images, the one identified as <i>Alpinia purpurata</i>. I have included it in the article about <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpinia.html" title="Alpinia">Alpinia</a>. One request&#160;: a picture of the habit of the plant (= the whole plant) would be welcome, as well as a close-up of one of the leaves. When done, you can put a message on my discussion page. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 20:30, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Alpinia picture (Red Ginger) is on Flora page 1. By the way, messages belong on the Talk pages, not on the User pages. And messages should be signed by 4 tildes, like this ~~~~. And never mind all these remarks, everybody, including me, had to go through the learning stage. And when taking pictures of plants, make a habit of taking several pictures&#160;: a) the whole plant b) the inflorescence c) a flower (if possible in macro) d) a branch or stem with the foliage (especially if there are a pinnate leaves) e) a closeup of a leaf, showing the margin (if possible in macro). When uploading the pictures, you link them with the same caption but with a different number such as red.flower.1.jpg, red.flower.2.jpg etc... With the different images of the same plant, you can help us describing the plant in detail. And keep up the good works&#160;! <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJoJan_2b10.html" title="User:JoJan">JoJan</a> 08:09, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could you be so kind to make some pictures of an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthurium.html" title="Anthurium">Anthurium</a> plant. There are very few photos of them in the public domain. These plants grow in tropical America, from Mexico down. So, I suppose, they must also occur in Belize. And, if possible, make several photos of each plant (full habit, leaf, flower, details..).

<dd>Hi. Sorry to take so long—I didn't notice your reply on my user page (instead of my <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerryFriedman_0284.html" title="User talk:JerryFriedman">talk page</a>). Yes, photographing wild birds is usually very hard! And you need that long lens.

<dd>&#160;:) That's quite funny. I guess that <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">User:Fir0002</a> felt the same way with his Wolf Spider. Thanks for clarifying that you are the photographer. I've now modified the image page to state that explicitly - its really just a pedantic thing, that without source information or knowing who the copyright holder is, we don't exactly know that the GFDL tag is correct.</dd>
<dd>By the way, you are probably welcome to vote on <a href="../../../f/p/c/WP%7EFPC_af1f.html" title="WP:FPC">WP:FPC</a> if you want to.

<p>Hi, I removed the story you posted on <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_Events_62e7.html" title="Current Events">Current Events</a> for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The story didn't seem to belong on the date where you placed it. If the story was reported in a newspaper dated January 13th, it shouldn't be listed under the January 20th events.</li>
<li>I know this may be an important story in Belize, but (as far as I can tell) only one newspaper is carrying it and there are no hits on Google News. It doesn't appear to be of global importance, which is usually what it takes to be included on Current Events.</li>
<li>The summary was way too long. Two or three sentences is usually the maximum for a summary. If it wasn't for the first two points, I would have attempted to edit the summary instead of deleting.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I'm going to remove the story, but if you can find more sources, please feel free to include a short summary and link on the correct date. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> 18:44, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have been interested in visiting Belize for a decade or so. Haven't had the local contact to coach me tho. I have a small sailboat that lives on a trailer and I sail extensively in the Florida Keys. I'd consider sailing past Cuba to Belize if I had some confidence on being able to leave it for a while as I traveled around the country. I sail, hike and camp extensively.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can chat sometime via mIRC as #masp or #belizian</p>
<p>Alternate is to use User talk:Masp and User talk:Belizian</p>
<p>or you may have better idea.</p>
<p>I noticed you were active in the #wikipedia just now.</p>
<p>you don't seem to have a talk page.</p>
