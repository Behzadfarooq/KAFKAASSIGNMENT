<p>Very little has been definitely revealed about Belkar's early life. He once spun a <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0125.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0125.html" rel="nofollow">sob-story</a> about how he was ostracized in the halfling community for being exceptionally small even by halfling standards and that he has since strived to be a great adventurer in order to assert himself and eventually return to the village and exact a murderous and bloody revenge. While he subsequently claimed to have done this purely to gain extra experience points for role-playing, much of the story rings true. Belkar is indeed quite sensitive about his height and when <a href="../../../v/a/a/Vaarsuvius.html" title="Vaarsuvius">Vaarsuvius</a> hits him with a crushing despair spell he <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0128.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0128.html" rel="nofollow">laments</a> that he is going to die alone and unloved.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that at least some members of his family share his general disdain for the lives of others and have a similar bloodthirst - it has been suggested that he has an <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0165.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0165.html" rel="nofollow">Aunt Judy</a> who is as vicious as he is. He also seems to believe that spending time with one's family is a form of cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p><a name="Joining_the_Order" id="Joining_the_Order"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belkar_Bitterleaf_9a55.html" title="Edit section: Joining the Order">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Joining the Order</span></h3>
<p>Details of Belkar's adventuring career are sketchy, although he was clearly something of an atypical ranger, in that he has never taken any points in the Survival skill.</p>
<p>What is known is that four days prior to the formation of the Order of the Stick, Belkar was locked up in the local prison, facing a charge of murdering fifteen people in a barroom brawl. He managed to escape when the "Iron Mage" wizards' arena, located immediately next door to the jail, was accidentally destroyed when Vaarsuvius mis-scribed a <i>Distant Inferno</i> spell. The resulting blast damaged the prison enough for Belkar to make his escape, although not before he'd taken revenge on one of the guards, whom he claimed was "Size-ist".</p>
<p>Belkar was next seen pushing to the front of a line of adventurers and mocking monks for their wimpy attack style (for not being armed), waiting to be interviewed by <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Greenhilt_7c09.html" title="Roy Greenhilt">Roy Greenhilt</a> to join his party. Roy had just offered the last place in the group to a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_c134.html" title="Monk (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">monk</a>, when Belkar arrived and, faced with the pressing need to leave town quickly with a heavily armed group, persuaded Roy to take him instead, initially asking who Roy wanted him to kill in order to earn his place, then revealing that he was a ranger with, he claimed when Roy showed interest, considerable tracking skills. As Roy needed somebody with those abilities, he agreed to take Belkar on.</p>
<p><a name="The_Order_of_the_Stick" id="The_Order_of_the_Stick"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belkar_Bitterleaf_9a55.html" title="Edit section: The Order of the Stick">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Order of the Stick</span></h3>
<p>Despite his kill-first who-cares-about-asking-questions attitude and lack of party loyalty causing the occasional problem, Belkar has proven to be generally effective as a party member during his time with the Order. Roy has learned from experience that Belkar is unlikely to follow orders to protect vulnerable individuals during combat, and he has often been known to regard his own teammates as viable targets, but, with carefully applied threats, the rest of the group have generally been able to keep the halfling under control and they consider him to be one of their own, standing by him when he faces threats from others. Having levels only in warrior-based classes (ranger and barbarian), Belkar has a Base Attack Bonus equal to his level, making him the most effective melee combatant in the group alongside Roy, whose combat skill is the same.</p>
<p>Captured and imprisoned in Azure City, Belkar was able to break out, murdered a guard and went on the rampage, daring paladin <a href="../../../m/i/k/Miko_Miyazaki_5e6c.html" title="Miko Miyazaki">Miko Miyazaki</a> to track him down and face him. She did so, in a fight that ranged throughout the castle, ultimately getting the better of the halfling (Though not before Miko was rendered unconscious at one point, and despite ample opportunity, Belkar refused to Coup de Grace her, apparently out of boredom). However, as she prepared to administer the final blow, she was struck from behind by a spell from <a href="../../../v/a/a/Vaarsuvius.html" title="Vaarsuvius">Vaarsuvius</a> who, despite his/her contempt for the halfling, still preferred him to Miyazaki. Belkar, however, was quite ungrateful, as he had been doing his best to provoke Miko into a genuinely evil act to deprive her of paladinhood; only the reminder that the party had no easy access to Raise Dead spells changed his mind. However, during the New Year celebration, the drunken halfling kissed Vaarsuvius. Since then, the wizard has been going out of his/her way to aggravate Belkar, in order to prevent any possible repeat of the incident. The exact nature of Belkar's relationship to Vaarsuvius is unknown.</p>
<p>In return for <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Greenhilt_7c09.html" title="Roy Greenhilt">Roy</a>'s co-operation in defeating <a href="../../../x/y/k/Xykon.html" title="Xykon">Xykon</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_the_Order_of_the_Stick_0dfe.html#Lord_Shojo" title="Characters of the Order of the Stick">Lord Shojo</a> has secretly agreed to allow Belkar to continue traveling with the Order of the Stick, postponing Belkar's trial for his murder of a Sapphire Guard until one week after Xykon is defeated. However, in return for his freedom Belkar has had an enchanted rune, visible only through a Detect Magic spell (or similar), placed upon his forehead. This "Mark of Justice" represents a powerful curse, triggered whenever Belkar violates certain terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>if Belkar attempts to deal lethal damage to any living creature within the bounds of any city, village or town. This condition is not revoked even if Belkar is attacked within city bounds; Belkar was able to circumvent this by getting others to kill the attacker for him, which he was not penalized for. He is also still able to kill outside the city limits (He is still allowed to deal lethal damage to undead, and of course can inflict <i>non-lethal</i> damage as much as he likes.)</li>
<li>if Belkar is separated from Roy by more than a mile;</li>
<li>if Roy triggers the curse with an as-yet-unrevealed activation word.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the curse is activated, Belkar would get sicker and sicker until he is incapable of hurting anyone. Belkar's freedom has been given "on the sly"; Belkar must remain in disguise whilst the Order are in Azure City, and Roy's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_the_Order_of_the_Stick_0dfe.html#Eugene_Greenhilt" title="Characters of the Order of the Stick">father</a> has created a permanent illusion of Belkar in the Sapphire Guard's cells (this initially worked, though problems arised when "Belkar" did not eat for weeks). So far, he has been careful to avoid violating any of the above terms that would activate his curse, although he came very close when facing <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_Guild_5229.html#Yokyok" title="Linear Guild">Yokyok</a> of the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_Guild_5229.html" title="Linear Guild">Linear Guild</a>, before Elan reminded him. His share of all the treasure and loot gathered will go towards having the guard he killed raised from the dead.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_the_Order_of_the_Stick_0dfe.html#The_Oracle_Of_Sunken_Valley" title="Characters of the Order of the Stick">Oracle of Sunken Valley</a>, Belkar will eventually cause the death of at least one of the following: <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_the_Order_of_the_Stick_0dfe.html#Miko_Miyazaki" title="Characters of the Order of the Stick">Miko Miyazaki</a>, Miko's "stupid horse" (Windstriker), Vaarsuvius, Roy or the Oracle himself, although, due to the specific wording of his question (or rather, the lack thereof), Belkar wasn't able to find out which one. The Oracle also strongly suggested that Belkar <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0329.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0329.html" rel="nofollow">won't live very much longer</a>, but no one in the party can remember this.</p>
<p>He possesses a <i>Ring of Jumping +20</i>, discovered during the Order's quest through the Dungeon of Dorukan. Belkar chose the ring when dividing up the loot after the quest, because he felt that it would not only allow him to rain death from above onto his enemies but also to reach things on high shelves. He had proved quite adept at concealing the ring somewhere on his body, allowing him to retain it when imprisoned in Azure City; he claims that he puts it in a place where no one will bother, nor dare searching or looking</p>
<p>On the Order's return from Cliffport, having successfully rescued Roy's sister <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_the_Order_of_the_Stick_0dfe.html#Julia_Greenhilt" title="Characters of the Order of the Stick">Julia</a> from the Linear Guild, Belkar was the first member of the Order to realize that <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linear_Guild_5229.html#Nale" title="Linear Guild">Nale</a> had switched places with Elan the bard, as, once he'd removed Elan's clothing and bathed, his different smell was enough to tip Belkar off. Ignoring the Mark of Justice, Belkar lunged at Nale with the intent of brutally murdering him. Unfortunately for the ranger's comrades, Nale successfully managed to magically Charm Belkar, and ordered him to murder his companions (while singing the complete score to "<a href="../../../m/e/e/Meet_Me_in_St._Louis_fcb0.html" title="Meet Me in St. Louis">Meet Me in St. Louis</a>"). Belkar was, however, subsequently restrained by Vaarsuvius, then tied up by Haley and kept restrained well after the charm had worn off. After he was finally released, he was present when Lord Shojo was murdered by Miko Miyazaki, an act which caused the latter to lose her paladinhood. Belkar later realized the loss of her Paladin powers would prevent him from ever killing her horse Windstriker, something that caused him considerable anguish. Said anguish had apparently worn off some time later in the city dungeon, when he awakened Miko with a rock to the head and led the other prisoners in a round of applause, commending her on being a 'paladin turned murderer'. She promptly swore she would kill him (again), but this only seemed to amuse him. Hinjo later summoned the prisoners (Belkar included) over 5th level (except those guilty of a capital crime) and offered them a deal: fight to defend Azure City and have their sentence reduced by five years, or remain in prison. Roy managed to convince Belkar to take this deal as the minimum sentence for manslaughter is four years. Hinjo. having overheard, then changed Belkar's sentence to six years, but then made a seperate deal with him. If Belkar helped to defend the city, Hinjo would have his wizards remove the Mark of Justice, believing (wrongfully) that the Mark has taught Belkar his lesson.</p>
<p>During the battle Belkar lends Roy his Ring of Jumping +20 to Roy for him to pursue Xykon, the purpose being that he made a bet with another prisoner that Roy would be foolish enough to take the risk. Later on in the battle, the same prisoner pays him 10,000 GP to look out while he attempts to Sneak Attack Hinjo with a poisoned arrow, the prisoner having being bribed before the battle by a powerhungry noble. Although initially agreeing, Belkar is caught up in a "moral" dilemma by two shoulder demons (his <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoulder_angel.html" title="Shoulder angel">shoulder angel</a> having being rendered mad by Belkar's murderous tendencies) in that he could either take the money and allow the prisoner to slay Hinjo and risk the Mark of Justice to never be removed (and thus never being able to kill within city limits) or saving Hinjo, thus securing a chance to remove the Mark. Choosing the latter, Belkar then lunges at the prisoner and both of them fall off the castle walls (and out of city limits) with Belkar decapitating the prisoner in midair and landing in the middle of a large group of hobgoblins. Being outside of the city, Belkar then begins to slay the hobgoblins gleefuly.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belkar_Bitterleaf_9a55.html" title="Edit section: Personality, Abilities and Traits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality, Abilities and Traits</span></h2>
<p>Belkar can be readily described as being extremely vicious, bad-tempered and distractible. He has no patience, poor memory, is utterly immoral, and would quite happily kill fellow party members for experience or their items. He would rather slit throats than take prisoners. He generally hates others as much as they hate him. Although his alignment was once in dispute, it has since been <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showpost.php?p=559967&amp;postcount=4" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showpost.php?p=559967&amp;postcount=4" rel="nofollow">confirmed</a> by the creator of the strip both through explicit statement and through various events in the comic itself that Belkar is <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alignment_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29_1984.html#Chaotic_Evil" title="Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)">Chaotic Evil</a>, something he attempts to prevent being discovered by Paladins. In his particular case, this does not mean he serves an evil ideology; rather, it means that he is completely self-centered and finds the greatest joy in harming others. His pleasures seem limited to killing things, murderously avenging minor insults, showing off his savagery, surprisingly sophisticated mental torture, setting things aflame, and copious amounts of food, ale and sex. He does have a sense of humor, albeit a relatively primitive one, and often finds <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elan_%28Order_of_the_Stick%29_fadf.html" title="Elan (Order of the Stick)">Elan</a> amusing. As far as physical confrontations go, Belkar is essentially fearless. To him, the <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0105.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0105.html" rel="nofollow">more</a> enemies to kill, the <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0261.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0261.html" rel="nofollow">better</a>. He is attracted to good-looking human females.</p>
<p>Belkar seems to be a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterstereotype.html" title="Counterstereotype">counterstereotype</a> to the traditional Tolkien-inspired <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">RPG</a> halfling, who is a stealthy, jolly, social, calm, occasionally mischievous and fairly cute person who dislikes violence and prefers a tranquil life emphasizing the small pleasures of life (the fact that he is none of those things has driven his shoulder-angel insane). His only similarity apart from his stealth (He has high ranks in Hide and Move Silently and used these against Miko) would seem to be his enjoyment of food; he has on a few occasions displayed the advanced culinary sense traditionally associated with halflings. He also has an unusually keen sense of smell; he was capable of identifying Roy's true identity when he was under the effects of a <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girdle_of_Femininity_Masculinity_5052.html" title="Girdle of Femininity/Masculinity">Girdle of Femininity/Masculinity</a> (though this didn't stop him from trying to flirt with "her", purely for the joy of tormenting Roy) and recognizing Nale by scent alone.</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/a/a/Vaarsuvius.html" title="Vaarsuvius">Vaarsuvius</a> has implied that Belkar has a problem with the concept that other people deserve to live, which essentially sums up Belkar's morality. The elf also claims Belkar has a Wisdom score "normally reserved for <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemming.html" title="Lemming">lemmings</a>" (due to this he is usually unable to use healing scrolls) and an Intelligence score that "would compare unfavorably with that of a table" (though (s)he later considers the last comment an insult to tables). All of these statements match Belkar most of the time.</p>
<p>In contrast, Belkar has incredible skill when he is torturing or fighting someone; he's come up with innovative battle tactics (like soaking the paladin Miko in <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sake.html" title="Sake">sake</a> before he threw a match at her), used class limitations to his own advantage (as he hid from Miko, knowing that Spot and Listen aren't paladin class skills), and improvised methods to get around dangerous situations (such as throwing up a lead sheet to prevent Miko from realizing his Chaotic Evil alignment; her Detect Evil couldn't pass the sheet.) His mental cruelty displays a surprising level of sophistication as well, such as attempting to make Miko kill him so she'd lose her paladin abilities. Considering that Belkar is Chaotic Evil, he may well believe the only good use of his brain is to torture or kill someone, and in an <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0058.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0058.html" rel="nofollow">incident</a> where Vaarsuvius cast an Owl's Wisdom spell on him, Belkar temporarily became a much more peaceful and focused being, indicating that his Wisdom score must be at least as high as nine (since a thirteen would be needed to cast Cure Serious Wounds).</p>
<p>Since the kiss incident, Vaarsuvius has developed the hypothesis that Belkar is only able to process two emotions with regard to other people: hatred and lust. While this does appear to hold true in many cases (particularly the hate part), there are certain individuals who appear not to fit into this theory, most notably Elan. While Belkar was perfectly willing to 'defeat' Elan in order to gain experience, he finds the bard amusing, they get on reasonably well, as a rule, and the two have, on occasion, <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0038.html" class="external text" title="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0038.html" rel="nofollow">joined forces</a> against Roy for their own amusement. When Elan was captured by bandits, the halfling required no persuasion to join the rescue effort, although it was on the basis that if anybody was going to gain experience for killing Elan, Belkar wanted it to be him (and Elan makes him laugh). He also seems to admit a certain amount of admiration towards Shojo due to his authority over Roy, general attitude and the fact that Shojo often has paladins do menial tasks; when Shojo was murdered by Miko in Belkar's presence, the halfling was visibly quite angered.</p>
<p>Belkar apparently knows the complete score to "Meet Me in St. Louis", and Vaarsuvius believes he lusts after Haley Starshine, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermione_Granger_d701.html" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, <a href="../../../m/r/s/Mrs._Butterworth_8215.html" title="Mrs. Butterworth">Mrs. Butterworth</a> and Vaarsuvius him/herself (Vaarsuvius reasons that after he/she saved Belkar from Miko, he classified him/her under the lust part of his brain). Haley does, on occasion, bring out unexpected sides of the halfling. At one time she made him feel guilty of being insensitive and prejudiced to her, the only time he has ever displayed anything resembling guilt and shame. Belkar also admits to finding it creepy that Haley polishes the party's gold daily, one of the few times that he has been shown to be ill at ease.</p>
