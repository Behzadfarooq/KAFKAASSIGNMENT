<p>Why is 2003 added to the time that Belgrade is the capital of Yugoslavia? Will it no longer be the capital after 2003? -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It will still be the capital, but Yugoslavia will no longer exist - it's being (been?) renamed Serbia &amp; Montenegro. I had thought the name change occurred in 2002, though this isn't reflected in the <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> article - can anyone confirm? <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a></dd>

<p><i>After rigged elections in 2000 Belgrade was the site of major demonstrations which caused the ousting of president Slobodan Milošević.</i></p>
<p>Is whoever wrote this asserting that the elections were rigged, or is there a general consensus? If the latter, among whom? I assume more than one person says it, but more than one person says the same thing about <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2000_85ca.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2000">the elections here that year</a>, and it would still be POV to declare it baldly somewhere. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalieber_db73.html" title="User:Calieber">Charles A.

I don't understand why in such an extensive article there is no mention of the war Serbia waged against the former republics of Yugoslavia. This is a HUGE part of history. People died defending themselves from Serb aggressors. Yet you mention NATO bombing of Belgrade...</p>

<p>Can someone confirm the remark about "beli" also meaning "east" in Slavic? In Serbo-Croatian I know the modern word for east is istok, and my Slavic lingustics professor has previously remarked that the meaning of Beograd was indeed "White town". In Russian the cognate only means white as well, not east, so I suspect the remark about it possibly meaning "East Town" may be erroneous. <a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENonbonumest_d45e.html" title="User:Nonbonumest">Nonbonumest</a></p>

<p>Serbia didn't exist as a formal political entity from roughly 1459-1526, 1527-1804, and 1922-1941 and therefore cannot have had a capital (See: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Serbia_946b.html" title="History of Serbia">History of Serbia</a>). In addition, Serbia had other capitals after 1404 (See: <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitals_of_Serbia_6d96.html" title="Capitals of Serbia">Capitals of Serbia</a>).</p>

<p>It's true that Serbia didn't exist as a state for longer than 3 centuries but Belgrade remained its last real capital (Smederevo was leveled to the ground). It became a mecca for the Serbs during 16th and 17th centuries, when it was one of the biggest European cities, counting over 100,000 people. Culturally it never ceased to be the capital of Serbia, not even during Turkish rule, even though legally Turkey was a centralised state. Serbs have never stopped looking at Belgrade as its capital city, rather than Constantinople of course. Belgrade was the capital of Serbia under Austrian occupations (3 times), and finally when Serbia declared independence in 1806, with Belgrade its capital. It would be the same as if you said that Athens (next to Constantinople) hasn't been considered a capital city by the Greeks, it's simply not true. Therefore, I support this timeline, and so does the city government (in 2004 Belgrade celebrated 600th anniversary of its capital city status). Serbia may have ceased to exist for 300 years, but teh Serbs themselves surely haven't.</p>

<p>The quotes section is rather POV. All of the quotes kind of glorify the city and they are certainly not well balanced. So, just like with photos, we can put on a good or a bad quote, thus introducing a POV.

<p>Thank you for this fantastic article, it is very informative and precise. You have described Belgrade in such a way that I can’t wait to come and visit it. BTW I really like the section about nightlife, and I think the text shows us that it is an important part of modern Belgrade, and please don’t «minimize» it! Is it true that Belgrade won the title ‘City of the Future’? We don’t get much information here in France about it; so if someone could write about it, that would be nice.</p>

<p>Belgrade has won the competition in the category of South European City of Future, after previoisly holding the title of "South-East-Central European City of Future". Belgrade got selected because of its cheep but qualified labour force, low prices and big investments, as well as the standard of living which is one of the highest in this part of Europe (there's a big gap between Serbian North, where Belgrade lies, and its poor South:(). New pics have also been added to this article, the city needs some good marketing after a very tough decade.;) Belgrade became popular among Ex Yugoslav nations as "Sin City"- where you can party your a** off without spending as much as in other Central European capitals; clubbing became one of the new brands of the city. Belgrade is also expecting a big boom in investments in the years to come, as it approaches the EU. <a href="http://www.siepa.sr.gov.yu/investment/belgradeFDI.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.siepa.sr.gov.yu/investment/belgradeFDI.htm" rel="nofollow">City of Future Article</a> <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENeroN_BG_df91.html" title="User:NeroN BG">User:NeroN_BG</a></p>

<p>There is a problem with pictures in the article and the way they affect the layout in wide windows on reasonably high-res screens. For example, "Geography" section starts with a huge gap to accomodate the two pictures from previous section(s). Perhaps we should do some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate some pictures which don't add value as they are now</li>
<li>Move the pictures from the floating right strip to their own galleries, perhaps even their own articles</li>
<li>Reduce the size of thumbnails - they are rather large by Wikipedia standards</li>
<li>Move all right-hand images into first-section and let them span as far as they need (essentially reserving right side for those images only), something like in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_computer_hardware_in_the_SFRY_da02.html" title="History of computer hardware in the SFRY">History of computer hardware in the SFRY</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We should also improve pictures. If anyone can take fresh/better pictures that would be nice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kralja Milana Street picture is rather pale</li>
<li>"The Victor" picture is really not the picture of the Victor, but of New Belgrade. Victor is to the left, headless (head is out of the picture)</li>
<li>Despot Stefan Tower picture is also rather pale, I could try editing it but it would be better if retaken</li>
<li>Map of municipalities only includes numbers that have to be looked up from the list, leaving a huge white gap. I'll see what I can do, but if anyone has a better, ready-made solution, please yell...</li>

<p>"Old Belgrade is situated in South-Eastern Europe, with one part on the Balkan Peninsula". Please stop vandalising the article. Balkan peninsula and Southeastern Europe are synonyms so this sentance does not bear any rational meaning. Vojvodina indeed belongs to Central Europe and so does Zemun and even New Belgrade, the latter however only geographically. To check out the borders of the Balkans see Central Europe, Balkan peninsula etc. Balkan peninsula reaches Sava and Danube which is where it merges into Central Europe. User:NeroN_BG.</p>

<li>Thanks for the advice. And? Sorry, man but you are absolutly wrong. "See the article Central europe, Balkan peninsula". Balkan is not the same es South-Eastern europe at all- the borders of Balkan peninsula are Sava and Danube, the borther of south-eastern europe is the northern border of Serbia (Vojvodina), as well as of Croatia.

<p>One thing is political map and the other thing is geographical terms. I'm sorry if this is too hard for you to comprehend, I understand that you have a limited "storage" capacity, however that's not my problem to deal with. Geographical, cultural and historical terms prove my point. Political terms however surpass the Balkan borders well into Central Europe (Carphatian basin, Pannonian plain- and so in political terms the areas such as Vojvodina, Transylvania, Pannonian Croatia and sometimes even Slovenia are considered South-East or Balkan-european, which does not correspond to their historical, cultural and other ties)</p>
<p>So I don't know where you came up with all those missconceptions about this area, but it's pretty evident that you are lacking a significant, if not basic, amount of info to start with.</p>
<p>And, one more thing... that same Wikipedia that ur trying to involve into discussion is going to confirm my claims, so feel to check not only Wikipedia but every other encyclopedia that you can think of:) Thank you for your comments, enjoy your enquiries User:NeroN_BG</p>
<p>I'm really sorry, but you are wrong. Historically, borders of Central europe were borders of Austrian empire. However noone consider today not, Serbia, but even Croatia to be an Central European country. Any case, you wrote, that Zemun (ok) and NEW BELGRADE belong have Central European culture. I cannot ignore political meanings becuase the TERM South-Eastern Europe is only 10 years old, and was made of political reasons. Croatia claimed that it cannot be a Balkan state since the half of it is not on the Balkans. Romania complaind that it's concidered to be a Balkan state and only 5% of it's teritorry is on Balkans. That's why new ter was found out whicj includes NORTHERN CROATIA, VOJVODINA and ROMANIA as well.</p>

<p>- First things first. Your sentence "Noone consideres Serbia nor Croatia to be Central European" is no argument whatsoever and doesn't offer a rational explanation nor covers your arguments. Nonetheless it depicts a lack of the latter. Northern Serbia and Croatia are indeed Central European, first of all geographically, according to the Danube-Sava-Kupa line which separates the Balkans from the Central Europe, not to mention culturally and historically. Transylvania of Romania is a Central European part of Romania, since it is located west of the Carphatian mountains, which form Central Europe's eastern border, also without mentioning cultural and historical arguments that there are plenty of, as in Serbo- Croatian case. Eastern Part of Romania, Wallacia and Moldova are considered Eastern European, while Dobruja region is a Balkan, or southeast european region of the country. Political map, on the other hand (type it on Google if you don't understand what it means) counts these areas as a part of Southeastern Europe or the Balkans, which indeed makes sence because today these areas are unified and represent a one whole; so in that case they are beeing perceived differently, wrong if you look it from the geo-cultural-historical aspect. You can go pretty much both ways however ONLY in political terms. BUT since political terms represent only a slice of a country's identity which is basically determined on its geographical position, history, culture, religion, neighbours, climate etc there are no reasons to fight those arguments. If you chose to perceive a country through political perspective only your results tend to be inconclusive and wrong, because ignorancy and uninforminess of the one sided view makes you see a totally misshaped image. I have to say I feel sorry for you if you think that's the way to be.</p>

<ul>
<li>The claim that Croats and Albanians had nothing to do with occupation of Belgrade is irrelevant because the sentence is about the occupation of entire Yugoslavia (<i>Yugoslavia was invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian and Bulgarian forces...</i>).</li>
<li>Even if it would not be the case, the Croats had very much to do with occupation of Belgrade specifically, as the very outskirts of Belgrade were ceded to Croatia.</li>
<li>The claim that "Serbian collaborators under Nedić" have anything to do with occupation of Belgrade is patent nonsense because Nedic's government was formed on August 29, while German troops entered Belgrade on April 12, some 3 1/2 months before.</li>

<p>I've changed this twice to "during socialism" and was reverted twice, so I guess it's time to take it to talk.</p>
<p>The formulation "under communism" is both wrong and POV. Wrong, because there was no communism, nobody claims or ever claimed there was communism, and the country was called "socialist", not "communist" in its name and constitution. It's POV because "under" implies that it was imposed from the outside or by a minority, both of which are untrue - Serbia and especially Belgrade supported the Communist party after (and in case of Belgrade, also before) WWII, and the socialism was home-grown.</p>
<p>Now, all this can be debated and sourced to people with different opinions, but there are appropriate articles for that, and this is not it. We have the unquestionable fact that the country called itself socialist (and had a form of socialism implemented), and we have the neutral preposition "during". What's the excuse not to use them? <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 13:24, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to go with Zocky on this one. The country was socialist or something similar, but in no way communist. In fact, I cannot think of any argument making it communist. FYI: If you studied law or political science in SFRY, your textbooks would correctly read that communism is a classless society, and that SFRY is not in fact a classless society, but a transitional society in, what political scientists call, a socialist state. As far as "under" goes, that's just POV no matter what facts we determine here, because it sounds pejorative. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcabrilo_147a.html" title="User:Dcabrilo">dcabrilo</a> 13:34, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It <i>was</i> under a Communist regime. I know it was technically in transition to Communism, but so was the USSR and that's usually considered communist. The reason it sounds pejorative is that communism has finally been utterly discredited. As for "under" not being NPOV, I suppose you consider the period of Communist rule, during which dissidents were imprisoned and no multi-party elections were held, to be a golden period of democracy? Something is only POV when it is factually incorrect, and Communism was imposed, whatever you'd like to think.

<dd>Actually, the alternative is less precise.

<p>So, I think that References section should go to the bottom of the article because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed order of sections in <a href="../../../g/t/l/WP%7EGTL_2e4c.html" title="WP:GTL">WP:GTL</a> is apparently a relic of a time before the introduction of Cite extension, when articles had a few references, and section order didn't matter much.

<li><a href="../../../g/t/l/WP%7EGTL_2e4c.html" title="WP:GTL">WP:GTL</a> says that <i>It is okay to change the sequence of these appendices</i> anyway.</li>
<li>There is discussion about which order should be preferred in WP:GTL right now.</li>
<li>Sections were in that order when the article was featured<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgrade&amp;oldid=85603363" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgrade&amp;oldid=85603363" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 14:12, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Still, the current practice is to keep them before external links and before further reading. When that changes, we can change in this article.

<p>I changed the picture of the arena because the previous one wasn't saying much</p>
<p>Now, since it seems to me that the new one is obviously better and I'm not sure why it wasn't already in use, does it have to do something with the copyright?

<dd>Yes, the copyright is the problem. The <a href="../../../b/g/a/Image%7EBGArena4.jpg_3cbd.html" title="Image:BGArena4.jpg">image page</a> doesn't say who is the author, and the image looks quite professional, and there are similar problems with some of the other images sent by the same user. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 16:50, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/l/Talk%7EBelgrade_b147.html" title="Edit section: Vincha?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vincha?</span></h2>
<p>Isn't it a bit of long shot to claim continuity back from Vincha? I mean, obvious city nucleus is on Kalemegdan and Dortiol area. Historically it was only recently that city territory expanded on Vincha, after Grocka municipality was incorporated. There are neolithic sites closer to the city, Banjica being one confirmed and I've heard that there might be some findings even in Kalemegdan area (need someone to comment on that one).</p>
<p>Vincha IS one of the most important and famous archeological sites around, but hey, let's not sacrifice the truth for some undeserved and unneeded addition to Belgrade's already significant history.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, however, while the most well known, and eponymous, findings of Vinca culture do come from Vinca, there are other settlements of the Vinca culture in Belgrade, for example a well known one is on Banjica which is the wider center of Belgrade today. It is safe to assume that there was one on Kalemegdan which was completely removed by the later ones, as it was as strategically important position then as it is now. I'll rephrase Zocky's rephrasing.</dd>
<dd>Ironically, some excavations discovered even earlier Neanderthal population but it isn't in the article I couldn't find a reliable reference about it. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 16:58, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can see a point there, but there's more to it. The article on Belgrade is not that of continuity- we all know that Belgrade has been raised to the ground 38 times during verified history alone. That also implies that Belgrade has spent a large amount of time rebuilding and reeventing itself, evolving if you will. This article is about emphasising Belgrade's glorious days- that were in essence shortlasting comparing to its much longer destructive periods. There were several periods of Belgrade's true glory, when the city topped the continent, culturally, demographically and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>First as the capital city of the biggest neolithic culture in Europe- Vinca culture. Vinca's traces could be found as far as Asia Minor on one side and Slovakia on the other side. This is extremely relevant to the city's prospect cause it shaped cultures to come, mixing with them and maybe even helped in shaping Balkans that we know</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second period would be that of the Roman Empire, when Belgrade was host to the Flaviae IV legion, serving as one of the largest castrums on the Roman Danune frontier. At the peak of its Roman-period-glory Belgrade counted some 10,000 souls- out of whom 5,000 were soldiers. In the 3rd century Belgrade became a semi-independent municipium of Roman citizens which stimulated its growth however only for a short time due to barbaric invasions from the north and political instability within the Empire</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second glorious period of Belgrade's history would be the one between the rule of Despot Stefan Lazarevic (1404-Serbian capital) and the Austro-Turkish war (1689-91). Belgrade topped Eastern Europe as its largest city, counting well over 100,000 souls, before it became to crumble under the wave of refugees and clashes between the Empires</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Third glorious period would be the one of Kingdom of Serbia (1882-1918). Belgrade passed through a reinassance, cultural and industrial transformation, emancipating from both East and West, reaching its medieval 100,000 mark in the eve of WWI</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Forth period would, arguably, be the contamporary Belgrade. Host to many European and World Championships (volleyball, basketball, Universiade), City of the Future of Southern Europe 2006, book faires, music and cultural festivals and so on. This is a matter of taste anyways.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is- Belgrade's history is indeed highly admirable and glorious- that's why we have to emphasise its brightest moments, one of which was the Vinca nucleus. Many other factors were surely included but Belgrade did not stick out during other period as much as it did during the ones mentioned above. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENeroN_BG_df91.html" title="User:NeroN BG">User:NeroN_BG</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>All of that doesn't make Vinča the same thing as Belgrade. We all know Neanderthals lived near Krapina, yet nobody is claiming that they founded Krapina. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User_talk%7EZocky_f226.html" title="User talk:Zocky">Zocky</a> | <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_Picture_Popups_bee7.html" title="User:Zocky/Picture Popups">picture popups</a> 01:08, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
