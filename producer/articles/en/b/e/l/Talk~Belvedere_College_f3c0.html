<p>Someone keeps adding Terry Wogan as a past pupil. Odd since he was born and raised in Limerick and there is no boarding in Belvedere.</p>
<p>Not really, he went to Belvedere in 5th and 6th year. Have a look in his auto biography. Got out of limerick as soon as he could!</p>

<p>Is there anything that can be added to the science paragraph? Should we include the names of the students?</p>
<p>The article as a whole is pretty good, but when I read it the names of the two students who won the scholarships stuck out like a sore thumb as utter trivia. I don't know the two guys in question and wish them every success, but if their 5 week scholarship is notable enough for inclusion, then by the same token every winner of every medal (Duggan medal, Dempsey medal etc.), every student who has represented the school in international competition, the school captain for 150 years, the lead role in the opera and the play, the captain of JCT and SCT etc., and pupils who won "proper" scholarships to US universities, i.e. scholarships covering their full college careers, all have a claim for inclusion. Those of a certain generation might be interested to know I won a merit card in Elements Knights 30 years ago, but Wikipedia ain't the place to tell them. <a href="../../../t/t/_/User%7ETt_225_09f2.html" title="User:Tt 225">Tt 225</a> 07:43, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your contribution, I've taken it into account and I've created a permanent facility to include the recipients names. Referencing your intention to consider including the winners of the Duggan medal etc., their merits should be taken on a case by case basis and not thrown in with a discussion about an article on Science in Belvedere.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 83.71.58.73 (<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User_talk%7E83.71.58.73.html" title="User talk:83.71.58.73">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__83.71.58.73_1e62.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 83.71.58.73">contribs</a>) 21:21, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>I think you missed my point - winners of a transition year prize simply aren't notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. People visiting the page don't have any interest in it. Instead of creating a permanent facility to keep your name on the page why not truly consider whether the encyclopedia entry for the school is going to be enhanced by an ever-increasing list of trivia. <a href="../../../t/t/_/User%7ETt_225_09f2.html" title="User:Tt 225">Tt 225</a> 01:27, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but its not my name. I was asked by the headmaster to ameliorate the section about science as part of Belvedere's policy on promoting the life sciences (including mentioning names!). May I ask who are you to determine Belvedere's priorities? Or indeed, to call them "trivia"? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.71.58.73_698f.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.71.58.73">83.71.58.73</a> (<a href="../../../8/3/2E/User_talk%7E83.71.58.73.html" title="User talk:83.71.58.73">talk</a>) 20:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I suppose I should deal with the provocative question first, without becoming overly provoked. You seem to suggest that this encyclopedia article should be platform for Belvedere's policies, and that authorship of the article should be confined to those who have had the imprimatur of the headmaster, or at least those who edit the page to his (or your) satisfaction. But Wikipedia is not (among other things) a soapbox <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAP" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#SOAP</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So perhaps we can agree that editing the page does not equate to speaking on behalf of the school? I believe I have sufficient association with and knowledge of Belvedere to make a positive contribution to this page in the spirit of neutrality. In contrast, <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> suggests that your edits of this section are more suited to, say, the Belvederian annual than to this forum: <i>"In keeping with Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy, edits where there is a clear conflict of interest, or where such a conflict might reasonably be inferred from the tone of the edit and the proximity of the editor to the subject, are strongly discouraged. Of special concern are organizational conflicts of interest."</i> The footnote goes on to clarify that organisational conflicts: <i>"include, but are not limited to, those posed by edits made by: public relations departments of corporations; or of other public or private for-profit or not-for-profit organizations; or by professional editors paid by said organizations to edit a Wikipedia article with the sole intent of improving that organization's image."</i> Nuff said? And perhaps worth mentioning to the next person who tries to "suggest" to you that you should edit the article with a particular agenda in mind?</dd>

<dd>Now, conflict aside, I can see that you have put far more effort into the page than most others, and I do appreciate that. But when somebody else edits the page and they clearly aren't out to vandalise it or to defame the school in some way, please take their contribution in good faith and recognise that it isn't your property or that of the school: <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a></dd>

<dd>My points above remain valid - the article correctly recognises the individuals connected with the school who are notable enough for such recognition in the alumni section. Winners of prizes in a school are recognised in the school's yearbook or in the local newspaper, not in the Encyclopedia Britannica or Wikipedia. My edit leaves the relevant information that the scholarship exists, and leaves the external link to the newsletter where the two names can be found, should anyone want to investigate further. <a href="../../../t/t/_/User%7ETt_225_09f2.html" title="User:Tt 225">Tt 225</a> 01:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Names keep on getting added here which may be notable but which do not have Wiki entries, nor any citations of notability given. I have removed the following&#160;: John Gerard Campbell; Paul Robert Duffy; Fionan Murphy; David Ryan; Karl Mullen - on the basis that there is nothing cited for them, and none of them have a Wikipedia entry of their own. The only one I've heard of is Karl Mullen. I appreciate that a presence on Wikipedia should not be a minimum requirement, but when such a presence is lacking, I think there should be some kind of indication of notability by another means. --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWastekiller_2a55.html" title="User:Wastekiller">Wastekiller</a> 12:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC) Karl Mullen is cited in "Belvedere's Rugby Heroes".

<p>Change this heading to School Academic Structure (to match the article heading)? Also, the classes used to be named by a different convention: Senior school had four streams e.g. 1G1, 1GA, 1G2, 1G2A. The Junior school had the class names Elements Knights &amp; Warriors; Rudiments Lions &amp; Tigers; 3G Explorers, Pilots &amp; Scouts; and 2G Falcons, Eagles and Hawks.

<dd>While it was a pain reinserting the alumni after they were all deleted, it's hard to disagree that they do need sources, and that whoever deleted them was correct. That being the case, some of the alumni are given sources from Wikipedia itself, which is kind of pointless ... Wikipedia is not a reliable third-party source as required by policy <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">WP:Verify</a>.
