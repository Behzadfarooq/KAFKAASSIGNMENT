<p>Good article.</p>
<p><br />
The information displayed is completely biased and should be changed immidiately. The Belgaum(or beLgav) is dominated by Marathi speaking population and Kannadi is hardly spoken there.Belgaum issue is subjudice and no pro-kannadi claims should be made.</p>

<dd>Mr Impumozhi whoever you are, your post betrays your bias. The uncivil nature of rajeev or whoever's remarks is there for everyone to see. And Mr. Dinesh has only responded in kind. If you are really so concerned about civility and political correctness on WP you ought to speak to the instigator first and then to Mr. Dinesh. Also what is it about "Stay where u are" that irks you and I also dont understand why Dinesh has to apologize for that. The way I understood that sentence is.. "It doesnt matter whether Marathis are more in number or Kannadigas are more in number or Bengalis or Swahilis or Santalis are more in number(in Belagavi), Belagavi will be part of Karnataka. As long as these Marathis are living in Belagavi, they are living in Karnataka." Whats wrong with that? It is just a statement of fact.</dd>

<dd>@ above Whats Belgavi????Belgav will be a part of Maharashtra for sure.U guys are free to cry whatever u want.Belgav is Maharashtrians-dominated and it has to be merged with Maharashtra.Forget about swahili or zulu,think abt Kodavis and Tulus who live in K'nataka.U have grabbed their land also!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>---Hello Dinesh and whoever supporting dinesh's statement. Do some research on the history of Belgav. Belgav was part of then Bombay presidency after independence. Before independence it was a part of the Sangli Sansthan. Belgav was included in Karnataka only because of administrative convenience. And you will see soon it will be a part of Maharashtra again. Marathi people are living where they are from generations. Better kanadis also stay where they are, that is in Mysore. Don't come to Belgav Jobs and shelter. I know Karnataka govt and these kanadi people from mysore will not leave Belgav so easily because they don't have many good cities like Belgav. But these Kanadi people should know that Karnataka is not a country. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/2/8/User%7E128.113.18.207.html" title="User:128.113.18.207">128.113.18.207</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/8/User_talk%7E128.113.18.207.html" title="User talk:128.113.18.207">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.113.18.207_1698.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.113.18.207">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Sorry for using tough words like "stay where you are". you just irked me by saying "Kannadi" and did not apologise. Kannada is one of the great languages of the world and will soon be recognized as a classical language. It has a proven written (archeologically) existance of about 1900 years and a spoken history of 2500 years and I am not talking about proto-Kannada. At the end of the day, we all need to realise that Maharashtra cannot have the apple and eat it too. If it wants a part of Belgaum, it has to give up a part of Sholapur. This is the premise of the Mahajan commission. No amount of Jingoism or Chauvanism can change geographic boundaries unless there is give and take or the Marathis of Belgaum have to hold there peace and move on with life. Sorry again about the remark i made. It simply goes against Kannada culture to exclude people from our midst. Dinesh</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dinesh, you dont have to apologize for anything. And just to correct you, even according to the Mahajan report, there is no question of giving up Belgavi. Even the Mahajan report contended that Belagavi would remain with K'taka. Also this 'fact' about Marathis outnumbering Kannadigas is actually a myth. Marathis may well in fact, outnumber Kannadigas a bit in Belagavi city, but Kannadigas are still the majority in Belagavi district. Here the issue like you said, is purely of Maharashtra wanting to have the cake and eat it too. They want both the industrialised and agriculturally rich parts bordering Ktaka and MH irrespective of whether the Mahajan committee report agrees with them or not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>---I did not know you are so ignorant. Your statement 'Kannada people outnumber Marathi in Belgaum district' is laughable. It seems you are so much afraid that Karnataka might lose the entire Belgav district and thus consoling yourself. For your information, nobody has claimed the entire Belgav district; nobody denies that Kanadis are more in "Belgaum district". Maharashtra has claimed about 600 villages and Belgav city, and not the entire district. And if you are talking about Solapur; better you visit and check the situation by yourself. Although, some percentage of people speak Kannadda, they have no desire of going in Karnataka. You will not hear a single voice demanding Solapur to be included in Karnataka. You should know that states in India have been formed based on languages, so it is the right of people living in Belgav that their state language should be Marathi. The only way of stopping Belgav becoming a part of Maharashtra is changing the state language of Karnatak from Kanadi to Marathi. The question remains if Karnatak govt and the Kanadi people from Mysore will accept it. BTW, I did not get why one should apologize for saying kanaddi?

<p>I have read all the info on this page and fell sorry for the Marathi people of Belgaum. In the 1950's, the movement to make Belgaum a part of Maharashtra was an emotional one with adequate support from the Maharashtra govenrment. However after the stunning defeat at the hands of Mahajan commission, the Maharashtra government is essentially doing to the Marathis what Pakisthan is doing to Kashmiris in that they are being used for their own election / selfish purposes with really no hope of reverting the decision of the Mahajan commission.</p>
<p>I believe the Maharashtra government knows all too well that there has to be give and take on Belgaum. Karnataka is going to stick to the Mahajan commission no matter what, just as India swears by the Shimla agreement. Its the poor Marathis who dont realise they are being used. Thats the reason you see this movement rise up in rhetoric every time Shiv Sena sees a humiliating defeat in Maharashtra.</p>
<p>In an internatioannly and globally rising and aligning India, there is little place for Sub-regionalism. Today there is not one independent candidate in Belgaum. The whole reason for this is the failure of the MEC and their high handed tactics.</p>
<p>Also, if the Kannada people of Sholapur are not fighting to Join Karnataka, its because Kannada people are basically decent non-militant people who have shown India and world our calibre by starting and starring in India's IT revolution. The world no longer talks of Mumbai as the gateway to India, but it talks of Bangalore (Bangaluru) as its international gateway. Karnataka is too important for India and the Indian govt. is aware of this. India cannot and will not allow shallow, narrow minded sub-regional fascists to ignite a problem that could spread through out India and damage India's image as a progressive nation. Nor do I believe Karnataka is weak enough to suffer a defeat like the "Battle of Panipat".</p>
<p>Buy the way, If i apologised earlier, it was not a sign of Kannadiga weakness, but a deep sense of regret for talking about closing doors to outsiders, when this is really not Kannada culture. Dont let this fool you about Kannadiga reslove.</p>
<p>Lets not forget that through out history, when other empires fell, it was the Kannada empires that stood the test of time to protect Indian Nationalism. The Hoysalas were the last to fall (1343 CE.)to the Khilji invasion while the Yadavas of Devagiri who actually had many cowardly agreements with the invaders were the first to fall (1315 CE.). From the ashes of the Hoysala empire rose the last great Hindu empire, the Vijayanagar empire (note that no historian calls the Maratha empire the last great Hindu empire) to keep invaders out for 250 years when our neighbours to the north were already ruled by the invaders during this period. The Kingdom of Mysore were the last to fall to the British in 1799 CE. under Tippu with the Maratha Peshwas and Nizam of Hyderabad working as agents of the British and actually assisting the British in the Third Mysore War. In return for their service provided, these English agents were given bits and pieces of northern Karnataka which later on became a part of Bombay presidency and Hyderabad presidency. we eventually go back what was ours in 1956. During the British rule, more than anyone else, it was the Kannada people who suffered, being split up into four regions, Bombay presidency, Madras Presidency, Hyderabad and Mysore Kingdom. Yet, by 1875, we had replaced Marathi and Urdu as the medium of education in northern Karnataka with our own language. We did this in a very cultured and educated way. Today we have 7 Jnanpith awards (the highest in India for any language), have won the Ranji trophy 6 times (having entered the cricket arena rather late in 1960's), started India's IT revolution. All this goes to show our resolve.</p>
<p>Those who misconstrue our generosity for weakness, those who miscalculate our humility for fear are sure to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Dear Dinesh kanammbbadi, YAWN!!!! I very well know how 'uncivilised goons u ppl r.And belive me ALMOST ALL points that u have metioned will sound PALE when compared to Maharashtra.Maharashtra is the greatest state and their ppl and language are greatest if compared with Karnataka or Kannada. Perhaps when Maharashtrians will awake and show u where u stand,u will understand what Maharashtrians are!! So smell coffee (and dosa!)</p>
<p><br />
Hi Dinesh, It is clear that you know nothing about Belgaum and you are trying to divert the topic by explaining how Karnataka and Kannad history is great---which is not a topic here. Your glorification about Karnataka only explains lack of knowledge. It is really difficult to understand what are you trying to do by glorifying Karnataka.</p>
<p>Your claims of Karnataka being close to Maharashtra and Bengalore getting closer to Mumbai are myths. I will just give you few facts and decide yourself. you will find a lot but read this <a href="http://www.midcindia.org/mah_overview/survey.php#0" class="external free" title="http://www.midcindia.org/mah_overview/survey.php#0" rel="nofollow">http://www.midcindia.org/mah_overview/survey.php#0</a></p>
<p>Another unlogical explanation is comparing belgaum with Kashmir. I really don't understand why is it so difficult for you to understand this simple fact. Do you know that people in Hukkeri and Athani do not wanted to be in Belgaum district. Can you compare this with Kashmir also? You should know that state government can change internal borders without much difficulty. Similarly Indian government can form new states or change the border of any state without much problem. No one in the world can change country's border. There is no supreme authority than country's governement. So better stop such illogical arguments. And you should know that central govt has formed many new states recently (for example, Chatishagadh, jharkhand etc). In fact, the Indian states have been formed linguistically. THUS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE MARATHI PEOPLE TO GET THE GOVT OF THEIR LANGUAGE. We live in an Independent India. Karnataka govt is acting like a British govt. For example, no job for marathi people, forcing to learn Kanadi, and harassing in many other ways. You should know that it is not Maharashtra govt but the people of belgaum wanted to be in Maharashtra. Go and check the political situation. Even after 50 years of harassment from Karnataka govt people still elect Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti's (MES) candidate. Right now there are two MLA and many ZPs and many Taluka Panchayat's are controlled by MES.</p>
<p>Now, about history... do some unbiased study and you will realize how much importance Maratha empire has in Indian history. Interestingly there is a marathi script at the bottom of Gometeshwar Statue at Shravabbelgol. This is more than 1000 years old and in so much south in Karnataka. Isn't that amazing. Marathi had so much impact on Karnataka in the past.</p>
<p>About Karnatak winning Ranaji 6 times... Again do some research and verify the records of Mumbai. you should know that more than 50 poets and writters have received Gyanpith award in India, why should there be so much fuss about that. Interesting 5 of your Gyanpith awardee donot speak kanad at home. For example, mother tongue of Girish Karnad and Dr. Shivram Karanth is Konkani; DR Bendre is MARATHI; Masti Venkateswara Iyengar is Tamil</p>
<p><br />
My suggestion is don't get emotional and write illogical. I can give answers to your each and every point but I think this is enough for now.</p>

<p>The logic behind it is same.Maharashtrians are in moajority in Belgaon.All villages/areas in disputed region have to be transferred to respective states on the basis of population.If Solapur district has regions where Kannadi are more than their's no problem to give those to Karnataka. Stop crying out Mahajan report.It is completely biased and unjustifies.Only that u gave him more bribe that doesnt mean Belgaon belongs to u.It will go to Maharashtra for sure.We have tolerated enough and we are not gonna give damn abt what Dineshs are saying.

<p>I am being reading ur talk page and seems u have not only abused Marathi and Maharashtrians but also Tamilians and the guy who said Rajkumar was not Kannadi!Thus it signifies how well-behaved and justified u(Kannadis) r as u mentioned to us in one of our discussions! Anyways what I want to tell u is dont cry foul abt Kannada being the classical and older language than Marathi.It may be(I dont care in fact!);but that does not make Marathi less important or less lovable!No matter how much u puke,u cant really question Marathi's greatness.U might not know but Marathi is 4th most spoken language in India (after Hindi,Bangla,Telugu) and 16th in world(native speakers),ahead of Tamil and Kannada!Its very laughable statement of urs that Marathi was evolved from kannada!!!Sanskrit is the only language with Marathi owes from as it is INDO-ARYAN language and not a Dravidian language.Stop swearing abt our language like u did in Marathi and Belgaon page.Konkani is essentialy a dialect of Marathi and even if all Konkanis and u dont agreee to it,the truth and history wont change!</p>
<p>U compared Belgaon to Kashmir.It surely resembles that issue.But I totally believe in motto-Satyameva Jayate.It is destined for India to have Kashmir and its destined that Belgaon along with other Marathi speaking villages of K'taka will finally belong to Maharashtra.In fact u shud worry abt rest of North kanara where Konkanis and Kodavis might want to seperate their land from Karnataka!congrats as Bangalore is advancing over Mumbai!I really hope that Bangalore surpasses Mumbai as then only u will know how decent and thoughful were Maharashtrians to accomodate outsiders so long.And abt Jnanapeeths,look Marathi can win it but we dont bother to lobby for that.We know we are great and we dont look for 'recognisation' from others.we dont even 'market' abt how we and our language is great!We just dont need certificates from others!!!</p>

<p>Hi Sarvagnya, A judgement by one person, that is, Mahajan cannot be the end of world for 30 lakh Marathi people in the area. Even Indira Gandhi did not agree totaly with Mahajan report and suggested to split the Belgaum city into Maharashtra and Karnataka. It your comments that are laughable. --Sandipani 15:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Belgaum is a part of MH? No.But logically it should be.And so should be Kannada speaking villages in Maharashtra,if they really exist.</p>
<p>The Mahajan commission ACCEPTED MH's demand for Belgaum city? A person cannot decide fate for some lakhs of Marathis who are detained in k'taka unnecessarily.Stop cryuing abt it,would u handle Dharwad if that Mahajan had asked to?</p>
<p>Maharashtra did NOT go back on its word to honour the Mahajan commission's report? It had to!How could a Marathi speaking majority town handed over to K'taka.On which grounds??</p>
<p>Belgaum is NOT a legal and constitutional part of Karnataka? It is.But residents of Belgaum wants to join Maharashtra.And u really cant hide the truth.No Kannada MLA has been ever elected from those disputed region.</p>
<p>That the Belgaum Corporation was superseded by the Govt of Karnataka illegaly? Perhaps.But they did it in a peaceful and constitutional way.Not like Vedike jerks who manhandled mayor near Vidhan soudha.Its not only shameful for them but also for Karnataka.</p>
<p>Karnataka govt butchered Marathis in Belgaum? Yes.Seriously.On which ground they want Belgaum in Karnataka?Mind u im talking about Belgaum city and not Belgaum district.Have u ever thought why u r so offensive and bad to neighbours?Killing ppl on Kaveri issue is one more instance of that.Why r u attacking?One must not forget that Maha's silence and humility doesnt mean that we cant react that harshly.</p>
<p>That Mahajan commission did not recommend exchange of villages between Kar and MH? Again.Move forward of that notoriois report,It was a jackpot for u,but that does not mean u can take disadvantage of that.Give me EXPLAINATION abt how K'taka can have Belgaum when Marathis have clear majority there?Wht abt Nippani,Bidar?My heart cries and blood boils with this injustice.</p>
<p>Karnataka govt bribed Justice Meherchand Mahajan? Most likely.HOW CAN MARATHI DOMINATED BELGAUM BE A PART OF K'TAKA??Would u have given Hubli/Dharwad to Maharashtra?If Mahajan had said Bangalore to be a part of TN as their population is significant,would u ppl had parted with it?</p>

<li>Karnatka bribed Mahajan</li>
<li>Ktaka butchered Marathis</li>
<li>Marathis outnumber Kannadigas in Belgaum - According to which census report, may I know? or did you carry out your own personal census?</li>
<li>"Maha's silence and humility"! huh. - While Ktaka has always wished for either maintaining status quo or the implementation of the report, it is MH that has kept the issue boiling.</li>

<p>While the English and Kannada transliterations can be explained, can anyone explain to me how a Marathi transliteration can find its place in this article?

<dd>"Belgaon" the Marathi name is used by both Marathi and Kannada people of Belgaum. Word "gaon" means village in Marathi. Similar names are found in the sarounding of Belgaum (e.g. Vadgaon, Uchagaon, khangaon, etc). Not even 1% of Kannadda people call it "Belgavi". May be people from Mysore call it "Belgavi" or whatever. Many people in Belgaum won't understand what is "Belgavi". Belgaum is in India; and Karnataka is not a sovereign country. Even Urdu is used as an official language in a few district in Uttar Pradesh. Marathi is the main language spoken in around Belgaum city. "Belgaon", as is&#160;::::pronounced in Marathi is the name used by local people irrespective of their mother-tongue. Marathi is one of the recognized language in India. Belgaum has more close ties to Maharashtra than Karnataka in all respect inculding trade and business. Belgaum Municipal corporation use both Marathi and Kannada as the official languages. Belgaum taluka panchayat use Marathi as the main language except while dealing with Karnataka govt. Election commision use both Marathi and Kannada in all elections. You should be aware that Wikipedia is nobody's property; others can remove your edits too. In fact, I don't see why "Belgavi" should be there. Translation in both Marathi and Kannada is the best possible thing that can be achieved. Hope you will understand it and act responsibly.--Sandipani 18:57, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I only need an explanation for having belgaon and its marathi transliteration <b>on English Wikipedia</b>. I dont want your stories and <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_original_research.html" title="No original research">original research</a>. India has more than two dozen states and each state shares its borders with close to half a dozen other states. That doesnt mean half a dozen transliterations in that many languages ought to find their place in articles dealing with border districts and border cities.</li>
<li>And as for "Belagavi" it is the official name the Government of Karnataka uses in all its correspondences. That is what is painted on all government buildings too. The entire Kannada news media including Government owned Doordarshan uses "Belagavi"(you'd to well to watch AND listen to the weather report in any Kannada news channel) <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 19:12, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Exactly this is an <b>English Encyclopedia</b> not a Kannada newspaper. Additionally the script Wikipedia is ROMAN not Kannadda. You can write whatever you want in Kannad verson of the wikipedia. The translations or pronouncations are given which are used by the majority of the local people. You said, "I don't want your stories ....." You should remember that I am not answering you. You are not the boss, who controls wikipedia, so better mind your language. The marathi translation has nothing to do with the Maharashtra sharing its border with Karnataka. "Belgaon", this is how it has been pronounced for generations and will be pronounced forever in the future. In fact, I don't see any point in calling it "Belgavi", just because some Kannada newspaper call it so.--Sandipani 19:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Belgaum,the English name ,is derived from Marathi 'Belgaon'.I hope u wont ask for a source here unless of course u pronounce Belgaum as Belgium or 'Belgom'.The pronounciation of word Belgaum is beLgav just like Vadgaon,Narayangaon etc.. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:35, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would recommend Belgaon to be written in both languages.Seriously,I never knew what is Belgavi!!!Perhaps u have modified Marathi version of Belgaon to Kannad Belgavi. It is true that Belgaon is presently in K'taka,but since its a disputed issue and having clear Marathi makority,addition of Belgaon in Marathi should be allowed. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The link proves nothing except the fanatcism, confrontationist approach of the Marathis and the scant regard MES has for the law.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just because MES does something does not mean that it is within the law. MES has only been known for its rowdy tactics and for sensationalising the issue for its own political ends at the expense of the citizens of Belagavi(not Belgavi).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>MES' use of Marathi on nameboards etc., much like its flying the 'Bhagawaddhwaja' atop the corporation, was in blatant contravention of the law(the KMC Act, the Flag Act etc.,).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>They were simply one of the many such indiscretions that the GoK was overlooking in its bid to not precipitate the situation or veer its focus away from more important things. In other words, you dont dignify barking dogs by paying attention to them. And not surprisingly, the trilingual boards were thrown out along with the MES.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Forget this link, look at BCC's own website. Do you see Marathi anywhere? If Marathi was an official language, how come only Kannada and English forms are available?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just because there is a sizeable Marathi population in Belagavi is no reason to have Marathi transliterations here. Border areas in most states have multi lingual mixes. Sholapur and other parts of MH have sizeable Kannada population. Bombay has an overwhelming Gujarati population. Madras, especially at the time of independence and even now has a very sizeable Telugu population. Parts of TamilNadu bordering Kerala have sizeable Malayali populations. Kasargod has majority Kannadigas. Tamil Nadu districts bordering Karnataka near Chamarajanagar are overwhelmingly Kannada. Delhi has sizeable Punjabi population. Haryana-Punjab border is a bilingual mix... we could go on and on an on about this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When the states were reorganized, several states got their borders redrawn. Yet, it is only Maharashtra and MES rowdies who are throwing such a fit about this. As if, merging Belagavi with MH will solve its problems. Try holding on to Vidharbha first and do something for the farmers there who are committing suicide in the hundreds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Belagavi all said and done is the most developed city in N.Karnataka. Compare that with the plight of MH's border cities. What you have to realise is that in India, except for the major cities, the rest of the country is a heap of shit irrespective of which state it is. 3/4th of our villagers do not even have electrified homes(the official figures put it at 56% of rural households), thanks to rowdies like MES playing petty politics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for all the Sharad Pawars and Thackreys they didnt even whisper a word about Belagavi when they were in power. The moment they lose power, they rake up the issue. Cant you see that they are taking you for a ride? First of all ask your old man in Bombay to keep his family and party together and then let him talk about Belagavi or belgaum or belgaon or balegaon or whatever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And as for yourself, I only have this to say. Forget about Belagavi merging with MH. Its not going to happen. Do you even understand the gravity of the Government's affidavit in the Supreme Court? That one affidavit alone is enough for the case to keep running for the next 50 years, not to mention anything about the Mahajan report or the report of the 4 member committee. And that affidavit is in spite of Shivaraj Patil leaving no stone unturned to help MH.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>MES is just selling you empty dreams to keep itself in power. As for your question of why MES keeps winning, it is simply because Kannadigas arent fanatics and dont gang up and vote for their language and because of that their votes get split. On the other hand, Marathis unmindful of the real issues like development, harmony etc., blindly vote for MES. The sooner you realise this, the better it is for both Marathi and Kannadiga citizens of Belagavi.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, look at these links from the BCC's own website and tell me if you find any Marathi anywhere.</dd>

<dd>Hello Mahawiki. The link that you provided does not indicate that the marathi name is also used. There is no precedent yet for such cases. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Indian_cities_3cb2.html#Lead_in" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Indian cities">The project</a> says that the name should be scripted in the local language. But the dispute here is about the language to use. So I would suggest that if Belgaum name is indeed derived from the marathi root, then add a very short section before history titled "origin of name". See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Indian_cities_3cb2.html#Origin_of_name" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Indian cities">this</a>. Provide citations for whatever you add. Nothing which you beleive to be true or know to be true. I am sure no one would object to that. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 12:00, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>First of all, keep out discussion about HDMC, demographics of Karnataka, demographics of Maharashtra etc.,.</li>
<li>Coming to the Pudhari.com photo, the photo is not clear, in the sense that each and every alphabet is not legible properly. The first line is clearly in Kannada script, the second line is in Devanagari and the third line is in Roman script. Of that, there is no doubt.
<ul>
<li>Now you are claiming that the line in Devanagari is actually in Marathi language because Hindi doesnt have 'ळ' - which again, is for you to prove.</li>
<li>Also, whether the Hindi language has 'ळ' or not is besides the point. The question here is, whether the Devanagari we see here is Marathi or Hindi. There are any number of haLLis and paLLis all over south india in whose railway stations you will see the Hindi version of the name painted in Devanagari script along with the local script and English(Roman script). I distinctly remember seeing the use of 'ळ' in the Hindi script. In any case, it is for you to prove that the Devanagari we see is Marathi and not Hindi. Also, if it is indeed Marathi, it is clearly in violation of the law. Lets come to that later. For now, just prove to me that the Devanagari we see is Marathi and not Hindi. Till then, the Marathi transliteration will be removed. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 05:01, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So the Nagari script u see on the board is Marathi.Morever the link which I cited before(of Vijay More) clearly mentions that all three languages are used in Belgaon Mahanagarpalika.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not entitled to comment on display of Marathi name on Belgaon Mahanagarpalika is violation of law or not.Also Wikipedia is not a place for original research.In fact the debate we are having here is immaterial as Kannada (and Kannadi corporators) are non-existent in Belgaon city and Belgaon Mahanagarpalika otherwise it would have been not possible to pass a resolution(seeking merger with Maharashtra) unanimously.</li>

<li>Plz dont remove Marathi transliteration unless u prove anything against my claims.Thanks.</li>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that the name is indeed in Marathi. I do not think it is Hindi. Anyone who removes it from the article should prove that it is not. This conclusion has also been <a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html#Belgaum" title="User talk:Aksi great">confirmed</a> by <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp">Nichalp</a> who lives in Bombay. And taking this to be Marathi, I think this is enough proof that Marathi is indeed a language local to the region. It may not be the official language, but is still used along with Kannada and English. Please discuss below if you do not agree with my judgement.- <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 11:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anybody who says the board is in Marathi or that hindi does not use 'La', be it mahawiki or aksi or nichalp or whoever, is merely asserting their own opinion. Marathi is indeed one of the langauges spoken in Belgaum, of that there is no doubt and nobody is contesting that. The question is whether having the Marathi transliteration here is warranted. It is NOT. If that were to be the case, we'd have to have Gujarati transliterations in <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, Kannada on Sholapur and Kasargod pages, Kannada on Hosur page, and so on and so forth. There would be no end to it. There are no precedents in this case and infact, talking of Kannada on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Sholapur.html" title="Sholapur">Sholapur</a> page(which I noticed just yesterday), I'd like to draw Aksi's attention to Mahawiki's vandalism and jingoism on that page too. The same Mahawiki who's fighting for having the Marathi transliteration here is continuously reverting/deleting edits on that page. So much so, he's even deleting all instances of even the word 'Kannada' that appear on that page. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 01:33, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And again, as for the assertion that La is not used in hindi, I can only say that it is utter nonsense. I have myself come across the use of 'La' in hindi textbooks. That fact notwithstanding, I am sure everyone here would have come across railway stations in india with the haLLis and paLLis painted in hindi.

<p>"Mumbai,Solapur have MAHARASHTRIANS in MAJORITY.Morever they are not DISPUTED as Belgaon and adjoining areas".<br />
This is again a profound assumption. What is the population of Marathis in Bombay?. Belagavi is not disputed as far as we Kannadaigas are concerned. We stick by Mahajan commission. remember the 245 villages in Sholapur district? as per Mahajan commission. Looks like this guy likes to wiggle around a lot. Can you prove from verifiable sources that Marathi's are in Majority in Belagavi district/Belagavi city and that these Marathi's are <b>NOT</b> recent immigrants after 1956.</p>
<p>There is no struggle or movement going on in Solapur as in Belgaon because there's only handful of Kannadis in those areas.Imposition of Marathi is not done in those regions.Population of Maharashtrians in Mumbai is only slightly less than Kannadis in Bangalore.Yes,I do know Mahajan commission had some mentions about it,but the fact is there is NO unrest in Solapur.<br />
Maharashtrians are in majority in Belgaon city and adjoining regions but not in whole Belgaon district.It is u Kannadis who talk about immigration of Kannadis in Belgaon,few Kannad chauvinists had actually urged K'taka govt to start indutries in Belgaon to 'increase' population of Kannadis there.<br />
Again point here to be considered is Marathi is one of languages used in Belgaon Mahanagarpalika. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is clear by his attitude and posts that Sarvagnya is frustrated!He asked me to edit the articles by citations.I have provided enough citations to prove that Marathi is used in Belgaon Mahanagarpalika.Morever his swearings against Maharashtra and Marathi cannot be ignored.He is adviced to not to edit the article without proper citations.""Belgaon in Marathi will continue to be displayed". Kannadi is the proper word of the speakers of Kannada.Infact if u see the wiki tags on the page of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a>,the Marathi tag clearly depicts that Kannada is known as Kanadi in Western/Central India,which of course is no offense.Kannadi means the residents of Karnataka,just like residents of Gujarat are Gujaratis or residents of Bengal are known as Bengalis. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 11:02, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also,the point to note is,he terms Maharashtrians as Marathis.I dont know why is he so disturbed with the 'term' Kannadi?If he stops saying Maharashtrians as Marathis I shall avoid the word Kannadi and instead use Kannada speakers.i did not mean offense,i urge the admins to ask him to stop swearing Maharashtrians.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 11:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did not find a place to reply above. So I am replying here. I was not aware about disputes in other places and that does not concern the current issue.

I have never seen Hindi using the 'la' written in that form. You keep on talking about the 'la' written on the stations (haLLis and paLLis). I have no clue what you are talking about. Please keep the discussion on this talk page related to the Belgaum article. Discussions on whether "Maharashtra govt. doesnt ill-treat the linguistic minorities there." or "ignorant terrorist trainees in Pakistani camps" are not related to the article.

<dd>I've answered this before more than once. Doesnt seem like you read the discussions on this page properly. Anyway, here I go again. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether the Hindi <i><b>language</b></i> has the alphabet 'La' or not is besides the point. The point is the Hindi <i><b>script</b></i> certainly has the alphabet and it is commonly used when the hindi script is used to represent the 'La' sound occuring in other languages. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>For e.g, let us forget the haLLis and paLLis(which curiously you needed so much time to come back and tell me that you dont understand) - let us take the example of 'belgaon' itself. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Now let us forget that board for a moment. Tell me how would you write 'beLgaon' in <i><b>hindi</b></i>?? certainly as बेळगांव. not बेलगांव. that is essence is my point and there are numerous examples of that, if you see how the names of numerous haLLis and paLLis in south india is written on their railway station boards. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Since you seem to be at a loss for understanding what what haLLis and paLLis are, let me explain. In south india, names of numerous towns and villages ends with the haLLi or paLLi suffix. for e.g., nayanDhaLLi, malavaLLi etc.,. not only that, the ळ sound occurs in the names of countless towns and villages across s.india. and all these towns and villages have railway stations where their names are painted in hindi along with english and the local script. and in all these names 'ळ' is used as in नायंडहळ्ळि, मलवळ्ळि etc. anybody who has travelled in trains in south india would surely have observed this. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>so that being the case it is not proper to conclude that something written in the nagari script is marati simply because the alphabet 'ळ' occurs in it. anybody concluding so, is merely asserting their own belief(that if 'ळ' is present, it cannot be hindi) and is merely POV pushing. nothing else.<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>and as for talking about MH's treatment of minorities, pakistani terrorists etc., please read the comments again. My comments have only been in response to the non stop virulent language and false assertions by mahawiki right from day one. and unfortunately neither you nor sundar have done little to rein him in yet. just look have the irrelevant and nonsense templates he uses to warn me on my talk page to get an idea. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 18:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Since you ask me, I would write Belgaon in Hindi as बेलगांव. And since I do not seem to have travelled enough in South Indian trains, I reamin unconvinced that the stations spell the names using 'ळ'. And thirdly, you seem to be under the false impression that the use of "non stop virulent language and false assertions" by others entitles you to do the same. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 18:39, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sigh!!</p>
<p>I have cited my sources and gave enough evidences to prove that the board at Belgaon Mahanagarpalika,carries Marathi transliteration and Marathi is used as a offical language(in Belgaon Mahanarpalika).Despite of repeated requests,a user is reverting without any reason.I hope he shall co-operate thus ending vandalism here. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 17:49, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am tired of this particular user who unnecessarily bad-mouths me every now and then.If my warnings to him are 'rrelevant and nonsense' arent his warnings the same,for the fact that Kannada speakers are known as Kannadis/Kanadis in Western and Central India?</p>
<p>i am not expert in Wiki's policies and hence Aksi and Sunder had suggested me to 'stop personal attacks','stop editing without citations' etc. which i have religiously followed.All ppl concerned can check my posts/msgs after Sunder and Aksi intervened.I have been extremely polite and resorted from uncivil behaviour but this particular user provokes and talks rubbish about Maharashtra and Marathi.</p>
<p>Those who have still not understood and agreed that the board at Belgaon mahanagarpalika is in Marathi should read this-</p>
<ul>
<li>1)Though Marathi and Hindi use the same (Devnagari)script,there's no 'ळ' in Hindi varnamala.See <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devnagari.html" title="Devnagari">Devnagari</a></li>
<li>2)Mahanagarpalika is a MARATHI WORD.In Hindi,Municipal corporation is known as Nagar Nigam.</li>
<li>3)Hindi users are likely to term Belgaon as बेलगाव rather than बेळगांव.See the pronounciation of it on this article itself.Other examples to consider are (Hindi name-Marathi name)वडाला-वडाळा,खंडाला-खंडाळा लोनावला-लोणावळा वर्ली-वरळी तलेगाव-तळेगांव .So if at all that board was in Hindi it would have been like नगर निगम,बेलगाव.</li>
<li>4)The link <a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html" class="external free" title="http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html</a> clearly mentions that Marathi is also used alongwith other languages.</li>
<li>5)The board is at Belgaon Mahanagarpalika and not any railway station.Stop nagging about haLLis and paLLis.If at all 'ळ' is used in Hindi there,its against rules of Hindi.Ask respective authoritivies to use 'ल' instead,but for god's sake spare us!</li>

<dd>I think you are mistaken in point 5. If indeed ळ is used everywhere, then it changes things because then we have to consider the fact that Sarvagnya is right about it. And then we must move on to the other parts of the sentence. I have not ruled out that option yet. But the way things are going on just now, it is immaterial if it is Hindi or Marathi because even if it is Marathi, there is not consensus that it should be included in the article. So please try working towards consensus on that front. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 18:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Aksi,</dd>
<dd>The wikipedia's page about Devnagari clearly says there's no 'ळ' in Hindi script.I have been repeatedly saying that Mahanagarpalika is an Marathi word.I am amazed at how things work here by the behaviour of some editors,it is just so obvious!WHY arent u ignoring the article-link which clearly says that Marathi alongwith English and Kannada is used in Belgaon Mahanagarpalika!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Using of Marathi transliteration here is justified as Belgaon Mahanagarpalika's acceptance as Marathi clearly proves that Marathi is used in city and city's municipal corporation as 'official language'.TIf at all Marathi transliteration is not included,there's no need for Kannada transliteration too.</dd>

<li>For starters, stop citing other wikipedia pages. I believe wikipedia has a rule that you cant use other wikipedia pages for citations/proof. It is absurd. if the devanagari page on wiki is wrong, then you are carrying over that mistake to another page.</li>
<li>As for proof that the alphabet ळ is very much part of hindi <i><b>script</b></i>, see <a href="http://archive.eci.gov.in/HindiMay2006/pollupd/ac/states/s11/Acnstcand134.htm" class="external text" title="http://archive.eci.gov.in/HindiMay2006/pollupd/ac/states/s11/Acnstcand134.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>. That is the hindi page of the Election Commission of India. On that page, do a control+f for the string 'पळ्ळि' or even just 'ळ'. You will be surprised.</li>
<li>As for khandala-khandaLa etc., go ask those who write खंडाला to correct themselves and write it as खंडाळा. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 19:16, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also your assertion that Nagarpalika is a Marati word is blatantly false. I have even given links earlier on this talk page where you can see the use of the word in various states where the language spoken is not Marati. Once again, Nagarpalika is a very common word in India in almost all languages and saying that it is used exclusively in Marati is blatantly false. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 19:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Devnagari script is used for Hindi or Marathi.So the Nagari script displayed on Belgaon Mahanagarpalika board is indeed,Hindi or Marathi.In Hindi Municipal corporation is termed as NAGAR NIGAM. See this: www.bhopalmunicipal.com</li>
<li>'Nagarpalika' may be used frequently but to enlighten the ignorants like u,there's difference between 'nagarpalika' and 'mahanagarpalika' just as 'municpal council' and 'municipal corporation'.</li>
<li>Marathi use the word 'Mahanagarpalika' and its different than Kanndi 'mahanagarpalike'.U need help.</li>
<li>THIS IS THE LAST TIME IM TELLING U,THE LANGUAGE DISPLAYED ON THE BOARD IS HINDI OR MARATHI.HINDI DOESNT USE THE WORD MAHANAGARPALIKA,BUT IT USES THE WORD NAGAR NIGAM.STOP MAKING FOOL OF URSELF.</li>
<li>Hindi speakers will not call बेळगांव but बेलगांव</li>
<li>If u r so worried,urge ECI,that Hindi has no ळ in its script. Ask them to see www.haryana-online.com/devnagri.htm and <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devnagari.html" title="Devnagari">Devnagari</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Morever the link u gave,shows usage of 'ळ' (a exception)for South Indian names.बेळगांव is a Marathi name.Kannada people reportedly call it as some belgavi or something.Its Belgaon बेळगांव written over that board,and not that odd Kannada name.Its Marathi!</p>

<li>Stop embarrassing yourself. Even on that photo, the word 'BeLagavi' is written in big bold letters on the very first line. Only if you could read Kannada. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 20:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nagarpalika is NOT a Marathi word. I've said this before and you keep raising this again and again. It seems to me that you have a problem understanding English. Let me copy and paste what I've already written on this page.</p>

<p>Nagarpalika may be used extensively but Mahanagarpalika is an MARATHI word.Clearly,the language in nagari is either Marathi or Hindi.So dont even look for other languages.MAHANAGARPALIKA IS A MARATHI WORD! <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 02:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Google for "Bangalore Mahanagarpalika", "Vadodara Mahanagarpalika", "Rajkot Mahanagarpalika", "Jamnagar Mahanagarpalika" and many more. None of these 'Mahanagarpalikas' are in MH and none of these have anything to do with Marathi. Infact, googling just told me that even Nepalis use the term Mahanagarpalika for their municipal bodies.

<li>I think it is high time that you stopped using your convoluted logic and canvassing for sympathy. Keep the discussion on this talk page limited to the article and take you alarmist propoganda elsewhere.</li>
<li>As for Mahanagarpalika, La and the origin of the name belgaum, it is clear as day to everyone here that you either have not provided any citation at all or the citations you have provided prove nothing. My links on the other hand prove that, 'La' is very much used in written hindi to represent the occurence of the sound in other languages. I've also proved with my examples of the Bangalore Mahanagarapalike, Rajkot Mahanagarpalike, Jamnagar, Vadodara and other examples that your fabricated theory asserting "Mahanagarpalike is a Marathi word" does not hold water. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 04:48, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is not only appropriate but absolutely right to list marathi names for things within Belgaum article. There should be question if we need to include Kannada names in Belgaum articles. Karnataka is not a country, and Marathi is one of official language of India. Majority of people Belgaum are Marathi. Thus Marathi is the obvious choice.</li>

<p>If someone really wants I can prove that I am from Belgaum. I have lived in belgaum for more than 25 years. I studied in Marathi medium as most of my friends do. Belgaum has a mejority Marathi people, but is unfortunatetly included in Karnataka. It is not Maharashtra govt but people of Belgaum are fighting to go into Maharashtra. Almost everyone in Belgaum speaks Marathi. But since, it is Karnataka, the govt tries to impose Kannadda Languages. Fortunately, our Indian consitution gives some rights to the local civic bodies such as Municipal corporation, Taluka panchayat, gram panchayat. Taluka and gram panchayat use only Marathi as official language with people, but city corporation use Marathi, English and Kannadda. I believe Wikipedia is not owned by Karnataka Govt, and hence is right to use Marathi. --Sandipani 03:20, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: KNM's comment, in this case, where there is a significant border dispute, and when the borders themselves were drawn on linguistic lines, do you think it is inappropriate or POV for the article to reflect this dispute by displaying the linguistic terms of both cultural groups involved in the dispute? While those other articles you mentioned don't make reference to any un-official languages, they also don't indicate that any disputes driven by language are affecting their borders. In this context, I personally find the reflection of multiple linguistic groups within the article as entirely appropriate and NPOV, and I look forward to discussing these matters civilly and in good faith.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 22:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>First off, <b>all</b> state borders in India have been drawn on linguistic lines. The K'taka-MH border near belgaum is no exception.

<dd>I am surprised to see that Sarvagnya is making up the stories to prove his point of view. He should be aware that Mahajan Commision did not recommend transfering of Solapur to Maharashtra. The commision recommended transfer of few villages from each state. The controversy was never about Solapur, but about Belgaum. The Beglgaum was not recommended to transfer on administrative ground. It has nothing to do with Solupur. --Sandipani 03:32, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>While nobody is contesting the fact that Marathis are a prominent linguistic group in Belgaum city and 'mention' certainly can be made of that(and has been made), Kannada is still the <b>only</b> official language of the state. And Belgaum, notwithstanding Maharashtra's plea in the courts, has always been and continues to be a legal and constitutional part of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. Also there are no precedents in this case. Like KNM said all state border all over india is a multilingual mix. If we were to set a precedent here, there would be no end to it. Talking of similar examples and precedents, let me draw your attention to <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Paso%2C_Texas_243a.html" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso, Texas</a> or <i>any such</i> city/state in the southern part of U.S where Hispanics are the dominant linguistic group. In none of those articles would you see Spanish transliterations. And the percentage of Hispanics in El Paso is far far greater than the percentage of Marathis in Belgaum. And Belgaum city is only <i>one of the</i> many <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taluks.html" title="Taluks">taluks</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_district.html" title="Belgaum district">Belgaum district</a>. The percentage of Marathis in the Belgaum district is not even close to being called dominant. Compare that with hispanics all across southern united states, and yet in none of the articles about southern united states would you find Spanish transliterations for anything inspite of the fact that Spanish is officially the second language of the United States. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 23:08, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ok, this is where I think progress can be made on this issue. I myself am of Mexican ancestry, and am aware of the border issues affecting the US and Mexico which such things as the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_only.html" title="English only">English only</a> movement in the US make manifest. To me, the border issues in India seem a lot more complex, because of how the languages predominant in particular regions were explicitly used in constructing the borders. There is not a similar sort of precedent in the US; the use of language in various border towns between the US and Mexico is more a consequence of 2 entirely different waves of colonization meeting each other than with any centeralized attempt at constructing state boundaries between different cultural groups. To me, if multi-lingual regions can be said to "benefit from their diversity," then the issue of displaying muli-lingual references should not be a problem, and would not be a bad precedent to set in terms of constructing this encyclopedia. "El Paso" itself is a Spanish name, and the article on <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> does use respective linguistic terms to discuss the state's multi-lingual heritage.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 00:32, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>While I agree that the underlying principles of constructing borders in the U.S and India are different, the situation is still quite similar as far as articles on wikipedia are concerned. You must remember that, all said and done, Spanish has greater sanction in the United States' constitution(In that it is officially the second language) than Marathi or any language for that matter, does in <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. In India all states have their own official languages and <b>only one</b> official language at that. For Karnataka of which Belgaum is undeniably a part of, it is Kannada and only Kannada.</li>
<li>If we were to start including transliterations of every language that is spoken by large numbers in a city, we will only end up cluttering the articles with many different transliterations. For example even on this very article, we would need to add <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu.html" title="Telugu">Telugu</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konkani.html" title="Konkani">Konkani</a> too. The fate of articles about major Indian cities would be even worse. For example, <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, which incidentally is like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_city_82f4.html" title="New York city">New York city</a> in many ways, would end up with a dozen transliterations in a dozen different languages plastered all over the article.</li>
<li>The fair thing to do would be to, stick to the official language of the state as far as the transliterations are concerned and at the same time, make a mention of all the different linguistic groups that form a significant part of the cities' populations and their contributions to the city's history, culture etc.,. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 01:34, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Drawing borders to separate states on linguistic basis is not limited to this article or to Belgaum alone.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the border dispute, the required information has already been mentioned in the article, and is only because Maharashtra's petition is with Supreme court.</dd>
<dd>Historically, Belgaum was ruled by Kannada speaking kings. Also, after the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_of_India_1425.html" title="Independence of India">independence of India</a> the following reports indicate clearly Belgaum has to be part of Karnataka and it has been part of Karnataka always.

<dd>Ok, thank you for engaging in this discussion with me. What I don't understand completely is the basis on which Maharashtra is making this petition. Sarvagnia informed me, and Mahawiki would seem to concur, that "Marathis are a prominent linguistic group in Belgaum city." In context of this petition by the Maharashtra state I can see how displaying the Marathis word for Belgaum can be interperted as showing political support for Maharashtra's claim to the city. As someone not involved in these politics, the issue to me as an editor would be how to show the basis for which these politics do exist without showing favoritism or dissenfranchizing the article from the rich diversity that exists within the city's population. As the state was constructed along linguistic lines it would naturally follow that Kannada would be the "official language" of the state, but if the linguistic names for Belgaum from all three of its major populations were included would that not at all help mitigate the political charge and possibly help end the revert warring?--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 02:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Amerique, thanks for trying to mediate on the topic. I have been reading Sarvagnya comments, and I am amazed how he has been trying to divert the topic by introducing many irrelevant topics. This might be very confusing for a person like who has not much idea background about the political system in India. I am from Belgaum , I have lived there for more than 25 years. I can't speak Kannada because I never felt necessary. I can send you certificates if you really wanted to verify if I am from Belgaum or not. I can easily say that Sarvagnya has never visited Belgaum; probably not any place close to Belgaum. I request you to verify whatever claims he has been making. I have responded to almost all claims made by Sarvagnya at the respective places.</p>
<p>BTW, I can't agree with your one comment <b>displaying the Marathis word for Belgaum can be interperted as showing political support for Maharashtra's claim to the city.</b> There is not a slightest possibility that the content on wikipedia would be used by supreme court to support Maharashtra claim. If that was the case Belgaum would have already been in Maharashtra. Because you can find hundreds of things in Belgaum which support Maharashtra's claim. --Sandipani 15:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, Maharashtra's contention when it first raked up the issue(in the 50s and 60s) was that Marathis were the linguistic majority in Belgaum and hence Belgaum and some adjoining areas should merge with MH. But the States Reorganisation committee in 1956, the four member committee in 1957 and the (Meherchand)Mahajan Committee in 1966(headed by a retired Supreme Court Chief Justice) all disagreed with Maharashtra and hence Belgaum has always remained a part of Karnataka. The committee also recommended transferring Sholapur(from Maharashtra) and Kasargod(from Kerala state) to Karnataka. But the committee's recommendations never got implemented due to politics and Karnataka reconciled to maintaining status quo. For decades after that, this issue was treated as a closed chapter by everyone concerned though MH kept raking it up from time to time.</li>
<li>40 years later, Maharashtra filed a petition in the Supreme Court saying Belgaum city should be merged with Maharashtra. However, this time round, their contention is that the 'Marathi population in Belgaum city is feeling insecure' and hence Belgaum city should be merged with Maharashtra. This was a case that was filed very recently(only months ago) and the case is still in its preliminary stages. In all fairness, Maharashtra's contention should find a mention in the article and it has. But to carry it beyond that, and add transliterations in the <b>Marathi script</b> would certainly not be appropriate and like you said, might send the wrong signals especially in this case where Maharashtra's petition is sub judice not to mention that it might set a bad precedent and engender numerous other edit wars on article pages of other cities(like you've already seen on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Sholapur.html" title="Sholapur">Sholapur</a>). <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 02:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for this information, there was an editing conflict with Mahawiki as I tried to reply. Under the circumstances, how would you feel about removing the Kannada script from the Belgaum article until this case runs its course? I'm not trying to go out on a limb here, but as Kannada is the official language of Karnataka, is it necessary to have to mention it in this article? I am not trying to say that including the script shows bias in displaying factual information as to the language of the state, but the information might not immediately pertain to the article, and under the circumstances of Maharashtra's petition it seems to me that the editing issue may become an "all or nothing" proposition as far as the linguistic scripts go. Anyway, I have to go offline, but thanks for responding to me about this issue.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 04:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>User Sarvagnya is repeatedly stating false statements. The four memeber comitte did not reach any decision. The Mahajan comission did not recommend the transfer of Belgaum to Maharashtra Govt. on "Administrative ground" <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=20051216008012500.htm&amp;date=fl2225/&amp;prd=fline&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=20051216008012500.htm&amp;date=fl2225/&amp;prd=fline&amp;" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. The comission only recommended transfering some villages, and not Solapur city, from each state. There was never a dispute with solapur city. Sarvagnya should provide a few links mentioning struggle of the local people to move into Karnatak before making any statement. "Belgaum was always a part of the Karnataka" is another ignorant statement. Belgaum was in Bombay state (now Maharashtra and Karnataka) before 1956. It was a part of Sangli Sansthan (a marathi King) during british rule. The issue was started only because Belgaum was unfairly transfered into Karnataka. --Sandipani 04:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Unlike our friend Sarvagnya claims the issue was never closed. I should stress a point here that it is the people of Beglaum are fighting against Karnataka govt. Maharashtra govt guides and help them from time to time. Maharashtra Ekikaran Samita (MES), a popular party in Belgaum region has been contesting the elections on only one issue for last 50 years. And they have been winning elections for state assembly and also in all local civic bodies. Govt of India tried to solve the problem by involving chief ministers of both states. But Karnataka govt always refused to have discussion because of the fear of losing belgaum to Maharashtra. After exhausting all other democratic options, Maharashtra Govt in association with MES decided to seek the justice from the Supreme court. Writing in Marathi is even more important than writing in Kanadi. The belgaum issue has nothing to do with Solapur, which was NEVER disputed. Belgaum is a city with a unique dispute in India. Mumbai is a cosmopolitan city, but has highest proportion of Marathi people (45%) and hence cannot be correlated with Belgaum. I request the moderators to search for other cities in India. You won't find a single city with this kind of disparity in an independent India. --Sandipani 05:08, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>They want to say that as some kannada tribes rules Belgaon for some time,it should go to Karnataka.These ppl are nothing but illogical blabbers who just have no competence of being even an editor.I think than Maharashtra should ask for Baroda,Indore or infact Attak(now in Afghanistan) as Marathas have ruled these regions too.Wikipedia is runied because of such fanatics who just want to push their POV.Note that this user has failed to prove that the script on Belgaon mahanagarpalika is hindi.He is too sad and frustrated as we have proved that Marathi is used as official language in Belgaon mahanagarpalika.No matter how they cry,its a truth.if u r not including Marathi transliteration there's no need of Kannada transliteration too! <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:04, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't believe the way in which you trying to divert the main issue by talking about dozens of irrelevant things. Dissolution of civic body does not change the past decisions taken by the body. I don't know, why can't you understand such simple thing. Many times central govt dissolves state government and impose president rule. Based your thesis, the language of that state should be changed to Hindi as it is the national language. Please think for a second before making any argument. --Sandipani 14:49, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If anyone thinks the language depicted is not Marathi,one has to prove it.To remind u again,Mahanagarpalika is a Marathi word and Hindi counterpart is Nagar Nigam.Stop hiding truths!!Even if Belgaon Mahanagarpalika has been dissolved its because of its resolution to join Maharashtra.The Marathi language is used as per Official language act passed by Karnataka govt.Look if u dont want to have meaningful debate plz dont reply.Go thru my ALL citation again.Dont act smart by ignoring citations.Everyone including u know that the language used on the board is Marathi.If u want to prove otherwise,plz give citations.I have proved that MARATHI IS USED AS A OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IN BELGAON.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 15:27, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This statement proves that you agree with all others that the boad in front of City corporation is indeed in Marathi. On the other hand it also reveals the depth of your knowledge. You should know that banks, Railway, Aviation, military (and NOT city corporation) comes under the jurisdiction of Central govt. This is the reason you can see hindi boards on those buildings.

Coming to the point please see the deliberate mentions of Kannada on Solapur article.There is NO controversy like that of Belgaon there.Note how Kannada ppl are busy to show on that article that how Kannada culture is prevalent there.Alsp see Kaveri_dispute.This is one more controversy that Karnataka has with other states.Look there too,the Kannada ppl are busy pressing their POV.See <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil.html" title="Tamil">Tamil</a>.There too this Kannad fanatics are busy proclaiming that Marathi lanugage and Marathi literature is too YOUNG than Kannad's.How Kannada has influenced Marathi,how Konakani is older than Marathi blah blah.</p>

<p>It seems Sarvagnya is talking a bit of sense. Yes, Akkalkot has good percentage of Kannadda people. But do you know that this is a very small town, and Maharashtra govt has no problem in tranfering this town to Karnataka if Karnataka govt tranfers all marathi majority area to Maharashtra. Some what smaller city Nipani and town Khanapur which as more than 80% marathi people have also been recommended to tranfer into Maharashtra. The core issue is Belgaum, so please don't divert the topic. --Sandipani 05:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Do you realise that the 'Marathis are majority' line is a dead and buried issue? It was raised by MH in the 50s and 60s and competent authorities and commissions(one of them headed by no less than a Supreme Court Chief Justice) rejected Maharashtra's claims? Even the Maharashtra government has dropped singing that line now. It can be seen in the fact that they have petitioned the court on flimsy grounds like 'Security of Marathis is at stake'. So stop using your percentages. It is not relevant to the case anymore. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 05:42, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess, you wanted to be the one decide what is dead and what is alive. My percentage of Marathi people was in response to your claim about Akkalkot. I really don't understand what are the basis of your debate. I would like to make four points. Please don't divert the topic and bring in the other cities.</p>
<p>1) Belgaum was ruled in Bombay state before 1956. It was ruled by sangli sansthan (a marathi king) during british rule. The dispute raised only because it was unfairly transfered into Karnataka. (response to your claim that belgaum have always been ruled by Karnataka)</p>
<p>2) Belgaum and sarrounding area have Marathi majority. All local civic bodies are ruled by pro-maharastrian politicians (proved).</p>
<p>3)Marathi is the main language used by local people. Marathi and Kanadi are used as as official languages of Belgaum (Proved).</p>
<p>4)States in India are not as autonomous as in USA, forget about any sovereignty. It is the federal govt who decides the boundaries. Local civic bodies have fairly good autonomy (they can decide their languages correpsondance with the people)(A well known fact).</p>
<p>With all these points, I see writing in Marathi is more important than writing in any other languages. --Sandipani 06:08, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>it is kannada and not kannadi,please refresh ur memory. wikipedia is not the place for using slurs/slangs or short forms,call it whatever u may,u have no right to write kannadi here.</p>
<p>and by calling sarvagnya's claim as ridiculuous,ur claim for a "sanyukta maharsthra" is equally crappy.</p>
<p>belgaum or belgavi whatever it is,is right now under the jurisdiction of karnataka. and its welfare and development will not change by going to maharasthra. Marathi speakers in belgavi havent been harrased. if you really want to include belgavi/belgaon as part of maharsthra and write so in the article wait for the court hearing.</p>
<p><br />
ur civility is less compared to that of sarvagnya.u seem to be ending ur posts with lame comments like jai maharsthra.</p>

<dd>The very first thing, before lecturing others, is that you should sign your comments. Comments without signature have no value on wikipedia. Now coming to your points. I really don't understand why are so getting irritated with the well known word "kanadi". It is not a slang. In northern India names of the all languages Gujarati, bengali, hindi, marathi, jharkandi, manipuri, nepali, kashmiri, panjabi,shindi, bhojpuri, assami, marwadi end with "i". The same rule is applied to the language in Karnataka too. I know many people call it "Kanad" also. This is not derogatory. Nobody is denying that Belgaum is currently in Karnataka. But, will that stop people of Belgaum using Marathi? Will that stop people of belgaum fighting with Karnataka govt? Again, nobody is trying to write Belgaum as a part of Maharashtra. The debate is only about writing belgaum in marathi (along with Kannada), so now you can judge how sarvagnya behaving. It was "Dinesh Kanambadi" who provokated others to write "Jai Maharashtra" by writing "jai Karnatak mate". Read his comments. --Sandipani 06:25, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>well,in south india which i would prefer to call as deccan,there are four languages: tamil,telugu,kannada,malayalam.</p>
<p>try adding a 'i' to it u goof.try doing that to english as well. dont extra polate your rules to the rest of the world.just because a set of shitheads call it by that name doesnt imply that,that is the actual pronounciation.</p>
<p>as i said give me a wiki article with the name 'kannadi' and then i will see how to react to that. for starters,its your prononuciation problem that leads to this wrong pronounciataion.</p>
<p>just because sarvagnya acts eccentric need not imply that even you act fanatical and change everything to marathi.go contact a admin you know and get him to act.</p>
<p>and here are some more languages for your thoughts,dont apply ur bullshit "theories" to these: assamese(and not assami),oriya(and not oriyi),tulu(and not tuli),Mizo(and not mizi),it is urdu(and not urdi),bodo(and not bodi),angika(and not angiki).</p>

<p>I was trying to give explaination why many people call Kanadi, this should not be a rule. Additionally, I was trying to tell it is not derogatory or anything. Major langueges in North India do end with 'i' or 'ee'. Other languages have unique pronouciation in all languages, but kannada not. I know many people pronounce it as "Kannad", "Kannada" and "Kanadi". Kannada script itself is "Kannad" and not "Kannada". It is not uncommon to have more way of pronoucing for any languages. For example, (spanish, espanol), (English, angreji, ingraji, angl..) what is the best pronounciation of Bangalore? Bengalore, Benglore, Bangaluru, Bengaluru, or bengaluroo. BTW, THE ISSUE WAS NOT WITH RESPECT TO HOW TO PRONOUCE KANNADA, BUT THE USER SARVAGNA. Some administrator intervned, but still it wasn't easy to get user sargagna act. I did not totally oppose Kannada transliteration, but wanted to include Marathi, which deserves to be included. Fortunately, now the issue has been solved. Hopefully, such things won't be repeated in the future. --Sandipani 17:32, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Its clear by now that sarvagnya and his kannad friends have no evidence whatsoever to prove that Marathi is not used as a official language in Belgaon.Whereas,I have proved the reverse by following citations-</p>

</ul>
<p>If u see the same talk page,u will see that Sarvagnya has failed to prove that 'the board is not in Marathi'.Even nichalp,samir and aksi_great has also confirmed that the board is in Marathi indeed.Morever Offical Language act(passes by Karnataka govt.) also permits the usage of Marathi in Belgaum and adjoining regions.(see: <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012505160300.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012505160300.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012505160300.htm</a> )</p>
<p>When a municipal corporation of a city uses a particluar language,it does only but confirms its official status.Since sarvagnya had no other issues to rake up he has deliberately changed the course of debate to Solapur,Kasargode,Akkalkot etc.This is to tell him that if he proves that the municpal councils/corporations of Mumbai, Solapur, Akkalkot, Akkalkot uses the other language (than state's official language) we shall be more than happy to include its transliteration on respective pages.</p>
<p>Lastly,if Sarvagnya needs entertainment and attention he is adviced to go somewhere else.This is an serious and sensational topic.Just crying foul for word Kannadi,then Solapur,then Akkalkot,how 'La' is used in Hindi,mindless commentry over haLLis and paLLis etc shows his seriousness about the topic.The kannadisation of Belgaum shall not be allowed here.Plz take a chill pill and prove WHY Marathi shoudnt be included on this page when Belgaum municipal corporation uses it as an official language?Dont touch the keyboard unless u have answers to above mentioned questions. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 08:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the script displayed on that board is Marathi. I have insisted that there's no ळ in Hindi. I think mahanagarpalika is indeed a Marathi word and its Hindi counterpart is Nagar nigam.Also बेळगांव is also a Marathi word,a Hindi speaker will pronounce it as बेलगाव or बेलगाम. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 15:54, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hindi does not have a ळ character. Unfortunately the link that you have asked to look at is showing garbage to me so can't comment on that.

At my native place <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varanasi.html" title="Varanasi">Varanasi</a>, it is called as Nagar Mahapalika, Varanasi, so I remember that.

<p>I think, after discussions with several users, there are only two potential solutions to the immediate issue here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>List however many linguistic scripts are appropriately representative of all the major and minor linguistic groups of Belgaum.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>List no linguistic scripts whatsoever, as the inclusion of any without others would be taken as a sign of POV support for a side in a political struggle.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I do not think I can make further interventions here, but I thank everyone for talking to me calmly and hospitably explaining these issues to me. I hope that the editing issue can be resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all involved parties. I beseech all users to assume good faith and consider that on WP there are possibilities for working together that do not exist in the real world. We should not try to replicate real world conflicts here, the challenge on WP is in representing these conflicts in a way that is fair, equitable, unbiased and well researched.

<dd>Amerique, thanks for your honest attempt to solve the issue. As I mentioned above, I am from Belgaum. I have explained enough, why writing in Marathi is more important than in Kannada. Although the majority of people use Marathi, I am used to bilingual and trilingual situation also, especially in Karnataka govt offices. Moreover, we need to solve issues too. I am in favor of your first proposal, that is, include Kannada along with Marathi. No other language is spoken by a sizeable group. --Sandipani 01:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That the board has Marathi on it is been proved as of now.Marathi transliteration of Belgaon is here to stay!This was actually a non-issue since all including those who were doubting it,knew it was Marathi.They were having debate for the sake of it.Sadly after giving dozens of citations,few arrogant users did take so long to admit it.And as truth is out these fanatics are invisible!!I would like to thank all senior wikipedians,guys who helped building consensus and unofficial plus official mediators for their efforts.It is because of their support and advice I got used to Wiki policies and how things work here.At the end of this battle I have turned into a citation-savvy wikipedian and also a bit practical too.

<dd>Because there is a link in the article to Chennamma's statue in Bangalore. That seems to be his weird logic! Little does he realize that unlike Shivaji, Chennamma is a local of BeLagavi apart from being the first woman freedom fighter(though Jhansi Rani is often credited as the first, Chennamma fought the British before Jhansi Rani was perhaps even born!!).</dd>

<p>Yeah,since there is a link to some queen's stautue of BANGALORE,a link to Shivaji Maharaj's statue ,which is a respectable figure,for Maharashtrians who form sizeable population in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaon.html" title="Belgaon">Belgaon</a>, should be prsent.If u want to remove it,remove that queen's staute link too.

<p>She was a queen "from" belgaum. So there should be a link to her statue. You are making this a pride issue. This is encyclopedia, not a place to show your language pride. I am going to delete that link. If you revert it back, then I will have to complain to moderators. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotolstoy_c8d2.html" title="User:Leotolstoy">Leotolstoy</a> 13:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If u have a link of statue of that queen in Belgaon than insert it/Mention of her statue in this article is no problem,but why arent u allowing Shivaji Maharaj's statue link?If u want delete Shivaji's link, I have to delete that queen's link too. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 13:23, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Chennamma stutue is just one of the dozens stutues in belgaum, and not a tourist attraction. Nobody comes to visit the stutue. Channamma was a queen of Kittur not Belgaum. Additionally, the section is about tourist attractions in belgaum and not the history of belgaum. People from south Karnataka should first do some study about belgaum, visit Belgaum, and stay there for few days, before editing this article. --Sandipani 02:39, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its you who is pushing your state/language's POV. Rani Chennamma is from Belgaum and its relevent to have link to her statue. Shivaji/sambhaji are not from belgaum. If you know any famous marathi person from belgaum feel free to add a link.

<p><br />
FYI, the statue was installed in the premises of the Parliament. This is probably the only statue of a native of Belgaum there and it is a matter of honor for people of in and around of Belgaum (does not matter either marathi/kannada). I am putting it back. Instead of makng these pointless arguments try to improve the page by adding more information about the place and people there (again does not matter if they kannadiga or marathi). <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotolstoy_c8d2.html" title="User:Leotolstoy">Leotolstoy</a> 17:58, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I assume good faith and request u to reconsider ur stand.That link should be a part of Queen's article.<b>Morever the citation of statue u gave is not valid since that page doesnt specify about the statute being installed in Belgaon</b>.So I think that link should be deleted,instead add few words about that queen in article itself.I am waiting for few hours until u come with proper citations.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 03:32, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I really did not understand the logic behind that. Anyway "Assuming good faith" I have deleted that link and I have added a small paragraph about Chennamma (not chinnamma) in history section. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotolstoy_c8d2.html" title="User:Leotolstoy">Leotolstoy</a> 17:09, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your other counterparts were being rude while interacting here and hence the mention of 'good faith'.Nice that u added info about the queen in article.I have removed the statue link(since it is not confirmed if it is in Belgaon or not) and stamp pic(which should be a part of queen's article,not here).Thanks.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 03:37, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is another article with title "belgaum district". Please don't include details about entire district in this article. I don't know who has added so many places of attractions. Most of the places can not be called as attractions. Additionally, a few of them are quite far from Belgaum city. I can give hundreds of places like listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nandagad: Shoor Sangolli Rayanna Smarak</li>
<li>Munavalli Panchalingeshwara Temple</li>
<li>Hooli Panchalingeshwar Temple</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, statues at road intersections are not the places of attraction. --Sandipani 03:06, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The rail/air connections information is ancient, and should be updated. I have made some minor changes, but it would probably make more sense for someone actually in Belgaum to update this information (I am from Belgaum, but I don't live there anymore).</p>
<p>I also find it very embarrassing (as an Indian) that India-related articles such as these quickly become the battleground for wannabe politicians (on either side) who do not understand what Wikipedia is about. Nothing on this talk page is really relevant to facts related to Belgaum. If Belgaum is part of Karnataka today, it can be stated as a fact, that it will be part of Maharashtra tomorrow is subject to "time will tell". Wikipedia reports only on facts, not on (possibly speculative) future events.</p>
<p>Because of the huge number of educational institutions in Belgaum (and the military bases there), the influx of people from all over India (and even all over the world) has changed the language and cultural profile of the city considerably - just like any city that is subject to influx of population from elsewhere. (To make a point - what is the "local food" of San Francisco?&#160;:)</p>
<p>Having said that (and knowing that this just adds to the noise) - could we archive this talk page and get rid of the bile that is flowing around here (which is in no way representative of Belgaum)?</p>
