<p>Why is this topic called "Bebi (Dragon Ball GT)"? Would "Baby (Dragon Ball)" not suffice instead? After all, Bebi is just Japanese phonetics for "baby". That would be like making topics on Piccolo and Trunks, and calling them "Pikkoro" and "Torankusu".... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_S_f5c0.html" title="User:The S">The S</a> 03:57, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article name should probably be "Baby (Dragon Ball)" because the official English name of the character is "Baby". However, I think that name was used once and so we can't rename it without an admin.

<p>When has Babi ever used Kuririn's Kienzan I haved a Dragonball GT box set and I never seen Baby used Kuririn's Kienzan nor Tenshinhan's Taiyoken. The moves that I only seen him copy was the Big Bang Attack and the Final Flash.</p>
<p>Answer: Bebi forms one during his fight with Uubu, but does not call out the name. Also, the article does not state that he copied the Taiyoken, only that the light he emits from his eyes is similar.</p>

<p>I would appreciate it if others could assist in reverting the vandalism by that anonymous user. Kibitoshin is the Japanese name for the Fusion of Kaioshin and Kibito. Kibitokai is the English dub name for that same Fusion. I don't know why the anonymous user fails to understand something so simple, despite my attempts to explain it to them. Regardless, I am sure that the rest of you can comprehend this, and also know that my inclusion of the character's name isn't an attempt to make this article about anyone besides Bebi. After all, Goku's name is included in the article, is it not? Why does this anonymous user not object to this, and claim that the article is about Bebi and not Goku?</p>

<p>Excuse me, but your wrong too. The name "Kabitokai" are separated in the Funimation dub into Kabito Kai in both the Budokai(videogame) and Dragonball Z,GTs series. Also the notes about Goku is pertaining to the importance of those attacks, seeing as how these attacks are all used on Goku. You seem to have problem to noted to Tenshinhan.</p>
<p>Gundirk 12:49, 7 March</p>
<hr />
<p>I am having difficulty understanding what you just said. If "Kibitokai" is seperated into "Kibito Kai" in the dubs, then fine. I don't care. The issue was not about Kibitokai/Kibito Kai. The issue is about the argument over whether the name Kibitoshin exists, why Kaioshin keeps on being reverted to an incorrect spelling, and whether Kibitoshin should be included in this article. If everyone thinks that all reference to Kibitoshin/Kibito Kai/Kaioshin should be removed from the attack names, then feel free. Just don't mispell the names if you DO include them, and do NOT claim that something doesn't exist when it DOES.</p>
<p>What was that last comment about? I never said anything about Tienshinhan. Also, I KNOW why Goku's name was included. Kibitoshin/Kaioshin was included for the same reason. That is why I do not see what problem there could possibly be in mentioning that character.</p>
<p>Saying I am "wrong" when nothing in my statements, or your own, would indicate I am wrong about anything, doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>Revenge Death Ball Final is indeed an offical non-fanon attack that is not pronounced out in Funimation's dub.

<p>it says Bebi is the only villan not seen when the gateway to Hell was opened. It is possible that since he was an artificial life form he had no soul to be sent to the Afterlife. but cell was there and hes a artificial life form too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cell is a Bio-Android, made of human, Namekian and Saiyan cells.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right. Cell was a living being. Bebi was some kind of organic metal, and wasn't actually born or even grown (like Cell) but was simply BUILT. Android 16 didn't appear in Heaven when he was destroyed because he was just a machine. He may have had a personality, but that doesn't seem to equate to a soul. It's complicated, and it may be best not to discuss the issue of souls, since it's a touchy subject with some people. It MAY be best to remove that part of the article entirely, unless others feel it is okay enough to remain without causing further confusion.&#160;::<a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaishokaioshin_d77d.html" title="User:Daishokaioshin">Daishokaioshin</a> 21:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Best to get rid of it. Toei included Android 19 (a machine model like 16) in Hell for no reason but a sight gag. Gero is still a cyborg, as is Dr. Myuu (though it's been so long since I've seen GT he might have been a full robot too). No one is supposed to be just strutting around in Dragon Ball's Hell anyway, it's a massive plot hole created by animation filler. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_Treason_ae0c.html" title="User:Voice of Treason">Voice of Treason</a> 22:15, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never really understood what happens to dragonball villains when they go to hell. Whenever you see dead souls at King Yemma's castle they always look like white blob things. However, when they're show in hell it seems as though they have bodies. I thought that in order to keep your body you had to be given special permision by one of the Kais. In fact, that was a major plot point in the namek saga, seeing as how Krillin, Tien, and Yamcha had to be transported to the check in station on earth because their physical bodies had been transported to King Kai's planet. I was especially confused by the other world tournament saga. From early on it was said that only a select few get to keep their bodies after death. However, only a few episodes into it, Cell and other villains are shown to be able to beat up some of the demon guys and Goku had to fight them in order to quiet them down. I realise it was only filler, but can the writers have been that stupid as to contradict themselves in the first few episodes. Is their something I'm missing or am I trying to read too deeply into something that was never really meant to be analyzed? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 141.157.17.245 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.157.17.245_71e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.157.17.245">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Listen, I told you why it isn't canon. You have yet to provide <i>any</i> proof or facts. What do you have to show that GT is canon, besides your opinion, that overules the facts I gave you? Nothing. In my opinon, everything after the point where Freeza uses his Death Ball on Namek (Androids Saga, Cell Saga, Buu Saga, everything) is non-canon, but I'm not going around changing articles to make it say that, am I?

<dd>The reason I put that it's debatable is because no official source has stated whether it's canon or not, so it's something that fans of the show continue to debate. I am not putting in the article that he's canon, just that it's debatble. I have editors who agree with me and Koji has one(maybe more) that agree with him. Most websites consider GT canon but no official source has said if it is or not. For now I won't revert, but I did put up citation tags on the parts of it being non-canon so you have a opportunity to proove it. I suggest seeing what the people at Wikiproject: Anime and Manga think so we can reach a consensus. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 05:39, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What makes this argument so amusing is that it is so incredibly trivial. It doesn't matter which of you it right because whether it's canon or not won't really affect anyone, anywhere, ever.

<p>The definition of Canon states that it needs to be <b>considered authentic</b> or created by a <b>particular author</b>. In this case, the particular author would be Toriyama. Also, authentic means genuine, which GT is not because it isn't based on the manga. Therefore, it would be non-canon. But, if you still don't want to listen to the facts, that's okay.

<dd>Err... That's a flawed argument if I ever saw one. Just because sources that an individual considers credible do NOT state something doesn't meant that an individual's particular beliefs are valid. That is a logical fallacy. If you cannot provide evidence that Dragon Ball GT IS canon, then you don't have a leg to stand on. Dragon Ball GT is considered non-canon by most people due to its many contradictions of facts, characters, and so on that have been established in Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It considered non-canon by most people because it is not based on any of the canon manga that Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z is based off of. It is considered non-canon by most people because it is poorly written, has bad characterization, and focuses almost entirely on a single character (Son Goku), giving little or no attention to any of the other characters. While the latter reason I provided may be debatable, the first two are NOT. They are facts. Dragon Ball GT is considered non-canon. Whether it is specifically stated that this is so by 'most websites' that 'consider it to be canon' is utterly irrelevant, because 'most websites' are not credible sources of information on this subject, nor are they authorities which can decide such matters.</dd>

<dd>The fact that Dragon Ball GT is non-canon doesn't need to be stated in the article, but arguing against it being such is a waste of everybody's time, especially when you break 3RR as badly as you and Kojidude have. Kojidude, I'm a bit disappointed in you. You should have just let TJ get banned temporarily. It might have granted him some time to think about what he was doing wrong. Entering into an edit war with him doesn't solve anything, and while I'm glad you've decided to drop the issue, you should have done it far sooner. Let others dig their own graves. You don't need to dig your own as well.</dd>
