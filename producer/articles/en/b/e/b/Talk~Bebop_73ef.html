<p>Is there any evidence that the 1953 Massey Hall lineup even played together in the 1940s? As far as I know while all the players had certainly played together many times, it was a supergroup put together for that particular occasion. -- I'm also a little dubious about the stuff near the end about the "bebop scales". I know these are used to teach bebop-playing to students <i>nowadays</i> but is there any evidence that this codification of the style existed early on? I think it's actually probably a formulation/rationalization introduced by players/theorists like Barry Harris later on. <a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 22:15, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ACK. There is no indication that <i>The Quintet</i> was something comparable to a regular working band at any time during the forties or later. Also, one could argue that Mingus doesn't really epitomize Bebop bass, his style went for a broader conception of jazz very early on. On the other hand, many musicians and historians credit <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Pettiford_6759.html" title="Oscar Pettiford">Oscar Pettiford</a> as being the major stylist on the bass (cf. his <i>Man I Love</i>-solo with Hawkins). Plus, the truth be told, Powell's playing on the Massey Hall recording – he wasn't in very good physical/psychological shape that night – is a far cry from his style (that being essentially a <i>trio</i>, not so much a <i>combo</i> conception). His comping on <i>All The Things You Are</i> in particular may be sort of impressive from a pianistic viewpoint – even that I find doubtful – but it's got very little in common with what constitutes "typical" bebop piano comping. -- With all due respect for Barry Harris, I'd leave all the bop scale stuff out. As a musician, I find it an interesting approach, but there is – to my ears at least – no aural evidence whatsoever to support the idea that Bird, Dizzy, and everybody thought along those lines. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainer_Lewalter_7488.html" title="User:Rainer Lewalter">Rainer Lewalter</a> 12:01, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>...yet another thing: IMHO that bit about <i>writing entirely new compositions based on existing chord changes, later known as contrafacts or contrafactions, was uncommon until the bebop era</i> overstates the point, don't you think? Cf. the dozens of traditional jazz compositions using <i>Tiger Rag</i> changes. Sure, these are much less characteristic or distinctive than e.g. <i>All The Things You Are</i> or <i>How High The Moon</i>, but the implication here is that the boppers came up with the entire basic idea, whereas in fact in this field, like so many others, they weren't really all that revolutionary, but took the tradition of the music to a consequent and logical next level... well ok, that's with the benefit of hindsight, but still. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainer_Lewalter_7488.html" title="User:Rainer Lewalter">Rainer Lewalter</a> 12:53, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comments--see if my edit of the page addresses these concerns. I think it's OK now; my one remaining concern is the paragraph that turns to modal jazz, which I think confuses matters more than helps them by referencing a later style. And again, there seems to me to be a smuggling-in of later codifications of bebop that were not to my knowledge quite put that way at the time: I gather that Berklee-style teaching is big on "each chord has its scale", but that's not necessarily how bebop or modal jazz approached things. (For instance, the key thinker in this period about modal jazz, George Russell, emphasized that musicians needn't bother to play over every possible scale--besides such "vertical" approaches he also advocated "horizontal" approaches a la Lester Young.) -- The main problem with this entire entry so far is that while it's quite detailed on the music-theory aspect of bebop, it has nil on the social/cultural history or even a straightforward narrative of how it came to be born (no mention of Minton's, Eckstine or Hines' bands, &amp;c &amp;c). Someone want to take a crack at this? I can't find my copy of the Deveaux book at the moment or else I'd start this myself.... <a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 14:29, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ndorward, yes, those edits sure make sense (IMHO at least). Concerning the broader perspective on the music, I also agree. I do have to admit, though, that I just finished an extended article on the compositional aspects of bebop in the German-language Wikipedia and for the moment I'm a bit exhausted&#160;:-) I haven't the faintest idea, to be sure, if you could manoeuvre your way through a German text, but here it is anyway <a href="../../../../de/b/e/b/Bebop_head.html" class="extiw" title="de:Bebop_head">de:Bebop head</a>. As I said, it's only about the compositions as such and leaves out everything that's more strictly related to bop's key feature, improvisation. In the context, all the good old stories about Minton's and Monroe's made little sense, whereas other aspects of the bebop community are more closely scrutinized (e.g. all of the copyright fee business, where there's a lot of legends around which have been recycled over and over since Gitler's earlier books). Well, anyway, there's lots of audio samples and music files in that one, and whatever you think might come in useful here, you're welcome to transfer- I uploaded all the files on WP Commons. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainer_Lewalter_7488.html" title="User:Rainer Lewalter">Rainer Lewalter</a> 19:33, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b><i>It is so that pettiford was the bebop bassist back at minton's. Bud powell was there, too, and along with monk he is the original bebop pianist.</i></b></p>
<p><b>but bebop as a form owes the most to Bird, of course. Diz was the perfect bop trumpet player for the time but parker invented it - he fully realized, musically, what the minton's crowd had been toying with for a while but couldn't quite coalesce. I need to source all this.</b></p>
<p><b>By Massey Hall, bop's obtuseness (to most ears) had removed jazz from the pop charts (permanently, for the most part). But it had its core of fans, white and black. Massey is the complete realization of 13 years of bop experimentation and growth. It isn't definitive musically, it's more of historical significance than anything.</b> As to the math and theory, that's good stuff. And it does need to get supplemented (which I will try to work on) with cultural meaings, and musical terms more friendly to the layperson.</p>

<p>Is it just me, or do the given audio samples contradict everything that the article says about bebop? None of them are "extremely fast tempo", and a couple of them sound more like swing than bop to my ears. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidMcCabe_5e48.html" title="User:DavidMcCabe">David McCabe</a> 09:04, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Man, this is one of those times when the state of copyright law really annoys me. It's almost impossible to get any sort of feel for the music in 20 seconds; these samples strike me as just about useless. Er. I've uploaded another one, though, for good measure. (As far as sounding like swing -- the selection of samples seems biased toward early bop, and toward head sections.) <a href="../../../t/l/o/User%7ETlogmer_ea3e.html" title="User:Tlogmer">Tlogmer</a> <small><b>(</b> <a href="../../../t/l/o/User_talk%7ETlogmer_36b4.html" title="User talk:Tlogmer">talk</a> <b>/</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tlogmer_cc7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tlogmer">contributions</a> <b>)</b></small> 17:50, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a music fan with a limited knowledge of jazz. I came to this page wanting to know about bebop, and was not able to learn much information from this article.</p>
<p>I'm not a complete musical novice; I can play a few instruments (poorly). But the bulk of this article is music theory that can probably only be understood by someone who already knows what bebop is. I don't wish to criticize what has been written, but only point out that there needs to be more information targeted to he casual reader.</p>
<p>I would suggest some of the following topics to be covered: (based on questions I had)</p>
<p>How did bebop come about?</p>
<p>What was the cultural context that surrounded it?</p>
<p>What contributions did some important musicians make?</p>
<p>What kind of cultural impact did it make?</p>
<p>What is the state of bebop music today?</p>
<p>Also, if the paragraph that starts with "Bebop differed drastically from the highly organized compositions" was moved right under the opening paragraph of the style section, it might help. I can understand the first paragraph and that paragraph fairly well.</p>

<p>Anyone else find the emphasis on Hawkins' "Body &amp; Soul" to the exclusion of virtually every other influence on the beboppers rather misleading &amp; bizarre? I mean, yes, it's a key performance &amp; it has some features (like tritone substitutions) that were central to bebop performance, but I don't see that the entire movement hangs on the once recording. I guess this emphasis on Hawkins to the virtual exclusion of other key influences like Lester Young, Roy Eldridge (Gillespie's major role-model) &amp; Art Tatum is the result of DeVeaux's <i>The Birth of Bebop</i>...... -- I have deleted some flowery, nonsensical phrases from the article, which seemed to me more about alliteration &amp; internal rhymes ("great/sedate") than actually saying anything useful. --<a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 16:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are several different spellings of bebop in the article, even though the article title is bebop. What's your take on this? www.etymonline.com sources it as bebop. I'm not sure which to use.

<p>I believe it should be bebop in order to display a constant on the spelling. I am choosing "bebop" because of the etymoline.com source. Wikifriendawesome 12:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary 2002 edition calls it bebop, so I'm going to go ahead and change all mentions of be-bop to bebop.

<p>How much music theory is appropriate here? There seems to me vastly more of it here (some of it very full of typos &amp; awkwardnesses) than necessary, &amp; I can't see what the point is of e.g. explaining tritone subs at length when there is already a page on it on Wikipedia (linked to in the article). I realize that the recent edits were done in good faith, but they just seem to me to bloat the article to no great purpose, &amp; give the reader a misleading impression that bebop is primarily some abstruse note-spinning exercise. --<a href="../../../n/d/o/User%7ENdorward_662d.html" title="User:Ndorward">ND</a> 03:31, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
