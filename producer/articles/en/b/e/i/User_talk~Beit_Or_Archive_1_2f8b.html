<p>Dear Beit Or, I don't know who you are but this is just to let you know that your editing out of a highly doubtful finge view on Pharaohs <a href="../../../a/y/_/Ay.html" title="Ay">Ay</a> <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramesses_I_891a.html" title="Ramesses I">Ramesses I</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horemheb.html" title="Horemheb">Horemheb</a> and [Moses], etc have been reverted back by a user named Therealmikelvee. (see here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Therealmikelvee" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Therealmikelvee" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) This user follows Ahmad Osman gewnerally unorthodox views on Ramesses I, the Biblical Joseph and <a href="../../../y/u/y/Yuya.html" title="Yuya">Yuya</a>--among others. However, Osman's views are not accepted by mainstream Egyptologists and have not published in reputable Egyptological journals like JEA, JNES, BAR or BASOR. Most professional scholars including Kenneth Kitchen date Joseph to the 20th Century BC based on the price of 20 shekels that was paid for him when he was sold into slavery in Mesopotamia/modern day Iraq. (see KA Kitchen, 'Genesis 12-50 in the Near Eastern World' in "He Swore an Oath", RS Hess, et al, eds: Cambridge Tyndale House, 1993, pp.67-92.) Somehow, I think that this user will probably revert back all your other deletions on <a href="../../../y/u/y/Yuya.html" title="Yuya">Yuya</a>, the <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> and complain that it is 'Vandalism' just as he called me that when I tried to edit his fringe views here. This is the problem with Wikipedia--anyone can put noncredible or original research here with no academic oversight to evaluate the credibility of the information. Just because a user can cite information from a book doesn't mean the book is mainstream or is published by a respected scholar. In contrast, more weight should be placed on the work of scholars like Frederic Payraudeau who have published in mainstream journals like JEA<a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16304000" class="external autonumber" title="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16304000" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> or BIFAO.24.87.128.182 22:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for noticing my message above, Beit Or. I am User 24.87.128.182 <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoboudv_38e3.html" title="User:Leoboudv">Leoboudv</a> 19:59, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Beir Or, Do you know anything about the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shasu.html" title="Shasu">Shasu</a>? Some scholars such as Donald Redford have once claimed that they were the Hebrews but others say these people were Bedouins. I thought they wee Bedouins but I know little about the topic. Anyhow, Thereamalikee has made a reference to the Shasu in the article on <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramesses_I_891a.html" title="Ramesses I">Ramesses I</a> but I won't touch it--for fairness sake--due to Redford's claim that the Shasu were perhaps the Israelites. As an Aside, are you Israeli? You seem to know much on Jewish topics. I have had some minor contact with Dan'el Kahn from Haifa University who has published a new, more accurate chronology of the 25th Dynasty kings in Orientalia 2001 such as <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shebitku.html" title="Shebitku">Shebitku</a>. Regards, <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoboudv_38e3.html" title="User:Leoboudv">Leoboudv</a> 03:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank You for clarifying the identity of the Shasu. I'm afraid I don't have recourse to my University resources at <a href="../../../u/b/c/UBC_98ba.html" title="UBC">UBC</a> at present. I have removed the reference to the Shasu to Rms I now. I always thought the Shasu were not the Israelites but someone else. Also, scholars once thought the Apiru or <a href="../../../h/a/p/Hapiru.html" title="Hapiru">Hapiru</a>--who are mentioned in the Amarna letters--were a reference to Hebrews but few now accept this comparison. Most scholars today view them as highway robbers/thieves who attacked the trade caravans travelling between Egypt and Mitanni/Hatti; hardly the vision one gets of the real Hebrews who lived in Egypt. As an Aside, it is sad for me to say that my local municipal library does have a copy of Osman's book on Akhenaten. It seems the local librarians can't distinguish Osman's untenable ideas; no wonder some people are fooled by his ideas unfortunately. My University and College definitely don't carry Osman's work--they are professionals who know what is history and what is fiction. I personally prefer BALANCE in Book Reviews and in Wikipedia articles Recently, I incorporated new evidence on 3 Egyptian kings--<a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamose.html" title="Kamose">Kamose</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/b/Sobekemsaf_I_0d98.html" title="Sobekemsaf I">Sobekemsaf I</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/e/Khendjer.html" title="Khendjer">Khendjer</a> on Wikipedia from Kim Ryholt's 1997 book on the Second Intermediate Period through my 24.87... or Leoboudv accounts, but I've also criticised many of Ryholt's views here. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//8772894210/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-0220998-3084869?ie=UTF8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//8772894210/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-0220998-3084869?ie=UTF8" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I don't believe in completely accepting a scholar's ideas if they are wrong as you can see here. In contrast, Thereamalikee uncritically--and constantly--pushed his POV's on Osman, which is just plain wrong. It was nice conversing with you..and wish everyone else was as reasonable and informative as you but we live in an imperfect world. With kind Regards, <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeoboudv_38e3.html" title="User:Leoboudv">Leoboudv</a> 02:37, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Personally, I agree that Osman doesn't belong in the main articles. However, this is a disputed point. Now, we could adress this on the talk page of every different article, but I suggest you make your case over at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Ancient_Egypt_d5fd.html#Ahmed_Osman" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Ancient Egypt">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Ancient Egypt#Ahmed Osman</a>. Contrary to what another user has written on your talk page, I believe you'll find Therealmikelvee to be a reasonable person, and not a "pov pusher." He is not an "osman follower," but merely believes that these theories deserve coverage. I don't personally agree; I believe they belong on Osman's page itself, but that's a matter to be hashed out on talk pages. I think I can speak for all of Wikiproject:Ancient Egypt when I say we'd rather avoid a full scale edit war over half the 18th dynasty, which this is quite possibly shaping up to be. Thanks <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 23:11, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the useful suggestion. I am not interested in a full scale war of reversions. That is why I felt it better to let Markh's historical context post remain even though I disagree with it. But PLEASE note ONE fact: when a scholar/student publishes an article in a major--or even a minor journal--like JEA, JNES, BIFAO, SAK, Orientalia or the small scale GM, it has been scrutinised numerous times for textual errors, historical context, the strength of the evidence supporting the article,etc prior to it being published! But with Osman's unorthodox views, there is no scrutinity--anyone can come up with their own ideas and post it on Wikipedia--or print his own book like Osman has without seriously analyzing what the archaeological evidence says. Encyclopaedia Brittanica wld never do this--they would just omit Osman's theory altogether. Neither would <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Kitchen_3947.html" title="Kenneth Kitchen">Kenneth Kitchen</a> who is renowned as a thorough fact checker whose books have mostly stood up to the test of time. Mainstream Egyptological Forum like Thoth Web and EEF have moderators to censor these unprovable ideas before they are even posted to Forum subscribers--but Wikipedia doesn't.

<dd>No, "Old East Slavic" is not a Wikipedia neologism: the term is used extensively in the scholarly literature, even if "Old Russian" is admittedly more common. See, for example, <i>Slavic Prosody: Language Change and Phonological Theory</i> by Christina Y. Bethin or <i>Languages and Their Status</i> (a standard linguistics reference text). In addition, there is no such language as "archaic Russian". Anyway, you'd better sort out this issue on the talk of the respective article. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 09:22, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Most probably, the crossbow first appeared at an unknown date among the tribes of South-Eastern Asia, where it is still used by the hunter-gatherer and nomad tribes both for hunting and warfare, as well as a toy. [1]</p>
<p>The reference for this statement is Needham according to your source. I doubt very much Needham ever said anything like this. There was a source about South East Asia and you deleted it, furthermore it is not clear its use was limited to hunter gatherer, this is close to OR. We had a long discussion on this issue and came to the conclusion it is not clear where the crossbow comes from, it is roughly South-East AND East Asia. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 22:21, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I have interpreted Needham correctly; notice that I didn't say hunter-gatherer <i>only</i>, but hunter-gatherer and nomad tribes. However, feel free to suggest your wording. What I'm 100% certain is that Needham does <i>not</i> say that the crossbow originated in China, as the article used to claim. In fact, he says it is more likely that the corssbow first appeared among the primitive tribes outside China. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 06:55, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Beit Or. What makes you think Kiyosaki is a Homeontherange sockpuppet? Can you point to specific contributions? I do suspect Kiyosaki is a sockpuppet of someone.

<dd>WP:AN/3RR doesn't include a confession from Kiyosaki as far as I can see.

<dd>Russia is a country, so it's natural that people from Russia are classified as "Russians" regardless of their ethnicity. There is, however, no such country as "Arabia"; thus, Arabs are an ethnic group rather subjects of a country. One cannot, therefore, call apply the name of "Arab" to anyone who lived in a coutry ruled by Arabs or simply wrote in Arabic. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 18:16, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Milton Friedman is not usually counted among Nobel laureates of Hungarian origin although his parents were born on the area of the historical Hungary and they spoke Hungarian between each other. Milton Friedman confirmed it in his letter to Endre Czeizel [a notable Hungarian genetician]: "I've always considered my parents Hungarian." Hence, Milton Friedman can better be classified among Nobel laureates of Hungarian origin than for instance Robert Bárány.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Only Milton Friedman's parents are known to a satisfactory degree. The father received the name Jenő (which is a typical Hungarian given name) and Saul (which refers to his Jewish ancestry). He was born in 1878 in Beregszász (...).</i></dd>
<dd><i>His mother was born in Beregszász, her family name being Landau, while she received the Hungarian names Sára (which she later used as "Sarah") and Etelka ("Ethel"). Three of her sisters had emigrated earlier to the U.S. Encouraged by them, she followed them there in 1895, aged 14. They lived in Brooklyn. She worked as a seamstress and she studied the language of her new homeland in the evening school of immigrants.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The two young people met in Brooklyn. They hadn't known each other earlier, although both of them were born in Beregszász. Their Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and their shared birthplace may have played a role in their coming together. They had four children, the first three being girls, Tillie, Helen and Ruth, and the fourth was a boy, Milton.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>If both of his parents were Hungarian, I don't think it's fair to remove reference to his Hungarian roots, even if it's only by birth and not by citizenship. I think it would be somewhat POV to decide on the side of citizenship. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 16:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This claim may be sourced, but you'll still have to demonstrate that it is NPOV to consider a Jewish person born in America to be Hungarian even if both of his parents were born in a twon populated predominantly by Hungarians. <i>Prima facie</i>, the claim of Friedman being a Hungarian sounds odd. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 17:24, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The statement is not that he was exclusively Hungarian but that Hungarian was one facet of his multiple (in fact, triple) identity. The best category would be "Jewish-Hungarian-American Nobel laureates" but since a category like that would be questionable, we use the separate categories: one for each facet, cf. <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyphenated_American_11d1.html" title="Hyphenated American">Hyphenated American</a>. It's also strange that you keep the Jewish ancestry in the category but delete the Hungarian. If an American identity overwrites (?) everything else, how can he remain Jewish? On the other hand, if an American identity doesn't overwrite the other ones, how can he put down the Hungarian one? I don't understand the rationality. Chronologically speaking, the Jewish was the first, then the family became naturalized Hungarians (while keeping the Jewish origin), then they became naturalized Americans (while keeping the Jewish and the Hungarian origin). Isn't it logical? If he had ever wanted to deny his parents, he could have denied the Jewish roots along with the Hungarian ones. But he did not do so with either so we must not do so posthumously, instead of him, can we? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 08:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A Hungarian is a person who either is Hungarian by ethnicity or was born in Hungary.

<p>I looked at some of the details of this article, and it appears that the person under consideration held anti-Judaic views (in the sense that he opposes Judaism as a religion). He doesn't appear to be antisemitic (i.e., he doesn't seem to be having any opposition to Jewish people—and their corresponding ethnic group). Do you agree with this formulation? I was thinking about creating a category called "Anti-Judaic people"—people having negative views toward Judaism as a religion, but not necessarily the ethnic group. For example some Jewish converts to Christianity might be anti-Judaic, but they may not be anti-Semitic per se. I hope you see what I'm saying. So let me know what you think about this idea in general and whether or not you think it applies in the case of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>.

<dd>No problem, but perhaps we should all in all improve this article. It gets quite a lot of attention (measureable with the weekly amount of vandalism) on the discussion page is a link to a sandbox with a rewrite. You are among the most knowledgeable editors on the origins so far. In my opinion one of the chief problems is the claim anybody invented this thing. From the rare evidence we have due to lucky circumstances such claims are erronous as a history professor has put it in a book on the Neolithicum (I'm reading currently). Perhaps we could once and for all make it clear to the average reader that there is no "invented" claim possible for prehistoric times. We only know the oldest surviving evidence. The aspect that the crossbow is actually identifiable at an earlier date in ancient Greece than in historic China could perhaps be better presented and a description of the development of nuts could help to shed some light on it (see Steven Selby studies). For the Romans I have some mention that they do have relief with small handheld horn crossbows besides small handheld ballistae. I will check this in time, but this would make the difference between China and Europe/Western Asia/Africa even lesser. What really bothers me is the time between the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and the battle of Hastings. In between the crossbow disappears from records. Are there possibly Byzantine records on the subject(They managed to steal the secret of silk, so I assume they knew Chinese weapons)?<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 23:49, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is even poor anti-Semitism to oppose the purported notion that Judaism is the one true path to salvation. A more accurate contention would be that Judaism is cliquish and exclusionist; it is based upon God's pact with Israel as descibed in the Torah. Non-Jews are not expected to follow all the regulations given therein. The upside to this exclusivity is than one is unlikely to come under attack, rhetorical or otherwise, for not submitting to Judaism. If one is an idolator, this is indeed condemned and has a right to take issue with Judaism on ideological grounds, if not practical ones as it has been millenia since Jews have persecuted idolators.
