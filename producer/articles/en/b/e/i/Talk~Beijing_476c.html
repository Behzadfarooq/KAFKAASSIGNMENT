<p>Article says "It was known to foreigners as Peking before China standardized on Pinyin for transliteration". Isn't it still called Peking (or a variant) in some languages other than English, e.g. French? -- <a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>My E-F dictionary says "Beijing", but I'm pretty sure "P√©kin" is more common. For instance <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Chine" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Chine" rel="nofollow">this wikipedia article</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/recherche_articleweb/1,9687,288301,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lemonde.fr/recherche_articleweb/1,9687,288301,00.html" rel="nofollow">this article in Le Monde</a>. "Bƒõijƒ´ng" may be the standard pinyin transcription, but that doesn't obligate the whole world to use it. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, "P√©kin" is still the most commonly used form in French. "P√©king" was used in French until approximately the beginning of the 20th century. Germans still commonly use "Peking". -<a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlivier_5e7f.html" title="User:Olivier">User:Olivier</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually"Nanking," now in pinyin is "Nanjing." No change in the pronunciation. "Canton" is also PR, which so far as I can see, has a very distance relation to any pronunciation in Chinese.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If nobody objects, I will adjust the wording in the article.</p>
<p>Actually the name Beijing means Northern capital. The name Peking comes from when Beijing was not the capital of China so the name is changed to Northern city. The name Beijing is the correct official name. No one who speaks Mandarin will call Beijing, Peking. They're written and pronounced differently in Chinese.<a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwazyutopia19_6201.html" title="User:Kwazyutopia19">Kwazyutopia19</a> 21:55, 24 September 2006 (UTC)KwazyUtopia19</p>
<dl>
<dd>Peking and Nanking are reflections of an earlier pronunciation of the names. In Manchu, Beijing is called <i>Beging</i>, which reflects the pronunciation of the name when the Qing dynasty was established. Jiangsu province was called <i>Giyangsu</i>, which is close to postal spelling Kiangsu. In many Chinese dialects, this shift from "k to j" has still not taken place. So it is not a question of right or wrong. As far as I am concerned, I have never heard anyone pronouncing Peking as "Bayjing".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Canton, it is an imperfect rendering of Guangdong. Apparently the first Europeans to arrive confused the name of the province with the name of the city. Such things happen. Chinese and many other languages, still refer to the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> as <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> Ëç∑ÂÖ∞, which is actually only a part of the Netherlands.--<a href="../../../n/i/o/User%7ENiohe_95e2.html" title="User:Niohe">Niohe</a> 22:05, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The metropolitan area of Beijing has been settled in the first millennium BC and the capital of Kingdom Yan (Ááï) was established there, and named it Ji (Ëìü). Ji has often been claimed as the beginning of Beijing; but in reality the city has been abandoned no later than the 6th century AD. The exact location of Ji is not clear despite numerous claims of its "discoveries" in recent years. During the great Tang and Song dynasties, only townships existed in this area. By the early 10th century, Kingdom Liao set up a "secondary capital" in the city proper, and called it Nanjing ("the Southern Capital"). Jing Dynasty that annexed Liao and ruled the northern China built its capital there, called Zhongdu (‰∏≠ÈÉΩ), or "the Central Capital". The Mongol force burned Zhongdu to the ground in 1215 AD and rebuilt its own "Grand Capital" (Â§ßÈÉΩ) to the north of the Jin capital in 1267 AD, which is the true beginning of Beijing. In 1403 AD, the 3rd Ming emperor Zhu Li, who just grabbed the throne by killing his brother after a bloody civil war and moved the capital from southern China to his own power base in the north, renamed the city Beijing (Âåó‰∫¨), or "Northern Capital".</p>

<p>My recommendation: Like I've created with the <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_Roads_of_Beijing_5d0d.html" title="Ring Roads of Beijing">Ring Roads of Beijing</a> and other such sub-pages, maybe we could move the Universities into such a section? I could then write something to start with (at the section on the Beijing page), such as a bit on famous universities, keep the "under the Min. of Edu." list, and move the entire list (with other entries) into the sub-pages.</p>
<p>As this is a big overhaul and affects stuff I (DF08) did not write, I'd like to gauge consensus before moving the whole thing. If within about a week there is no opposition or if I get a response to the tune of "do it", I'm going ahead; or someone else may take the lead ahead of time.</p>

<p>IMO one of the "owners" of this page needs to edit the text with an eye to Wikipedia style. Phrases like "Beijing is a true transportation hub" need to be ditched in favour of neutral, factual statements like "Beijing is one of the major transportation hubs in northern China". The first version is in a style often called "Comglish," (for obvious reasons), which is itself a subset of Chinglish.

<p>Actually, the English name "China" is misleading because the chinese zhongguo is a relatively recent term and China comes from the Chin dynasty. The page is to China-centric. For example, Dadu was part of the Mongolian empire, not China at the time. The so called "yuan dynasty" is an ethnocentric concept.</p>
<p>Peking is much more natural in English and is not a mistransliteration. Much of China still pronounces it with a hard [k] sound. The US Government decided to adopt the pinyin transcription but that does not mean that all English speaking regions did the same.</p>

<dd>It was the Mongol rulers themselves who called their government the "Yuan Dynasty" and themselves the emperors of "Yuan".</dd>

<dd>Beijing is the overwhelmingly common spelling that is used today by the English language. Google yields 15.7 million results for Beijing and 3 million results for Peking. So it is clear which one is more accepted.</dd>

<dd>And finally, [k] is not the pronunciation used in Standard Mandarin, nor the Beijing dialect, nor something like 90% of the dialects of Mandarin, Jin, Wu, or Xiang. It is preserved in Cantonese, Hakka, Min, and Gan (some parts). Considering that the [k] in "Peking" is not used by the standard language of China, nor the natives of Beijing, nor everyone else in China (except for something like five or six provinces), it's not precisely "much" of China that pronounces it with a hard [k] sound. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 02:09, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, those stats are given, but they aren't very useful...

<dd>I don't know... but it must have happened pretty recently, considering the prevalence of spellings like Peking, Chungking, Nanking, Kiangsu, Fukien, Kirin, etc... these spellings must have been adopted when the standard language of China (be it the Beijing dialect, or Nanjing dialect, or whatever other dialect) still contained the /k/ sound in those words. -- <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERan_05dd.html" title="User:Ran">ran</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERan_9e82.html" title="User talk:Ran">talk</a>) 01:56, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No. It didn't happen recently. Spellings like Peking existed when the shift had already occurred. The "k" was supposed to be pronounced /ts/ in Beijing while pronounced /k/ in southern dialects.

<dd>I don't agree and I would like to see a source from Qing stating that Peking is supposed to be pronounced /ts/. The fact that many of these sound shift are quite recent, by Chinese standards, is reflected in many <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchu_language.html" title="Manchu language">Manchu</a> spellings of Chinese names, which were fixed in the early seventeenth century. For instance, in Manchu, Beijing is called <i>Beging</i> and Jiangsu is spelt <i>Giyangsu</i>.

<p>Fukien should be transcripted based on the Min languages.

<p>Well I said.. the Europeans who arrived in China via the southern provinces.. and therefore I was suggesting the possibility that they romanised place names based on southern spoken variations, and ended up with a "k" in "Peking". ‚Äî <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Insta</a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInstantnood_9d48.html" title="User talk:Instantnood">ntnood</a> 17:34 Mar 3 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh... I see what you mean... well, but there are also examples like "Nanking". Clearly it has the "k", but in a southern dialect the front part would be "Nam", not "Nan", giving "Namking" instead. And then there's "Foochow", which would be something like "Fookchow" or "Hokchiu" in a southern dialect. (Foo without the -k is quite typically Mandarin.) Similarly there's "Kirin" (Jilin), which would probably be "Katram" or "Kitrim" (with -t and -m) in a southern dialect.</dd>

<p>Does it make sense to say that the Nationalists changed the name to "Beiping"? Obviously this is the Pinyin transliteration of what they changed the name to.

<dd>The English name used by then should be used. In English the adoption of Hanyu Pinyin by the PRC was in effect a name change. However, names prior to Postal Pinyin would perhaps be best be standardised by Hanyu Pinyin. In other words, the name of Beijing should be written as Dadu for the Yuan Dynasty, Yingtian during the early Ming Dynasty, Peking when Postal Pinyin was introduced, Peiping during the KMT era, and Beijing when Hanyu Pinyin was introduced and adopted by the UN.

<dd>The separate paragraph describing Beijing as one of 4 municipalities and its history as a municipality has been returned to its former position as second paragraph in the lead section, after I had moved it down to the last position. Is there a strong argument that it should be the second paragraph rather than closer to the bottom? I had moved it in trying to establish a pyramidal structure with information of greatest interest to the reader at the top and decreasing in importance on the way down.</dd>

<p>Is there a consensus as to whether the hutong-siheyuan section should be under the Culture section or Architecture section? Likewise, what about the placement of language and Beijing stereotypes? Language certainly makes sense under Demographics.

</dl>
<p>1) "Damages" should revert to "damage." The English word "damage" is a non-count noun, meaning that it does not need to be expressly pluralized (adding "s") to be able to refer to more than one instance of that thing. The word "damages" typically refers to legal monetary reparations.<br />
2) "Incessant" has replaced "intense." I will not say "intense" is the only appropriate word, as there may be others, but I don't feel "incessant" is appropriate here. It seems overly literary and not technical enough for an encyclopedia, in this context...and may express POV in the form of emotional emphasis.<br />
3) Should this paragraph-long sentence be restructured? There were originally dashes, as can be seen, to make the structure more readable. Should be dashes be returned, or the sentence alternately restructured in some other way?</p>
