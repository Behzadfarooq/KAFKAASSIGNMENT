  that this article or section

<p>Thanks for the heads-up. I think, however, that you have participated in creating a striking inconsistency at the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Shahak_0de1.html" title="Israel Shahak">Israel Shahak</a> article. Another editor (Jayjg) removed a link to <a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/Jews_NonJews/NJ_Attitudes_TO/NJ_Attitudes_BibRab/NJ_Shahak.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/Jews_NonJews/NJ_Attitudes_TO/NJ_Attitudes_BibRab/NJ_Shahak.htm" rel="nofollow">"Israel and Anti-Gentile Traditions,"</a> with the comment "the link is about the book, not about Shahak," (which I think is a very poor reason, as I noted on the talk page of the article), but when, for reasons of consistency, I removed the links to <a href="http://andrew.mathis.net/shahak.html" class="external text" title="http://andrew.mathis.net/shahak.html" rel="nofollow">The Interpretational Errors of Israel Shahak</a> and <a href="http://www.wernercohn.com/Shahak.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wernercohn.com/Shahak.html" rel="nofollow">The Jews are Bad!</a> (which I think are less scholarly, more poorly written, and more biased than the other article, and which are also reviews of the book rather than comments directly about Israel Shahak), you restored them. And, I note, you also repeated (unintentionally? It was coincident with another edit you made) the deletion of the link I added. Surely, if links that are about the book do not belong, then all three links should go; but if links that are about the book are admissable, then no legitimate reason has been given for the deletion of the link that I added. Could you please make sure your actions are consistent, either by restoring the link I added or by deleting the other two, or, in the absence of that, please explain at the talk page of the article why you think the two anti-Shahak book reviews belong but the neutral-on-Shahak book review does not belong?

<p>For the sake of the size of the main article (already overlong) and some kind of chance at peace, please move this line to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_and_the_Jews_9d61.html" title="Martin Luther and the Jews">Martin Luther and the Jews</a> article.

<p>Hi! I like the work you have done on the Ras Burqa Massacre page; however, in the process of some typo editing, I (and others, as shown on the talk page) came to feel that the balance of the coverage of the "opposition" Islamic reaction to the issue and other Islamic reactions to the issue may be a little one sided. Could you maybe take a look at this? I can also do so, if you do not have the time.

<p>Did "massive attacks", i.e. pogroms, by christians occur in the 2nd century? If so, were they inspired by this sermon?

<dd>I don't think so, but Classical Arabic had a contrast between different grammatical case forms, while modern spoken Arabic dialects do not have case distinctions. In circumstances (such as the "sound plurals") where dropping a word-final short inflectional ending (<i>i`rab</i>) did not automatically eliminate all case distinctions, the modern dialects generally use the old oblique forms in all grammatical uses -- and this feature of the spoken language sometimes influences modern written Arabic (though purists would consider such usages "incorrect"). I don't know anything about the specific etymology of the word Qurayza -- <a href="../../../y/b/g/User_talk%7EYbgursey_3741.html" title="User talk:Ybgursey">User talk:Ybgursey</a> might be able to help you there (if he was willing...). <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 13:57, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I noticed you reverted one of my edits without talk page discussion. Given that the edit was not vandalism, I feel that this inappropriate in accordance to Wikipedia policy. Please keep in mind <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a>. The "Don'ts" section would be especially pertinent to this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not simply revert changes that are made as part of a dispute. Be respectful to other editors, their contributions and their points of view.</li>
<li>Do not revert good faith edits. In other words, try to consider the editor "on the other end." If what one is attempting is a positive contribution to Wikipedia, a revert of those contributions is inappropriate unless, and only unless, you as an editor possess firm, substantive, and objective proof to the contrary. Mere disagreement is not such proof.</li>
<li>Generally there are misconceptions that problematic sections of an article or recent changes are the reasons for reverting or deletion. If they contain valid information, these texts should simply be edited and improved accordingly. Reverting is not a decision which should be taken lightly.</li>
<li>There's sometimes trouble determining whether some claim is true or useful, particularly when there are few people "on board" who are knowledgeable about the topic. In such a case, it's a good idea to raise objections on a talk page; if one has some reason to believe that the author of what appears to be biased material will not be induced to change it, editors have sometimes taken the step of transferring the text in question to the talk page itself, thus not deleting it entirely. This action should be taken more or less as a last resort, never as a way of punishing people who have written something biased.</li>
<li>Do not revert changes simply because someone makes an edit you consider problematic, biased, or inaccurate. Improve the edit, rather than reverting it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aminz did the same stuff at <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmitude.html" title="Dhimmitude">Dhimmitude</a> as well, the WP:LEAD violations and tendentious editing against majority opinion. Same quotes. I'll do a write-up today.</p>

<dd>Maybe the <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmitude.html" title="Dhimmitude">Dhimmitude</a> editing was different, what you think? <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 02:37, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if you voted at these AfD's, but Aminz nominated all of the articles on Spencer's books for deletion. Some of them are NYT bestsellers. It was on January 9th, the first one is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_9#The_Politically_Incorrect_Guide_to_Islam_.28And_the_Crusades.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Log/2007_January_9#The_Politically_Incorrect_Guide_to_Islam_.28And_the_Crusades.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Do you want to add this to the RfC, or should I? It would probably be better if you did it because I reacted pretty strongly in my votes. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 02:59, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know about the mass nomination. I didn't vote there, only commented on one of the Afd's: I believe that non-fiction books may have their own articles only in exceptional circumstances, but the consensus on Wikipedia is different at the moment. I think that the mass nomination with the same rationale was disruptive: if an editor believes that several articles must be deleted for the same reason, he must start only one Afd, instead of making other editors voting five or six times. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 07:25, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On the one hand, these articles, along with countless others such as <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza_farm.html" title="Pizza farm">Pizza farm</a> which have proved impossible to delete, probably should not be here, but the motive to AfD them may have been POV animus rather than encyclopedicity.</dd>
<dd>Aminz was probably unaware that he should have listed them en masse. In light of this, and the fact that a good case can actually be made for their (or at least most of their) deletion, it seems petty to keep this alive when there are a number of conscious, recurring problems to discuss. Although, Arrow, as you opposed the AfD's, you may have a different perspective. For my part, I'd like to focus on the big picture.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:44, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aloha, Beit Or. With the upfront caveat that I was not the author (nor do I have any idea who it was), I'm curious why you reverted the text posted by 172.129.70.39. As an outside, disinterested reader, it didn't seem like POV pushing to me at all, but rather additional and possibly relevant information. Seems to me that more information (as long as it is accurately reported and sourced, which this was) is better than less, especially when the original text seemed to give an inadequate accounting of other evidentiary sources. Cheers. <a href="../../../a/r/j/User%7EArjuna808_efa1.html" title="User:Arjuna808">Arjuna</a> 11:00, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The anon added the word "tentative" at the beginning of the paragraph, apparently insinuating that some later, better study will support the Khazar origin of Ashkenazim. Furthermore, the cited study<a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/90879162.html?dids=90879162:90879162&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+20%2C+2001&amp;author=JUDY+SIEGEL&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=04&amp;desc=Genetic+evidence+again+links+Jews+to+their+ancient+tribe" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/90879162.html?dids=90879162:90879162&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+20%2C+2001&amp;author=JUDY+SIEGEL&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=04&amp;desc=Genetic+evidence+again+links+Jews+to+their+ancient+tribe" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> does not in any way undercuts the evidence in favor of the Middle Eastern origin of the Jews, as the anons "however" implied; if anything, it provided further evidence for this generally held view. In any event, the Khazar hypothesis is already debunked in the article; further details are unnecessary. This is an article on Khzars, not Ashkenazim. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 18:14, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beit Or, thanks for your comments, and particularly for pointing out the singularly obvious that this is an article on Khazars, not Ashkenazim. However, as you know, the meme that “Jews are decended from Khazars” exists willy-nilly, and thus the issue is a relevant one. As one who was aware of this meme, I sought out the article simply seeking accurate, objective information with which to assess its merit or lack thereof. I do find it somewhat perplexing that this issue is clearly seen by some (many?) as fraught with political implications. Despite the Koestler view also being espoused by some with various anti-Israel political agendas, to a disinterested observer this is rather confusing, since, as the article accurately points out, it is decidedly un-pernicious either to the Jewish people or the cause of the State of Israel.</p>
<p>However -- and just FYI -- as a disinterested observer the discussion of this issue as it is currently written in the article seems about as POV as they come. In fact, in being so one-sided and rhetorically heavy-handed, the dismissal of the Koestler theory seems so facile that it actually comes across as somewhat suspicious. This is not particularly helped given your deletion of the material added by 172.129.70.39. That material seems relevant and, if as you point out, it does not contradict the debunking of Koestler, why was it necessary to be deleted? As for 172.129.70.39’s use of the word “tentatively”, I hardly think that is POV. Genetic mapping of global populations is still in its very early days, and there is indeed much that science does not know about the complex movement of human societies in pre-modern times. It may indeed be highly unlikely that “some later, better study will support the Khazar origin of Ashkenazim”, but to beg the question as you do is hardly scientific, is it?</p>
<p>In fact, I have to say that your deletion of this information seems like active suppression of information that you find unhelpful. Now, it may be the case that your position is correct, but doing it in such a heavy-handed fashion invites suspicion. The discussion of this issue as currently written is actually not very convincing, which is a shame. Instead, it reads as piece of bullying rife with logical fallacies. (Appeal to authority; ad hominem / guilt by association). Just FYI. Here’s a good compelling case that could have been made but wasn’t: assimilated peoples almost always carry linguistic traces from their area of geographic origin. If so, one would expect Yiddish to contain cognates of Turkic languages, but apparently (I’m not a Yiddish speaker so this is based on my informed understanding) it does not. This is compelling evidence that Ashkenazim are not primarily decendants of the Khazars. That’s a freebie, feel free to use it. Anyway, with all due respect, I really don’t have a dog in this fight and was simply looking for evidence one way or another. Good luck with the article, and aloha. <a href="../../../a/r/j/User%7EArjuna808_efa1.html" title="User:Arjuna808">Arjuna</a> 03:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your warning that I am about to violate the 3 reverts rule I have read it clearly.</p>
<p>However this rule apply on the people who cut my hard word edits which did not interfere with anybody's edits or cut from their edits. My edits are new addition to the subject and I worked hard to avoid original research, plagiarism, reverting or cutting other people work. If I would do I would cut Hal Lindsey, Parabiblical nonsense and many non referenced material.</p>
<p>some one probably you who is reverting my edits I reverted no body's edit other than their edit by reverting my edit to some one's else edit. Hence the warning goes to that person. I am going to complain to administrators for cutting my new referenced contributions whole sale after I worked hard on them. By the way I never cut any body's edit I just ADDED, The people who reverted my edits have no right of doing so.</p>

<p>Watt says no such thing regarding Nadir's payment to Arab tribes. The quote regarding his perspective is here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Montgomery Watt has drawn attention to the fact that the Banu 'l-Nadir, driven out of Medina, had taken refuge in khaybar and that their chieftains and the chieftains of other Jewish groups, eager for revenge, were intriguing against Muhammad along with the Arabs tribes of the neighbourhood. So Muhammad had not only a just motive for attacking them, but there was also the positive necessity to destroy these enemies, more formidable even than the Quraysh because of their adherence to their own religion, their intelligence and their superior culture.</p>

<p>Let's see, you removed: Balfour Declaration, Partition plan (part of our history), West Bank Barrier (I suppose it's there to cage in the albino population of Switzerland), Holy sites that are holy to Palestinians (Jerusalem Churches and Mosques, Church of the Nativity), <b>Palestinian</b> Christian, <b>Palestinian</b> Jew, Dabke (and who are more famous at it than the Palestinians?)</p>
<p>All that and more, and the reason for your wholesale edit was, unbelievably: "Not related to Palestinians".</p>
<p>Well, if you wish to be taken seriously, you should learn to edit responsibly. Taking out things like "Palestinian Christian" under the reason of "not related to Palestinians" is not a sign of responsible editing. Furthermore, I didn't make this template. But you cannot just come and remove things at random, <i>under outrageous pretexts</i>, and then come to my user page and tell me that I need to make the case for retaining them. I don't go around removing clearly relevant information from WP pages and then tell people to make the case for allowing them back. And if I ever do need to make the case of why <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Christian_32dd.html" title="Palestinian Christian">Palestinian Christian</a> or <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Nativity_a0fc.html" title="Church of the Nativity">Church of the Nativity</a> are related to <b>Palestinians</b>, that is an explanation I do not owe to you, as your irresponsible deletions do not reflect the level of seriousness in your editing that would warrant my needing to explain any of this blindingly obvious stuff to you.

<p>Do you mind not making false accusations about me in your edit summaries to articles that you don't add anything to? All you do is delete material, you hardly discuss and then you accuse me on POV pushing? Wow.</p>
<p>But I can see above that even Ramallite, the paragon of even-handedness, has called you out for you BS editing, which basically consists of delete, delete, delete. And so I guess I should proud of you calling my edits POV. It just means I'm doing my job in countering your sickening anti-Palestinian bias.

<p>I spent a lot of time yesterday converting a whole section from external links to reference links. I have a lot of other work to do also. Please have patience. We will merge what we can into <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>. There is too much to merge all of it.</p>
<p>The new name for the article takes away a big reason, I believe, why many people wanted to delete the article. Accusing Israel of war crimes is too much for many people. And inaccurate for the most part. I find the old title to be offensive. And such a title needs an article that meets very high standards.</p>
<p>That is no longer this article. This article is about alleged human rights violations, and it also must meet high standards for sourcing, etc.. I am working on it.

I grant you that if a <i>genuine</i> consensus is established and the result is that a no holds barred image of Muhammad is decided for display at the top of the article then I shall not further belabor the issue.

<p>Beit Or,</p>
<p>Arrow740 suggested you might be a good person to ask. There is four days left for final changes to the 2007 Wikipedia CD Selection. I am after a couple of people of different religious views to have a quick look through the relevant pages on Islam, Israel, Palestine etc. I have asked Aminz as well. I don't promise to make any changes but I will seriously consider it if you think some of the version adopted are POV.</p>
<p>The 2006 CD has an estimated circulation of over 50,000 so its worth getting as good as possible. The most recent viewable copy is at&#160;: <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/index/alpha.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/index/alpha.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Changes planned are listed at <a href="../../../2/0/0/Wikipedia%7E2006_Wikipedia_CD_Selection_e83c.html" title="Wikipedia:2006 Wikipedia CD Selection">Wikipedia:2006 Wikipedia CD Selection</a> in terms of (1) articles currently included to exclude (2)articles to add (3) articles to update because the version listed is vandalised (4) sections to exclude (mainly on appropriateness to children) (5) string deletes and spelling corrections (to UK English) (6) redirects of common article names to the main article. Navigation and search pages are being sorted separately. See especially: <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/m/Muhammad.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/m/Muhammad.htm" rel="nofollow">Muhammad</a>, <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/p/Palestinian_territories.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/p/Palestinian_territories.htm" rel="nofollow">Palestinian territories</a>, <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/w/West_Bank.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/w/West_Bank.htm" rel="nofollow">West Bank</a>, <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/i/Israel.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/i/Israel.htm" rel="nofollow">Israel</a>, <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/l/Lebanon.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/l/Lebanon.htm" rel="nofollow">Lebanon</a>, <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/j/Jew.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/j/Jew.htm" rel="nofollow">Jew</a>, <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/j/Judaism.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/j/Judaism.htm" rel="nofollow">Judaism</a>, <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/i/Islam.htm" class="external text" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/i/Islam.htm" rel="nofollow">Islam</a> and any shocking omissions?Please let me know of any issues if you see any.
