	    <p>--Who has a problem with the article on the town 'Beith' and please specify your complaints because the information i have donated to this article is accurate to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suspect it's about the claims of violence. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 15:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>--If that us indeed the case then I'd like to assure you that the information on this page is accurate as i live in beith and have studied the fairly short history of the gang and know that what i have stated are facts. I do not just take the time to make up stories and post them on the internet. If there are any other complaints please state them here. Thank you.</p>
<p>SDJK</p>
<p>Then it falls under the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> rule, and should be removed. (I live in Beith too, by the way) --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 21:11, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- My father works for the Starthclyde Police and has done research on the movements of the gangs in and around the area. The facts I have published indeed come from original research even though I was not the one to research them.</p>
<p>SDJK</p>
<ul>
<li>Bingo. That's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> for Wikipedia's purposes. It has to be a widely acknowledged and published fact about the subject to make it into the article. Take a look at <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> for more details. If you can find reputable sources giving the same information (official publications, newspaper reports etc.) please cite them and we'll be happy to keep it, but 'my dad says so' is not good enough. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 18:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>-- Look - do what you want. You want to edit that page and emit the facts I have published you go ahead and do that. You are indeed right in that I am unable to reference to any <a href="../../../p/u/b/Published.html" title="Published">published</a> articles on the topic. I'm a bit fed up, though, of being constantly questioned on the statements I have made in an effort to expand what before was just a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a> of an article on my town. So the ball's in your court.</p>
<p>SDJK</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you get into a mudslinging match, remember that it's <i>my</i> town <i>too</i>. I appreciate you trying to expand the article, but this is an encyclopedia. Small and correct is better than big and inaccurate. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 16:25, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>-- My information is not innaccurate it is merely thusfar unpublished. I do not intend to get into something as childish as a mudslinging match I merely mean to protect my right to put forward information I believe to be accurate. I would suggest the real problem here is your apparent inability to cope with the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undeniable.html" title="Undeniable">undeniable</a> fact that Beith, like most towns in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Ayrshire_4527.html" title="North Ayrshire">North Ayrshire</a> is a beautiful town with an occasionally violent underbelly. I hope you come to accept this fact soon and move on. By the way do you have a son also called Scott Wilson?</p>
<p>SDJK</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not saying it <i>is</i> inaccurate, but, since it has not been published, it is hard to verify it's accuracy. That's the whole point of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research rule</a>. I once again ask you to take a look at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> page. This argument's been had before, and that page deals with it far better than I can. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 12:32, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
--Then what on earth are you proposing? You keep refering me to that same page (which I have read, by the way) yet you offer no actual suggestion to what should be done about it. You obviously can't take my word that the information I have written is correct. This is either because you do not want others to come onto this site and read about the other, less attractive features of Beith - or you are simply an insatiable do-gooder who will not rest until you make me leave this site because you have nothing better to do. Unless you come up with either a proposition or a promise to leave me alone I see no reason for your constant nagging.</p>
<p>SDJK</p>
<ul>
<li>I am proposing, as I said above, that, under the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> rule, the paragraph on gang warfare (or a lot of it) should be removed until such time as sources can be found to demonstrate it's verifiability. The reason I haven't just gone and done this is to avoid a potential edit war with you; you've already reverted it once, so one must give you a chance to put forwards your reasons for supporting the inclusion of that section in the article. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 19:08, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>--You obviously have some kind of personal agenda going on here about debating anybody who(unknowingly) tarnishes the image of your perfect town. You are not going to rest until you have the information I have published removed and to be honest, I have a life, unlike you, and have better things to do with my time than debate you. However if you do happen to find yourself reaching towards the delete button after highlighting my passage, this will indeed start an editing war between us.</p>
<p>And don't forget - I know where you live.</p>
<p>Have a nice day</p>
<p>SDJK</p>
<ul>
<li>Skeil (or whatever you are this week), there really isn't any choice, thanks to the NOR rule. I'd be delighted if you could find a source for your assertions, allowing them to be included, but currently they cannot. Don't you think that every town has their own small gang? One could almost accuse you of having the opposite bias to me; being unswayable in your desire to increase the profile of BYC. Nonetheless, I don't think we're going to get much farther, so I'm calling for a <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">third opinion</a>. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Wilson_16a7.html" title="User:Scott Wilson">Scott Wilson</a> 18:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Judging by the town's website (linked from the article), it looks like there might be some more information on this soon, in the "Beith: The Darker Side" section. Until then, though, the information is not verifiable and should be removed. If and when more information is available, it could be re-inserted. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:32, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Is there still a Naval Armaments depot near Beith? <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDouglasnicol_6f3f.html" title="User:Douglasnicol">Douglasnicol</a> 18:10, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yup. Good idea. I'll mention it. --21:10, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
