<p>'Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics' is one of the longest real univeristy name in use of the world.</p>
<p>In 2002, the university board decide to change the English name of the university from 'Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics'(BUAA) to 'Beihang University'(BHU) for short, and the Chinese name as well. However, due to the strong objection from most of the alumni and students, the university board have to cancel this change and return to the old name of 'Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics'(BUAA).</p>
<p>The short period of two different names cause some confusions in China and overseas. Seems that although the old name of 'Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics'(BUAA) is obviously too long, graduates certainly do not want to take any risk for that change.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing_University_of_Aeronautics_and_Astronautics_545d.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Beihang was founded in October <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> as Beijing Aeronautics Institute (<i>Běijīng hángkōng xuéyuàn</i> 北京航空学院) and renamed in April 1988. The current president of Beihang is <a href="../../../l/%C7%90/_/L%C7%90_W%C3%A8i_0a83.html" title="Lǐ Wèi">Lǐ Wèi</a> 李未 (since 2002).</p>
<p>The meeting announcing the founding of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics (BIA) was held in the auditorium of Beijing Institute of Technology (formerly Zhongfa University ) on October 25, 1952. Faculty and students from the aeronautical departments in eight universities joined to lay the foundations for the new institute, whose chosen site was in Beiyanzhuang Village , Haidian District, in the western suburb of Beijing . Construction started on June 1 and over 60,000m2 of buildings were completed within 6 months. By October some of the faculty and students were able to start normal work and study. In the beginning there were only two departments with 4 majors: aeroplane design and aeroplane technology in the department of aeorplane engineering, and engine design, engine technology in the department of aeroplane engine engineering. In May 1988 the Institute changed to its present name of Beihang University .</p>
<p>BUAA was among the nation' s first 16 key universities back in the 1950' s, and among the top 15 for priority development during China' s 7 th five-year-plan period (1986-1990). During the 8 th five-year-plan it was listed among the top 14 for priority development, and at the start of the 9 th five-year-plan BUAA was among the first batch of 15 universities in “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_211" rel="nofollow">project 211 for Higher Education</a>.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of several generations of people, BUAA has grown to become an open, multi-disciplined, research-oriented university of engineering science and technology. The university now has 40 undergraduate majors, 65 master programs, and 36 second-level doctorate programs in 2nd level disciplines and 12 post-doctorate stations. In 10 disciplines of the 1st level, BUAA is authorized to confer doctor and master degrees. BUAA, as a center of both higher education and scientific research, has become one of the most important bases for high quality engineering education and scientific research in China .</p>

<p>Students in BUAA come from different provinces of China, so there are plenty of culture diversity and mixture of dialect in the campus. Students have chance to enlarge their network during their study.</p>
<p>There are various of student societies and activities to join. Students can find almost every sport societies after they enrolled. Student scientific and engineering innovation groups can have plenty of sponsorships from different entities. The famous annual competition of student scientific and technology innovation works held by the university called 'Feng-Ru' Cup attracts thousands of students every year.</p>
<p>However, the common concern of engineering universities also raises in BUAA -- the gender balance. In some serious engineering departments like the School of Jet Propulsion, School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Astronautics, famale student are so rare that it usually has the rate of 7 male to 1 famale student in an undergraduate class.</p>
