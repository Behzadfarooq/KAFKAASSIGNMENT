<dd>There's plenty of reasons to call what Israel did "state terrorism." This is fair to both sides, since effectively, both sides are "terrorists" because</dd>
<dd>they accept the death of non-militant civilians as a necessary sacrifice for their political aims. Israel's actions were most</dd>
<dd>likely meant to drive the point home that there will be heavy price for not only terrorists .. but non-terrorists as well. It was an act of sacrificing</dd>
<dd>innocent lives in order to scare people into submission.

<dd>It wasn't deliberate. If you'll check the facts you see that only one shell, out of 12 shot, hit the Palestinians.

<dd>According to the IDF none of the massacres it has commited throughout history was deliberate. You are mistaking fact for PR and taking one side's statements at face value.

<p>To MathKnight please read some articles...This is take from the Guardian:</p>
<p><b>"At least 19 Palestinians were killed and 40 wounded when FIVE ISRAELI SHELLS hit a row of houses in the northern Gaza town of Beit ber Hanoun this morning."</b></p>
<p><b>"A further FIVE OR SIX landed in the same vicinity over a period of 15 minutes, witnesses said."</b></p>
<p>It was definately at least 5-6 shells that landed in the same neighborhood district of Beit Hanoun, why on Earth and how on Earth the Israeli's targeted a village which is right on the Israeli border and has nothing to do with the Hamas rocket attacks is a mystery to me. They definately cannot hide behind their usual excuse of "Civilians caught in crossfire...etc..." for justifying civilian deaths anymore. As clearly there was no reason to even fire at this town. They were no militant activity at all in this town, in fact it again says on the Guardian the alleged "target", the IDF Artillery was supposed to fire at was at least 1 mile away from Beit Hanoun. I'd definately label it a massacre, it's the same as what happened in Qana, Shiyyah, Shatila, or the tons of other "incidents" of "accidental" civlian casualties. Israel's policy coudln't be anymore blatantly obvious; of targetting civlians deliberately to inflame and incite an uprising or counterattacks by Hamas or Hezbollah just so they can then justify even more extensive military operations.</p>
<p>Call it what it is, killing an innocennt family in their home with artillery? This is a massacre, better yet war-crime...</p>
<p>P.S. Oh SUPRISE, SUPRISE, MathKnight is an Israeli as well... please we don't need your pro-Zionist agenda in another Israel-related article, it is a massacre, like it or not the IDF has committed another massacre, please face the truth... 203.134.146.126 19:06, 8 November 2006 (UTC)Amir</p>

<dd>"Witnesses said" and we know how reliable Palestinian witnesses are (they blame the IDF with radioactive candy bars and "500 massacred in Jenin". The Guardian claim it was by "tank fire" which is absurd since no <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a> was around miles away. According to <a href="../../../h/a/a/Haaretz.html" title="Haaretz">Haaretz</a>: "The IDF confirmed that an artillery battery containing 12 shells had aimed at a site from where Qassam rockets were fired at the southern city Ashkelon on Tuesday. The artillery fire had been intended for a location about half a kilometer from the Beit Hanun houses. At this stage it is unclear whether the incident was caused by <b>a technical or human error</b>." There was no intention of massacre, and the incident was a mistake as the article indicates. Further more, Israel vowed regret over the incident (unlike Palestinian terrorists who declare publicly that their intention is to kill as many civilians as possible) Since you are seeking Zionist conspiracy in every corener ("<i>Israel's policy coudln't be anymore blatantly obvious; of targetting civlians deliberately to inflame and incite an uprising or counterattacks by Hamas or Hezbollah just so they can then justify even more extensive military operations.</i>") you won't be bothered by the truth.

<p>What about another name such as "killings" or "shelling"? If not I would prefer "massacre". There is no evidence that this was a rogue shell other than the IDF's statement. Why should they be automatically believed when Human Rights Watch and others have poured scorn on IDF internal investigations? An 'incident' is:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 A definite and separate occurrence; an event.</li>
<li>2 A usually minor event or condition that is subordinate to another.</li>
<li>3 Something contingent on or related to something else.</li>
<li>4 An occurrence or event that interrupts normal procedure or precipitates a crisis: an international incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>If 1, then it's a very bland/meaningless description (it might as well be "Something happened on 8th Nov...'). If 2 or 3 it's diminishing the significance of these deaths relative to other deaths in this conflict. If 4, I can't see this disrupting normal procedure... sadly it's perfectly normal at the moment.<a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPuddleman_1944.html" title="User:Puddleman">Puddleman</a> 03:07, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also prefer massacre. "incident" or "accidental killing" is quite funny. missing artillery couldn't go a mile away. It is widely called massacre (of course not in Israel) But i think we don't need "November 2006" things,</dd>

<p>Since your the IDF expert here MathKnight, please do explain how it was an accident and show some proof. "Massacre": The word massacre has a number of meanings, but most commonly refers to individual events of deliberate and direct mass killing, especially of noncombatant civilians or other innocents without any reasonable means of defense...</p>
<p>Since it is being established whether this was truly accidental or not doesn't matter, the way in which the unarmed civilians were killed, the location of the killing and the fact there was no link to any rocket-launching sites in Beit Hanoun which the IDF were supposedly after is reason enough to call this a massacre. All the other so called "accidental" attacks on civilians by Israel in the past are called massacres, Qana, Shatila, etc... why isn't this one?</p>
<p>The only person here who disagrees is MathKnight, and his judgement is quite questionable, since he's trying desperately to defend Israel's actions and IDF's motive. I think we should VOTE. 210.50.228.5 06:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)Amir</p>

<dd>And you said this as a qualified artillery officer? For BTVR shelling, about a mile off is a reasonable deviation range, a specialy if the coordinates were misfed or there was an error in the gun controls computer. One evidence that the incident was an accident is that only 1-2 shells hit and not the whole 12. Believe me, if the IDF wanted to massacre, he was shelling the town itself with more than 12 shells. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 12:33, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Btw, MathKnight it's <b>Ad Hominem</b>, not Ed Huminem, I don't think you properly understand what an Ad Hominem arguement is, since I am not using one. Must I again repeat myself? READ THIS ARTICLE&#160;: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1942339,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=12" class="external free" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1942339,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1942339,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=12</a></p>
<p>LOOK PLEASE:</p>
<p><b>"Witnesses said that the first shell hit a home, causing deaths and injuries."</b> "A further five or six shells landed in the same vicinity over a period of 15 minutes, witnesses said."</p>
<p>At least <b>5 shells</b> landed in Beit Hanoun, probably more, it was not 1 or 2 as you claim. Get the facts right please! Even CNN is reporting it as 6 shells.</p>
<p>Standard Deviation in modern artillery systems of something like a couple of hundred metres is ok. Israel uses the M109 Paladin as their main Artillery howitzers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m109a6.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m109a6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m109a6.htm</a>, the M109A6 Paladin which Israel uses can hit a tank-sized target 10km away within MOA of 200-375m, and standard spread of 20m. This means a shell fired will land somewhere within a 200-375m metre diameter circle around the target with a spacing between each subsequent shot of usually 20m.</p>
<p>Since the target of Beit Hanoun was engaged by Israeli Artillery only a few kilometres away across the Israeli border, the standard deviation from the actual target should have been under 100m easily. The only way an artillery barrage like this could end more than a mile from the intended target would have to be incorrect orders/instructions/coordinates, which I highly doubt. Either way, Israel's usual excuse would of "accidental fire" would hold, but because of the particularly large condemnation from EU, UN, Human Rights Watch, Red Cross and so on, and because of the nature of the attack, (an entire family being killed), I really think this deserves the title of massacre. It had no military merit whatsoever.</p>

<dd>"Incident" is not neutral. There must be a better term to use between 'incident' which has connotations of a 'random act of God' or something totally unexpected, which when an army fires shells in the vicinty of civilians deaths can not be, and 'massacre' which implies a deliberately perpetrated mass killing.

<dd>If the event was an isolated incident, maybe. But it wasn't, was it? Analogy: if you shoot me, and there was no prior engagement between us, it is a reasonable proposition for you to claim that an accident has occurred and a name like "ironduke/mdf shooting accident" would be assigned. But if we were neighbors, with a long, bitter, history between us, including violence, and you <b>then</b> shot me, I'd have to be a complete idiot to believe your after-the-fact apologetics "oh dear, an accident, sorry!". <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samson.html" title="Samson">Especially if these "accidents" appear to be a semi-regular feature of the relationship.</a> An accident is possible, but the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_inference.html" title="Bayesian inference">prior</a> virtually excludes it from the outset.

Personally, I feel a massive, overwhelming benefit of the doubt be given to the victims. They took the hit, they get the right to name the event. If it's an inappropriate name, let the shame be on their heads. If the people who are firing these guns don't like the names being assigned, maybe they can be more careful with their toys.

<p>Based on English Google, 'Massacre' outnumbers 'Incident' by a 1.6 margin. "Attack" is more common than either of those terms, and "Killing" is higher even. Incident seems like sugar-coating what the NPOV reality is in the English speaking world and press outside Wikipedia. Perhaps 'Killing' or 'Attack' is better?

<p>Eating your lunch can be an incident, walking your dog is an incident, and incident is any random occurence. ANYTHING could be called an incident, but we usually figure out better ways to describe things than call them "random occurences". If massacre is still too POV for some people, although I have to say in this case it would an appropriate title, what about Killing? Or even Shelling, ANYTHING that actually describes this event.</p>
<p>There could have been tons of "incidents" in Beit Hanoun in November, the November 2006 Incident is really too vague and unimaginative for a wikipedia artice. I suggest if people think massacre is too POV, then at least Shelling or Killing. Can't we just have a proper vote already and get this sorted, this is ridiculous, people have been arguing for days now. Come on just vote already.</p>

<p>Massacre is not NPOV, so let's forget about that. "incident" seems fine to me - it doesn't necessarily mean random, it certainly doesn't mean "Act of God", since there is no god. "Killing" seems ungrammatical. "Attack" implies intent, which can only be speculated about and is not NPOV. Doesn't anyone have a thesaurus? There must be loads of other words we could also argue about.</p>
<p>As for the person who wanted the whole thing deleted, nope - an encyclopaedia is the place for an article which answers the question "What happened at Beit Hanoun in November 2006?" That said, if this was one incident in the Shelling of November 2006, it should be a subsection of that article. I know you wikipedians are obsessed with the number of articles in the English Wiki, but don't artificially split stuff off just to add one more to the total.</p>
<p>If it is to stay separate, I agree with the above comment to come up with a naming standard for events like this. How about this - do a survey of the naming scheme of other wiki articles on other incidents and see how other less-contentious issues have been named, then go with that.</p>
<p>Or how about "Incident of XX November 2006" - that is, specify the exact date, to differentiate from incidents that didn't lead to a complaint to the UN and yet another US veto in the UNSC.</p>
<p>Oh, and for MathKnight, who said earlier "IDF knew there were women and children protecting militants - well, you admit the IDF targeted militants who used civilians as human shield. Hence, not a massacre." - I don't get this; if the IDF knew there were civilians being used as shields and they fired anyway, then that's a massacre AND a war crime.

<p><b>Massacre</b>. First of all, a massacre can be an accident, but it still a massacre if a large number of people died. Second of all, it is not POV to say that it was a massacre. The IDF knew there were civilians in the area and decided to take the risk anyway. I'm not saying that the IDF was wrong, I'm just strongly hinting at it and thinking it. Five or six shells hit the house according to most news agencies, including The Guardian, CNN, and Yahoo!, and that hardly seems like an accident to me. Still, whether it was an accident or not, it was not an "incident", which suggests some innocence. There was not innocence. It was known that there were civilians just as in any urban warfare, which means nothing about it was innocent because no war of any kind is, whether you're trying to save lives or take them. To call it an "incident" is not neutral. To call it a massacre is to call it what it was. It did not have to be deliberate—although there's no reason why it couldn't have been, since it will most likely end up being considered an act of self-defense by the tank gunner because a kid in the window was holding a rock—for it to be a massacre. The only requirement is that a lot of people were killed.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">What could they have expected to accomplish??</span></h3>
<p>Out of curiosity, what could Israel really have expected to accomplish? I mean seriously. Did they really expect to hit only "terrorists."? If this was sincerely their goal ... that they really thought they could eliminate individual terrorists with surgical precision .. .then fine .. it was an "accident" and not a "massacre." But what on earth could they possible have that would make them think they could hit only terrorists...that there would be minimum civilian casualities? Do they have terrorist seeking missiles? If you know for certain it's going to kill civilians .. and there's only possibilty it might kill a terrorist ... it is definitely a massacre, or what one might call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terrorism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terrorism" rel="nofollow">state terrorism</a>. You perform an action that has at least one guaranteed outcome ... civilians will die. You want to perform this action. So therefore, you purposely want to perform a specific action that has the guaranteed results of killing civilians. This is massacre. 18.211.0.105 18:35, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is a massacre. It was indiscriminate killing due to either EXTREME negligence (the rockets had been fired a day before, no intelligence stated that rockets were continuing to be fired) or simple malice.

<p>I guess I won't know when 1730 UTC is until I post this entry, but with all due respect, what the BBC and the Guardian call it isn't really relevant. Haaretz is referring to "Shelling of Beit Hanoun", so that would be more in line with the rules quoted by Puddleman above.</p>
<p>Google searches are also not really relevant, since I'm pretty sure Google is biased towards English language sources, and neither of the parties speak English as a first language.</p>

<li>I believe that there is now enough distance from the recent move war for me to put my $.02 worth in. Before I do so, I would like to emphasize that I'm saying this as an editor, not as an admin. My actions as an admin regarding this article have nothing to do with this message/vote. I feel that <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> (policy) trumps <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> (guideline). <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html#Consensus_vs._other_policies" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus#Consensus vs. other policies</a> would apply: "It is assumed that editors working toward consensus are pursuing a consensus that is consistent with Wikipedia's basic policies and principles - especially the neutral point of view (NPOV). At times, a group of editors may be able to, through persistence, numbers, and organization, overwhelm well-meaning editors and generate what appears to be support for a version of the article that is actually inaccurate, libelous, or not neutral, e.g. giving undue weight to a specific point of view. This is not a consensus." In other words, it is more important to be neutral than to do what the majority in this poll wants. As Tewfik has said, wikipedia is not a democracy. I also agree with what he said about incident and massacre. Either word would be our interpretation of what happened. Both versions need to be addressed in the article, but should be avoided in the title. I therefore suggest going with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_shelling_of_Beit_Hanoun_415c.html" title="Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun">Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun</a>. It has all the relevant facts in the title (Who? What? Where?) without passing a judgement. I think we can all agree that what happened was a shelling of Beit Hanoun. Whether that shelling constituted an incident or a massacre is the dispute.<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">Dancing</a> to electro-pop <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">like a robot</a> from 1984.</sup> 10:38, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are getting there. The next step is to realize that "shelling" is just as much a whitewash as "incident" is. The end-game is to realize there is no NPOV title of this article: anything that doesn't directly refer to the fact that 19 people were killed in their own homes will be challenged by one side as a lie of omission, and anything that does directly reference this fact will be challenged by the other as pernicious propaganda. The contents of the article are just as non-NPOVable, since it will simply be a "he says, she says" affair beyond the single sentence that describes what happened. As I expected back on Friday, this entire "discussion" is basically descending into the two factions sniping at each other, with no productive work being done. I'll re-state my advice:
<dl>
<dd>Delete the article as non-encyclopedic at this time. If no NPOV title can exist, then it's likely that neither can an article. Move it to wikinews and be done with it (no NPOV, no NOR, etc). Maybe all these rhetorical snipers will follow along.</dd>
<dd>If not possible, if a POV article must exist, then simply make up a naming scheme for sitations like this and apply it mercilessly across the board. I strongly suggest a bias towards the victims, but any bias will do. The point is to <b>state the bias</b> and declare the reasons why it exists (to wit: so people will use WP to create content, not to serve as yet another information battlefield).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Particularly, it needs to be clearly stated that if the "we just follow the mainstream media" approach is taken, that this does lead to a natural bias that is not intrinsically "neutral", and worse, tends to lean towards the position that is better represented in that forum. <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 20:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Muslim POV pushers? I dont know if anyone in this discussion is Muslim. Quite a few are Israeli. In any case it seems that only the occuppiers have a right to "self-defence" whereas those who are being occupied and getting killed (hundreds over the past months) must keep quiet lest they be branded terrorists or jihadists. Lets keep neutral. Israel killed around 1000 civilians last July in Lebanon. Maybe they were all "accidents" or "mistakes" in the language of the IDF, but when you bomb the hell out of a country you know civilians are going to get killed. The same goes for Palestine. Shelling heavily populated areas ammounts to a massacre as one can reasonably predict that there will be civilian casualties. In a court of law, murder requires intention to kill <i>or</i> moral certainty that death will result from our actions in the case of oblique intention. The same should apply to the IDF's operations. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 16:20, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am offended by your obvious bias; I condemn the death of innocents but recognize that they wouldn't have died if the Palestinian terrorist groups weren't playing games, claiming Hamas was in a "cease fire" while they lobbed missiles DELIBERATELY at civilian centers under an assumed name. I recognize that incidents like Palestinian national radio calling for civilian shields to protect terrorists from being captured, and trying to sneak them out under a group of burkha-clad women and then bitching when the women were wounded as the terrorists were found out, are rampant disregard of ALL portions of the Geneva Conventions by the terrorists who run the Palestinian society. And I absolutely am outraged anyone like you who has so little disregard for human life that you can blither on about only one side of this, while the terrorists blatantly ignore the Geneva Conventions even while their supporters like you bitch and moan every time the Israeli army, the most handcuffed army in the world, winds up hitting the civilians instead of the terrorists who were hiding in their basement. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 16:50, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is very complicated. 50 years of occupation does tend to breed hatred and terrorism. And this hatred is not restricted to Muslim Palestinians. Christian Palestinians feel pretty much the same way. I see that you <i>do</i> have strong feelings on the issue. Maybe Israel should just pull out of the occupied territories and just let these people live with dignity in their own land. It would make life easier for everyone. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 16:59, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yawn. You can't bother to thread your responses properly, and by "occupied territories" I presume you mean the ones listed on the Hamas flag, that exclude the existence of Israel at all? You're a real laugh riot. I have strong feelings anytime I see someone trying to justify using "civilians" as human shields to wage a genocidal war, just as I have strong feelings about any army that deliberately targets civilians (which is I will note NOT what the IDF does, but what Hamas, Hezbollah, and the rest of the terrorists do on a daily basis). <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 17:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't really judge any party to the conflict, but especially not the Palestinians.

<p><b>Support</b>: Incident is a euphemism for the shelling of a populated area and the killing of women and children in their sleep. It is borderline offensive. Massacre is the proper word in my opinion but I understand that wikipedia has to be careful with politically charged words.

<p><b>Support</b>: "Incident" is indeed a euphemism, and I do not see how the word "shelling" has POV connotations. "IDF shelling of Beit Hanoun" is EXACTLY what happened.

<li><b>Support</b> - Incident is neutral at the risk of being utterly meaningless, which is not the intent of NPOV. I think the term "massacre" or even "attack" is too emotionally charged to use for a current incident, even though that may well turn out to be what occurred. I'm generally in agreement with points made by Puddleman and Andri that "shelling" is NPOV enough - it explains exactly what happened, that shells were fired by somebody and fell on somebody else, without making a value judgement. Where possible we should be using factual terms. I also agree that something less cryptic to the random observer than IDF should be used (although Israeli Army may be technically incorrect if it was the air force, and many leftist Israelis may object to the generic "Israeli" - gotta love word value politics&#160;:|) <a href="../../../o/r/d/User%7EOrderinchaos78_0cc3.html" title="User:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orderinchaos78_01d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orderinchaos78">c</a>)</sup> 23:04, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article is about a clearly defined event, the shelling of Beit Hanoun by Israeli Defence Forces. The title should reflect this, propose move to 2006 Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun or similar.

"israeli shelling..." might be argued over on grounds that it wasn't the state/people of 'israel' who carried out the shelling. also it's already a re-direct &amp; would still be if the name change went thru. the point of this proposal is, as stated, to find a main title that isn't euphemistic. there can be any ammount of re-directs from other titles.&#160;<span style="background-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 11:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>RundedChozo. As I have pointed out, "incident" basically means, "something that happened", not a highly descriptive title. As for being 'deliberately neutral,' what do you mean? How does a word have intent? And can you accept that for the victims this would not appear to be a neutral description? 'Israeli/Israeli military shelling of Beit Hanoun' actually contains what happened, by whom and to whom. Much more descriptive and NPOV. Fair enough getting 'masszcre' removed from the options, but if you look at the list of [massacres] there are plenty that at the time the perpetrators denied being deliberate. <a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPuddleman_1944.html" title="User:Puddleman">Puddleman</a> 18:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Puddleman, to argue that words do not have emotional content is absurd. "Massacre" is an emotionally charged word, and the rest of the behavior by these POV pushers has been consistent: they are trying to make the article as biased against the IDF, Israel, and "Jews" as they possibly can. "Incident" indeed means "something that happened", and this article is about an <i>event</i> that happened <i>on a day</i> and <i>at a place</i>. That is what the title should be, nothing else. As neutral as possible. IF there should come to be a colloquial or agreed-upon phrase to describe the event, even if it is later disproven to have even happened (such as <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenin_Massacre_0020.html" title="Jenin Massacre">Jenin Massacre</a>) then, and <b>only</b> then, should we change the name, but it is ridiculous to stand by and let POV pushers try to make this into some emotional propaganda piece. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 19:12, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>RunedChozo, would you call the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth "The Westminster Abbey Incident," or the Munich Putsch "The Munich Incident"? These are both 'things that happened on a day at a place' but we commonly give them a name that gives more information.</dd>

<p>Sure, I have a political view on this conflict, as I hope you admit you do to, but I am trying really hard to remove that from the picture when I am arguing this - thinking in purely encyclopedic terms I believe that "incicent" is not an adequate description. Just to be a bit long-winded, but I think relevant... nNear where I live, there was in the 1860s a mass killing which for many years was known as 'The Wairau Massacre'. This was when some local Maori killed a group of colonists who were illegally surveying land which they wanted to buy and had tried to arrest the chief of the tribe. The Maori were shot at... some have said by accident, and they responded by killing almost the whole survey party. Sometime in the last twenty years, for reasons of historical revisionism, and for a cause that I wholeheartedly believe in, that of building good will and understanding between Maori and Pakeha in New Zealand, the name on the plaque where this happened was changed to 'Wairau Affray' and in many books to 'Wairau Incident'. Though I believe that the people who instigated this change were doing it for the best of reasons, I still am conviced that for true understanding that the original title would have been far better. So, my point is that euphemistic descriptions lead to false views of history. It is important to be truthful in descriptions so that people can have real understandings, and through facing reality, hopefully find ways to solve its problems. (There's my dose of idealism for the day&#160;;&gt;)<a href="../../../p/u/d/User%7EPuddleman_1944.html" title="User:Puddleman">Puddleman</a> 22:23, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not everything is about racism against Jews. People in my family died at the hands of Nazis. I still tend to agree with those who say that "incident" is pretty meaningless in an encyclopaedic context, and something else - albeit something factual - should be used.

<p>That would be POV since that it was "accidental" is contested. There is no more to it. Can some one please contact an administrator, make the move and we can just forget about it and stop wasting time?

<dd>Better idea: Can you stop being a POV pusher, stop trying to bias this article, and go away so that those who really want to make an NPOV, encyclopedic article can do so without your POV pushing causing us more problems? "Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun" is an attempt once again to make an article saying "ooh look what those evil Jews did", just like your POV fork that got deleted, and you know it. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 19:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - my view on this debate. In response to <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">Runed Chozo</a>'s objection:</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. If there is a particular common name for the event, it should be used even if it implies a controversial point of view.
<dl>
<dd>The incident isn't really major enough to have acquired a "common name" yet, but a quick test through Google News gives:
<dl>
<dd>about 1,970 for beit hanoun incident.</dd>
<dd>about 2,430 for beit hanoun shelling.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>which to me would seem to indicate the latter is the more commonly accepted name.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. If there is no common name for the event, and there is a generally accepted word used when identifying the event, the title should include the word even if it is a strong one such as "massacre" or "genocide" or "war crime". However, to keep article names short, avoid including more words than are necessary to identify the event. For example, the adjective "terrorist" is usually not needed.
<dl>
<dd>I propose that a) the year is unnecessary in the article title here since there are no other similarly titled articles to confuse it with and b) that "shelling" is a generally accepted word used to identify the event, as shown by the above Google News search.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. If there is no common name for the event and no generally accepted descriptive word, use a descriptive name that does not carry POV implications.
<dl>
<dd>In no way are the words "Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun" a violation of NPOV. There are no dispute over these facts: Israeli shells hit Beit Hanoun. Accidental or not, it was a shelling. If at some point it is proven that this was an accident I would then propose a further move to "Accidental Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun" or similar. This is far more descriptive than "Beit Hanoun incident".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've never gotten this involved over an article move before, however the complete lack of impartiality in this discussion has led me to try and put my view across. Thanks. <a href="../../../q/m/u/User%7EQmunkE_1841.html" title="User:QmunkE">QmunkE</a> 20:12, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As explained above, "Israeli shelling of Beit Hanoun" omits the fact that 19 people were basically killed in their own homes. That is to say, it is just another way of saying "Israeli caused incident at Beit Hanoun". You can try the other way, but then the Israeli's will object. The core problem is there is no NPOV title for this article, or articles of a similar form. No shades of gray, no calm transition from "wild POV X" to "wild POV Y", without doing an injustice to some side or another. It's a super-sharp <a href="../../../s/t/e/Step_function.html" title="Step function">step function</a>. The simple answer, if articles like this need to exist (I believe wikinews is a better forum) is to just invent some scheme and blindly stick to it no matter what. Push the interminable dispute into some other forum, away from the article itself. Almost any other option will will inevitably lead for the article being used as yet another propaganda battleground, and the firefight erupting with each event like this that takes place. <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 21:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why don't we just change the title to "OMG LOOK WHAT THOSE EVIL JEWS DID" and get it over with then? The point is to be encyclopedic, not to try to push every bit of emotional content that you can.<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 20:37, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
