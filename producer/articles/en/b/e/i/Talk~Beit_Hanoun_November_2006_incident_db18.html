<p>Someone keeps trying to reinsert a picture with a caption about "blood-stained water" on it. However, a quick look at the picture reveals that the coloration of the "water" seems merely to be a reflection of the buildings above it. Plus, there have been numerous scandals about pictures that are either altered or just miscaptioned for propaganda purposes recently. I don't trust this picture, the caption fails the smell test, and it is highly POV in any case. Please do not reinsert it. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 21:23, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even with citation, the summary is worthless. The red in the image is not possible as shown, unless it's just a reflection of the buildings behind it. If it were really the water that were red, the blue sky reflection on bottom right wouldn't be there. Also, the human body only has 6 quarts of blood; if you had 19 fully grown adults (not the case) and got every single last drop out of each of them (also impossible) and all of it got into that area (again impossible) then you have 114 quarts (28.5 gallons) of blood. That's not nearly enough to get that color of red; motion pictures use 100's of gallons of denser fake blood to try to get the same effect. The picture is either miscaptioned or altered, and is POV propaganda in any case. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 15:48, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My POV is very close to that having happened. However, in general the BBC is treated as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> and until we have reason to believe otherwise in this specific instance we should include it. In any event, I've already contacted people who know more/are active in these sorts of issues and asked them to look into it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:19, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found RunedChozo's (et al) original research more suspect than the image. It looks like a typical blood stain to me. Are there in fact any red buildings in the area? Looking at the unstained section of section of the water ("blue"), it appears that the colour of the buildings reflected is about the same as the background wall -- which is what I would expect. For the stained section of the water: if in fact reflected from a background the geometry of the image basically says the source wall must be the visible wall <b>which is clearly not red</b>. Simple physics, but of course for propaganda purposes, physics is not relevant, right? Anyways, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/11/08/israeli-shelling.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/11/08/israeli-shelling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/11/08/israeli-shelling.html</a> has a close-up of what appears to be the same scene. Whether or not the image is an artifact of some propaganda machine, I can continue my refrain from above here, as it seems relevant at this point: if it can be demonstrated that an article is being used as a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" title="WP:NOT">propaganda battlefield</a>, is Wikipedia the appropriate forum for it? <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 13:21, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>you obviously know shit-nothing about physics, if the buildings were colored red by red in the water, the sky reflection wouldn't be so blue, it'd have tinted purple. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.7.35.126_6543.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.7.35.126">129.7.35.126</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.7.35.126.html" title="User talk:129.7.35.126">talk</a>)</small> your second image is bullshit too, looks like ordinary muddy water.

<dd>Yes, which is why I concluded that part of the water has not been heavily stained (for whatever reason) and could then see the buildings are not in themselves particularly red. Did you read what I wrote? As for your "muddy water" argument, people can compare that image with the one at <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419038,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419038,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419038,00.html</a>. Note the purple "sky" in each is the same, as is the red (except for luminosity -- in the the der Spiegel image, the pool is directly lit by the Sun, while the Beit Hanoun pool is in shade). I can also suggest you try and get around more in life, as pools of blood and water are not all that uncommon. I've seen many beside car accidents -- can you guess one reason why the fire department is typically dispatched to these events, even when there is no fire? -- and all images I've seen here are consistent with this experience. <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 14:42, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's quite a stretch for the water to be perfectly blue (instead of the purple seen in your other photo) even in the reflection of a gap in the building, while the building in question somehow manages to remain red <b>beyond</b> that gap.

<p>From <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>: <i>Just as giving undue weight to a viewpoint is not neutral, so is giving undue weight to other verifiable and sourced statements. An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.</i> The picture the POV-pushers keep trying to insert is pushing undue weight for only one side. It adds no information on location, damage to buildings, or anything else. All it does is push emotional content. This is directly contradictory to the NPOV policy. This is ALSO why I have so much problem with what Mdf and his fellow POV-pushers are doing, as their now-deleted POV fork was based on the same attack, and much of that content they have now dropped into here, while removing items related to the Israeli side and neutral international documents on the matter.<a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 19:00, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You quote policy, but fail to understand it. Allow me to highlight the part that permits this image: "An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a <b>weight appropriate to its significance to the subject.</b>" Now in the instant article, we have 19 dead people who otherwise would not be dead. We have an eye-witness report in the article about human body parts strewn willy-nilly. Therefore, an image of this environment would not given "undue weight" "inappropriate" to this particular aspect of the subject. It is for this reason why infinitely more explicit images of fields of dead bodies are permitted in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a>, and other articles. Once again, I suggest you look to attacking the source, not the message or messenger. Life is ever so much simpler if you just follow policy. <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 19:51, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I quote policy, but you appear to lack the capacity to understand same. In this instance, we have a military war going on, and we have a case where errant shots were fired. All the picture is designed to do is increase the emotionality of the report, it does not offer any better information than we have if we did not have the picture. Therefore, the picture violates NPOV and you are wrong. But, since you are in bad faith desperately pushing POV here, I do not expect you to ever concede such. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunedChozo_b781.html" title="User:RunedChozo">RunedChozo</a> 19:53, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a suggestion, would it be a good idea to have a sub heading as suggested above? It could come after the incident and before reactions and include such information as the Geneva Convention article and the previous rocket attack.

<dd>Sorry, but the Fourth Geneve Convention Part 3 Sec. 1 Art. 28 is not relevant in this case. The Palestinians did not put the civilians in shelled areas on purpose. They lived there before the area was shelled, SO the Palestinian Authority did not act in Bad Faith with Art. 28. This is off course only true if Israel did not purposfully bombard the area. If they attacked the houses and civilian areas on purpose, then the Civilians would have to be evacuated. So, that is why the Geneve Convention does not apply to this incident. However, when Civilians where used as human shields (recall the incident with the mosque), there is no discussion, that this is a clear violation of Art. 28. So yes, the article should be expanded, but no the Geneve Convention does not apply in this case!81.5.2.197 06:24, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is interesting. However, as observed in the above list "The criteria used for this list: deliberate attacks against civillians in which ten people or more have been killed" that's very different than attacks which incidentally have accidentally killed civilians.

As for the "accidental shelling" of Qana in 1996, all independent investigations (UN, Amnesty international) reject Israeli claims that the deaths were accidental. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 21:13, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The trouble here is that the Israeli government is pretty much united when commenting on an "incident". That, along with their grip on many media, makes their standpoint more resonant and credible. Also, Israel only acknowledges actions which are undeniable. Anyone remember the Gaza beach in June 2006? The IDF still maintains it wasn't them despite evidence pointing in their way. Interestingly, the Wikipedia entry about it is called "Gaza beach blast". <a href="../../../l/i/x/User%7ELixy_c530.html" title="User:Lixy">Lixy</a> 11:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can assure you that I argue in good faith here and have absolutely no desire to spread around lies as you seem to imply. Now, I have no evidence about the "grip on many media" part, but I do have plenty circumstancial evidence on a media bias in favor of the Israelis. Consider for example how much attention/space/time is given/allocated when an Israeli soldier is captured and contrast it with the coverage of a Palestinian citizen getting kidnapped. Chances are the latter won't even be covered. Is the bias a consequence of the self-censorship all foreign reporters in Israel are practicing because of the military censorship laws? Maybe. The bottom line is still that there POV prevails.</dd>
<dd>Of course, the influence of the Jewish lobby in Washington has been established by now (there are a couple of academic papers on the issue if you're interested) and that alone could be considered enough leverage to bully some media. The Israeli PR campaign to influence the American media in their favor is hardly ever reported in the mainstream.

<dd>Ok, two problems with that. First, I'd like to see a source that UN rejected the Israeli statement that the deaths were accidental. Second, even if the UN did it is still different because some signficant group is still claiming that the deaths were not deliberate. In any event, I'd agree that massacre has POV issues. IMO, it makes more sense to remove the word from all articles than to argue about whether or not this one should have it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:18, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That would be impossible. There are rules about how to call articles which should be followed. For example the Boston massacre cannot be changed to the Boston incident. However I feel that these rules are being applied differently regarding massacres of Palestinians and of Israelis. The reason is that there are more persistent hard-core pro-israelis on wikipedia (like User:Amoruso for example) than hardcore pro-palestinians. I dont know why this is, but wikipedia rules on naming these types of incidents should be applied consistently.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgas00_25ab.html" title="User:Burgas00">Burgas00</a> 21:22, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If anyone's more organized, it's you and your friends, Burgas. To try to claim that there are "persistent hard-core pro-israelis" somehow POVing the entire site when it's obvious the bias thanks to you and your crew runs in the opposite direction, is dishonest at best. 70.114.236.109 07:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, ok. Does anyone no if there is any actual policy or guideline on the use of the word?

<p>The POV pushers on the muslim side want a few things. First, they want to keep a highly emotional and not at all relevant, not to mention major copyright violation, image on the page to prejudice readers.</p>
<p>Second, they want to ensure that only material negatively slanted to the Israeli side exists in the article. Thus even in discussion of the events surrounding this <b>incident</b>, they refuse to allow quotations from the actual Israeli military, refuse to allow quotation of relevant Geneva Conventions passages, refuse to allow notation that the area of Beit Hanoun was used for launching deadly missile strikes by terrorists both before and after the <b>incident</b>, and yet they insist that a quotation from a small and barely notable leftist group within Israel be given prominence in the listing of "reaction." They also are on the standard POV pusher tactic of trying to destroy - literally, get banned - anyone who disagrees with their POV pushing ways.

<p>How about a map that shows where the shells hit, where the Qassam rockets were coming from, and the surrounding area of Beit Hanoun? That would be NPOV and yet give readers a better sense of what happened. The only problem is legally getting a hold of a map.</p>

However, regardless of whether the images <i>could</i> be used as fair use, it seemed as there was somewhat of a consensus here that the images are not neutral and are quite irrelevant (blood flowing in the streets??).

<dd>I strongly dissagree and are going to start a fomal proces if the images are reverted. The images are visual representation of the consequesnes of the shelling and a visaul representation of the reactions. This can not be refuted. The simple <i>fact</i> that the images come from RS mainstream media (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6127250.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6127250.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1942339,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=12" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1942339,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=12" rel="nofollow">Guardian</a>) proves that the images are both notable and relevant to this very issue.

<dd>Striver, in the future, it would be nice if you would let interested editors know that a DRV was taking place (say a note on this page). I'm still very puzzled at least for the AP photo how a photo can be fair use when it is something which the AP specifically liscences to media to use. As for your other claim, other editors including Tariqabjotu who is uninvolved seem to disagree with you. And no, the mere presence in other media does not make them automatically NPOV to have them there. I could probably find in the media a few other images of the incident that were as graphic or more so and add them to the article under the same logic. That wouldn't make that NPOV. Can you articulate what having both photos accomplishes? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:08, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It gives a visual representation of the reactions of the shelling.</li>

<p>Any more questions? Any dissagrements? Are the pictures unfactual? If pov, whos point of view is it? Would an Isreali camera had capture another picture given the same location and time`?

<dd>Maybe you didn't understand my question- the inquiry was what is accomplised by having both pictures? As to your second point, there are accurate pictures all the time that would make an article POV. If for example, on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> we had two pictures of the firebombing of Tokyo and nothing else that would be a serious POV issue. Pictures naturally pull at emotions and as such an emphasis on a specific type of picture can have serious POV concerns. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:28, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sure, but the comparison is not adequate. WW2 is a encompases huge space and time, this event is very limited in both, so while a single picture in WW2 might only encompase a small portion of the event, a picture here encompses a much large portion of that event. I mean, one town, one day, how many pictures do you want? Would a picture of every corner of the house be more NPOV?

<p>Sensationalism is not necessarily presenting false information so much as presenting information selectively to give undue weight to certain aspects of a story.

<dd>I don't feel either image to be particularly informative in this article, however leaving an image of "mourners" in over a bloodstained street seems nonsensical to me - surely there is more bias showing the emotional state of a group of involved parties than the physical effect of the attack? I think it's fairly obvious people would be grieving for their relatives, I don't think it's appropriate for their grief to be a battleground over "POV" issues. Also, I agree that it would have been polite for Striver to bring to the notice of this page's editors the DRV on the image, and I think that there was not enough discussion for the decision to be overturned - this is clearly a controversial topic the history of which the closing administrator should have researched on this talk page. <a href="../../../q/m/u/User%7EQmunkE_1841.html" title="User:QmunkE">QmunkE</a> 17:46, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have repeatedly insinuated that we do not believe the pictures are factual. That is a strawman. The fact remains that given an ongoing conflict such as the issue of Palestinian sovereignty, with two active viewpoints each having international support, we cannot compare this situation to a historical event where all the meaningful debates have already been had.

<li>The main concerns of editors not favoring the inclusion of both pictures is that a) they have very weak fair use claims and it is nearly impossible to argue that somehow there is a legimimate fair use claim for both of them. b) having the pictures here (and certainly having both pictures) runs afoul of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> by pulling on heartstrings and heavily emphasizing the Palestinian casulties. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 22:31, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Look closely at the red water it is only red where the buildings are reflecting. Distributing of real flowing blood would be independent of the reflectiing. Either a natural illusion or a photoshop on magic wand selected area of building reflecting.</li>
<li>Why is there water? Does water normally flow down Gaza streets or maybe the IDF shells filled with water? None of the links say anything about the water! Which would be worth of reporting. Quote is saying 'We saw legs, we saw heads, we saw hands scattered in the street' anything like that here? Should be we saw them FLOATING DOWN the street!</li>
<li>Is there any evidence of the shelling in the pic? Look at what the people are doing is it indicate anything about the story? or is there ANY reason for us believing it was taken at the scene?</li>
<li>Pic is not credited to a photographer and caption isnt credited. Even story isnt credited meaning BBC bought it. Unlike the respectable newspaper BBC doesnt credit its sources.<a href="../../../o/p/i/User%7EOpiner_8286.html" title="User:Opiner">Opiner</a> 09:15, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As to the colouring of the water, I can't comment, but saying "it looks photoshopped" isn't a valid objection, it's original research.

<li>For the water in the street: there might be water from many sources (broken pipes, runoff from attempts to put out fires).</li>
<li>Okay, the picture doesn't show the shell damage explicitly as far as I can see, unless the stuff floating in the water is detritus from the destruction of buildings. This isn't shown in the caption for the image on the original article and so cannot be ascertained at this time.</li>
<li>The picture is from <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agence_France-Presse_c913.html" title="Agence France-Presse">Agence France-Presse</a>, a reputable news agency. I agree it should be mentioned somewhere as the original source of the image.

<p>Beit Or, I think you should reflect on the moral implications of your editing of this article. Palestinians are also human beings.

<dd>I would urge calm from everyone on this topic. Calling other editors well-informed opinions "attempts to twist reality" is neither productive nor civil. As for the quote about arms and legs everywhere, I note that in articles we have about some of the major suicide bombings such <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover_massacre.html" title="Passover massacre">Passover massacre</a> we don't have pictures of blood and we don't describe there being arms and legs everywhere (although a quick google source easily gives enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>-compliant stuff which makes similar claims). I'm not trying to make this an us v. them sort of thing but its useful to change the context sometimes and ask if we would put in the corresponding article. When the answer is obviously "no" that should tell us something about this one. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:31, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Im sorry but claiming that pictures of blood on the street is the "reflection of red buildings" is an attempt to twist reality.

<dd>A bit of AGF might be in order. First, the building in question is red. Second, the people who were of that opinion expressed there reasoning above.

I'm still not convinced we have a decent fair use rational for either picture. But be that as it may, I would suggest the following compromise: include the street picture and not the morgue picture and give the street picture a caption that says something like "according to the BBC, the red coloring is due to blood in the water" <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I value that you are interested in a compromise, really, but i feel that i have a very strong case for including both pictures and unedited &amp; unqualified BBC text, and i rather continue the dispute resolution. Lets see what the mediation cabal request ends in. Basically, there is no RS disputing the BBS claim of it being blood, so i see no reason to qualify it, and as i have argued before, i view it as censorship to not include both pictures, arguing that both are informative and that there is ample precedence in other articles in support of including this kind of pictures. I dissmiss the FU dispute as nothing more than a diversion that has no merits.

<dd>Right Rosicrucian itd be the original research to put the pic in the article and THEN write the cap 'the red color here doesnt come from blood.' Its NOT original research like the policy is saying to decide what to trust and include and why. If you take that definition then everything were doing is the original research. Striver is saying pic should be included because other articles have holocaust pics. Thats strivers original research and now hes using it to decide what should be in the article?

<dd>I can't say I've seen any original research from Striver. Maybe you should read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">the policy</a>. Personally, the caption can stand as sourced as it meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> failing any particular controversy over that given photo. Whether the photo is fair use in this context, and whether it is being used to bias the article, are the issues I feel we should discuss. That we keep getting away from this to irrelevant issues is part of why we're not making progress. So I'll put a finer point on it. Unless <b>you</b> have a reliable source that the caption on the photo is not accurate, we must go with the only other cite we have for it. Otherwise, we cannot really speculate as to the nature of what is depicted. I have argued against the inclusion of the pictures, but the nit you've chosen to pick seems to me to be a waste of time.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 01:50, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

Maybe you should read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">the policy</a>. Its the original research to say the cap fake IN the article or to put our own cap saying the red isnt blood IN the article. Its NOT original research to notice its fake on the discussing page and decide not to include it. Policy in a nutshell saying 'Articles may not contain any unpublished arguments, ideas, data, or theories; or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published arguments, ideas, data, or theories that serves to advance a position.'<a href="../../../o/p/i/User%7EOpiner_8286.html" title="User:Opiner">Opiner</a> 02:00, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but you can't just hop onto a 9/11 talkpage and say "I've done the math and theory X on the WTC is wrong." Reliable source answers reliable source, and original research can't be used to argue against inclusion because it is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. So unless you have a reputable source saying that the picture does not show blood, you are merely theorizing. As I said, it's not relevant to the argument as a whole. It's a red herring.

<dd>The caption <i>was</i> cited anyway - and therefore this compromise is not actually changing the attributation of the quote - it's just moving it into the article text, where it doesn't belong. If we include the line you suggest, it would imply that the provenance of the image is in doubt. I'd be more willing to accept this interpretation if I had some evidence which either throws the BBC's reliability into doubt (actual examples please) or which interprets the picture as something else (again, a reliable source please).

<dd>joshuaz, you have already been asked to substantiate your claims about bbc bias, &amp; you have refused to do so. as pointed out, you're going to need something a little stronger than your opinion. also, if it is only a matter of <i>mistakes</i> your claims are irrelevant, mistakes will always be made no matter how thoroughly these things are checked. you're going to have to establish acctual bias if you want to rule out a source full stop. (also the bbc has a <i>very good</i> reputation on this score, and <i>obviously</i> the source will be on the image page). &#160;<span style="b[ackground-color: #000000">&#160;<font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a>&#160;</span> 15:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think we should censor these picture from wikipedia. We have many potentially offensive pictures on wiki, and this should be no exception. These pictures also only (visually) describe the incident and in no way promote one POV. They are photgraphed by BBC reporters not HAMAS. If, however, these pics don't meet the "Fair Use" criteria, then, ofcourse, they should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 01:18, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These pictures aren't "reported by BBC" they're AFP which is as far as I'm concerned a Hamas front group, likely pictures bought from Hamas-allied "stringers."

<dd>RunedChozo, the decision to close the mediation was not a "threat" - please desist from trying to re-ignite the bickering which has plagued this talk page. Also, nobody has been active on this issue for almost a month. Personally I can't understand why it was even taken to the Mediation Cabal, <s>which isn't an official step in the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution process</a>, and can't enforce any binding decisions</s> okay, it's listed but it's hardly suitable for this issue. If the issue required mediation that badly it should have been taken down the official channels. <a href="../../../q/m/u/User%7EQmunkE_1841.html" title="User:QmunkE">QmunkE</a> 16:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
