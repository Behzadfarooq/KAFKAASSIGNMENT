<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p><i>Being There</i> depicts the story of a gardener named <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauncey_Gardiner_ecea.html" title="Chauncey Gardiner">Chance</a> (Sellers) who grows up in the townhouse of a wealthy man in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. For reasons that remain unexplained (beyond the implication that he is a simpleton), Chance has had virtually no contact with the outside world and no social interaction for his entire life. Apart from his limited relationship with Louise the maid (Ruth Attaway), Chance's cultural and social education is derived entirely from what he watches on the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television sets</a> provided by his employer.</p>
<p>When his benefactor dies, Chance, now middle-aged, is forced to leave his sheltered existence in the house and discover the world outside for the first time. He wanders around wintry Washington dressed in clothes that are thirty years out of fashion and carrying a suitcase and umbrella. Some of the rougher people he meets look upon him as either odd or trying to provoke trouble (which is furthest from his mind).</p>
<p>After being adventitiously struck by the vehicle of a wealthy and powerful businessman named Ben Rand (Douglas), he is invited into their home to recover from his broken leg. Coughing over a strong drink, Chance's name is interpreted as "Chauncey Gardiner" rather than "Chance the gardener", which is what he said. Rand and his wife Eve (MacLaine) believe that Chance is a businessman who has gone bust and take him under their wing. His simplistic, indeliberate utterances, that mostly concern the garden of which he was once steward, are interpreted as allegorical statements of deep wisdom.</p>

<p>Rand, a dying man, is also the confidant and adviser of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">US President</a> (Warden), whom Chance has "seen on TV". In their meeting, Chance's remarks about how the garden changes with the seasons are interpreted by the President for economic and political advice. He makes similar quotes in a TV speech and as a result Chance quickly rises to national public prominence.</p>
<p>"Chauncey Gardiner"'s appeal is increased by the fact that nobody seems to know who he is or where he comes from. Neither the press nor the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Service_f791.html" title="Secret Service">Secret Service</a> can find information on him. Even the heads of the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> and <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> argue if he is a former agent of each others' organization.</p>
<p>Only Rand's doctor (Dysart) sees Chance for what he is: a simple-minded gardener. However, the fact that the man has given his patient an apparent acceptance of his illness and peace with his imminent death makes him hesitant in revealing this. Rand himself encourages his wife to get close to Chance.</p>
<p>Rand dies and the President gives a long-winded read-out of his quotes at the funeral. The <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pallbearer.html" title="Pallbearer">pallbearers</a>, members of the board of Rand's companies, hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President for the next term of office. As Rand's coffin is about to be added to his family's <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid.html" title="Pyramid">pyramid</a>-like <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mausoleum.html" title="Mausoleum">mausoleum</a> they finally agree on "Chauncey Gardiner".</p>
<p>Oblivious to all this, Chance wanders through Rand's wintry estate. Ever the gardener, he straightens out a bush and then walks off across a small lake, seemingly on the water's surface.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/i/Being_There_8e19.html" title="Edit section: How the Main Characters See &quot;Chance&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How the Main Characters See "Chance"</span></h2>
<p>The way each main character sees Chance says a little about Chance and a lot about themselves.</p>
<p><b>Ben Rand</b>, the dying business leader and political king-maker, gains a perception of Chauncey as a failed though totally decent businessman down on his luck. And he sees Chauncey's reference to seasons in gardening as an insightful comment about the national economy.</p>
<p><b>Eve Rand</b> (Ben's wife) is at first puzzled by Chauncey's strangeness and then thinks of him as having insight and a sense of humor. Later she sinks her own initial doubts and adopts the consensus view that he is a great man. She then pursues her own need for friendship and sexual contact, especially when her dying husband signals his assent to her forming a relationship with Chauncey.</p>
<p><b>The President</b> initially sees Chauncey's "advice" as inspiring to the point that he quotes and names him on national TV. But he soon comes to regret bringing this mystery man into the spotlight since it might jeopardise his chances of running for a second term.</p>
<p><b>The CIA</b>, astounded by their inability to discover any records of a Chauncey Gardiner, come to the conclusion that someone has eliminated the entire record - a feat of such ability that "only a CIA man could have done it!" <b>The FBI</b> prefer to think that the cover-up was done by one of their own, highlighting the rivalry between the two organizations.</p>
<p><b>Thomas Franklin,</b> the lawyer, distrusts Chance's motives for acting the way he does when they first meet. Later the lawyer, keen to make a career in politics, seems to view his contact with Chauncey Gardiner as potentially ruinous to his career.</p>
<p><b>Louise</b>, the maid, sees Chance, whom she has known since he was a boy, on national TV, and declares out loud that he only has "rice pudding between the ears". It confirms her opinion that America is certainly a "white man's world".</p>
<p><b>The general public</b>, as portrayed by the audience in the TV studio, opinion polls and the lawyer's girlfriend, thinks that Chauncey is "brilliant".</p>
<p><b>The political elite</b>, seen at Rand's funeral, believe that Gardiner may be their man for the next presidential election instead of a second term for the current President.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Robert Allenby,</b> the good-hearted doctor, initially worries that Chauncey will sue Rand for damages following the accident. Later he comes to understand the truth about Chauncey but chooses to hush it up.</p>
<p><a name="Memorable_scenes" id="Memorable_scenes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/i/Being_There_8e19.html" title="Edit section: Memorable scenes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Memorable scenes</span></h2>
<p>Memorable scenes in the film version include Chance being confronted early on by a street gang. He pulls out his TV remote control as though to change the vision before his eyes. A lifetime of watching TV has not prepared him for the realities of real-life. He is surprised when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>In Eve Rand's limousine, Chance asks to watch TV, to which he pays more attention than the luxurious vehicle around him or the woman he has just met. Chance watches the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheech_and_Chong_b5c0.html" title="Cheech and Chong">Cheech and Chong</a> short film <i><a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_Jones_30c2.html" title="Basketball Jones">Basketball Jones</a></i> in Eve's limo, and the song continues to play when he arrives at the Rand estate and is brought into their mansion.</p>
<p>Leaving the house he has lived in all his life to enter into the poor black Washington, D.C. neighborhood he has never explored, the scene is musically set to a funked-up version of "<a href="../../../a/l/s/Also_Sprach_Zarathustra_31dc.html" title="Also Sprach Zarathustra">Also Sprach Zarathustra</a>", the music popularized in <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29_dbd6.html" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i> and an accompaniment to many TV programs regarding space exploration.</p>
<p>MacLaine's character writhing in long-suppressed sexual pleasure on a bear rug while Chance obliviously channel-surfs and tries to mimic a yoga program by standing on his head.</p>
<p>The second to last scene has generated discussion and controversy. Before Ben dies, he says, "Tell Eve that...", and he dies in the middle of the sentence. The doctor puts Ben's hand to his chest. Chance then puts his hand on Ben's forehead as if reviving him. When he takes his hand off Ben's forehead, he speaks with the doctor, and then, leaves the room. As Chance is leaving the room, the doctor, blurred, is watching him with his back facing the screen. Someone (the doctor or Rand) then says, "I understand." The doctor turning around to look at the dead Ben, then says, "I understand?"</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/i/Being_There_8e19.html" title="Edit section: The Lake Scene">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Lake Scene</span></h3>
<p>In the final scene, Chance is seen apparently walking across the surface of a lake while the most important movers and shakers in the USA discuss running him for President. This scene continues to generate discussion and controversy. Clearly we see Chance walking on water, an act with a clear <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical.html" title="Biblical">Biblical</a> reference. It is as though the director is pushing our own sense of seeing what we see or what we want to see. Are we prepared just to see the same view that others are seeing, or are we prepared to go beyond that. Is there a prosaic explanation, such as hidden stepping-stones? Or is Chance the <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savior.html" title="Savior">Savior</a> (as so many of the characters are looking for)? Does he truly possess some special <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace.html" title="Grace">grace</a>, given his simple innocence and simply being present to each moment without filters and ideas? In his 2001 book <i>The Great Movies</i>, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> argues for the latter interpretation. Another view is that the director (and the author) are simply asking the audience: "How much more would you have believed? We've been kidding you all along you know!"</p>
<p><a name="Bloopers_and_continuity_errors" id="Bloopers_and_continuity_errors"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/i/Being_There_8e19.html" title="Edit section: Bloopers and continuity errors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bloopers and continuity errors</span></h3>
<p>While the credits are rolling the viewers get to see some bloopers from a scene in the movie: Sellers, lying on an operating bed, tries in vain to quote inner-city slang and swearwords with as straight a face as possible and ends up chuckling instead. The audience gets to see Peter Sellers "out of character" — the opposite of how his character has been portrayed. Outtakes like these being shown in a major Hollywood production were very rare.</p>
<p>IMDb reports two continuity errors in the film. The napkin tucked into Chance's neck moves around from shot to shot, and while at dinner for the first evening with Ben and Eve, Chauncey's wine glass fills and empties within seconds. There is another they have omitted. When Chance first meets Ben they are in the part of the home deemed the hospital. As Ben tells Chance about his aplastic anemia and Chance prepares for x-rays the camera cuts repeatedly from one to the other. As it does, the nurses who are taking care of Ben during his transfusion repeatedly disappear and reappear.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/i/Being_There_8e19.html" title="Edit section: Sellers' view">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sellers' view</span></h2>
<p>This was Peter Sellers' penultimate film (his next and the last one being <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fiendish_Plot_of_Dr._Fu_Manchu_6ade.html" title="The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu">The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu</a></i>).</p>
<p>It is said to be the one film about which he was truly passionate since it was an opportunity to showcase his skills as an actor as opposed to being a comedian. Up till now almost all of his films had been straight or <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_comedy.html" title="Black comedy">black comedies</a>.</p>
<p>Reputedly, he pulled out all the stops to gain the role for himself after reading the book.</p>

<p>The film makes continued use of actual television clips throughout. These clips are part of the ambient visual and audio background, presented as a natural occurrence of a television being on in the room where the scene is taking place. The clips were chosen by Dianne Schroeder, and are referenced in the film credits as "Special Television Effects."</p>
<p>These clips are an essential element of the film. They provide a window into the mind of Chance, who knows nothing of the world outside the old man's home except from what he's learned on television.</p>
