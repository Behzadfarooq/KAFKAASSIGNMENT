<dd><b>History</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Established in 1946, Beijing No. 101 Middle School is the only middle school founded in old liberated area by the Chinese Communist Party and later moved to Beijing. In 1955, Mr. Guomoruo gave the name Beijing No. 101 Middle School with the meaning “Make still further progress”.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a school with glorious revolutionary tradition, it has been getting constant attention from leaders of the Party and state for nearly 60 years since its establishment. In 1953, Premier Zhou Enlai came to visit the school and made important instructions on preventing privileges for cadres’ children and training successors to the cause of revolution. He told the students: “You are the descendents of the proletariat and shall not become “children of the Eight Banners” (from “Educational Selections from Zhou Enlai”). In 1965, Chairman Liu Shaoqi gave instructions on the work-study programme of Headmaster Wang Yizhi. At the celebration of the school’s 50th anniversary in 1996, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Chairman of the Central Committee Li Peng inscribed for the school: “Inherit the revolutionary tradition and train new persons of the times”, “Inherit the glorious tradition and carry out the educational principle on a general basis” respectively. Accompanied by Wu Yi, Chen Zhili, etc., Premier Wen Jiabao visited the school in 2003, inquired about the study and life of the students, and encouraged them to do great achievements.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The school has been carrying out the educational principle of the party on a general basis and providing education according to the educational discipline for past 60 years. It possesses an excellent team of teachers who have noble professional morality, excellent teaching skills, and creative spirit, including 7 winning “National Educational System Labor Model”, “National Excellent Teacher”, “Beijing Municipal Labor Model”, and “May 1 Labor Medal”, 10 teachers of a special classification, and more than 40 subject leaders at city and district levels as well as core teachers. The advanced schooling idea, highly qualified team of teachers, and educational reform adapting to the development of the times yield high-quality results for the school: Over 90% of its students are enrolled in key universities and 4 of its students have got the highest score in the final examination for higher schools. The school has also got excellent results in international Olympic competitions, subject competitions at national and district levels, middle school sports competitions home and abroad, art competitions, and technological creation competitions. It has trained more than 30,000 excellent graduates who have become the backbone forces in all trades. Of the members of the Central Committee and Central Political Bureau selected at 16th Party Congress, 6 graduated from Beijing No. 101 Middle School, and 4 are leaders of the Party and state. In addition, quite a lot graduates of the school have become major leaders of the party, political, and military forces at provincial and ministerial levels as well as big military quarters, and many have become experts and scholars known home and abroad as well as advanced models for all trades.</dd>

<dd>Technological Garden, adjacent to Tsinghua University in the east, Beijing University in the south, occupying 200,000m2 of land. Inside the school there are 5 artificial lakes that have water surface totaling 13,000m2. In the dusk of a sunny summer day, mountains see their shadows in the water to integrate with the quiet and peaceful style of Yuanming Garden. The exquisitely designed pieces of grassland match the clean and fresh air in the garden. Today No. 101 Middle School has become unique garden school in a modern metropolitan.<a href="http://www.beijing101.com/bj101/showart.asp?art_id=176" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.beijing101.com/bj101/showart.asp?art_id=176" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<dd>Starting first thing in the morning, the whole delegation went to Beijing 101 "Middle School", which covers grades 7-12. It is one of the premier high schools, and perhaps the very best, in China. The headmaster explained that its name was due to their desire to have students perform at better than 100%! Take a look at its web page (<a href="http://www.beijing101.com" class="external free" title="http://www.beijing101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.beijing101.com</a>) and you’ll see that it is also the home to the current and future leaders of China.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The school is located in the Haidian District of Beijing, an area of three million people that is known as the high tech and university district of the city. It is also the location of many American corporations in China, including IBM and GE.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Beijing 101 has approximately 3,500 students. It is a very selective school, taking only 5% of the applicants from across the nation each year. For a Chinese school, it has relatively small classes – 50 per room. The student days are long and the curriculum is rigorous, including three science classes each day as well as English. <a href="http://www.westchestergov.com/china06/Beijing2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.westchestergov.com/china06/Beijing2.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
