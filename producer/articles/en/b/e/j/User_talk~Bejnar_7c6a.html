<p>Hi! Because the impact crater articles are already categorized as impact craters, there is no need to create a duplicate astrobleme category.--<a href="../../../j/y/r/User%7EJyril_fd2c.html" title="User:Jyril">Jyril</a> 23:26, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually the impact craters seem to be categorized as just "craters", which is not very specific. However, almost all crater articles are about impact craters, and volcanic craters are categorized under <a href="../../../v/o/l/Category%7EVolcanic_calderas_143e.html" title="Category:Volcanic calderas">Category:Volcanic calderas</a>, so there is no ambiguity. Therefore we don't need another category for astroblemes. Also, <i>astrobleme</i> is rather obscure word (maybe not for geologists), most readers have no idea what it means (I confess, even I had to consult a dictionary). Of course, astrobleme might be more descriptive word because most impact "craters" have nothing to do with a bowl-shaped depressions.--<a href="../../../j/y/r/User%7EJyril_fd2c.html" title="User:Jyril">Jyril</a> 09:26, 11 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There appears to be some ambiguity, since <a href="../../../v/o/l/Category%7EVolcanic_calderas_143e.html" title="Category:Volcanic calderas">Category:Volcanic calderas</a> is appropriately a subcategory of <a href="../../../c/r/a/Category%7ECraters_c3b2.html" title="Category:Craters">Category:Craters</a>, and craters are categorized by place (e.g. <a href="../../../c/r/a/Category%7ECraters_on_Mars_7f72.html" title="Category:Craters on Mars">Category:Craters on Mars</a> <a href="../../../c/r/a/Category%7ECraters_of_North_America_cf82.html" title="Category:Craters of North America">Category:Craters of North America</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Category%7ECraters_of_Brazil_e355.html" title="Category:Craters of Brazil">Category:Craters of Brazil</a>), and on earth by time (e.g. <a href="../../../e/o/c/Category%7EEocene_craters_eea1.html" title="Category:Eocene craters">Category:Eocene craters</a>), but the only subcategory (prior to <a href="../../../a/s/t/Category%7EAstroblemes_2393.html" title="Category:Astroblemes">Category:Astroblemes</a>) that was broken down by origin was <a href="../../../v/o/l/Category%7EVolcanic_calderas_143e.html" title="Category:Volcanic calderas">Category:Volcanic calderas</a>. The result is that, perhaps appropriately, Crater Lake, Oregon could be classified under <a href="../../../c/r/a/Category%7ECraters_of_the_United_States_efc0.html" title="Category:Craters of the United States">Category:Craters of the United States</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Category%7EHolocene_craters_1959.html" title="Category:Holocene craters">Category:Holocene craters</a>, as well as <a href="../../../v/o/l/Category%7EVolcanic_calderas_143e.html" title="Category:Volcanic calderas">Category:Volcanic calderas</a>. Similarly, my hometown of Socorro, NM is in a heavily eroded volcanic crater that hasn't made its way into the wikipedia yet.</dd>
<dd>I agree that astrobleme is not a household word, with only 32,000 Google hits (astrobleme OR astroblemes); although it does transfer between languages well with German and Swedish: astroblem (7,000 hits), Spanish, Portuguese, Lithuanian and Romanian: astroblema (400 hits). Nonetheless, if one clicks on <a href="../../../a/s/t/Category%7EAstroblemes_2393.html" title="Category:Astroblemes">Category:Astroblemes</a> or searches for astrobleme one can get the idea pretty quickly.</dd>
<dd>I am particularly fond of tear-dropped shaped ones. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 21:27, 11 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Impact crater" gives 457,000 Google hits, so in popularity it wins hands down. I suggest that we use the current crater categories only for impact craters/astroblemes (and rename them eventually with a less ambiguous name) and create similar category structure for volcanic calderas. If we put all the several hundred impact crater articles into the astroblemes category and volcanic crater articles into the volcanic caldera category these two categories would become impractically large.--<a href="../../../j/y/r/User%7EJyril_fd2c.html" title="User:Jyril">Jyril</a> 21:59, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that crater is used more extensively for volcanic caldera, than caldera is, just as it is used more extensively for astroblemes. 'Crater' is not an un-ambiguous term, and taking the word 'crater' just for half of its meaning doesn't work for me. Is there a mediation process that we can appeal to on Wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>Also, are people who are interested in location of craters more interested in where they are than in what type of origin they may have? <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 22:50, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Bejnar,</p>
<p>I didn't really delete a reference to the alternative name "Talas," I only took it out from the first sentence, since already listed too many names. I felt that it was more important to have the more common forms of each historic name listed there (i.e., Taraz, Dzhambul and Aulie-Ata), putting the alternative forms (Talas, Zhambyl) later in the text. Note that in the second paragraph I actually refer to the city using the name "Talas" since this name seems to be more common in that period. I then switch to "Taraz" (the Arab version) when the city accepts Islam. I also added a disambiguating link from the "Talas" article, so if anything, I think the alternative name "Talas" is featured _more_ prominently now. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../q/a/r/User%7EQaramazov_fc31.html" title="User:Qaramazov">Qaramazov</a> 14:51, 27 March 2006</p>

<p>Has the term ‘Constantine Conspiracy’ been used by others to refer to these actions by Emperor Constantine? If not, what did they refer to it as?

<li>Yes it has been used by others e.g. "The Constantine Conspiracy: Another remarkable claim in The Da Vinci Code is that the Bible, as we know it today, was collated by the pagan Roman Emperor <i>Constantine the Great</i>, (231). Brown lifted this idea straight from <b>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</b>: It was at this point that most of the crucial alterations in the New Testament were probably made and Jesus assumed the unique status he has enjoyed ever since. The importance of <i>Constantine’s commission</i> must not be underestimated.7" --<a href="../../../m/e/b/User%7EMeBee_2caa.html" title="User:MeBee">MeBee</a> 04:01, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The material I cited has one central theme &lt; The Pagan Roman Emperor <i>Constantine the Great</i>, wanted to change the "Jewish group" who used <i>The Gospel of the Hebrews</i> , into modern Christianity based on the Four Gospels.

<dd>Howdy! There are some differences in the complant system verses Metayage, mostly in the realm that the prendeur had more control and was less an indenture servant then in what he became under the Metayage system. In Metayage the bailleur owns the vines as well as the soil and the prendeur is essentially only renting both. Under the complant system you saw more freedom for the prendeur to move his cuttings and rootstock to another piece of land if he wanted, especially if he could get better partnership terms. Metayage sort of became a "bastardize" version of complant and put much more control in bailleur's hand. In fact most of the criticisms in the Metayage sections wouldn't apply to complant-which is why I think its merits inclusion. I was kicking around the idea of its own article but decided there wasn't enough info to hold it's own. As for Wiktionary, admittedly I'm not the most familar with that project, would the links from metayage automatically go to the Wiktionary entry? If so, I do agree they are better suited in a dictionary style format. I just created the articles so there wasn't a red link for the word. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne27</a> 17:02, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You seem to know a lot about this subject. I had thought the various subgroups of Moken are the only group called "Sea Gypsies."

<p>Yes, I moved all the text from Sea Gypsies into Moken, putting it at the bottom so that it can later be reconciled with the original Moken text.

<p>Hello, I noticed you put Filip Dewinter in the category "Flemish activists". That's quite an assertion&#160;! Do you have any reputable sources to substantiate this&#160;?</p>

<dd>Calling Dewinter a Flemish activist was based, in part, upon his youthful actions: "In 1978, as a 16-year old, he founded the Flemish Student Action Group (Vlaamse Studenten Actie Groep)." Activist is not the same as terrorist. You said "That's quite an assertion&#160;!" I am not sure what you mean. Activists can be liberal or conservative. But I am not sure that I have ever seen a middle-of-the-road activist.&#160;:<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 20:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Flemish activist" is quite an honorary title in Flanders. As such, it is very POV. Bestowing such a title to a controversial political figure as Filip Dewinter is seen as taking sides <i>for</i> the far right <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlaams_Belang_4b54.html" title="Vlaams Belang">Vlaams Belang</a>, and <i>against</i> the democratic part of the Flemish movement.

<dd>I used activist to describe political activity directed towards Flemish nationalism. If you choose to see activist as a POV word, I cannot help you. Some people, who are not necessarily Flemish, see all separatist movements as inhumane. For them, Flemist activist probably implies a negative connotation. Do you deny that Dewinter founded, or help found, the Vlaamse Studenten Actie Groep? <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 21:33, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know whether he did. It is not relevant, I think. Do you have sources that call Dewinter a Flemish Activist, or is it just your opinion&#160;? In the latter case, putting that cat there is original research.</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been examining the "Flemish activist" problem a bit closer. I believe there is a deeper problem. In Flanders, the phrase "Flemish activist" has a very specific meaning, which is very much more narrow than "activist with Flemish nationality". It's more something like "someone who devoted his life to Flemish independence".</p>
<p>A second problem is, that in an international context, which Wikipedia is, the "Flemish nationality" doesn't really exist. For a non-Belgian, Philip Dewinter is a Belgian.</p>
<p>I propose to move the Category:Flemish activist to Category:Belgian activist, which is what it is meant to be&#160;: Activists by nationality.</p>

</dl>
<p>As far as piping is concerned, we normally don't pipe templates at all - and attempting to do so by simply adding "|*"ends up with all articles being indexed randomly at * in the category, which can cause big problems if there's more than one page in the category (200 articles). As far as the category creation is concerned, it's probably no big deal in this case, but usually they're only made if they're guaranteed to reach threshold. Normally if there's some doubt we'd make the template lead back to the parent category (in this case <a href="../../../m/a/l/Category%7EMalaysia_geography_stubs_c807.html" title="Category:Malaysia geography stubs">Cat:Malaysia geography stubs</a>) and make the category later if there were 60 or so (which we can find easily by checking the template's "Whatlinkshere" page). It's very easy to change the category over later now - no need for null edits like there used to be. As I said, in this case, it's not really much of a problem, since there are very likely to be enough articles, but if we are going to split Malaysia's geo-stubs completely by state it may be a problem with some of the smaller ones like Perlis and Melaka. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your message on my talk page (copy below), the article you mentionned on Juan Matos (the unknown actor) was now deleted. If eventually someone wishes to work on the Juan Matos (quite known salsa pro dancer) article comes up, I think it should indeed be on the same page where the actor's article was hosted before. In the future, pages could be made on "Juan Matos (dancer)" if disambiguation becomes necessary. Note that I am no longer working on the salsa page so maybe that will never be an issue. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeltz_37ca.html" title="User:Beltz">Beltz</a> 09:22, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Copy of your msg: Last December (2005), when you created the List of Famous Salsa Dancers, you indicated that these were "all very well known in the worldwide salsa dance community" and that "Articles will be created for each of those dancers." I am concerned about the article on Juan Matos who I understand was from Puerto Rico. It does not appear that the person described in the article Juan Matos is the famous Salsa dancer. I guess that we could move to delete the current article (afd) and afterwards you could start a new one with the data about the real Juan Matos.

<p>Bejnar, I put that article into history of social sciences because psychology is often labeled as a social science (probably more often than a biological science), and from a quick skim of the article it seemed like anecdotal cognitivism was closer to the traditional social science side of psychology (despite dealing with animals) than to ethology or a biological approach cognition. "History of biology" could be a justifiable alternate (or additional) category; my main concern was to remove it from the supercategory of "History of science", which tends to get cluttered with overly broad categorizations.

<p>Hi Bejnar, thanks for the tidyup you did on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Salomons_bcce.html" title="David Salomons">David Salomons</a>, but I was surprised by the changes you made to the opening sentence. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29_d981.html#Dates_of_birth_and_death" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Dates_of_birth_and_death</a> is clear that <i>"Locations should be included in the biography portion of the body article"</i>, not in the opening sentence.</p>
<p>Also, the use of symbols for date and death (rather than a dash between dates) is not something I can find any support for in the MOS, and they are unlikely to be converted usefully to a blind reader. They seem particulary innappropriate in this case: a cross is hardly the right way to mark the death of a Jewish man whose life's work involved campaigning against exclusion and in particular against being forced to take christian oaths as a precondition of public office.</p>
<p>So I have reverted the opening sentence to comply with the MoS. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 06:18, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Sorry there was an improper link; if you follow this link (<a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniforms_of_the_Canadian_Forces_1357.html#Distinct_Environmental_Uniform" title="Uniforms of the Canadian Forces">DEU</a>) you will see that it refers to the <i>Distinct Environmental Uniform</i>. Before DEU was introduced, army, navy and air force all wore the same dress uniform (CF Greens), work uniform (the dreaded "bus driver" uniform), and mess dress (the midnight-blue CF Mess Dress). After the introduction of DEU, these uniforms were replaced by service-specific uniforms; for example, scarlet mess jackets for the army, black work dress for the navy, etc. Sorry for the confusion.</p>
<p>On a related note, it would help if you provided the following information when requesting clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>an actual link to the edit; barring that,</li>
<li>the exact date and the article or talk page in question.</li>
</ul>

<dd>OK, this is really weird. I typed the above answer promptly to your enquiry, got your reply, checked your talk page, saw that my answer was <i>not</i> there, scribbled a hasty reply, then when I go to ad it, it's here now, as if I just posted it. I think this is what happens when you have too many editing tabs open in FireFox.</dd>
<dd>What I was saying in my second reply was, yes, I updated the DEU link when I saw that it was bad (you pointed that out - thanks); but I also replied as above.</dd>
<dd>The reason for this second answer is just to let you know I did indeed reply, as is my habit, but for some reason either I or the Wiki editor did not post it (more I think about it, the more I am inclined to believe it was carelessness on my part regarding the "Save" button). I was not ignoring or dismissing your question.</dd>

<p>Hi Bejnar, Can you give me an example? I've been cleaning up a fair number of ISBNs myself recently. I'm wondering if what you're speaking of is what has been called an invalid or a cancelled ISBN elsewhere. If the ISBN is wrong everywhere, I've been trying to not list the ISBN so that it will not continue to be flagged by SmackBot; rather I've been listing the LCCN and/or OCLC instead. Maybe we need to develop a flagging system of some kind for cancelled/invalid/always wrong ISBNs so once confirmed as such, they aren't listed with the ones that truly deserve fixing. Just my two cents ... I'm relatively new to this ... Regards, <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 21:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for the example! I like the idea of keeping the invalid ISBN around ... as long as it doesn't generate error tags. In your example, is it the ... or the spaces amidst I S B N that avoids the tagging by SmackBot? Do you know for sure SmackBot avoids these? The example you gave me appears to have been created within the hour, so SmackBot probably hasn't had a chance to catch it yet. The only other thing I may suggest is when available to additionally include an OCLC or LCCN since some catalogs, I believe, deliberately do not list incorrect/invalid/cancelled ISBNs. Just a thought. Regards, <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 22:21, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Military brats are the largest subcategory of <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Culture_Kids_a3da.html" title="Third Culture Kids">Third Culture Kids</a> (an article needing a fair amount of work.) I propose creating a new category <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Culture_Kids_a3da.html" title="Third Culture Kids">Third Culture Kids</a> and then creating a subcategory on military brats. This will alert those who are unfamiliar with the term that we are dealing with a scientifically studied definable term.

<p>Just a couple of suggestions. Take a look at all of the various merge templates at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">Template:Merge</a>. I have changed the template that you used on the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_entomology.html" title="Timeline of entomology">Timeline of entomology</a> article from <a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_8f97.html" title="Template:Merge">merge</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom-multiple_4bed.html" title="Template:Mergefrom-multiple">mergefrom-multiple</a>. Also the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">Template:Mergeto</a> is useful to direct discussion to a common Talk page.</p>
<p>More substantively, the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_entomology.html" title="Timeline of entomology">Timeline of entomology</a> article was split up in October 2005 because it was too long. You may think of the main <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_entomology.html" title="Timeline of entomology">Timeline of entomology</a> article as a distribution point much like a disambiguation page.

<dd>The major problem with that article is not that it's so long it needs to be split up into more than one article, it's that the vast, vast, vast majority of the listed information simply is subtrivial.

<p>Hi Bejnar, I happened to notice already that you have improved the disambiguation links for G15. Good work! In future I will check the incoming links. I'm trying to learn from the way you did it, so may I ask your advice with another example? Last week I created Zechariah (disambiguation), as there were different pieces of disam info on the pages for <a href="../../../z/e/c/Zechariah.html" title="Zechariah">Zechariah</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachariah.html" title="Zachariah">Zachariah</a>, and <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zacharias.html" title="Zacharias">Zacharias</a>; these are different people with the same name, but their article titles are differentiated only by different spellings. (There are also <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zakariya.html" title="Zakariya">Zakariya</a> and <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachariah_%28Mary%27s_Guardian%29_9790.html" title="Zachariah (Mary's Guardian)">Zachariah (Mary's Guardian)</a>, which had been proposed for merger into one of the others but are now proposed only for merger with each other.) I did not alter the article names, but now I think that I should change them to <b>Zechariah (prophet)</b>, <b>Zecharaiah (priest)</b> and <b>Zechariah (king of Israel)</b>. <a href="../../../z/e/c/Zechariah.html" title="Zechariah">Zechariah</a> should become the disambiguation page, and <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachariah.html" title="Zachariah">Zachariah</a> and <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zacharias.html" title="Zacharias">Zacharias</a> should become redirects to it.

<p>Hi there. I will look for the Harland book. I know that it is a reputable source, especially concerning magnetic stratigraphy. However, unverifiable information can sometimes make it into a reputable source, and this is what I suspect happened here. That is why wikipedia (in my opinion) is supposed to represent a consensus of secondary sources. The Harland "addition" to the Earth's geologic timescale represents a very (very) minority opinion. I suspect that if you were to confront him about this (and I will after reading it) that he would acknowledge that a mistake was made in modifiying the Hadean portion of the timescale. I am not trying to do "original research", nor present a biased synthesis, by removing facts that I don't agree with in the literature from wikipedia. It is just that this timescale is not in use today, and is not found in modern textbooks. If only 1 book out of 100 cite these subdivisions (I will keep adding books and review chapters to the AfD talk page!), then I don't think this deserves mention on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this up. You are right that this should not be debated from a scientific viewpoint, but rather from the point of view of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 18:39, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to clear up a few other points: "It is not selenologists who are using these subdivisions, it is geologists, probably mostly cosmologists, so it is not surprising that these subdivisions are not mentioned in Wilhelms' book and Martel's article about the Moon." Most lunar geologists (or Martian or Mercurian geologists) are also terrestrial geologists, or were at least trained in terrestrial geology before specializing in planetary geology. (The converse is generally not true.) The term selonology is not used any more, as it has been realized (mostly after Apollo) that all terrestrial planets are modified by a common set of geologic processes. Also, by "cosmologist", I presume you mean "cosmochemist", of which Linda Martel is one. All the cosmologists I ever met could care less about geology! <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 19:18, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You sent me a personal message saying that it was inappropriate to put Category references on "disambiguation" pages. However, this does not seem to be correct, as the Wikipedia page on disambiguation pages includes the sentence: <i>Following the template, include any of the standard categories as appropriate.</i> <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelandkentevans_8466.html" title="User:Clevelandkentevans">Clevelandkentevans</a> 23:53, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I did not create the category "Given names", I have merely been adding some pages that are also listed as "disambiguation" into that pre-existing category. And that category certainly seems to be an exception to the rule that you have quoted from the "style guide." A great many pages the deal with given names are listed as "disambiguation" pages and also give an explanation of the name and so are included in the category "Given names". Just looking at those pages in the "Given names" category starting with "Aa.." through "Am..", there are 20 of them that are categorized as both "Disambiguation" and "Given names", and that categorization was done by someone other than myself. Looking at the pages that were already in the "Given names" category before I began to heavily edit Wikipedia a couple of months ago, it seemed to me that it was not only allowed by _expected_ that "disambiguation" pages that dealt with given names also be listed in the "Given names" category.</p>

<p>Hi Bejnar. It seems that there is a slight misunderstanding (in part my fault, as I didn't check what you referred to and simply answered the question): when you write: "and in Soviet times by 1959 Shusha became the second largest town in Nagorno-Karabakh, with a mixed population (56.5% Armenians, 43.2% Azerbaijani Tatars, 0.3% Russians and Jews).[4]" and cite <a href="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/117/117444.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/117/117444.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/007/117/117444.htm</a> you should know that this URL is not for Great Soviet Encyclopedia, but the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Brokgauz and Efron, published, as it appears, in 1907—1909. As such, the census or actually annual population estimate-count (since the last census was done in 1897) refers to the one conducted sometimes around those times, most likely 1906. Also, it says that Shusha was founded in 1752 by Panah Ali Khan of Karabakh. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">AdilBaguirov</a> 09:12, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I will amend my comment to accetance of his reality. On a second point, I am incorrect in my stated belief that The Prophet is never referred to by his unadorned name, without honorific? I had thought that the invariable format was always (in Arabic, obviously) either "The Prophet Mohammed" (however spelled) or "Mohammed, blessings be upon him".

<p>I wondered about that. That same editor had been adding very dubious passages into other articles, and in this case he added lines like this: "she was a late medieval version of Aphrodite and associated with fish-tailed Venus or the Roman goddess of light, Lusinia (Juno Lucina="light") and therefore associated with Shamuramat or Semiramis, worshipped at the goddess cult center of Avalon identified with Glastonbury in Somerset." This, and the entire paragraph it's from, is bull. Not knowing what of the new material was good and what was false (it was all unsourced), I thought it best to remove it all, lest the whole article be damned. If you want to add the good material back in with proper sources (or at least cite needed tags), please do.

It seems clear from that discussion that when you created <a href="../../../a/s/t/Category%7EAstroblemes_2393.html" title="Category:Astroblemes">Category:Astroblemes</a> in March 2006, it was considered an unnecessary duplicate to <a href="../../../c/r/a/Category%7ECraters_c3b2.html" title="Category:Craters">Category:Craters</a> which had existed since June 2004.

<p>I am currently at University, and the point has been made by one or two of my lecturers, that, despite common misconception, the crust is not part of the mantle, and the lithosphere is. This mostly is to do with the types of rock found. The two are closely linked, although the fact remains.</p>

<dd>Thanks for your explanation on my talk page. The main issue is that the lava field, though it may be a small portion of the overall desert basin, is known as "Jornada del Muerto" lava field in geology and volcanology texts. This lava field has been the subject of a few published scientific papers, in addition to a detailed description in the book <i>Volcanoes of North America</i>. Someone looking for info about the lava field will find this article. I intend to expand the section on the lava field in the future, but need the {{<a href="../../../v/o/l/Template%7EVolcano_3b59.html" title="Template:Volcano">Volcano</a>}} and <a href="../../../v/o/l/Category%7EVolcanoes_of_New_Mexico_34c8.html" title="Category:Volcanoes of New Mexico">Category:Volcanoes of New Mexico</a> in order to easily find this article (and others like it) in the future.

<p>It is a matter of debate. The way, I, and the lecturers at my Uni, see it, is that the lithosphere moves on the convection currents in the asthenosphere, both, the mantle, with 'lith' as meant to mean, rock, or something, while the crust just happens to sit on the segments. Crusts lead an entirely different life than the lithospheres. Maybe something like, techtonic plate, is the correct term for the mingling of these? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikieWikieWikie_fb53.html" title="User:WikieWikieWikie">WikieWikieWikie</a> 21:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am sorry, well defined scientific terms are not a matter of debate. You are still not using terms in a standard geological way. You seem to understand the process, but not the jargon. Please read some standard geological textbooks, memories of lectures are not a sufficient substitute. If your lecturers at University have published, please refer expressly, directly, and specifically to their published works. Otherwise, please keep their ideas off of the Wikipedia. <i>Lithos</i> does in fact refer to rock coming from Greek <i>Λιθικός</i> meaning stone. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 23:12, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>The Earth's tectonic plates constitute the lithosphere so no proper understanding of plate tectonics can be achieved without reference to the lithosphere, and this requires an understanding of its essential difference from the crust</i>, I quote from the Geological Society [<a href="http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/template.cfm?name=lithosphere" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/template.cfm?name=lithosphere" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>]. <i>There are incorrect uses of both terms in text books - particularly common is the use of 'crustal', as opposed to 'lithospheric' plates</i>, I quote again from this source. May I draw your attention to the 'as opposed to, in the latter quote, with crust opposeing lithosphere... I read on, and the sad story unfolds that even this eminent faculty contradicts itself. I ungainlyly quote, again, <i>the crust is an integral part of the lithosphere, the lithosphere is mainly composed of mantle rocks</i>. I will personally stick with my view, although I suppose I can't argue it is better than the final points on the link, it does seem yo be sense, even if it is sense with convention in contravention??? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikieWikieWikie_fb53.html" title="User:WikieWikieWikie">WikieWikieWikie</a> 00:35, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Surely the, discontinuity, which is the Moho, means there is a disconnection. This I believe is the point my lecturer was intent to clarify. If the Earth's tectonic plates constitute the lithosphere so no proper understanding of plate tectonics can be achieved without reference to the lithosphere, and this requires an understanding of its essential difference from the crust, surely, techtonic plate is the best description. I can't in my head reconcile the idea lithosphere and crust are one. One, key point is that during subduction, the oceanic crust, melts, to blast through the overarch, and form volcanoes, as the lithosphere, oceanic if you will, merges with the lithosphere under the continental crust. The rock cycle, essentially, does not include the lithosphere (unless you include the crust), and the shifts in the plate techtonics is with relation to the density of the crust, with the lithosphere definitely in the realms of the Earth's inner energies, rather than outer features. The Earth is a sphere, yet the land is flat, like the crust, which lays on the mantle. I think this is reason.</p>

As in response to your question... Is there oceanic crust under continental crust? I believe there is. All the crust began as oceanic crust, unless it was formed before the oceans formed.</p>

<p>The Problem here is the article's name, do whatever redirect link you have to do, but the article talks about the capital of the department of <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guain%C3%ADa.html" title="Guainía">Guainía</a>, which NOW is <b>Inirida</b> and because of it the article's name should be Inirida, not <b>Puerto Inírida</b>, which is a name that is no longer in use. According to you, the article <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Granada_bcd8.html" title="New Granada">New Granada</a> should talk about Colombia, and the first line would read "Colombia, formely known as New Granada...."</p>
<p>It is not about being user friendly, is about stating facts, FACT, the name of the city is now Inirida, if someone still thinks its Puerto Inírida, and they search for that, a link would redirect to Inirida and then they would know why.</p>
<p>Another example, the former capital of <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> was <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yangon.html" title="Yangon">Yangon</a> it used to and is still widely known as <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangoon.html" title="Rangoon">Rangoon</a>, nevertheless the article is located in the page of the now official name, Yangoon, not Rangoon, even though it would be more user friendly, or if not, take the country itself, The US, Australia Britain know it as <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma.html" title="Burma">Burma</a> and the EU accepts both, but because the country calls itself Myanmar, the article is in Myanmar, now the goverment of the city in question, calls it Inirida, and the article should be in Inirida. <a href="../../../m/i/j/User%7EMijotoba_f86c.html" title="User:Mijotoba">mijotoba</a> 04:25, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again you are missing the point, the article should be just moved to <a href="../../../i/n/i/Inirida.html" title="Inirida">Inirida</a> after all there is no other article that has that name and the "(town and municipality)" is just too much, and IT DOES NOT HAVE AN ACCENT ANYMORE, so regardless the new name is wrong, im not trying to be difficult but why create another article about a page that aleady exists, and Inirida is not a just a town, is a city, and in Colombia, Municipalities are cities in itself, theres no need to have both, and calling it town underminds its importance as a capital, after all you dont know if there is a town somewhere else called Inirida, maybe in Peru or Brazil. <a href="../../../m/i/j/User%7EMijotoba_f86c.html" title="User:Mijotoba">mijotoba</a> 18:30, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
