	    <p>Q: What is your name, rank and serial number?</p>
<p>Erm, Ryan Smith. Rank, rank.... Captain. Captain sounds good, right? I think Hawkeye from MASH was a Captain, and he got to smoke cigars in an operating room, so he must've had some clout. Combine that with all the tail Captain Kirk got, and you've got one helluva military rank. So yeah, call me "Captain". Serial Number? Well let's see uhmmm. 6 and a half or there abouts, or maybe twelve.</p>
<p>Q: How did you get into Quake?</p>
<p>Via Doom in around 1994. My brother and I first got the Doom shareware from some crazy department store shareware disc (since we did not have internet access), along with a bunch of other games. After playing and liking both the ROTT and Doom shareware demos, we went and purchased both games. We played the two games religiously on our two PCs linked with an (now completely obsolete) null modem cable for years, until I finally got dialup access in late 1996. That was the magic year, and all the sites were ablaze with the news of Quake's release. We were quick to get our hands on the shareware, downloaded from ZDNet's hotfiles.com, which at the time meant something.</p>
<p>Our quasi obsolete machines could barely run it, and it became a reason for us to upgrade. In the mean time, I discovered the world of modding, via the Barney Doom mod. It fascinated me. I had programmed many games back on my Commodore 64 in the 80s, and I was anxious to play with game logic in modern games. However, nothing was really 'open source' back then, and modding for Doom and the like, you never really got to work with actual code. Most programming languages required expensive compilers, or were so underpowered as to be ridiculous. After we finally upgraded I noticed id had released the QuakeC source and tools to build it. It was a chance to once again code for games and I snapped at it.</p>
<p>Q: What is it that you like about the great game?</p>
<p>I like nearly everything about it. I love the QuakeC language, and the tools to build it. I love the way the maps are constructed, they're relatively simple and straightforward. I love that it's multiplayer, both cooperative and deathmatch. More recent games have increasingly dropped or neglected cooperative. I also love all of the monsters, they each have unique roles in the game world. I even actually love the three 'themes': tech, medieval and runic, they manage to keep the game fresh when a theme changes.</p>
<p>Sure some of the game could've used a little more polish, but id software did a great thing making the game so open, anything you wanted to 'fix' you could. So the thing I guess I love most is how open it was, it is and it continues to be.</p>
<p>Q: Out of all your work, what has been your favourite?</p>
<p>I follow a very specific pattern when I code. I work tirelessly on a mod for months, sometimes even years. Then I hit a roadblock, either life gets in the way, I lose something important in a crash or I just lose interest for a week and I don't have the energy to get back into the fray. Sometimes, very rarely, I actually finish something.</p>
<p>When either of those two stop conditions come about, the project goes sour on me. If it was actually finished, I hate it for what I should have done and neglected to do before calling it 'finished'. If I didn't manage to finish it, I get mad at whatever reason stopped me and lament what I never got to complete. Perhaps I'm too much of a perfectionist, but as a result I despise all my work mere minutes after it's 'done'.</p>
<p>The one project that, for me, I still have an ounce of pride left in is the FrikBot, it also helps that it remains my most famous project. I value it the most because it's simple, comprehensive and relatively complete.</p>
<p>Q: What Quake project by a creative mind other than yourself is your favourite?</p>
<p>I love almost all of MauveBib and his brother Harb!inger's work, especially Defeat In Detail. I once tried to join the ELF team to assist in creating DiD, but for some reason they turned me down.</p>
<p>Q: What is your favourite way to play Quake, eg: mod, gametype, map, engine, opponents, teammates?</p>
<p>I seldom actually play standard Quake much anymore. The majority of the times I actually fire the game up if because I'm testing some modification for myself or someone I'm helping. The mods I enjoy change rapidly. Mods I actually sit and play are few and far between. The last one I really spent any real time on was Wazat's brilliant mod, Conquest.</p>
<p>As far as gametype, I've always been a big fan of cooperative, as I state previously. When you can hear and see the other player's screen as I can with I play with my brother, deathmatch is out of the question, however, that ability is helpful in coop.</p>
<p>My engine of choice is DarkPlaces. LordHavoc has done a wonderful job with the engine. Days after the source code release I started on plans for my 'modder's engine', which had a vast list of planned features. For years I had been living with the limitation of QuakeC and the Quake engine holding me back from the games I really wanted to work on. When the source release came out I realized I could engineer away these limitations and work free from the burden. After a number of false starts, I began to notice LordHavoc's engine was rapidly not only becoming the best looking engine out there, but also the most modder friendly.</p>
<p>So my favorite way to play is a good coop game with DP, even though that seldom happens these days.</p>
<p>Q: Over all your years of gaming, what game other than Quake have you liked the most?</p>
<p>I've enjoyed many many games, and have modded for a few. The game I probably enjoy the most beside Quake is Neverwinter Nights by Bioware. It's a great RPG, that with the addition of the prestige class pack from the Player Resource Consortium, it is nearly endlessly replayable. I go for the hack and slash and the strategy of building a character, not so much the 'role playing', however. To the uninitiated, the role playing refers to you pretending to be an elf or a dwarf and acting and speaking as such within the gameworld. It is a major no-no on some servers to speak out of character.</p>
<p>The reason the communities of Quake and NWN simply don't get along is the Quakers recognize their game is a game. It's a fun, bloody contest, the story and depth of character is nearly non-existent. By contrast, some of the Neverwinter Nights community see the game mechanics of what they're playing as a tool to tell stories. Quakers largely think of NWN as boring, filled with text and with little actual gameplay. The fans of NWN, on the other hand picture all players of First Person Shooters as, well, the worst CS players you can imagine. Both of these generalizations are at times true but also completely unfair.</p>
<p>Q: And now a few questions suggested by the community. What's your favourite Quake-related memory?</p>
<p>The time I deathmatched with Kryten and Menagerie from the Inside3D forums. I fired up GameSpy and was browsing the list of servers, and happened across two names I recognized. I joined the game just as they were wrapping up and hardly got a word in edgewise, I think the chat was, in between random acts of gibbing, "Hey, it's me from the forums at Inside3D!", "who?", "FrikaC!" "oh, you, what do you want?" "n...nothing, just hi" "hi" but for some reason I still remember that night fondly.</p>
<p>Q: What do you think about the Quake community nowadays?</p>
<p>I think it's tired. I know I sure am. The modders have been nearly eradicated, while there's still a strong player and mapper base, the modders are biting the dust left and right. I think it's because modders are generally ambitious, they want to make full games with each idea they've come up with. While you can do that with Quake, especially now that the engine source code is out, the problem now is there's newer games our there with full open source code. If you want to turn your mod into a full game, and most modders do, it becomes advantageous to use the latest engine to gain the graphical advantages it brings.</p>
<p>Q: You are a veteran Quake coder. What are your plans for the future, and what are you developing now?</p>
<p>My plans for the future revolve around another kind of engine I'm developing called MAGE. Which is an acronym for the mindArt (my made-up company) Game Engine. It's the engine behind Qake, which I released during the last QExpo, designed to be a generic 2d tile based game engine with a QuakeC like virtual machine.</p>
<p>Q: Have you thought about Quake's 10th anniversary and QExpo, and if so, what are your plans for it?</p>
<p>I've thought about it a lot. I've been so busy as of late, I haven't had a chance to whip up even a simple Quake mod for it, but as the deadline approaches, I'm sure to come up with and code something for it. Maybe a new release of Qake will be in order by then, but I'm sure the community is probably already getting sick of it.</p>
<p>Q: I guess you agree that releasing Quake stuff under GPL has been a good thing after all. But do you think there are some disadvantages this step brought to Quake? Do you think they should have released more or less stuff from Quake under that license? Where do you think Quake could be (in the best possible case) if id software didn't do that?</p>
<p>In my circles, the releasing of Quake, it's tools and it's engine under the GPL was never, ever considered a 'bad thing'. There was concern among some programmers out of the QuakeWorld community needing to suffer from cheats that could arise, but the proxies of the previous generation had showed that very little could be done, even when you had complete control over all the communication back and forth to the client.</p>
<p>For me, I almost always play in tight groups where we know there are no cheaters, on mods where cheating would be pointless anyway. So yes, the release of all that code to the public and the abilities it gave us coders was almost always seen positively. I see very few real disadvantages from it.</p>
<p>As far as should they have released more or less things under the GPL? Well, there's quite a few tools that I wished were GPL, such as Worldcraft 1.6 and others, but id has no control over any of those. Realistically, I don't see what more they could have gpl'd. They map sources would be interesting, but more or less a novelty. They could help one or two retexturing/etc projects, but they really don't help the modder community much.</p>
<p>Releasing the rest of the content as GPL is going to become kind of moot as projects such as OpenQuartz fill the gap. So I think releasing more under GPL is kind of pointless, and releasing less would not have been feasible. The things gpl'd were Quake, QuakeWorld and the basic tools. If they never released the engines we would have never had any of the good fortune that has brought, and if they had never released the tools, new games based on the engine would be up shitcreek without a paddle.</p>
<p>Q: How do you pronounce xhrl? <a href="http://www.besmella.com/comments.asp?newsid=394453897383176760300926" class="external free" title="http://www.besmella.com/comments.asp?newsid=394453897383176760300926" rel="nofollow">http://www.besmella.com/comments.asp?newsid=394453897383176760300926</a></p>
<p>"Ecks Hurl". I derive that from my pronounciation of URL, "Yurl", and yes, I know that it should probably be "Earl" or something similar, but yurl just sounds funnier.</p>
<p>Q: Any last words?</p>
<p>Zug tug.</p>
