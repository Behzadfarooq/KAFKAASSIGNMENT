<p><a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">Welcome</a> to Wikipedia, Bestghuran! My name is Ryan, aka <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Acetic Acid</a>. I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascading_Style_Sheets_981c.html" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a>. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">How to edit a page</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_write_a_great_article_687a.html" title="Wikipedia:How to write a great article">How to write a great article</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid">talk page</a>. Please be sure to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">sign your name on Talk Pages</a> using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right?&#160;:)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. We can use all the help we can get! Have a nice day.

<p>What are their license? If you just swiped them from nhluniforms.com then <b>I</b> would say you're in a very grey area.

<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one.

<p>Why do you keep uploading images without sources or proper copyright tags? Image:BC Lions 1953-1968.gif and Image:1td.jpg were deleted as per the letter of the law and you still reuploaded them without proper copyright information. Images cannot be uploaded unless their source is disclosed, period. Your claims of "fair use" are impossible to verify. The other images you uploaded without tags are also impossible to verify.</p>
<p>If you provide the sources for the images, then their status can be verified, and they become harder for admins to delete. It's that simple.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you read <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I sound a bit harsh, but Wikipedia needs to take copyright seriously in order to avoid getting sued. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertR_0869.html" title="User:AlbertR">Alr</a> 18:18, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bestghuran, you seem to treat "fair use" like an invitation to upload as many images as you can to Wikipedia. Fair use is a court defense, not a right. It is applicable only to certain, limited circumstances. I would guess that 80%-90% of the images you've uploaded are not fair use and are probably copyright violations. Please don't upload any more images unless you understand the policies. It creates tension and animosity in the community and leaves Wikipedia open to legal action. I have seen too many good-faith editors get branded as "untouchables" because they made mistakes then they added pictures to Wikipedia, and I would prefer you don't get the same treatment. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertR_0869.html" title="User:AlbertR">Alr</a> 18:22, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. You tagged the above image as a stamp, but it doesn't appear to be so. The website you retrieved it from doesn't explicitly say that the images are copyrighted (as far as I am able to tell), but the copyright is assumed. I have tagged the image as missing the appropriate copyright tag, so if that image is really available freely, please make the correct changes. --PS2pcGAMER (talk) 05:58, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have contributed a lot to this website, it is unfair that I am blocked with May 4 as my expiry, then May 5, then May 6 and now indefinite. I have only did one thing that was a disagreement to certain people this does not mean I should be blocked forever. I have created several pages and even completed pages that were listed as stubs that were my contributions to this site. Can one of you administrators please unblock me, so I can do other work. My IP address is 24.87.77.241. Please include this address, along with your username (Bestghuran), in any queries you make.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Inedfinite means just that, no definite end date. The block has been indenfinite since it was imposed on May 2, I guess the reason you've seen other dates is that you have tried to log out and edit as logged out user or with a different account. This cause the autoblocker to block the IP address for 24 hours at a time, it does this to stop people trying to evade blocks. However the original blocker has since lifted the block and there don't appear to be any auto blocks outstanding so you should be ok now. (There is a small risk an autoblock will activate again, in which case use the unblock tag or email the original blocker (or both)). --<a href="../../../p/g/k/User%7EPgk_d0c7.html" title="User:Pgk">pgk</a><sup>(<a href="../../../p/g/k/User_talk%7EPgk_b406.html" title="User talk:Pgk"><font color="mediumseagreen">talk</font></a>)</sup> 09:57, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know the details of what you did, but an indefinate block seems way too harsh to me. You definitely have contributed an amazing amount of material related to the CFL to Wikipedia. I have left a message with the admin that blocked you. Let me know (by editting this page) if you need any assistance. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 06:53, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> thanks man for trying to help, listen if I am still blocked let me know if you want any information to complete the CFL seasons. Oh yeah by the way the two Winnipeg Grey Cup games in the 90's the stadium was known as Winnipeg Stadium until the 21st century. 07:42 Pacific, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh yeah and tell whoever is changing the logos from center to right, tell him to put them on the left. Also if he sees other logos like CFL USA and Radically Canadian to put keep them center on the top and put the main logos on the left.</p>
<p>Anyways if you want to now the details in what I did. I recently did zoo and aquarium articles that are from Canada some improved and some I created and one I found uncategorized. What happened they had two categories Zoos in Canada and Aquaria in Canada, I thought it would be best that they had a category for Zoos and Aquariums of Canada, because I thought having one category under that section would be best than having two, because it is similar. They deleted that category without notice so I reverted it, because I was not given an explanation why. Then I put their categories under delete we had an argument over it and they said that we have to keep it separate, because the other categories about zoos and aquaria in other countries are separate. But to see the hypocrisy about it if you look at both Zoos in Canada and Aquaria in Canada, Montreal Biodome and Marineland were put under both different categories, they recently changed Marineland, because I complained about that. Also the similar complaints they had of me they were doing the same thing. Any ways I don't want to drag on here, but I made concessions, but I asked them let's talk about making all the categories like this into one category not only for Canada, but for other countries like they stated. I was then blocked to even continue discussions. 8:04 Pacific, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not totally sure what the problem was, but next time it happens to you try this. Delete the whole Image thing ([[Image:...]]), and make sure there are no spaces directly before or after the Image tag. Then type the image tag out, copy the image name from the top of the image's page.

I noticed that <a href="../../../8/2/n/82nd_Grey_Cup_e053.html" title="82nd Grey Cup">82nd Grey Cup</a> had a tag to that effect. I made some suggestions of how we can improve the style on the talk page for that article in order to get the tag removed. I would like to discuss these with you to see if we can reach some consensus (I would have written earlier but I needed some help to find your talk page).
