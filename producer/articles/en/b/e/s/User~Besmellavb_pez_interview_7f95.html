	    <p>Q: The introductory question: Who is your daddy, and what does he do?</p>
<p>ße I'm payze aka pez or pezej as some people say, 22 years old and living in Nancy - France. I finished my studies in June 2006 and am currently jobless \;D/, so I'm enjoying my free time for movie making etc...</p>
<p>Q: How did you get into making gaming videos?</p>
<p>Oh well I started to make videos 5 years ago, right after watching <a href="ftp://ftp.blueyonder.co.uk/mirrors/ftp.planetquake3.net/movies/pro-motion.zip" class="external text" title="ftp://ftp.blueyonder.co.uk/mirrors/ftp.planetquake3.net/movies/pro-motion.zip" rel="nofollow">pRo-motion</a> (the first, and still the best CPM trick movie on RA3 maps, that I recommand BTW). At this time I was still on 56k and mostly playing VQ3 DeFrag&#160;:&lt;, CPM physics weren't incorporated in that mod yet. I was so impressed by the moves and runs that I decided to throw VQ3, to learn CPM and make a movie. The result was a short movie named "pez on fire" ¶¦¬Þ that ran for 3:35, featuring me doing VQ3 DeFrag runs and some CPM freestyle with "Disturbed - Voices" as the soundtrack&#160;:D. Unfortunately that movie isn't online anymore for your viewing pleasure d;p</p>
<p>Q: What games other than Quake 1 have you made videos for?</p>
<p>Actually I've made videos for Quake 3 (with CPM physics for most of them), and Warsow. I'm not sticking to one game only, I enjoy exploring new stuff, although it has to interest me to get my attention. You won't see me doing a CS video. But so far QW is the greatest game i've ever worked on, it made me lose my faith in CPM/Q3&#160;;&gt;</p>
<p>Q: Do you get sick of your own videos after spending all that time making them?</p>
<p>Nah not really, it's really enjoyable to watch the final render after long hours spent on the project. But with time, usually 2 or 3 months later you find some stuff you made was really noobish. You can actually see what's missing/wrong, I guess that's what motivates me to do more videos and editing. Every new movie is an improvement over the others.</p>
<p>Q: You mentioned recently that sometimes you run out of ideas while planning/editing a video. Where/how do you find such ideas?</p>
<p>Ideas can come from anywhere, but when I can't make something by myself I get inspiration from cinema, TV clips, websites or even a single picture can do the trick to develop a new effect.</p>
<p>Q: Do you ever get frustrated while making a video?</p>
<p>Well sometimes during the making there is moments when you are pissed, things are not going like you want and you're losing motivation. When this happens it means I have to take a break and play&#160;:D, usually I play the game I'm making a video on (that really gets me into the "game's mood") but I play solo games as well.</p>
<p>Q: What are you working on at the moment?</p>
<p>Dag Def Extreme 3 as some may already know&#160;:). We (<b>def</b> &amp; I) delayed the movie for quite some time (project should have started in January 2006) due to some missing stuff we absolutely wanted for this movie (recaming system, models, etc). But now it's been a month that I have started it and they (the betatesters) are really pleased of it so far. I guess the movie should come out in the first 2007 quarter. After than I've been asked by <b>Apokalypze</b> to do his own movie.</p>
<p>Q: What do you think of filmmaking in Quake 1 now, with all the feature-packed engines, camming tools and so forth?</p>
<p>Quake is really great for movie making, everything is customizable, the community is active enough to help you and so on. Now with the coming of new tools such as CamQuake I hope we'll get some interest from the others movie makers (can't make all the division 1 clan movies by myself&#160;;p). Next step is to code this camera on the FTE engine and everyone will be happy I guess =)</p>
<p>Q: Do you have any tips for upcoming video creators?</p>
<p>A newcomer to movie making can do great things if he has the patience and motivation for it (I have proof) - it's like a class mate I recruited for <a href="http://www.temporalpictures.org" class="external text" title="http://www.temporalpictures.org" rel="nofollow">temporal pictures</a>. He has never released a movie but I kinda got him into movie making last year and he learnt the basics of editing apps. Now he's with us we're helping him as we can and he's doing a great job, I won't be surprised to see him on top of gaming movie makers by the release of his movie.</p>
<p>Q: Who do you think will win Best Video/Best Filmmaker in this year's Quake Video Awards?</p>
<p><b>Nylon</b> if he releases his video before 2007 of course.</p>
<p>Q: How's the Quake 1 playing going?</p>
<p>Fine, I'm now retired of CPM after 4 years of loyal services where I spent my best moments with the <a href="ftp://ftp.blueyonder.co.uk/mirrors/ftp.planetquake3.net/movies/clan%20leto%20-%20roboty%20from%20outer%20space.rar" class="external text" title="ftp://ftp.blueyonder.co.uk/mirrors/ftp.planetquake3.net/movies/clan%20leto%20-%20roboty%20from%20outer%20space.rar" rel="nofollow">superheroes</a> squad: <b>aggnog</b> "policebob", me "kittykat", <b>gellehsak</b> "lumberjack XL", <b>naz</b> "whiteninja" and <b>tl</b> "foofinator". But we all split, gellehsak went to the PK world tour, aggnog to university, and naz &amp; tl to WoW, only I was remaining on #CPMPickup. Now I'm in QW with old CPM buddies in <a href="irc://irc.quakenet.org" class="external text" title="irc://irc.quakenet.org" rel="nofollow">#sadtroops</a> (so saddddddd&#160;:() where we do not play seriously and have fun&#160;:)</p>
<p>Q: Favourite Quake 1 map?</p>
<p>I enjoy DM2 alot for TDM even if I can barely do the RJ to mega/tele&#160;;&lt;, but my fave is definately Aerowalk, it's so smooth to move and frag on. Actually I dislike duelling, but I like Aero duels =)</p>
<p>Q: Favourite Quake 1 weapon?</p>
<p>I think it's the shotgun, along a quad damage of course &lt;3</p>
<p>Q: If you could bring any retired Quake 1 player, who would it be?</p>
<p>I never really saw the oldies playing QW like <b>Lakerman</b> or <b>Kane</b> and so on... So I'll stay with someone I know: <b>dag</b> because of what I saw in the old DDE movies and in the DDE3 content. Otherwise (he's not retired yet!) my fav would go to [ssc]milton.</p>
<p>Q: Has making videos changed how you look at things in-game? Do you see a good play and think "I could use that" or anything like that?</p>
<p>Yes kinda, through the years you notice that x midairs get boring and bring nothing new to the movie making scene (of course it's still enjoyable to watch a few of them). Nowadays I'm more interested in technical moves followed by frags, faints, hide and seek stuff, map control etc...</p>
<p>Q: What music are you listening to these days?</p>
<p>French electro stuff, Vitalic, John Lord Fonda... And something else I won't say cause it's in DDE OST&#160;:)</p>
<p>Q: How do you pronounce xhrl?</p>
<p>icks-hache-ère-elle although I blame Canada.</p>
<p>Q: Any last words?</p>
<p>I blame vße for disturbing me in the middle of a DDE3 editing session with that interview!&#160;:oF *bisous*</p>
