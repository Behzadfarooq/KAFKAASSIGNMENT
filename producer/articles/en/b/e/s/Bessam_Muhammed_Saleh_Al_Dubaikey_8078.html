<p>While answering the factors favoring continued detention he confirmed that his name was not really Bessam Muhammad. He said that Bessam Muhammad was a friend of his, with a more influential family. He said he thought that if he pretended to be his friend it would preserve him from some of the harsher treatment.</p>
<p>The Board did not ask his real name.</p>
<p>He also acknowledged falling off a horse, and suffering a head injury. He said, for a time, he suffered from multiple personalities. He said blows to his head can bring strange behavior, or relapses.</p>

<p>Initially the United States government asserted that it could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to prisoners in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>.

<p>Al Dubaikey acknowledged traveling from Saudi Arabia, through Pakistan, to the UAE, but couldn't recall the exact date.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey acknowledged being arrested at a checkpoint in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey acknowledged being in possession of a large sum of money when captured.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey acknowledged being captured with another individual.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey denied his companion was a fighter at Tora Bora. He was arrested before the fight in Tora Bora.</p>
<p>Al Dubiakey denied his companion attended paramilitary training camps.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey expressed skepticism that his traveling companion was a director of Al Wafa.</p>
<ul>
<li>His traveling companion had a lot of money, which he was looking for a good, reputable charity to whom to make a donation. Al Dubaikey suggested, <i>"If he had any relations with the Al Wafa organization he would not go and look for another organization to give the money to he would just give it to his organization."</i></li>
<li>He just came from <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>.</li>
<li>He never mentioned Al Wafa during the four days they traveled together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Al Dubaikey responded to the allegation that Al Wafa was known to be considered a terrorist organization by saying he had never heard of Al Wafa until he arrived in Cuba.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey responded to the allegation that he met with a known al Qaida facilitator by saying he met two people in Pakistan. And, if they were related to al Qaida they would have disapproved of him because he dated lots of women and didn't have a beard.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey denied attending any training camps.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey responded to the allegation that he received special training in Kabul by asking where Kabul was. When he was told that it was a town in Afghanistan he reminded the Tribunal he had never been to Afghanistan. He reminded them that they had his passport, which showed he had arrived in Pakistan very shortly before his arrest. There would have been no time to cross into Afghanistan, attend a training camp, and be back in time for his arrest.</p>

<p>Al Dubaikey told the Tribunal that he had met with representatives from the Saudi embassy, who told him that Ali Abbott, "the head of the intelligent service in Pakistan" <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> had looked at his file, and told them he was obviously innocent. Dubaikey said he got "a piece of paper from the court in Pakistan saying that I was an innocent man". He said he received this paper the day before he was transferred to American custody. Al Dubaikey said he hopes the paperwork that verifies his innocence is still buried somewhere in his dossier.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey said he feels unsafe, both in Guantanamo, or if he is released, because the Saudi detainees, who were actually jihadists, all believed he was a spy. He feared retaliation, both in Guantanamo, or if he were released.</p>

<ul>
<li>Al Dubaikey said he traveled to Pakistan to look for artifacts like old coins or old books. The kinds of artifacts he deals with are much cheaper than in Saudi Arabia or Europe.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey said this was his first buying trip to Pakistan.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey said he had taken ninety thousand dollars with him to buy artifacts.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey said much of that money he earned in the short time he was in Pakistan, because he found other collectors had already bought the kinds of artifacts he was interested in, but failed to realize their value, and he had been able to buy some of them, and sell them on the internet. One of the artifacts he mentioned selling for a great deal of money was a pair of mummies.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey assured the Tribunal that his sales could be documented, if the Pakistan internet expert who helped him make the sales could be located.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey assured the Tribunal that he had no military training.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey assured the Tribunal he was not a member of al Qaida, and not a member of Al Wafa.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey clarified that he had only been in Pakistan a short time, but it was longer than four days. It had been four days since he met his traveling companion, who rescued him, when he got lost, and couldn't find his hotel, and had a panic attack.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey said they were both traveling with a lot of money, and thought they would be safer if they traveled together.</li>
<li>The Tribunal officers pointed out how little Al Dubaikey knew about his traveling companion. They pointed out he could be a fanatic. Al Dubaikey admitted sheepishly that he didn't know much about him, but he suggested it was unlikely he was a jihadist because he chose to watch pornographic movies on Al Dubaikey's laptop while Al Dubaikey drove.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey said that the reason they were told they were stopped at the checkpoint was that they were Arabs. The official manning the checkpoint acknowledged he had no reason to assume there was anything wrong with them, but unless they paid him $5000 he was going to arrest them and turn them over to the Americans, who would pay $5000 a piece for them.</li>
<li>Al Dubaikey was asked what happened to his $90,000, and his other artifacts, when he was arrested. He knows that his belongings followed him when he was transferred to US custody.</li>

The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>Al Dubaikey chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.<sup id="_ref-ArbAlDubaikey_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArbAlDubaikey" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
