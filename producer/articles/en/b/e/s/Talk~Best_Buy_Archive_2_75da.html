<p>There needs to be a set of critera established for that should be posted in the Criticisms section. If having a criticisms section is going to allow for endless postings of every lawsuit filed against the Best Buy company, then I just as soon see the section go away. The truth of the matter is, is that Best Buy probably has hundreds of lawsuits filed against them every year. But I don't believe that the scope of wikipedia, is to provide an account of every single lawsuit that's filed against them. So what are some ideas for guidelines that need to be met in order to post something in that Criticisms section? <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 21:41, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>we can just debate each one to see which ones are worthy... I think court cases are much more relevant to the article than a "no-christmas" policy.. It's going to be nearly impossible to create a set of criteria that is fair. There's only one court case in the section, so I don't see how it is a problem. I'd say its relevant because it involves multiple stores, is a federal case, and has been brought to the court by a state. Future/past similar cases can simply be combined into the same sentence (rather than having multiple sections/paragraphs for it) <a href="../../../b/g/o/User%7EBgold4_6969.html" title="User:Bgold4">Bgold4</a> 21:50, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Try <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticism_8870.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Wikipedia:Criticism</a> for ideas. If it's a major lawsuit then I usually put it in its own article and provide a link to it from both the defendant's page and the prosecutor's page (when applicable). As far as the Christmas thing, content like that should go in the article about the organization criticizing Best Buy, not the article about Best Buy itself.

<dd>I agree with both of you. I think the no-christmas policy is not relevant enough for the article. Things like the PS3 and XBOX fiascos could probably be crafted into one short sentence with citations. I'm going to see how creative I can be and write those two into one paragraph. And I think we do away with the no-christmas policy. The truth of the matter is that if it was ever relevant, it's relevant only for this Christmas season. After that, it's pretty much irrelevant on all fronts. <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 23:00, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I did it. I hope there's not too much flack. Basically, summarized the XBOX and Playstation incidents. If the reader wants more detail about the incidents, the links to the sources are included. It's not necessary for us to include all the nitty gritty details if it's available via the link. Secondly, removed the no-christmas policy altogether as discussed above. Lastly, removed the paragraph regarding the civil suit in Wisconsin. It's a pending lawsuit, so I don't see it as having any relevance to the article. If Best Buy is found at fault in the end, then that might be another matter to discuss later. Until then, I don't see how it adds anything to the article. Thoughts? <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 09:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I disagree and out of respect for all those who actually contributed and edited this section I reinstated it.</p>
<p>It might be prudent to actually ask those who contributed to this page about drastic changes befroe making them unilaterally. Happy Holidays! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jomomm (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jomomm_cb85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jomomm">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Jomomm, that is actually the intention of this discussion page. I have no way of contacting every single person that contributes to this page. That is what the talk page is for. And the reason I went ahead with the change, was because all I had seen was positive responses to my ideas and that was why I went ahead with them. <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 02:34, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd say to combine the PS3 + 360 paragraphs into one paragraph, get rid of the no christmas paragraph, and leave the Wisconsin trial... I'd also say that the trial magazine paragraph should be eliminated (I think that has to do with a third party rather than Best Buy) <a href="../../../b/g/o/User%7EBgold4_6969.html" title="User:Bgold4">Bgold4</a> 02:46, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The trial magazine thing has been going on for a long time, and yes, it has to do with a third party. Not Best Buy themselves. There have been numerous news stories on this, and the end result always pointed to either the magazine company or the subscriber not reading all the terms and conditions of the trial subscription. Back to the "no-christmas policy", I should reiterate that this is a short-term issue, and it really won't have any relevance after Christmas is over. So I agree, it should go. I did merge the XBOX and PS3 paragraphs already. I also included a little more detail than I did on the last edit, in hopes that it will cause a little less "shock" to other editors. I really think that if readers want more details than whats on the wikipedia page, then they can follow the links. It's not necessary to copy down every little detail. <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 04:26, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The biggest factor behind my reasons for not wanting it posted on the article, is because there is no fact-based sources for the information. Yes, the general issue is that the words "Merry Christmas" were not used in the 2006 marketing campaign. I don't recall even seeing the words "Happy Holidays" in the ads. But the best source we have for that is the website of the boycotting organization? That's a biased source, and shouldn't be relied upon as a reliable source. That's my extra two cents on the matter. &#160;:) <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 02:51, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first reference in the no-Christmas paragraph was an Associated Press article. B2Bomber81's claim that "there is no fact-based sources for the information" seems to be untrue. (Posted by 148.87.1.172)</p>
<p>First, please remember to sign your name on your posts. Second, the link that you posted, claiming to be an Associate Press article is broken and doesn't work. Besides, it appears its a forbes.com link anyway - not AP. So, going back to what I said - there do not seem to be any fact-based sources out there. The only working links anybody has posted are links to the AFA and Catholic League. I'm not saying that there is no fact to this story - I think it's well known to a lot of people. But in order for the article to be valid, you have to have a credible source to cite. AFA and Catholic League don't cut it for me. <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 14:56, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(posted by 148.87.1.172) I'm sorry the original link is dead. Fortunately, AP stories can be viewed on many different websites.

<dd>You stated above: "The biggest factor behind my reasons for not wanting it posted on the article, is because there is no fact-based sources for the information."

I hope this is not the case. 148.87.1.170</dd>

<p>I don't see why this needs to be posted on the article. Why is it a criticism? Wal-Mart decided to say "Merry Christmas", which is great - Best Buy opted to not refer to any one specific holiday on the chance that they would offend someone for not also saying Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa, etc. Now, that doesn't mean that Wal Mart did anything wrong by saying just Merry Christmas - I'm saying that I don't understand why just because some organization calls a boycott, why it automatically becomes a notable criticism? I'm want to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 17:35, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a criticism because of the simple fact that two national groups (AFA and Catholic League) have criticized Best Buy. Whether the criticism is merited is outside the scope of Wikipedia. Whether the criticism is "notable" is perhaps more subjective, but we could look at the media coverage. The controversy has been featured on the Bill O'Reilly program (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200612200012" class="external free" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200612200012" rel="nofollow">http://mediamatters.org/items/200612200012</a> ) . Also the email campaign against Best Buy is big enough to warrant a Snopes Urban Legends profile (<a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/christmas/bestbuy.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.snopes.com/politics/christmas/bestbuy.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/politics/christmas/bestbuy.asp</a> ). This seems to be big enough of a controversy to be counted as "notable". 148.87.1.170</dd>

<dd>You have two points listed on the other page. One, the criticism is not retailer-specific. Two, this is a single organization's "cowboy crusade." Regarding the first point, it was Best Buy spokeswoman Dawn Bryant's statement that sparked the criticism. All the subsequent criticism focused on BBY, and this particular statement. Regarding the second point, there are three distinct critics of Best Buy: the AFA, the Catholic League, and Bill O'Reilly. It's not just "a single organization".148.87.1.170</dd>

<dd>The comment from Best Buy's spokeswoman didn't spark the controversy - AFA, CL and O'Reilly sparked the controversy when they chose to make an issue out of it. I'm sorry, but just because those people have I'm sure if you dig a little deeper, you can probably find somebody making a stink about Wal-Mart or Target saying Merry Christmas too. Do you think that should be posted on their articles as criticism as well? I'd like you to take a look at <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200612010011" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200612010011" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> before you say anything else.

<dd>I am aware of Media Matters and its stance on O'Reilly. In an earlier post, I included a Media Matters link. You seem to be saying that critics are the cause of the controversy. I think that a controversy requires at least two sides. For example, is KFC or PETA the "spark" for the controversy between them? For the sake of neutrality, I think the controversy should be mentioned in Wikipedia articles on both the source and target of the criticism. 148.87.1.170</dd>

<dd>Okay - but you keep using O'Reilly's involvement as a basis of truth to this and O'Reilly is the one that made up the story. He made claims that Best Buy was firing employees for saying Merry Christmas, and Best Buy came out and said that wasn't true. In the end, the only truth to this whole thing was that Best Buy stated they would only use Happy Holidays in their PRINTED advertisements. They pointed out that the TV commercials even had representations of Christmas and never once uttered the words "Happy Holidays". <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 17:28, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As stated in point 2 above, you'll see that O'Reilly was never part of the passage. However, omitting the AFA and the Catholic League's opposition (backed by factual citations) means that no criticisms are actually mentioned. The leftover result is just two decontexualized policy statements, which would be puzzling to the reader. 148.87.1.170</dd>

<p>Well Wikipedia is built on consensus, so let's get some. I agree with B2bomer81. I don't really see why this is notable enough to be part of the article. I'm sure many other companies made similar decisions with a wide range of responses. You can't please everyone with this stuff and since it isn't really notable to Best Buy, I don't see why it should be in here at all. The Christmas Controversies article would probably be appropriate to have it in there, as a minor note. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Cyr_2f7a.html" title="User:Paul Cyr">Paul Cyr</a> 00:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your objection that the no-Christmas policy isn't notable has already been rebutted above. Bill O'Reilly's heavy coverage of Best Buy's no-Christmas policy (not just that of retailers in general) demonstrates that the controversy garners enough media attention. As mentioned before, O'Reilly's coverage demonstrates notability (as opposed to accuracy), while the Associated Press article is used as an reliable source. 148.87.1.170 13 February, 2007</dd>

<dd>Surprisingly enough, not everyone considers everything that Bill O'Reilly talks about to be automatically notable. (It's kind of funny that the link you found claims that he lied about the statements he made anyway...) Do you have any specific objections to the suggestion above about adding the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_controversy.html" title="Christmas controversy">Christmas controversy</a> link to the See also section, and adding additional information there? --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 18:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The O'Reilly source fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for coming to a hypothesis that Best Buy has a no-christmas policy. You have to see no further than the title of the article, <i>O'Reilly falsely claimed Best Buy employee confirmed ban on "Merry Christmas"</i> because the conversation is between O'Reilly and a customer. Even if the conversation was between O'Reilly and an employee, it would probably still fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> because there is no way he can verify who he is talking to. <a href="../../../t/u/x/User%7ETuxide_b7c3.html" title="User:Tuxide">Tuxide</a> 02:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think you read what I wrote. I mentioned O'Reilly's coverage because it implies that criticisms (whether true or false) generated significant controversy. This rebuts the charges that the criticism applied to retailers in general or that the controversy was minor.</p>
<p>Please note everything in the actual Wikipedia article (see below) is fully backed by the AP article. The comments from the Catholic League and the AFA are taken from their respective websites. These citations satisfy the WP:V criterion.</p>

<p>B2bomber81 and other opponents of the no-Christmas paragraph have 3 main objections:</p>
<ul>
<li>veracity</li>
<li>notability</li>
<li>specificity</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how I have addressed these objections</p>
<ul>
<li>Veracity: It is backed by the AP story.</li>
<li>Notability: It has received much media attention, including snopes and O'Reilly</li>
<li>Specificity: There is a Best-Buy-specific campaign by the AFA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any other objections? 148.87.1.170 14 February, 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, let me break this down for you.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Veracity: It is NOT backed by the AP article. The AP article simply stated that Best Buy was not using the word "Christmas" in its advertising. Don't add anything to it, don't take anything from it. Your contribution is not based on the AP article, it's based on lies told by O'Reilly.</li>

<ul>
<li>If you read my contribution, you'll find no mention or citation of O'Reilly. My contribution contains two things. (1) It contains BBY spokeswoman Dawn Bryant's quote about Best Buy policy. (2) It mentions the AFA and the Catholic League's negative reaction. That's it. My contribution is <b>100% factual</b>. 148.87.1.170 14 February, 2007</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Notability: Again, you use O'Reilly as a basis for notability, as well as Snopes. Not sufficient evidence for notability. You've been told that several times already. Get over it. It is insufficient.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Is the Associated Press sufficient?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Specificity: The AF-who? Who cares? Their campaign was based on (again) the lies were told by O'Reilly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire "No Christmas Controversy" is a sham started by O'Reilly, then it cascaded into the AFA's ban of Best Buy which was based on O'Reillys lies in the first place. Your contribution is based on nothing, which makes it inappropriate for Wikipedia. Go find something else to occupy your time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Your AFA-got-it-from-O'Reilly claim is wrong. The American Family Association started its campaign on Nov. 10, 2006. This is <b>well before</b> Bill O'Reilly's feature on the Best Buy policy, which aired Nov. 29, 2006.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The AFA campaign is based exclusively on the AP article. See this link to confirm: <a href="http://www.afa.net/petitions/email/bestbuy_11102006.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afa.net/petitions/email/bestbuy_11102006.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>148.87.1.170 14 February, 2007</li>

<p>I have come to a solution that will satisfy my end on the inclusion of a no-christmas paragraph. The paragraph can exist only if the templates {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EContent_672a.html" title="Template:Content">content</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} are above it. The use of the first template requires that the disputed content should stop being removed. The reason that I am bringing this up is to keep this thing from being edit-warred over, and to encourage discussion on this topic from other Wikipedians. By proposing this I do not mean to imply <a href="../../../d/n/f/WP%7EDNFT_2f6f.html" title="WP:DNFT">WP:DNFT</a>, because I do not want to label anyone with <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">WP:TROLL</a> yet; however this will go to <a href="../../../w/q/a/WP%7EWQA_4730.html" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a> if this discussion continues irrespective of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a> rule.

<dd>It's quite clear that this person, only identified as 148.87.1.170, 148.87.1.170 and 24.218.124.62, is an obvious vandal. My only regret is that I kept arguing with the troll instead of just following warning procedure to get him banned. If you look at his contribs, he's got a long history of vandalism. A consensus was reached already that this content does not meet Notability guidelines. Yes, it meets verifiability guidelines because it was published by Associate Press. But the argument for notability was that the AFA and Catholic League mention it on their website. This does not satisfy [[WP:Notability]. It states <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and of each other.</i> I think the page needs to be reverted back to version #108339637. Lastly, we need to return to the discussion of whether a Criticism section should even be kept on this page. It's well documented in Wikipedia guidelines that Criticism sections only serve to attract trolls and spawn frequent edit-wars. <a href="../../../b/2/b/User%7EB2bomber81_4a7a.html" title="User:B2bomber81">B2bomber81</a> 07:25, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Furthermore, I am strongly convinced that there is a user, or a group of users on Wikipedia that has been <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a> this subject onto multiple retailer articles.

<dd>I agree. You will notice you won't see this information posted on the Catholic League or AFA articles. Just the retailers. If this is such a major issue for the CL and the AFA, I find it interesting that such effort hasn't been made to get this information posted on THEIR articles. My proposition is that this be removed from the Best Buy article, and that the appropriate information be added to the CL's and AFA's article. For example, the CL's quote could be posted on their article, and the AFA's quote could be posted on theirs.

<dd>My opinion is to do what <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticism_8870.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Wikipedia:Criticism</a> says, and I know it's an essay. In the past, there has been some movement to make it a guideline. My interpretation is that the passage should go into <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_controversy.html" title="Christmas controversy">christmas controversy</a>, and a wikilink to this article should go into the <i>See also</i> section of the Best Buy, Catholic League, and American Family Association articles, etc. I am considering posting a request on <a href="../../../w/q/a/WP%7EWQA_4730.html" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a> merely for some outside opinions on this, since my opinion can no longer be considered "outside". Also, this talk page needs to be archived, and the active topics (prominently this one) needs to be refactored into a few bullet points. See <a href="../../../t/a/r/Talk%7ETarget_Corporation_7f8f.html" title="Talk:Target Corporation">Talk:Target Corporation</a> for a good example on a refactored talk page after archival.

<dd>I'm working on the archive and bullet points already, and planning on posting it in the next day or so. Yes, some outside opinions are definitely a must at this point.

You seem to want to segregate the "War-on-Christmas" criticism of Best Buy, Wal Mart, and other retailers into its own article. But as mentioned above, <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a>'s criticism of <a href="../../../k/f/c/KFC_5346.html" title="KFC">KFC</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus_4aef.html" title="Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus">Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</a> is integrated in articles for both the source and target of criticism. As the PETA precedent suggests, integrated criticism sections are standard and reasonable. 24.218.124.62</p>

<dd>Fast-food restaurants and circuses are outside the scope of <a href="../../../r/e/t/WP%7ERETAIL_3d59.html" title="WP:RETAIL">WikiProject Retailing</a>; therefore I am not really interested in them. The inclusion of this content is also disputed. If I had a say, content should remain in the PETA article, and the articles <a href="../../../k/f/c/KFC_5346.html" title="KFC">KFC</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus_4aef.html" title="Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus">Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</a> should have a link to <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a> in its <i>See also</i> section.

<p>I read long ago that Best Buy wanted to expand to Puerto Rico,does anyone have any info?</p>

<dd>The store locator lists Puerto Rico as an option, and Best Buy press releases say that they have stores in PR <a href="../../../b/g/o/User%7EBgold4_6969.html" title="User:Bgold4">Bgold4</a> 04:50, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have received horrible service/prices----(they broke my computer via geeksquad+ told me I needed a service I didn't and said it was the only way to fix my computer+the extended service plan is made so that they have complete control over it so if they sais it's ok--it's ok(even if broken)+the "staff" there could not POSSIBLY be an worse) and I have noticed the mass amount of lawsuits filed against best buy along with anti-best buy sites such-as "bestbuysux.org" so I think it would be a viable idea to add a "Ethics Standard" section or something similar(same general idea, but it explains how best buy TREATS customers....not just how people THINK best buy treats customers(and the site I mentioned earlier would explain what I mean).....<a href="../../../d/e/x/User%7EDextrone_e5e2.html" title="User:Dextrone">Dextrone</a> 00:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is not a journal of personal incidences.
