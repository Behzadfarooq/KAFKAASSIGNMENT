<p><i>The head of the North Ossetian security service said that he was certain now that the guerrillas had located their point of attack well in advance and had not simply rushed into the school on Wednesday, the first day of the academic year, on the spur of the moment.</i></p>
<p>(it goes on in detail naming sources)</p>
<p>From my memory of reading russian translations, I recall a boy saying he wanted to see the renovation work done in summer (so it seems likely there was work done around July), an adult hostage claiming he was forced to rip up floorboards to expose the hidden cache.</p>
<p>I haven't time now, but later this section could be expanded with at least what is being said by named sources. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibob_130d.html" title="User:Wikibob">Wikibob</a> | <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibob_a563.html" title="User talk:Wikibob">Talk</a> 19:54, 2004 Sep 6 (UTC)</p>

<p>The parliamentary commission had proved that the russian security forces threw flaming grenades on the gym's roof, setting it on fire and provoking most part of the casualties in it (<i>"After the front page"</i>, documentary from Frank Müller, Germany, 2005). --madtibo 22:08, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it happened at all, they were stun and flash grenades. Even if it were true, a fire on the roof would not cause any casualties at all. Give me a break. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 01:48, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You should check the parlementary commission conclusions or watch the documentary by Franck Müller. It says the Russian security forces have used flaming grenades on the gym's roof, setting it on fire. The roof collapse and made many casualties. I really hate terrorist acts but the Russian way of dealing with it is really harsh, and I'm not surprised something like that had happened. There have been more than 344 casualties (three times more according to beslanhope.org <a href="http://www.beslanhope.org/what_happened.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.beslanhope.org/what_happened.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) and maybe some died in a fire caused by the Russian security forces!! If you are positive the security forces haven't done it, maybe we should speak about the two hypothesis... And I won't "give you a break"!!! --madtibo 09:29, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The bombs strung up in the gym caused the roof collapse by knocking out supports. A fire on a roof, especially an old roof, would take a very long time to collapse. You could run through the gym 30 times before that would happen. That is not to say the Russian "solution" did not exacerbate the problem, mostly with shooting, but the fact that many were not saved or in fact killed because of this is already mentioned in the article. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 13:53, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Government and Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Now this is just a consideration, but I thought it may be worthwhile to add a section about how the (Russian) government has handled this tragedy in terms of political situation management. So far, the let's-get-bloody-revenge response seems to instead be one of we-have-handled-this-astoundingly-poorly in terms of attitude, at least on the part of the (Russian) president. I could be horribly wrong here, but I'm only going by what the papers tell me.</p>
<p>There is also a very good chance that this is irrelevant or too dubious (with regards to neutrality) a point to make at all. Just a thought. I havent added anything to this tune to the article itself. --<a href="../../../o/c/e/User%7EOceanhahn_678f.html" title="User:Oceanhahn">Oceanhahn</a> 09:01, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was an anti-terror demonstration (антитеррористический митинг/antiterroristicheski miting), not an anti-war. Word "anti-war" has completly different meaning. I hope we don't start edit war again...</p>
<p><i>At the "demonstration" no oppositional members of the parliament spoke to the citizens, because the Kremlin ordered so.</i> <i>According to European media channels, the Russian government has ordered the Russian TV stations to broadcast the event with a 10 minutes delay, so the government could censor raging or critical overtones.</i></p>
<p>Where did you get that? Lazy Ranma 00:12, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>As far as I understand, the telephone-gram asks the managers of the local companies to provide 10 persons each for _participation_ in the meeting. Your comment suggests that the order asks to provide security guards. I understand the USSR traditions are pretty much embedded into the bureaucrats' memories so they act just as some 20 years ago. I cannot blame people for not being citizens enough and for not criticizing the government at the meeting as I emigrated 6 years ago. <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlgiz_5b54.html" title="User:Ilgiz">ilgiz</a> 16:38, Sep 8, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>They were not <i>forced</i>. How do you imagine this? I think that schools', institutes' and public enterprises' directors allowed their students and workers to leave early to the damonstration.

<p>I do wonder how a hypocrious scum like you would sound like, if those happened to be your children! I see not even the slightest difference between US soldiers killing Iraqi kids (i cant imagine them doing that on a purpose) and arab assasins shooting children in backs it the courtyard of the Ossetin school. It anything depended on me , both kind of murderers would have to idle away their scrawny lives serving a lifetime sentence in the worst prison on Earth. Cacofiend 18:33, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Cynical- Do you have any sources showing that Allied forces in Iraq have purposely killed children or taken them hostage? When the Soviets were attacking Berlin, they also killed many children - are they terrorists? They must have known that children would be harmed. I would guess that the conquering of Berlin was a military strategy. I guess that those German children were just collateral damage. (Although the USA was never directly attacked by Nazi Germany, I am proud that Americans finally recognized there was no option of diplomacy with Hitler.) At Beslan the hostage takers were clearly terrorists. They shot and terrorized children before the final battle. I would call those children civilians. And I would call the hostage-takers terrorists. Anyone here who says they weren't terrorists without going into more history and comparisons? WhyerdWhyerd 12:48, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wonder when we will start calling Russian army terrorist. Hundreds of thousands of Chechens have left their homes since the beginning of the war and their stories are really terrible.

<dd>Seems peculiar to put the emphasis on the siege rather than the hostage taking. It was the actions of the hostage takers, not those who besieged them, that led to the carnage. If one were to go by Google, "Beslan terrorist attack" would be correct. Of course, we won't use that at Wikipedia, because these fine gentlemen and ladies might be freedom-fighters. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 12:08, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have a point here about the naming of the article. On the matter of people's reluctance to use the term "terrorist" I think we should be clear that no one editing this article is seeking to defend these people, it's just that the word is pejorative and therefore POV, which doesn't belong in Wikipedia. Any sane person would indeed consider these people to be terrorists and wouldn't dream of defending their actions, but that doesn't mean they should describe them as such in an objective article. The best analogy I can give you is that the article on <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> doesn't say "Hitler was evil" even though only the dangerously deluded would seek to defend him. That article describes Hitler's actions and lets the facts speak for themselves, and we should be doing the same here. That is <b>not</b> equivalent to allowing for the possibility that the hostage-takers might be better viewed as freedom-fighters. Perhaps the best solution is to simply refer to them as hostage-takers, which is incontrovertible fact, as "militants" does carry a slight tone of conspicuous political correctness. I notice that TV news here (Britain) seems to have adopted this approach: they usually tend to avoid "terrorist" and prefer "militant" except in this case where they can say "hostage-taker" without attracting accusations of political axe-grinding. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 14:11, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Terrorism has nothing to do with morality - someone thinks terrorism is bad, someone thinks terrorism is good. Terrorisam is hostile actions against civilians.

<p>I think "terrorism" is appropriate; it was clearly meant to scare Russians into backing their government's reconquest of oil-bearing Chechnya, and fluff up the general antimuslim sentiment in the rest of the world. (Russia's one of the few backing Iran against the US right now; WTF would muslims p*ss off one of their only big-gun friedns?) There's no way anyone clever enough to have organised this could not have foreseen that no matter how well it went, let alone with balky behaviour. And the Russians, insanely, attack the place and kill nearly everyone who could say who was really behind this. I, myself, believe "terrorist", but I don't believe "Chechen/muslim" (thus "insurgence/resistence/militants/etc") one iota. This was a Shrub-Sharon operation (which doesn't rule out "al Qaida"<a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=241042&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=5&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y&amp;itemNo=241042" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=241042&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=5&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y&amp;itemNo=241042" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.propagandamatrix.com/palestinians_arrest_al_qaeda_poseurs.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.propagandamatrix.com/palestinians_arrest_al_qaeda_poseurs.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>) to bring Putin onside, in which Putin would be a vaguely willing (tho unwitting) participant because of the ambitions on Chechnya. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwantus_5aca.html" title="User:Kwantus">Kwantus</a> 15:26, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Has it not occured to you that just perhaps everyone taking part in this debate agrees with you that these people are, as you put it, vile murderers, and indeed terrorists? Maybe if you can grasp that you can move on to the concept of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> and understand why in an encyclopedia it's probably better to avoid such terms, however true they might be. A professional news service wouldn't use such phrases as "vile murderers" except when quoting someone else, and that's the tried and tested approach we like to follow here. The facts speak for themselves: these people were murderers, they were terrorists, and what they were responsible for was one of the most depraved and despicable acts of violence I have ever had the misfortune to hear of, but such assertions just don't belong in an encyclopedia.

<dd>If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, why should not it be called a duck, instead of "anatidae"? Because some ducks would feel that it's a pejorative term? Or because some news outlets like to call own ducks "ducks", but ducks from other countries "anatidae"? If there is a common word correctly describing a certain activity, why should not it be used to describe it? "Vile murderers" is a bad example because it would require explaining why this murder was particularly vile compare to other murders. And why don't you try to visit a Wiki page on 9/11 and try to remove the word "terrorist" there. Just go there and replace it with something neutral.

<p>I agree on using the term terrorists. A terrorist, as per Wiki description, is the correct term here - because civilians were targeted. It's not a moral issue, a moral issue is what one thinks of terrorists. Hostage-takers is a good term, but terrorists is a more narrow one and fully applicable under the circumstances. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolver_6882.html" title="User:Solver">Solver</a> 20:52, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also think it's important that the article makes clear that the hostage-takers were terrorists, and it should do that by making reference to the usual definition of terrorism. If these people weren't terrorists then I wonder who on earth is? I don't think that fact is at issue here though. This is only speculation, but I would hazard a guess that the US media describes people as terrorists more readily than in other parts of the world, and so to American eyes an article which uses the term "terrorists" throughout is less striking than it would be to European eyes. If you look at, for example, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3627586.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3627586.stm" rel="nofollow">this analysis</a> by the BBC, they use "hostage-takers", "militants" and "attackers" but not "terrorists", because it's a loaded term they consider to be best avoided in neutral reporting of events. I think perhaps the term has a subtly different meaning in different countries, with the US standing out as an example of a country where it's routinely used in factual reporting. This is just conjecture on my part, but it would appear to explain why Americans in particular can become enraged when hearing terrorists called by a different name, as if whoever's doing the naming is trying to diminish their actions. I hope this matter can be cleared up to everyone's satisfaction, and then we can remove the NPOV notice which makes Wikipedia look bad, particularly as this article must be getting very high traffic as we speak. I invite others to comment on my view of things. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 21:42, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a very fair point. Even our article on terrorism here mentions that the term is politically loaded. However, that political load is usually visible as people who don't use terrorist tactics (by definition) are called terrorists. Strictly speaking, a suicide bomber in Iraq who attacks a US Army base and kills US soldiers, can't be called a terrorist, as he targets military personnel. He's an insurgent, militant, rebel or an attacker then. Those, however, who take civilian hostages, suicide bomb civilian locations (like buses in Israel), etc., they are terrorists by definition.</dd>

<dd>I think that, as long as this article links the word "terrorists" to the respective article, it's fine - anyone who clicks the link will see that these people were indeed terrorists, by any definition. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolver_6882.html" title="User:Solver">Solver</a> 21:57, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<p>Calling the neutral naming conventions a hypocrisy is single sided in the sense that actions of state military personnel can sometimes also be called terrorist. Even Putin was surprised to see Grozny destroyed to the ground when he flew over it in a helicopter few months ago. It is also known that some consider military conflicts within the state not subject to international law.

<p>Could the word 'perpetrators' maybe be not only less emotiv but also more accurate. "Terrorist" as I've always understood the word, is someone who attempts to achieve specific goals through the use of terror as an immediate and also ongoing threat. This usually, but not exclusively, involves identifying the act of terror with a cause, demand or movement. Without this identification, any such action becomes random terror, which would be hard put to achieve anything for anyone. (Other than opportunistic politicians perhaps)</p>

<dd>Yes, that would not be neutral, as it's pretty unlikely that the two had anything to do with each other. The Chechens have issues with Russia, not with the United States, so that would be a little bit far-fetched, and I haven't heard a single commentator suggesting such a thing.</dd>

<dd>I'm happy with hostage-taker or terrorist - anything but militant, because it's a weasel word. I don't quite understand what you mean, however, Marvin. You seem to be arguing against the use of the term terrorist, but your definition (attempting to achieve a specific political goal) fits this exactly. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:02, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the point (main) i was trying to make was that, until such times as the perps have identified themselves or been positively identified, it's perhaps a bit erroneous to tie them in to a particular group or type of people. One thing I picked up during all this was that at first came claims for the chechen cause as passed on by the Russian government, then all of a sudden they were taken back. During the same news broadcast it was mentioned that an expert mediator was brought in to talk to the killers, and she, as I understood it, made a statement after * hours of discussion with these people, to the effect that, as far as she was concerned they had nothing to do with any chechen freedom fighter/terrorist/guerrilla forces whatsoever. Her opinion, I feel, is bolstered by the actual 'identified terrorists' being from places outwith Russia. Such an atrocity can be given a lot of names and descriptions which are all open to debate, but the common part of all their definitions is probably 'criminal'. And until such times as any other definition is established, shouldn't we all treat it as just that? I don't know what news coverage you saw, but after the bits i saw (eg. the large number of parents suffering outside who looked more Chechian and less Russian), Al-Queada/Bin Laden or Bush/oil concerns are as likely candidates if not more likely than chechen people to be behind it. If so, then the way must be opened for Presidents, Prime Ministers, Kanzlern etc. to be branded terrorists in the media. Otherwise there's an implied immunity which is totally unjust. As for the commentators, (if it were the USA + pals behind this) maybe it would be too big and too hideous a crime to imagine. Or want to imagine. Not to mention them personally being implicated by assosiation. make any sense? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarvin_Sunday_a6b6.html" title="User:Marvin Sunday">Marvin Sunday</a> 04:02, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that "terrorist" is an accurate description of the hostage-takers (they targeted and killed innocent civilians to create a climate of terror and achieve political aims), in the same way that there is no doubt that Hitler was a mass-murderer. Still we shouldn't use the word "terrorist" all over the article to refer to the hostage-takers for the same reason that we don't use "mass-murderer" in the Hitler article in that way. "Terrorist" doesn't add anything that isn't clear from the facts already, it is actually less precise than "hostage-takers". A paragraph on terrorism in the Russian-Chechen conflict would be useful though and should address concerns if anyone really worries that readers might be left wondering if this was an act of terrorism. Those who insist on using the word "terrorist" are not motivated by a desire to be <i>factual</i>, but by an (understandable) urge to express their moral condemnation. While I agree, of course with the moral condemnation, this is not the place for morally charged debates (it only leads to dubious comments like <i>"europeans are well known for their hypocrisy and ignorance" "it was not your country that have been hit by that fuckheaded morons""only arab assasins and one negro"</i> etc.) The point is that Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i> not the Bible - people come here to get factual information not to get told about right and wrong, good and evil. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 09:13, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now a probably began to understand you. May be russian and european people have different meaning for word "terrorist". For me everyone who targets civilians and only civilians is terrorist by definition. Just because terrorist is man or woman who targets civilians. Looks like people in EU and US thinks that terrorists are very-very-very bad people, that is why this word cannot be used in article (but aren't those who kills hundreds of innocent children very "bad" people?). But here in Russia some divisions and actions of revolutionary parties of Russian empire are called terrorism in textbooks of history. If I am not mistaken, even in the Soviet textbooks. Lazy Ranma 12:31, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you, I see your point that there may be differences in how the term is used. The thing is that Wikipedia is not there to label some as "very-very-very bad people", even if we all think that's what they are. The hostage-takers are doubtlessly terrorists but we should avoid emotive terms; the word should be mentioned in the article (like now, in the introduction) but it should not be used throughout. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 13:24, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

The point is that the BBC don't use their authority as an objective news source to label anyone as a terrorist (even when it's completely uncontroversial), thereby remaining outside the debate of who is and who is not a terrorist. Wikipedia is best served by attempting to achieve a similar non-emotive matter-of-fact attitude (even in completely uncontroversial cases like the Beslan massacre). - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 10:22, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>this article can be used as a straightforward description of the terrorists' actions. They do however talk about such things as "the threat from global terrorism." I have been thinking more about usage of the word and I wonder if it might have something to do with the longer history of terrorism in Europe, and the fact that it has generally come from within instead of overseas. If you take the example of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_cef2.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> the BBC have always had to be careful about how to refer to them because of the old cliché that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom-fighter. There are other examples all over Europe, particularly such groups as <a href="../../../e/t/a/ETA_5e56.html" title="ETA">ETA</a>, where, like in Northern Ireland, part of a political movement for independence uses violence, which may be considered justified by some sections of the community. The US on the other hand has been notably free of terrorism, and when the 2001 attacks took place they were perpetrated by people from outside with no significant support base inside the country. This is a different situation, and allows the US media to use the word terrorist without offending anyone. This is not to say that in this article anyone is trying to suggest the terrorists could be viewed as freedom-fighters and therefore we should try to avoid offending people, it's got more to do with the different usage of the word that has developed outside the US. "Terrorist" is an emotive term which is striking in a news report or encyclopedia article — it tends to make it look more like an opinion piece. As for the Lockerbie attack you may have noticed that the page you linked to was not a news report as such and so is probably not held to the same standards. The BBC does have a more tabloid, sensationalist side to them outside of their direct reporting of news. Note also that the article also uses the phrase "mass murder" another emotive term (though correct), which would suggest that the piece adheres only loosely to their news guidelines.
<dl>
<dd>Well, I fail to see why a perfectly valid term cannot be used to describe an activity if the term is the definition of that activity. Say, theft is called theft, not "involuntary wealth redistribution". And also, if you propose such a significant policy change, I would really like to see you change the word "terrorism" on the page <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> to something more neutral.

<dd>Part of the reason for the hesitancy in the use of the word terrorist in some media organisations must be the fact that the events are still on-going and not properly understood. Older terrorist attacks can be recognised and named as such. Large media organisation must be aware that their reporting of an event as it happens may even prejudice the outcome, even in international reporting. If Wikipedia continues to grow as is seen as a legitimate source of information and news it should also recognise this. In the erly hours of the event "hostage takers" was the best word soon after the event degenerated that became rather an insult.

<p>I've been trying to find the initial news reports on BBC. None of them use the word "terrorist", sometimes they use "terror" in a very careful way but that is quite different. (In fact the BBC is constantly attacked by Israel and pro-Israeli organisations because they refuse to call Palestinian terrorists "terrorist".) Their language seems to be very consistant in the news reports (not the opnion and analytical pieces). Oh, and just for the record, I'm not defending the BBC as ideal, I often find the BBC coverage (of other issues) biased, but compared with other news outlets they are pretty good and careful about inflammatory language. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 17:29, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In summary, they only use it when they quote other people, or when others have used the term - but they don't label anyone a terrorist.

I certainly meant no offence or I should probably apologize if that's what it sounded like. On the other hand , i distinctly recall lord Judd's comments in front of EU parliament when he was all but writhing trying to defend those who later claimed resposibility for the explosions in Moscow and Budennovsk. I did not mean that it was news correspondents who was calling Basaev or Maskhadov freedom fighters, but, for example, perhaps you would explain me by what right was the terrorist's emissar Zakaev harboured so willingly in London, since he calls himself an official representative of those who confessed in terrorism and mass murder?

<p>I cannot agree with the practice of use of the words like "hostage-takers" and even "rebels" instead of the clear term "terrorists" in this article. It is not violation of NPOV, these people are terrorists by any POV (I believe by terrorists itself POV), at least I know nobody who can say that murderers of children in this crisis can be named just as "hostage-takers". They are murderers, killers, assassins, they have no excuse and you just want to name them as "hostage-takers". It's not NPOV, it's a lie. If they would understood that their crime is unbelievable and released all hostages without any harm for them we will name them as "hostage-takers", it will be correct. But they are not only "hostage-takers", they murdered innocent children, so "terrorists" is the mildest term they deserved (for me it's neutral enough, at least I know some English words that are more appropriate for these people, but they are not in format of Wikipedia). I don't want to evaluate these people by themself, it's not a point here. Who knows may be in the past they were very nice people and were kind as Santa-Claus, but in this crisis their behaviour is named "terrorism" for sure. So I reverted these "hostage-takers" and "rebels" to "terrorists" to remove the lie. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximaximax_5f36.html" title="User:Maximaximax">Maximaximax</a> 12:07, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apart from the whole 'one mans terrorist...' argument, hostage-taker is more accurate. Someone who assassinates a world leader could be described as a 'terrorist'. Someone who hijacks an airplane could be described as a 'terrorist'. Someone who blows themself up could be described as a 'terrorist'.

Everyone also agrees that <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was an evil mass murderer, but it doesn't say that in the article, because it's still POV, however true it might be. Ask yourself why respected sources of news don't use the word terrorist? Is it because they think what these people did was not actually that bad? The answer is of course no. They don't use the word because it's POV. <b>The facts speak for themselves.</b> It makes Wikipedia look amateurish to have an article which is full of the word terrorist. People don't come to Wikipedia to get moral judgements, they come for the facts, and that is what we should be supplying. I would like to urge you again to read everything that's already been said on this talk page, and the same goes for anyone else who comes across this article for the first time. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 13:01, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I hope so. That's what I was originally trying to avoid by changing the conspicuously politically correct word "militants" into the factual "hostage-takers", but it seems to have met with limited success. If possible some of the sentences should be reworded slightly to avoid having to make the choice, but we can't avoid it all together. By the way, I don't object to the hostage-takers being described as terrorists, as long as it's qualified somehow so that it's clear we are being objective and factual and not just using an emotive term. What I object to is wholesale replacement of all the words that are used with "terrorist" which makes the whole article read very badly and looks unprofessional. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 14:04, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To repeat what I wrote above: some of those who insist on using the word "terrorist" are not motivated by a desire to be factual, but by an (understandable) urge to express their moral condemnation. While I agree, of course with the moral condemnation, this is not the place for morally charged debates. The point is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a moralistic authority - people come here to get factual information not to get told about right and wrong, good and evil. I don't know if we are 100% consistent, but at least we try (e.g. avoiding the term "dictator" including for people like <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Jong-il_a8a4.html" title="Kim Jong-il">Kim Jong-il</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>) - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 14:21, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like that there is no "rebels" in this article anymore, but I see that my explanation why we shall use the word "terrorists" instead of "hostage-takers" was not understood, I guess it was because of my bad English, sorry. So I will explain more detaily. You missed my explanation that they are not only "hostage-takers". They are "hostage-killers", "hostage-murderers", etc. "Hostage-takers" we can name people who take hostages, but after a while they released them without any harm. But these terrorists were gangsters, "bandits" (rus.), they are not takers, they had noi intention to save lives of their hostages - they started to kill them from the beginning of the action. So, if you think that using of the term "terrorists" throughout the article looks "unprofessional", change some of them to killers, murderes and gangsters, I think it will be okay with NPOV. As for me using name "terrorists" for terrorists does not look throughout the article about a terrorist incident does not look "unprofessional". For example, if you write an article about crocodiles you call them crocodiles but not green americans, sorry. I will not revert edits again, please do it by yourself, I hope now you understand why it's necessary to do it. AGAIN: they are NOT ONLY "hostage-takers", they performed much worse crime, so they MUST be named accordingly <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximaximax_5f36.html" title="User:Maximaximax">Maximaximax</a> 14:51, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, I understand what you mean. I agree partially whith what you are saying. However "hostage-takers" in no way implies anything as to the fate of the hostages - clearly any reader of the article will know what their eventual fate was&#160;; I don't think there's any evidence that makes it clear that they planned to kill all the hostages from the beginning. I'm not hung-up on any particular word&#160;: in one context "terrorist" may be the most to-the-point in another it maybe "hostage-taker" and there are other suitable terms. However it is not acceptable to use highly emotive words like "terrorist" throughout. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 15:09, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with pir and Trilobite about avoiding the moral charges here. It is something that I found unusual when I left Russia. Maximaximax, I agree as everybody else that the perpetrators were terrorists and inhumane. But giving some space to the readers' judgement is what I liked in the Western culture. My words may sound offensive and only spoiling this discussion by distorting the pir's and Trilobite's point of view. I am only trying to add some emotional dimension to my understanding of situation. The urge to divide the points of view into "ours" and "theirs" is all too common in Russian state-backed newspapers and TV channels, and this give justification to hatred towards any non-Slavic national residing in Russia. I am probably offending Maximaximax or Cacofiend by measuring people by the country of origin, but keep in mind I myself am from Russia and I understand the emotional part of a Russian soul as it was always more important than the judgemental part. What pir and Trilobite are saying, in my understanding, is that they don't want wikipedia be a part of the search for moral questions. I understand such separation of data from judgement as a great cultural achievement of the West. <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlgiz_5b54.html" title="User:Ilgiz">Ilgiz</a> 15:20, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am really interested in learning the newspeak. What would you call a person, who steals? What would you call a man who had forced sex with a woman against her will?

<dd>a) One can easily see the elements of this culture in the newspaper articles where a suspect is called a suspect until he/she is sentenced.
<dl>
<dd>True, but I don't think it's relevant now. Can you actually provide a term which you would use to describe a person who, say, is convicted of rape? See, no one questions the fact that this was a terrorist attack. No one questions the fact that attackers/hostage takes really existed. So, there were people who participated in a terrorist attack. Why not call them terrorists? Not some particular Joe or Ahmed, but the group as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But mistakes happen even in the court system, as the 27 year improsonment of Milgaard has shown. b) It is already known that an injured person who only _looked like a militant_ was beaten to death by the crowd just moments after he was brought from the school.
<dl>
<dd>Do you feel a moral right to pass judgement? Suppose it was your child there and you saw an armed stranger coming out of school who quite possibly killed your child. How would you personally act? Would you keep cool and protect him from others? Remember, this is a small town. They probably know each other by face. Would you advocate sentencing the specific father who actually killed the gunman for unpremeditated murder? Would you advocate sentencing the others who participated in beating for assult?</dd>

<p>I think it's important to include in the article that this was a terrorist action, at the moment the first reference to the hostage-takers in the article says the school "was seized by armed Chechen and Arab terrorists" which I think covers this. We don't want to give the impression that anyone is trying to deny they were terrorists. However, to use the word throughout the rest of the article makes it emotive, when it should be a detached record of the facts. Your objection to the use of "hostage-takers" instead of "hostage-killers" is understandable, but "hostage-takers" is a more established phrase, "hostage-killers" would sound like it had been deliberately made up to sound emotive. If we can concentrate on improving the rest of the article, which is what I would like to try and do now, we will have something that describes what happened sufficiently accurately and in sufficient detail to make it quite clear to anyone what a terrible thing this was. I really do think letting the facts speak for themselves is the best approach in these cases. I hope we are all coming to some agreement now, if there are specific parts of the article you think are still worded wrongly please do bring them up. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 15:21, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Why this article contains lie</b> I was very disappointed with the fact that you insist to use the term "hostage-takers" instead of "terrorists" in this article. I see 2 reasons for it: 1) we have different meaning of these words in different languages so my understanding of these terms is far from the real English, I hope it is the real reason of this discussion; 2) it is your way to hide the truth, I belive it is not so. To hide some part of truth is a lie, I hope you understand it. I will repeat again: we may not reference these people as "hostage-takers". It's not because of morality, it's because of facts. I don't know, may be I really have a lack of correct English, so you always misunderstand me, but again I will explain using an example. Just imagine: a person steals a car. How we will reference him in the article about this action? As a thief. But if he killed a driver to stole this car we may not reference him as a thief, because he is also a murderer. So we may name him as murderer (because it is worse crime) or criminal (because it is more general word, including both murderer and thief), but not as a thief (because then we hide that he was also a murderer). The same we have in this article, we may name these people as terrorists or criminals (because meaning of these words include both hostage-takers and murderers), but we cannot name them as hostage-takers because this kind of crime is not so bad as a murder. When we call them hostage-takers we hide a part of truth, so it's a lie. I'm sure that in Wikipedia must be no lie, so we must correct the article. We may use hostage-takers in the text sometimes, but at least not more often as terrorsists, criminals or gangsters. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximaximax_5f36.html" title="User:Maximaximax">Maximaximax</a> 06:03, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maximaximax, I honestly think the issue here is language, and not POV. As the article is <i>at the moment</i>, with a clear statement that the school was seized by <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorists</a> in the intro, with no gratitious dwelling on the word, is fair. How can you say we are hiding the fact it was a terrorist attack when it's right there, in the introduction? I would, however, also object to complete removal of the word. As for "hostage-takers", I assume you are not familiar enough with the english language to realize that it is a "coined" expression, whereas "hostage-killer" is not. I really think, therefore, that in such questions of <i>style</i>, you should just believe the natives (who may well disagree among themselves, still). Again, nobody is attemting to hide the atrocity. I think the mere facts are accusation enough. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 06:47, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>what's the point (sarcasm?)? The outcome will obviously be <i>Use the emotive terms sparingly when appropriate</i>, and that's what we're supposed to achieve here <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 11:40, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with a system-wide policy, but I also dislike emotive terminology. Finding middle ground here is more useful than a single regulation which deals with all entries regardless of their nature. With that said, however, I should also say that it is only my opinion and that I also feel that a precedent may actually cause more confusion than it resolves.</dd>
<dd>For what it's worth, I support hostage-takers over terrorists, but only because the later is so devastatingly overused these days. In terms of technicality, the definition of '<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a>', such as it is, seems to fit the circumstances more or less exactly (so I say), but that would also mean that the term '<a href="../../../m/u/r/Murderer.html" title="Murderer">murderer</a>' -- maybe even '<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_murderer.html" title="Mass murderer">mass murderer</a>' -- could be hung upon them. Frankly, I dont see the fault in this, but we're not here for what I think. We're here for facts, perhaps a little opinion. And in the best interests of objectivity, "hostage-takers", though loathsomely plain, seems to be the best fit.</dd>
<dd>I hope that helps.</dd>

<dd>Okay, I hope it will help. I believe you that the problem is in language. It looks very strange for me but probably in English "terrorist" is an emotive term. In Russian it is not so, it is just legal term, nothing else. And anyway I don't understand why you always skip my opinion that "hostage-takers" is very narrow term for these people. It is like name of "programmers" as "computer users". May be really in English "to take hostages" means that these hostages may be also killed by these "hostage-takers" and they will still remain "hostage-takers". I'm not native in English and may be I cannot understand Western culture as well, but I had to express my opinion, and for sure in Russian version of this article the word "terrorist" and "bandit" will be used instead of "hostage-takers". It's not because of emotions and morality, it's because of facts and may be differences between our languages and cultures. If you still want to explain me how it could be that people who did A and B where A and B are subset of C, are referred only by A but not by C (as a common term) , and B is missed completely - I will very appreciate it, may be it will change my opinion as well. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximaximax_5f36.html" title="User:Maximaximax">Maximaximax</a> 09:34, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

As a person for whom russian is native language i should probably clarify a few things. Most people in Russian have not even the faintest idea of the thing which is called "polite-correctnes", if I'm not mistaken. We do not call things other than we see them. Terrorist is called terrorist, and that not the only example. An american friend of mine was genuinely schocked when he was called a negro, not knowing that there is no other definition for a black-skinned person in the russian language.

<p>This proposal does look quite reasonable, and I would ideally like to see a system-wide policy — for consistency and because that's what professional news organisations do. However, looking at the controversy that's erupted on this article alone, I think trying to achieve such a thing would provoke massive edit warring all over Wikipedia. We have managed to do things in a civilised way here I think; there has been heated discussion but no personal attacks or excessive back-and-forth reverting. It would be much more difficult to avoid hostility if people went round all terrorism-related articles trying to "enforce policy", whatever that might end up as. It's emerged over the course of this discussion that in the US and Russia the word "terrorism" is used more readily than elsewhere, so we are always going to have readers arriving at articles, being outraged at what they perceive as the overuse or underuse of the word and going through the article changing every reference, without knowledge of or regard to carefully considered policy. I can't see a solution to this while the world situation is as it is. There's currently not much in the world more politically controversial than the "War on Terror", and the Bush administration's willingness to throw the term around knowing full well that it's emotive of such things as people's painful memories of the horrific World Trade Center attacks means that people will feel very strongly on either side of this debate for years to come. I would like to see a cooling-off period, and to support it I am going to spend the next few days at least focusing more on improving the content of the article than the terms we use in it. For the record I do believe these people are terrorists, in fact I could hardly think of anyone more deserving of the description, but that doesn't mean it's right to make wholesale use of it in this article, because it's inherently POV, and it doesn't matter how universally that POV may be held. We should provide the facts of the case, and the readers can make up their own minds about the appalling nature of the crime. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 16:55, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Calling a spade a spade</span></h2>
<p>Even though I myself think of <b>"the people who took over the school and held the children hostage"</b> as "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorists</a>", I agree with the reasoning above that the Wikipedia article should not automatically apply this label.</p>
<p>Note that the largest amount of discussion on this page is <b>whether or not the "hostage-takers" are "terrorists".</b> This alone should be sufficient evidence (to Wikipedia article editors) that we have a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversial_issue.html" title="Controversial issue">controversial issue</a> here. And Wikipedia does not take sides on any controversy -- at least, not in its articles.</p>
<p>Why is the concept of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> so hard to agree upon, that we can't even decide whether a given action is "terrorist" or not? Here is my idea on the subject, and I mean it to be as neutral as I can make it:</p>
<p>"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter." What this means is that the term <i><b>terrorist</b></i> is often used to mean "a person who <b>illegitimately</b> uses terrorism to get his way". So, for those who have already decided that an independent state for Group X is not worth the killing of a few hundred random civilians, then Xist terrorism is "bad". But, for those who think the opposite, that an independent state for Group X is worth the killing of a few hundred random civilians, then Xist terrorism is "good". (And they probably won't even want to call it "terrorism"; the word "resistance" sounds so much better.)</p>
<p>There's a similar "good vs. evil" squabble over many other political conflicts. One side claims that an action is intended to "liberate" an "oppressed" people; the other side says the action was intended to advance narrow interests. I sure wish Wikipedia could get to the bottom of these disputes and say clearly that <b>Side A is right and Side B is wrong.</b> But without an absolute standard of value (note that this link is red!), we'll never be able to do this. So we're stuck with "One side says this; another side says that" for the indefinite future. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:18, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC) --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:18, 8 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there necessarily a judgement being made about the cause by using the term "terrorist"? I'm very much pro-Chechen, but that doesn't make this any less of a terrorist attack. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 00:23, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course not. Terrorism is one particular tactic which <i>one section</i> of Chechen separatists have chosen (and their can be many reasons for this choice, like historical precedents, the superiority of the Russian military, rejection of a negotiated solution, the general brutalisation of the conflict, personal traumas -female suicide terorrists have often lost their husband or been raped, and rape has apparently been used widely in this conflict -, etc.), but it is clearly not a choice necessitated by their cause. Not all Chechen separatists are terrorists - although Putin would like us to believe the opposite. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 15:08, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Uncle Ed, I think you misrepresent the debate above quite seriously. Not a single editor disagrees that the hostage-takers <i>are</i> terrorists, nobody here thinks that they were "resistance" fighters. Even in the world outside of Wikipedia I haven't come across anybody who publicly endorsed this terrorist barbarism. The debate here centred around the use of highly emotive language, and I think the result of the debate was that most people accept that it is best avoided in Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 09:55, 9 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not quite sure what you want to say. In my opinion, we Wp. writers must momentarily forget our moral values and judgements when we write articles. They are articles not editorials or preaching. We must describe all facts objectively, make them understandable by adding analysis, and report <i>other</i> people's views (informed by <i>their</i> moral values)&#160;; but Wikipedia itself must not express <i>any moral values</i>, except one: a principled dedication to representing the factual truth, in as objective and neutral a way as is humanly possible. If we get that right, we will "never have to say we're sorry" (unlike e.g. the New York Times and the Washington Post had to over their Iraq coverage). That's what an encyclopedia is for - factual information. It is not for inculcating moral values - readers already have these, and they will judge the content accordingly.

<p>Good point. Actually, I'm trying to think of a consistent naming scheme for these recent incidents where terrorists take over a building full of people and then (a) hold them till their demands or met or (b) until someone they respect tells them to stop it or (c) kills them as the building is stormed by commandos; etc.</p>
<p>Anything but <i>siege</i>, I think. Because the main point is not how authorities deal with the incident.

<dd>I think the evidence suggests this was <i>not</i> the intent. Rather, they were trying to force political concessions out of Russia by taking hundreds of children hostage, knowing anything that went wrong would be a serious egg on the face for the leadership. To this end, they were <i>willing</i> to massacre the schoolchildren, but I don't see that as their <i>intent</i>. (In contrast to 9/11, where the intent was to kill thousands.) There <i>was</i> a Beslan school massacre; it just happened at the end, while this article is about the whole incident. However, I will add that I do like the word <i>school</i> in the title, as the casual observer may not have any clue what <i>Beslan</i> means without it, and may not associate the name with the incident. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">V</font></a> 00:14, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am moving the page back to <i>Beslan hostage crisis</i>, to avoid the title <i>Beslan school massacre</i>. My justification is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Beslan massacre" has extremely negative connotations that are against Wikipedia's NPOV goal (just consider this: why has "massacre" been preferred over more neutral terms, such as "killings"?). Furthermore, as <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">User:Pir</a> said, "we can't know that the massacre was the outcome intended by the terrorists."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Why in the world is the terrorists <i>intent</i> germane? Did these people die by accident while they were being given a seminar on Chechan culture? -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 20:10, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Beslan tragedy" also does not work as this title makes a value judgment as to whether the incident was "tragic."</li>
<li>"Beslan terrorist attack" might be the term used most often in the media and on a Google search. However, the precedent established by <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> on Wikipedia is that we avoid using the term "terrorist" in titles of such incidents.</li>
<li>"Beslan attack" is extremely vague, and the entire incident was really only an "attack" at the beginning and the end; in the middle, both sides did a lot of waiting.</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to the criticisms of the title "hostage crisis": "It's not a crisis any more; it's over." So what if it's over? Just because it's over doesn't mean it wasn't a crisis; see, for example, the article <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_Missile_Crisis_79ac.html" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>. No one disputes that there were hostages held in this incident and that this incident was a "crisis" of some sort. <i>Beslan hostage crisis</i> avoids the POV-nature of titles like <i>Beslan school massacre</i>. And why is it that the terrorists "massacred the hostages" instead of "killed the hostages"? And even supposing they did, the massacre was only at the end of the incident. The incident as a whole was a "hostage crisis" that turned out very badly.</p>
<p>The other title besides <i>Beslan hostage crisis</i> that I feel is fairly NPOV is <i>Beslan school siege</i>; I think either could be acceptable, but <i>Beslan school massacre</i> goes against Wikipedia's NPOV policy and is not.</p>

<dd>I disagree with portions of this analysis. I don't consider <i>massacre</i> to be POV. There <i>was</i> a massacre. My objection is that only refers to the closing minutes of the crisis. As I note above, I feel having <i>school</i> in the title is a big plus. The objections to <i>terrorist attack</i> on the 9/11 page were mostly absurd, and it was won largely through the exhaustion of its proponents (against <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWik_19d3.html" title="User:Wik">Wik</a>, among others) and sockpuppet voting, but again while this was carried out by terrorists, it was not a "terrorist attack" nor really an "attack" at all. I'm ambivalent about <i>siege</i>; I guess that word has pretty broad meanings these days. So, I favor either <i>Beslan school hostage crisis</i> or <i>Beslan school siege</i> or some single word which stands in for "hostage crisis" and is more accurate than "siege". <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">V</font></a> 00:14, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with VV, but that's because I'm a humanitarian. As a Wikipedian, I have to support Lowellian. My heart wants the article to express the POV that the terrorists were wrong, but my head acknowledges that NPOV policy requires the Wikipedia <b>not to endorse that POV</b>. Who knows? Maybe I'll fork one of these days and make my own Absolute Values Wikipedia!

<p>"My Lai Massacre" is the name <i>most often</i> used by the media for that event. "Beslan school massacre", however, is <i>not</i> the name most used by the media for <i>this</i> event. If anything, it's "Beslan terrorist attack", but that has its own set of problems. As to your second point: just because the crisis is over does not mean it can't be called a crisis, in the same way that just because World War II is over, it was still a war; again, I cite <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_Missile_Crisis_79ac.html" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>.

<dd>But with the Cuban Missile Crisis, the crisis, i.e., the showdown between major powers, <i>was</i> the story. If Cuba had resulted in nuclear war, the article wouldn't be entitled <i>Cuban Missile Crisis</i>.</dd>

<p>I have a reputation for not being anti-American, but I prefer the <i>crisis</i> naming still for the reason I noted above, that the massacre was the end of the crisis, but the article is about everything (the hostage-taking, etc.). Certainly, I'd have no problems with saying the crisis <i>ended</i> in a massacre, but the story is larger than how it ended. And yes I think the CMC point is not correct.

<p>By the way, I <i>do</i> agree with you (Cecropia) about the anti-American/etc. biases on the 'pedia, of which some comments above may be in line with (cf. the hyper-PC'ers who disputed that 9/11 was a terrorist attack or that bin Laden is a terrorist), but I don't see that as the main issue. I <i>don't</i> believe this was a terrorist attack. The goal was not to shoot and kill hundreds of children, although obviously that was an outcome they did not object to, but rather to force political concessions from the Russian government by holding them hostage. (Of course, I'm repeating myself, as I said this above.) I'm not sure what to make of the Google test, except that "Beslan massacre" could as I said be used to refer to what happened <i>at the end</i>. For what it's worthy, I <i>do</i> feel "hostage crisis" rather understates the case, but I haven't been able to think of a way around that. The word <i>siege</i> comes close. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">V</font></a> 02:45, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To repeat: Lowellian's assertion was that <i>"Beslan school massacre", however, is</i> not <i>the name most used by the media for</i> this <i>event. If anything, it's "Beslan terrorist attack"</i> And I've demonstrated that this is wrong. <b>23,860</b> references refer to a <b>massacre</b> and another <b>2,130</b> as an <b>atrocity</b> which is even stronger, whereas <b>14,330</b>, about 40% fewer, use "crisis" in the primary description. "Terror" or "terrorist" attack is a dismal third with fewer than <b>3,000</b> hits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And my complaint with Wikipedia isn't anti-Americanism <i>per se</i>, it is that when it comes to the US or the west in general, people have no fear to use harsh and often unjustifiably judgmental characterization, but when we're dealing with actual brutality against total innocents, we get all warm and fuzzy and NPOV-ish. I'm not going to question the sincerity of those who feel they're being NPOV, but there is a matter of editorial equality, without which any credible source is inherently compromised. If people who can't call Usama a terrorist or Beslan a massacre think that they're defending Wikipedia's virginity, they should know that the Wiki has been a little bit pregnant for a long time. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 03:28, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm, I'm worried we're talking past each other.

In any case, I think your analysis of use of terms is basically right; indeed, I suspect a lot of anti-Americanism exists because the large American editorship is trying to be "fair". <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">V</a><a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVeryVerily_9fe0.html" title="User talk:VeryVerily"><font color="green">V</font></a> 08:55, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

It seemed to me that the media was using "Beslan terrorist attack" more often than "Beslan massacre", but I guess I was wrong about it. I still think that the article should be named "Beslan school hostage crisis" over "Beslan massacre" because I don't think "massacre" describes the event as a whole, just the end, like User:VeryVerily said.

<dd>I believe the problem with your analysis is that you are putting too much freight on the concept that <i>massacre</i> is judgmental. The simple definition from dictionary.com is: "The act or an instance of killing a large number of humans indiscriminately and cruelly." This certainly fits the bill. More died at Beslan than at My Lai, and with even less provocation, if that's possible. I was in the U.S. Army when My Lai happened (no, I wasn't there) and if anyone could understand the emotions and circumstances that allowed it to happen, I could. But a feeling of defensiveness for my service or my country does not translate into any objection whatever to describe My Lai as a "massacre." So my question is: what exactly makes Beslan <i>not</i> a massacre, while we can say that My Lai "is", all in the same *cough* NPOV Wikipedia? -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 18:15, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

You don't need to embellish some descriptions with an adjective, because it is historically understood, so that a euphemistic title like <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristallnacht.html" title="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> need not be called <i>Kristallnacht Riots</i> or <i>Kristalnacht Murders and Destruction</i> because it is well understood what Kristallnacht was. In fact, I find the newer German name for the event <i>Pogromnacht</i> to be more descriptive but actually <i>more</i> objectionable. Same with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auschwitz.html" title="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> (which is, after all a place name). The Beslan Massacre has not reached that level of recognition and may never. If we <i>had</i> gotten to that point, we could simply call the article <b>Beslan</b>. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 18:25, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This would not be my first choice (that would be "Beslan school hostage crisis"), but I <i>could</i> accept this as a second choice on the basis of the "most common name" policy of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> 22:13, Sep 30, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Excuse me - but 330 is not accurate death toll, even according to Russian media initial reports it was at least twice as much - I dont know what are the sources for this number - chechen rebel sources put casualties at 400 - 700; and Putin's state run media is unreliable in giving straight facts - so I would like a second inquiry into casualty count and breakdow - (I will also do myself)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Identities of hostage-takers</span></h2>
<p>I've spent several hours searching the web trying to piece together the various reports, as well as Nur's testimony at trial (You'll notice I made him his own page, as well) - however even still we're looking at only 17 out of 32 names. (Be careful when looking, some of them, especially <i>Polkovnik</i> have multiple names listed for the same actual person). Would appreciate any help on this. Also, while I'm sure it's completely fruitless, I've collected every image I could find of the actual hostage-takers themselves and tried to sort them based on nuances in their clothing, so far I can offer at least partial images of 8 distinct hostage-takers, though I can't really think of any way of telling who is who, especially since all but one wore masks. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> 08:11, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>k, odd find here, but apparently <i>Hanpashi 'Khan' Kulayev</i> had his right arm/hand amputated three years prior to the assault, which may have even been a cause for his bitterness and participation. Basayev speaks of him only carrying a pistol, and Nur-Pashi said at trial that Hanpashi was the only carrying a weapon (a pistol) in the Gaz-66 on the way to the school. However among all the images on video, and now the lot of high-rez images of dead hostage-takers I've got sitting my HD, I can't find any that appear to have been missing an arm. Would love if somebody else could examine images and video to try and spot the one-armed bandit <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> 19:30, August 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They're coming from a slew of different sources unfortunately, the former Soviet Union isn't quite the United States, who you'll remember had their own troubles identifying the 9/11 hijackers, so any attempts to identify them are rudimentary at best...especially that <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Taziyev_e741.html" title="Ali Taziyev">Ali Taziyev</a> guy =\ Some places say he was the main leader (<i>Polkovnik</i>?), others say he had a tertiary role, others still say his identity was stolen, or it was just an alias used by either Magas or Khodov.</dd>

<dd>I felt the "Why target Beslan" section wasn't helpful since it couldn't offer any actual information, just personal guesses as to why they may have done it. (The fact it was a short drive from where the majority of hostage-takers came from, was in fairness probably a deciding factor, and a crime of opportunity, they had a person on the inside for the Beslan school construction that summer, so they exploited it. The "motivation in targeting children" section seemed similarily unneccessary since it was the stereotypical "Terrorist says he will kill your children, because you killed his people's children" tit-for-tat. As per the nightline Interview, it may go well on Basayev's personal article, but we shouldn't have an entire section devoted to a single "Special" connected with something as huge as Beslan that had thousands. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> 05:06, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FYI, I've removed the part reading <i>some of the mothers with two children were forced to choose one to take with them, and leave the others behind.</i>, since that's a tad POV and untrue, it was all nursing infants and their mothers released under Aushev - so there was certainly no agonizing choices about which kid to take, older children had to be left behind. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherurcij_a3b4.html" title="User:Sherurcij">Sherurcij</a> 17:20, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>
