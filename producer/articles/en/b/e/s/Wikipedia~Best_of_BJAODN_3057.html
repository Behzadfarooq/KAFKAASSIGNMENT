<p><b>Th'u~nks</b> as a religion, was born when two prophets — known as the <b>Two Great Piephits</b> by practitioners of the religion — discussed the greatness, and spiritual meaning that can be found in the humble pie, particularly the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pukka_Pies" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pukka_Pies" rel="nofollow">pukka</a></i> (pronounced "puck-ah") variety. Currently it has believers in countries around the globe.</p>

<hr />
<p>In the year 2006 CE the Piephits were discussing the benefits of the pie over other pastry based savoury foods, when they were struck by a joint moment of revelation. This moment, known as <b>The Pievation</b>, was believed to be the moment when the <i>Master Baker</i> showed the true meaning of pastry, and consequently life to the Two Great Piephits. From this they jointly established the main underlying tenet of the religion, that of <b>B'heegery</b> and thus <b>Th'u~nks</b> was born.</p>

<hr />
<p>This is the main philosophy of the religion, and a <b>Th'u~nkseer</b> must complete an act of B'heegery to become a true adult in the eyes of <b>Th'u~nksian Church</b>. After this a <b>Th'u~nkseer</b> may complete <b>B'heegery</b> as often as he or she likes. It is born out of the notion of conversion, the act of <b>B'heegery</b> being the conversion of another non-believer with a melodic shout of "You love-a the Pie", and the ceremonial handing over of a pie, preferably <i>Pukka</i>. The pie should then be eaten by the converted one, saving the <i>crust</i> until last. The foil casing that the pie arrived in then may be worn as a hat, to show others that the wearer embraces <b>B'heegery</b>.</p>

<hr />
<p>The normal method of worship is the weekly attendance of a <i>Pie Factory</i>, services are held on the factory floor, usually by the owner of the Factory (naturally all <i>Pie Factory</i> managers are <b>Th'u~nkseers</b>). On entrance to the factory, one must make the traditional cry "Me love-a the Pie". The service mainly consists of the handing out of the <b>Piehost</b>, and the silent, meditative consumption of it. Of course this act of worship is substitute to the act of <b>B'heegery</b>, which is often known as "The Pure Worship". Some devout <b>Th'u~nkseers</b> refuse to worship in this way, and worship solely through <b>B'heegery</b>; naturally these are responsible for the majority of conversions, and offer an explanation as to why <b>Th'u~nks</b> grew so quickly.</p>

<hr />
<p>Very soon after the Piephits founded <b>Th'u~nks</b> and set down the fundamental aspects of <b>B'heegery</b> a split in the Church was formed. This stemmed out of the two Piephits inability to agree upon which crust is the greater, and therefore should be saved until last. This formed the famous <i>Upper/Lower</i> split in the <b>Th'u~nksian Church</b>. Some renegade <b>Th'u~nkseers</b> believe that this split in belief was an intentional design of the <i>Master Baker's</i>, and that no crust is greater than the other: as such they eat whichever crust they please, to the great disgust on the behalf of most <b>Th'u~nkseers</b>. This instability in the early Church was further compounded by unfounded rumours that the naming of the fundamental aspect of <b>Th'u~nks</b> (<b>B'heegery</b>) was named after a crude, minor expletive. At this point the religion threatened to collapse, and so the <b>Two Great Piephits</b> set aside their differences temporarily to reassure that this was not the case. After this both the <i>Upper</i> and <i>Lower</i> aspects of the religion grew in size (there has also recently been a definite increase in those believing the renegade view of <b>Equal Crusts</b>), and since then the religion has remained stable.</p>

<p>TRANSMISSION FROM THE YEAR 2007: STANDBY FOR TIME MOVEMENT:</p>
<p>Weeding was generally thought to be the first indication that Wikipedia would lose its free form nature and become moderated by a small knit circle of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascists</a> willing to impose their own intellectual aesthetic on others, much like <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>. Although this increased the consistency of the site and decreased the number of punctuation and spelling errors, a small and militant minority noticed the decrease in the intellectual diversity of the entries, and went on to form its own splinter group, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Shittipedia</a>.</p>
<p>By 2005, Wikipedia had become <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomis.html" title="Bomis">an incorporated entity</a> and was bought out by <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation_fdf7.html" title="Westinghouse Electric Corporation">Westinghouse</a> for 35 million dollars, making many of its key authors very wealthy, while simultaneously alientating tens of thousands of miscreants, ne'er do wells, and other undesirables (who in fact had provided 90% of its content).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/s/Wikipedia%7EBest_of_BJAODN_3057.html" title="Edit section: Political Philosophy (from Bexley Hall (MIT))">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political Philosophy (from <a href="../../../b/e/x/Bexley_Hall_%28MIT%29_1c1e.html" title="Bexley Hall (MIT)">Bexley Hall (MIT)</a>)</span></h2>
<p>Bexley Hall has a unique set of governing laws. Many dormitories throughout the United States have meager, impotent governmental bodies operated by either photogenic male sociopath proto-politicians or detail-obsessed sexually-repressed females bent on attaining perfection at the cost of their humanity (some examples: <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Lee-Gifford_12cb.html" title="Kathy Lee-Gifford">Kathy Lee-Gifford</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Flick_f394.html" title="Tracy Flick">Tracy Flick</a>). Bexley hall is different. According to noted anarchist thinker Rudolph Rocker, Bexley Hall is an "... oddly prescient example of what the future anarcho-syndicalist living situation should resemble... truly a place where the calcified rotten husk of formalist government has been upended, pulped, and made into rolling papers for the smoking of intoxicating plants."</p>
<p>Bexley Hall was first to understand that government by people (or even robots) was inefficient and error prone. People tend to be afflicted with 'principles' and 'morality', they are also subject to 'reality'. Bexley was the first institution to institute a de-facto illusory governing construct, pre-dating Foucault's deconstructionist theories by some two decades.</p>
<p>As the case of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> amply demonstrates, in this age of mass-media, people do not want and cannot tolerate being ruled by humans. They want to be ruled by myths. Mythological rulers are more appealing, more effective, and ultimately more cost effective for all. They transcend the straightjackets of 'objectivity', 'consistency', 'honesty', and 'ethics' that hampered previous non-constructed leaders. Actual politics is quite boring and will not satisfy the current generations of television and internet-saturated entertainment consumers. Expecting these consumers to have any working knowledge of history (or even the present) that will allow them to differentiate 'fact' from 'fantasy' is far too much to ask. Anything with a semantic content more sophisticated than <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_Magazine_456e.html" title="People Magazine">People Magazine</a> is difficult and disturbing for the average American.</p>
<p>In the year 1920, Bexley-based political scientists experimented with the '<a href="../../../c/o/n/Construct.html" title="Construct">construct</a>' idea. It was considered absurd, irresponsible, and nihilistic -- because it was, and the creators said so themselves. They suspended research in 1941 to work on Radar, and were hired again by HUAC in the early 1950's. Their stunning success was noted in governmental circles and a project was inaugurated to unify the powers of Hollywood and Washington to create a cross-national axis of delusion.</p>
<p>The Bexleyites called this elaborate, highly-funded secret operation PROJECT REAGAN. Through a miracle of public relations firm moxie and animatronic genius, the Reagan-bot broke down the barriers between fantasy and reality in a masculine fashion.</p>
<p>By 1980 the transfer to a completely fantasy-based system of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_economy.html" title="Political economy">political economy</a> was complete when Ronald Reagan was elected <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>. The purposely fantastical and delusional actions of the government caused the fall of the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> when the Russian government realized they could not compete with the sheer entertainment power of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. The United States' systematic program of voluntary, incentive-based stupidification was far more successful than the Soviet Union's program of forced, involuntary stupidification.</p>
<p>Racing to catch up, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorbachev.html" title="Gorbachev">Gorbachev</a> implemented <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perestroika.html" title="Perestroika">Perestroika</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glastnost.html" title="Glastnost">Glastnost</a> to try and compete, but by the end of the decade America's PROJECT YELTSIN seized power and implemented a foreign style delusion-based system of political economy, creating a fantastic narrative where the President was a drunken buffoon who fired one Prime Minister after another, suspended democracy on multiple occasions by dismissing the <a href="../../../d/u/m/Duma.html" title="Duma">Duma</a>, and even sent forth tanks to fire on the nation's highest legislative body. An interesting side-note was the creation of the Cheap Vodka Party, a short-lived group of politicians who were promising and, based on the absurdity of their premise, capable of seizing power over the world's largest country; until they were upended by the fantastically funny and fanatical Vladimir Zhironovsky, who threatened to take back <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> from the United States if elected. Cheap vodka is one thing, but promising frivolous war on a nuclear power is clearly the trump card of balderdash.</p>

<p><b>Logical positivism</b> asserts that only statements about empirical observations are meaningful, effectively asserting that all <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> statements are meaningless.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this fundamental tenet of logical positivism belongs to the family of statements that it asserts to be meaningless. As a result, the entire edifice of logical positivism vanishes in a puff of logic.</p>
<p>This insight appears not to have occurred to the logical positivist school of philosophers.</p>
<p><i>This is <b>still in</b> the article:</i> Logical positivism failed primarily on the basis that its fundamental tenets could not themselves be formulated in a way that was clearly consistent. The verifiability criterion did not seem verifiable; but neither was it simply a logical tautology, since it had implications for the practice of science and the empirical truth of other statements. This presented severe problems for the logical consistency of the theory.</p>

<p>In any encyclopedia Hitler should be given a fair judgement.</p>
<p>He was not a blood-thirsty murderer. Rather a loving family man. He liked a animals and was kind to them.<br />
Anyway, we so often say that a person who shows kindness to animals can't be a bad person.</p>
<p>Besides he had done a lot of good for the Germans, at least before the WW2 broke out.</p>
<p>Oh, and he enjoyed paying prostitutes to shit on him.</p>
<p><i>(Edit: The "blood-thirsty murderer" part I would not touch with a 10 foot pole.</i></p>
<p><i>The "loving family man" part is partially a lie. Firstly, Hilter did not marry (Eva Braun) until the day before they, along with their bunker mates, committed suicide. In that sense, Hitler was no "loving family man." On the other hand, rumors have surfaced that Hitler impregnated his niece. In this sense he was very much so a "loving family man." (I have to mentally laugh here =))</i></p>
<p><i>Hitler did in fact, love animals, as his much loved german shepard, Blondi, will tell you.</i></p>
<p><i>Hitler did in fact do a lot of good for Germany before the breakout of WWII, however any thought of that has mostlty been elimiated from history. But just think Autobahn, yes, that unlimited speed highway in Germany where new Mercedes Benzs are tested out, albeit that it was a tool for his blitzkreig tactics; it was still a major public works project for a country that was in "water up to its neck" because of the terms of WWI. This is in addition to the various other public works projects.</i></p>
<p><i>As for the "paying prostitutes to shit on him," Hitler did not need to pay prostitutes, he had enough of a cult following of women who were too messed up in the head to care what he wanted them to do. As for the shitting part, it could have very well been what Hitler wanted, but none of those messed up women talked about it, unfortunately.)</i> --Lonelysoul01 09:15, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Coalition to Prevent Gratuitous Misuse (CPGM) was organized in 1901 to protest the (then) common misuse of the word <i>weight</i> to mean <i>mass.</i> The movement gained momentum (defined as the vector product of its velocity and mass) when <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> was officially adopted in place of metric system, which no longer carried its weight.

<p>However, musicians, at least insofar as their human manifestations go, can be distinguished from other creatures that create melodic sounds by their insistence on producing such sounds even when there is no clear reason for them to do so and even in the face of compelling reasons to cease such activity in favour of dealing with crises affecting their personal survival. In other words, even when no reward or likely advantage is to be obtained by the performance of "Brown Eyed Girl" or "Mustang Sally" in a bar full of losers, a musician will, nevertheless, perform such composition or other "song" requested by any audience even as his (or her) girlfriend (or boyfriend) is being wooed by the bartender and/or all his/her belongings are being carted off to a disposal site and/or staff of such establishment are telling him/her to "stop now!". (See also, "guitarist" and "singer" and "homeless person".)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><i>Edit: As a well rounded musician I would just like to point out that I am in fact, not homeless, nor have I had my girlfriend (or boyfriend) 'wooed' by the bartender. As well, I would like to point out that the creator of this post is most likely, a failed musician. Sadly, I'm inclined to agree with playing requests, afterall, it is the goal of a musician to entertain not only themselves, but the audience as well.</i></p>
<p><i>Edit: Male classical musicians can easily be identified by their eccentric hair and penchant for rimless spectacles. Evgeny Kissin <a href="http://musicaclassica.home.sapo.pt/images/Kissin.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://musicaclassica.home.sapo.pt/images/Kissin.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is a prime example of male classical artists who adopt the "sweep it back and let it grow" hairdressing technique. Female classical musicians are harder to spot, but can usually be put into one of two categories:</i> <i>a) mousy librarian types; or</i> <i>b) superficially glamorous but slightly neurotic suburbanites.</i></p>
<p><i>Edit: I used to think the "sweep it back and let it grow" style was some kind of anti-authoritarian statement by musicians generally compelled to wear formal clothing. It may be that too, but its ubiquity is more likely dictated by being the least expensive way to ignore the growth of hair. Milo 14:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>The Baby Catapult is an invention of insane genius Maxwell Q. Infantlauncher of Indianapolis, Indiana. It is not meant to launch actual infants; it is meant to launch Cabbage Patch Kids and the sort. The goal is for them to go 100 feet in the air, and 500 feet along the ground. The catapult should be finished by mid-2004.</p>

<p>There are several types of bird, all included in the bird familly <i>Birdidae</i>. The systematics of this taxon are most complex, and bemuse anyone but the most committed and knowledgable birdologist.</p>
<p>A simplified classification tree follows:</p>
<p>===Air Birds=== (genus <i>Flybirdia</i>) These are the most common bird group. They are found in the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air.html" title="Air">air</a>, although one occasionally sees them on the ground due to a frequent breif medical condition known as wing cramp or <i>pterostasis</i>.</p>

<p>In its natural state, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> is docile until attacked, when it will spray sweet <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquid.html" title="Liquid">liquid</a> on the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predator.html" title="Predator">predator</a>. It has many foes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teens</li>
<li>Children</li>
<li>Parents</li>
<li>Movie-goers</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet it is often found and eaten. It does many things to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protect.html" title="Protect">protect</a> itself. It may 'accidentally' tip over when frightened, or <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disguise.html" title="Disguise">disguise</a> itself as the less popular Pepsi or Dr. Pepper. Still, even with its most <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative.html" title="Creative">creative</a> attempts, its foes still find it.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild.html" title="Wild">wild</a>, it stays in packs of 5-23 other cans. Sadly, many packs have been taken into captivity, where <a href="../../../r/i/n/Rings.html" title="Rings">rings</a> are put tightly around their middles and the cans are put into <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxes.html" title="Boxes">boxes</a>.

<p>C is for Cookie can be regarded as a case study in persuasive <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oratory.html" title="Oratory">oratory</a>, emphasizing the emotional aspect of public speaking. Cookie Monster builds excitement by answering his opening <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetorical_question.html" title="Rhetorical question">rhetorical question</a>, "Now what starts with the letter C?" with the obvious reply, "<a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie.html" title="Cookie">Cookie</a> starts with C!" He then challenges the audience, "Let's think of other things that starts with C," before quickly replying, "Oh, who cares about the other things?" casually dismissing a whole range of other possibilities as irrelevant. Thus, having ostensibly come for the purpose of covering the letter C in its entirety, Cookie Monster has already focused his agenda exclusively on cookies, employing the classic <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bait_and_switch.html" title="Bait and switch">bait and switch</a> tactic. Several times in his presentation, Cookie Monster emphasizes what appears to be the central thesis of his remarks: "C is for cookie, that's good enough for me!" The appealing rhythm of this <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slogan.html" title="Slogan">slogan</a> appears designed to entrance listeners, swaying their emotions and making them instinctively want to chant along with him. After rousing the crowd, Cookie Monster systematically lays out the logical underpinnings of his pro-cookie ideology, comparing cookies to round <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donuts.html" title="Donuts">donuts</a> with one bite out of them and to the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">moon</a> during its crescent phase, in essence using a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> argument that implies his opponents would advocate the superiority of these competitors over cookies. In this sense, Cookie Monster may be proposing a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a> representing cookies as the only viable choice to a group of obviously inferior alternatives. But before the audience has a chance to catch on, Cookie Monster launches into another round of repetitive chanting, "C is for cookie, that's good enough for me, yeah!" as young children sing along. Here, Cookie Monster uses a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> technique strikingly similar to that employed in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell's</a> <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a> by the pig Napoleon, who trained the farm's sheep to bleat, "Four legs good, two legs bad" on his cue. Cookie Monster then adds visual stimulation to his discourse by chomping into a large cookie, concluding his remarks with "Umm-umm-umm-umm-umm" and other chewing sounds.</p>
<p><i>[I would like to distastefully add that the cookie monster has now gone healthy. when offered both carrot and cookie, he now pick's the carrot! What is this world coming to... I mean, carrots and salad in general is what <b>food eats</b>. SOMETHING IS WRONG!!!</i></p>
