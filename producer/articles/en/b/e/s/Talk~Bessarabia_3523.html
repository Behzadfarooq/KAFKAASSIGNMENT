<p>Dear Wikipedians,</p>
<p>The changes to the article "Bessarabia" made at 19:46 on 30 Jan 2005 have nothing to do with vandalism.<br />
Their purpose is to make the article to conform the NPOV policy. If you do not agree, let us start a discussion, but do not merely revert the changes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 141.2.48.127 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_141.2.48.127_f4d6.html" title="Special:Contributions/141.2.48.127">contribs</a>) 12:22, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Secondly, the information you deleted is factual, unless you have information to the contrary. Instead of just deleting, you should try to ADD more information, if you think the article needs more balance.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 12:28, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear AAAAA, you write an ecyclopedia article on Bessarabia, not an article on anti-Semitism or on Jewish history.</p>
<p>If anybody would "try to ADD more information" to balance what you have written, this would make the article too large and unsuitable for wikipedia. This is an encyclopedia article, not a monography on the history of Bessarabia, after all.</p>
<p>There is no such a rule, that the balance should be reachet only by adding information, not by deleting it.</p>
<p>The NPOV policy is obligatory for everybody who edits the article. It is not normal, if somebody makes obviously biased articles and other wikipedians have to correct this.</p>

<p>To AAAAA: You may consider writing a separate article "History of Jews in Bessarabia" or something like this. So you can publish all the facts about Jews in Bessarabia without making the original article "Bessarabia" biased and strange-looking.</p>

<p>BTW, just noticed that there were some quotes involved. AFAIK, the policy is to put them in wikiquote <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bessarabia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bessarabia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bessarabia</a> and then link it here.</p>
<p>Oh, and it would also be nice that the history part to be re-written as a text, not as a timeline and the population data to be moved to their own section. I'll do this myself when I'll get some free time. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">Bogdan</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/g/User_talk%7EBogdangiusca_77a5.html" title="User talk:Bogdangiusca">Talk</a> 13:44, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please, remove the references to "Burebista's state" from this and other pages. Professional historians have shown that there is no reason to call it anything other than "a polity" (and a very loose one for that). Otherwise, you include a thesis which has as its only "merit" the fact that Ceauşeuscu endorsed it.

<dd>Burebista did conquer the Celtic town of <i>Aliobrix</i> (which was on the left bank of the Danube, but while theoretically in Bessarabia, it had more connections with Dobruja, where there were many other Celtic towns) and the Greek colony <i><a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyras.html" title="Tyras">Tyras</a></i> (on the Dniester). It seems that we don't know much about what happened inland, but it is certain that it was sparsely populated.

<p>For example:</p>

<dd>I don't care about the POV of Russophobic writers and don't think Wikipedia should reflect it. They are always eager to portray Russia as an ever annexing and ever invading monster. In fact, this particular war was started by the Turks and lasted for six years, before being concluded by a treaty, whereby the Turks ceded the territory to Russia. It doesn't conform to any definition of annexation I have seen as yet. If you want a typical example of annexation, it was Catherine II's taking of Crimea, when Russian forces just invaded the area and proclaimed it the Russian possession. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 16:58, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then, I suppose the title <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan-Korea_Annexation_Treaty_8f45.html" title="Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty">Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty</a> is an outright oxymoron, right?</dd>
<dd>An annexation is taking a territory by the means of force. In this case, neither the Turks and Moldavians gave it in willingly. The Turks thought they would lose if they continued fighting and the Moldavians, the actual inhabitants of the region, had nothing to say in all this. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">bogdan</a> 17:41, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Bogdan, annexation is <i>unilateral</i> taking the territory by the use of force, such as annexation of good chunk of Ukraine by Romania in '41 through the allied with Nazi invasion of the USSR. Territorial changes through the treaties, are not annexations. Yes, treaties are often imposed by the strong on the weak, or by the allied war victors on the war loosers. In such cases, you just described what happened in the article but to use annexation is simply incorrect. Aneexation is, basically, just grabbing something and saying that's mine. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:48, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The only source I have on this is the Nazi propaganda of the time, that was justifying the massacres of Jews in Bessarabia and Transnistria.

<p>The "blatant anti-romanian POV pushing" edit summary (apparently by Bonaparte) was rather hilarious, too. There is nothing anti-Romanian in those two sentences, but plenty anti-Semitic.

<dd>Just because it was included in propaganda of that time doesn't make the fact to disappear. There are many references to that that don't come from fascists or their supporters.

"Let's see what the convicted murderer Adrian writes today...", "We should not forget the bad parts of your life just because they are inconvenient...", that kind of crap.<br />
Now that you sourced it, however, I'll let it stay. It's up to real historians to "examine the evidence". Especially since I don't know Romanian enough to read the whole book. Although, according to his <a href="../../../../ro/p/a/u/Paul_Goma_0fc0.html" class="extiw" title="ro:Paul_Goma">ro:Paul_Goma</a> entry (which I *can* read), he's quite suspicious himself. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> 09:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, I don't think anyone called you a murderer, just as if you say that Romanians killed Jews you don't call me a murderer (I hope). This is not the only reference that I can find about the subject, but it's pretty detailed, the guy is of course "suspicious" to the people who don't agree with him (and he was also tortured by Communist Jews in prison so he doesn't necessarily loves them and his family had to flee Bessarabia because of the invasion), however, he quotes enough original sources and nobody to my knowledge accused him of falsifying sources, I referenced to him for convenience, I don't feel like going to archives and lose time to get exactly the same stuff he got.... -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 09:35, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you misunderstand me. The example was not about you or me. I just used your nick so that you could realise (for a moment) how it feels to be falsely (I hope) accused of something. When someone claims that another person or group did something bad, that claim must be backed up by evidence of some sort. Otherwise that person is subject to legal action for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> (depending on the seriousness of the allegation). On Wikipedia, perpetrators of slander cannot be prosecuted, however. So, the policy of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Wikipedia%7ELibel_9d80.html" title="Wikipedia:Libel">Wikipedia:Libel</a> is used instead.<br />
1) Now, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bessarabia&amp;diff=78128592&amp;oldid=76039108" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bessarabia&amp;diff=78128592&amp;oldid=76039108" rel="nofollow">originally</a>, it was just "the Jews" there, not just Communist Jews. You know, like, all of them. Woman and child. "The jewish violence of hate", "Stalin promised Hebrew SSR", "genitals in their mouth" - that's Nazi propaganda almost verbatim. No sources, dates or names (or just bogus ones), just general things aiming to rouse the crowd. <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel_against_Jews_e798.html" title="Blood libel against Jews">That's really getting old, you know</a>. 2) Also, if he was indeed tortured by Communist Jews, than it will be much harder for him to realize that not all of the Bessarabian Jews are bloodthirsty murderers, who deserve nothing more than what eventually happened to them, as he shows them to be. If that sentence does indeed come from his book, of course. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> 22:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You comment about sentences that I didn't add or that I already changed into a more neutral format. What I'm here interested is about the facts, not about blaming people, being them Communists, Jews, Romanians etc. I think it's pretty much a fact (that's verifiable) that a part of the local population attached both the Romanian Army and the Romanian population. We could choose to ignore that "detail" or we could choose not to try to identify who did that, just say that "a part of the civilian population attached Romanian Army", I think though it would be a lie through omission, and it would be misleading, people won't understand who and why attacked the Romanians. We could change that to "Communists, mostly ethnic minorities: Jews, Ukrainians, Bulgarians, etc and but also some Romanians attacked the Romanian Army" and then the we could say that "later on Antonescu regime used this as an excuse to kill innocent Jews and Gypsies in Bessarabia". I'm not an adept of occulting facts because they are uncomfortable, that book is pretty detailed and contains many declarations of witnesses and in general verifiable info. It is also important to add that because it's a well known assertion (being it true of false) in Romania and Moldova (there are still people alive that went through WWII and others heard the story from their parents), by putting things out in the light we can give a chance to other people to come with references that refute that assertion if that's the case. Otherwise, people will still know the "unofficial" story and take it as true, even if there are very good arguments against it (they will never have the chance to hear the arguments _against_ the story, they will just assume that historians are intimidated and afraid to be labeled as "antisemites" and are afraid to discuss that issue because of that). -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 23:36, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I get the strangest feeling that you're implying that I am trying to (convince you to) occult facts. Let me assure you, that I am genuinely unaware about these things you present as facts. A quick search of the Internet shows that I am not alone in not knowing them. Similarly, there is no mention of this in other Wikiarticles including the <a href="../../../../de/b/e/s/Bessarabia.html" class="extiw" title="de:Bessarabia">German</a> (from which I originally translated the section you have edited) and <a href="../../../../ro/b/a/s/Bassrabia.html" class="extiw" title="ro:Bassrabia">Romanian</a> ones. In fact, the only places I find a mention of these "facts" are either openly anti-semitic hate sites or historical articles describing Nazi propaganda of the period. If it is such a well known fact, then digging up unbiased evidence (preferrably in English) for it would be trivial, don't you think?</p>

<p><i>It is also important to add that because it's a well known assertion (being it true of false)</i> - presenting a "well known assertion" whose veracity is not known in the form of a confirmed fact is not the way of Wikipedia, don't you agree? The burden of proof of such an assertion lies wholly upon the asserter, in this case, you. Your reasoning in the last few sentences looks extremely... weird to me. It's like saying "Since we all know that John Doe is a paedophile, let's just say that he is, so that if he is not people will come and present arguments refuting the claim".</p>

<p>One more thing. Say, the retreating Romanian army was still an army, right? Armed soldiers and all? So, how did the Jewish population manage to attack them, armed with pitchforks and torches as it were? And what was the point attacking them, as those Romanians were retreating anyway? --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> 13:40, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know that this kind of information is to be found either in the archives of those time AKA "fascist sources" or in anti-semitic books, sites, etc because that's the kind of people that are interested in that kind of issue. It also doesn't help that people who bring this issue up are imediatelly labeled "anti-semites". In that book there's a quote from a book published in US: "Green Shirts and Others: a History of Fascism in Hungary and Romania" by Nagy-Talavera, Nicolas M. the quote sounds like (approximate translation by me): "In the chaos generated by a hasty and unorganized Romanian retreat many things happened that were not supposed to happen [...] Jew and Ukrainian population, in the enthusiasm generated by the departure of Romanian authorities, which made out of this province the worst administered part of the country, have treated the retreating Romanians in a way that will cost them direly one year later". So there you go, an American Jew historian wrote that in 1970. (I will add the reference) This book by Paul Goma just details the issue and provides documents, testimonials and references.

<dd>That sentence has been already deleted. It's possible to interpret Jews behavior at that time as racial hate or "antiromanism" (or how should I put it in English?) but that's clearly a point a view, not a fact, so it doesn't belong in here, here we need to look at facts and from my limited access to materials the facts presented in that book are pretty convincing, as I already explained.

<dd>This, by the way, is one way to discern an anti-semite or any other anti-national - instead of pointing out a responsible group from among the target nationals, they'll make a broad all-encompassing statement, like "Jews, Russians, Romanians etc murdered his family", thus hinting that all Jews, Russians, Romanians etc are the same. --<a href="../../../i/l/l/User%7EIllythr_5e28.html" title="User:Illythr">Illythr</a> 21:56, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As for your last point, I think part of the issue was that Romanian Army was under the order not to open fire and many soldiers didn't even had ammunition distributed. And you'd be surprised to find out that people at that time had also guns, not only pitchforks and torches. Also, in some cases those attacks were on captured soldiers (Soviet Army captured the soldiers and civilians were doing the beating and killing). They also attacked Romanian civilians, not only the Army from what I understand. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 15:45, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There were armed patrols called "Patrula apararii civile" (Civilian defense patrol). Also, remember that Romanian Army was on the move (actually running) it's one thing to confront an army on the battle front and another thing to attack tired and possible unarmed soldiers that were marching for miles on foot. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrianTM_7334.html" title="User:AdrianTM">AdrianTM</a> 22:33, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have taken out the following sentence:</p>
<p><i>These peoples came mostly as small, strong armies of mounted warriors, and did not leave notable traces</i>.</p>
<p>It was placed after the arrival of the Slavs. Slavs were never mounted warriors. I am not sure about the 'notable traces' but the first part of the sentence should be attributed to Avars and Bulgars, though they moved in larger numbers.</p>
<p>Also, did that Thracian tribe actually arrive after Huns, Avars, Bulgars and Slavs? Seems like a factological mistake to me. As far as I am concerned Thracians were extinct by then as a Thracian entity. They were assimlilated by other groups or moved to the mountains and merged with other mounteneers.
