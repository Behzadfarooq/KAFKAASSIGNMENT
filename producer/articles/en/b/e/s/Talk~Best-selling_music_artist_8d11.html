<p>I think Michael Jackson is pretty well covered, but if anyone has any additional information about The Beatles' or Elvis Preley's total sales, please add any credible, sourced and relevant information you have. Also, ABBA is sometimes called the biggest selling act ever. If anyone has information to support this claim, I think adding a section about ABBA would be good. If you want to add an ABBA section, structure it that same as Michael Jackson, Beatles and Elvis. That is, heading, image, intro (where they are from, when they were active, any records they hold, then go into detail about their sales. But I think ABBA should be the only other artist to be added to this list. I don't want it to turn into a big long list. Only add artists if they have been claimed by many sources as being the best-selling ever and they are well known for being one of the best-selling artists ever. Please limit it to Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Elvis Presley and maybe ABBA. Otherwise, it might as well be <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_best-selling_music_artists.html" title="List of best-selling music artists">List of best-selling music artists</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 16:35, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have re-worded article, too much "doubt" mentioned for Elvis and The Beatles, while Jacksons entry seemed to be an essay to convert us over to all beliving he was the number 1 artist.</p>
<p>Thank-you for doing that. You know, it's not that I was trying to make Jackson look good, it's that I knew more about the nature of his sales than the Beatles and Elvis. Sorry if it appeared otherwise. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStreet_walker_7556.html" title="User:Street walker">Street walker</a> 03:43, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then it's funny how you keep removing words such as "sales claims" and such like from the Jackson article, as well as the disclaimer about the WMA's. It may also be mentioned at the top, but it is relevant to MJ, not Elvis and the Beatles. There is also a disclaimer at the top that also states sales are disputed and given by record companies, yet, that didn't stop you repeating it time and again in the articles of the Beatles and Elvis, if you're not trying to make MJ look good and the other two look bad, well, you could have fooled me!.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, <b>The BJP</b> (Beatles/Jackson/Presley) are the best selling artists of all time. That is the reason why we do need all objective fans (from Beatles/Jackson/Presley) and other fans/non fans to fill any reliable information so as to rule this wikipedia page.Readerweb 12:47, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no 'fact' on this at all. It is all speculation and guestimation. Why these artists have been singled out as the best sellers is because they have received awards for such ... and these awards are bogus to say the least. Without a doubt The Beatles and Elvis Presley stand supreme, but Michael Jackson is not the 'third biggest'. Bing Crosby appears to have sold more, and so do ABBA. With Mariah Carey now having 16 number 1 hits in the US, being 2 behind Elvis, and 4 behind the Beatles, I also wonder what her true figures are.</p>

<p>It is quite intersting this. I'm not sure whetehr we should structure the page around their list, but it could well be worth at least a mention, perhaps its own section within the page. However, I can't find this anywhere on the IFPI's webiste. Indeed, the only place I can see it referred to is on madonna's website; I think we'd need something more concrete <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 10:28, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AH, hang on a minute - I found a webiste that said 'the IFPI are the organization that provide the WMA with their figures'; so we'd have the same problem as we do with their figures <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 10:29, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to World Music Award website <a href="http://www.worldmusicawards.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldmusicawards.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> are the Best Selling Recording act of All Time (check news category). In 2000, the same WMA has also awarded <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> as the Biggest Selling Solo Artist of the Millenium, yes indeed, single artist does not mean artist in general speaking (band+singer together). Of course this info is based on IFPI standard counting. So if we take into account those two information we have&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>THE BEATLES as the Best Selling Artist of All Time</li>
<li>MICHAEL JACKSON as the Best Selling Solo Artist of All Time</li>
</ul>
<p>(according to IFPI countings)</p>
<p>But keep in mind that <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> has probably sold million of records (uncertified records around the world) that IFPI standards didn't register. Readerweb 20:55, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From the source thats cited, Michael jackson was awarded the 'best selling male pop artist' not simply the best selling solo artist artist. Funny though, that the official WMA site doesn't show any winner of a 'Best selling pop artist of the millenium'. The photo of Jackson in this article is of him receiving the Legend Award not a millenium award, as i noticed this exact same picture in WMA site with the caption saying "Michael Jackson, Legend Award Winner in 2000". I'm not saying he never won any 'best selling pop artist of the millenium', i just think it a bit odd that the WMA never gave any indication of it on their site.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Chocula_2986.html" title="User:Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> 02:07, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, this was in 2000, this site doesn't seem to have archives. But it is 100% sure WMA awarded Michael Jackson as the Best Selling Male Pop Artist of the Millennium <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/744794.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/744794.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which means according to Prince Albert speaking at the ceremony "the Best Selling SINGLE Artist of the Millenium" it was broadcast live on TV. Again, here is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame site that confirms this <a href="http://rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=1141" class="external autonumber" title="http://rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=1141" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, this site has always been a true musical reference. Readerweb 17:10, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All good then. He is certainly the best selling pop artist, thats pretty obvious even without an award. I wouldn't say he is the best selling single artist as there are no sources to prove that, though I'd wager that Elvis Presley is likely to be biggest selling single artist given the estimate by RCA of approximately one billion records sold.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Chocula_2986.html" title="User:Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> 03:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Elvis Presley was also a "pop artist" to a degree. He can't just be labeled "Rock And Roll", he also recorded Country and Gospel and a lot of his songs fall into the pop category. Therefore, Jackson cannot be call (point blank) the Number 1 selling pop act. Also, Elton Johns sales are also up there with Jackson's as a solo act and if you are going to use the "added Jackson 5/Jackson's" sales argument, then Paul McCartney and John Lennon are also up there, as all their sales with their groups and solo surpass that.</p>

<p>This "independant" Eurovision site is reliable but there is something that bothered me though. The <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Music_Awards_2c60.html" title="World Music Awards">World Music Awards</a> is always refering to IFPI <a href="http://www.worldmusicawards.com/ifpi.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldmusicawards.com/ifpi.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> so why did WMA awarded <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> as the World's Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium in 2000 as she's only number 8 and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a> number 4? I don't think Madonna has sold 50 million records since 2000 and then outsold Mariah Carey within 5 or 6 years. Anyway, WMA is keeping secret on this list, except the Beatles news on their website (as best selling act of all time), why can't they provide the second, the third, ...? IFPI website is just providing certifications of the year. IMO it is too conflicting for both (WMA and IFPI) to publish officially a list of the best selling artists of all time (with figures) as Music Companies and Majors won't probably accept it (again, it's my opinion).Readerweb 20:23, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can answer the question about Mariah, according to a rep at the WMA, Madonna was offered this award first--however they never rec. a responce from her rep..Liz , they stated that since there was no responce they gave the award to another "deserving" artist.</p>
<p>Madonna has sold well over the 275 million albums stated above, none of COADF is accounted for in this number. Madonna's ablbum sales outside the USA were over 200 million in 2000. This was stated already, not including sales in the USA. The above IFPI sales totals are proven and accurate based on the time frame of up to mid year 2005.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maddona hasn't sold that many in reality. She'sonly sold 130 million singles and albums by 2000. he has NOT sold another 175 million plus since then.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hope this answers the question.</p>
<p>This is the same list thats been floating around wikipedia the last couple months. It is a fake list, and IFPI currently tracking down the source of it i believe. The fact that theres no indication of its existence on IFPI's official website should've already rung alarm bells.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Chocula_2986.html" title="User:Count Chocula">Count Chocula</a> 07:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

i dont know who changed my opinion on the page. Elvis presley is dead , The beatles are defunct so michael jackson is the highest selling artist ALIVE AND ACTIVE 59.92.95.181 09:08, 13 May 2006 (UTC) paul newman
</pre>
<p>So what? That dosen't mean anything. Jacksons sales include that of a defunct group. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are both alive and active and have outsold Jackson! <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.65.39.59.html" title="User:74.65.39.59">74.65.39.59</a> 02:17, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh great............if they go out and branch as solo acts then they are on their own.it is being said that michael jackson alone has sold 300 million copies as a solo act.i think we should include only tat.omit the jackson 5 part.now probing a little deeper i think we should have a seperate biggest selling page for the solo artists such as elvis presley , brooks , jackson etc. But heck with it......... its the music that matters not the sales......to me beatles are junk....elvis and jackson are the true kings.59.92.61.24 08:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)Paul Newman</p>
<p>has AC/DC really sold more records than ABBA???? I don't know, since the WMA's are secretive about this sort of thing, I call it all into question.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Beatles are not junk. "Yesterday" is much finer than "Wanna be starting something" by Wacko Jacko! <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.65.39.59.html" title="User:74.65.39.59">74.65.39.59</a> 11:16, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But on the other hand "She's Out of My Life" is finer than "Yellow Submarine"... <a href="http://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikipediisto:Bab" class="external text" title="http://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikipediisto:Bab" rel="nofollow">Bab</a></dd>

<p>Michael jckson has sold 350million and the Jacksons 150million so Michael Jackson has sold 350+150=500million=&gt; so he is the real number one. And it's not finished...(actually it is)</p>
<p>The Jacksons/Jackson 5 sold 60 million not 150 million and if you actually add up Mjs album and singles sales it comes closer to 300 million.</p>

<p>ABBA sold 360 million sales worldwide up to 2004. This does make them the 2nd highest selling 'group' after the Beatles, but they have not made any claims at being the biggest selling artist of all time, hence don't belong on this page.</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Music_Award_29b4.html" title="World Music Award">World Music Award</a> website says that it part of the honor is for 'Thiller' selling over 50m. NOTE 50m NOT 60m as some are claiming.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The 50 million figure is from the Guinness estimate which is quite old. The BBC source is very recent and is more reliable as well as many other source claiming that Thriller has sold 60 million copies.<a href="http://mjinf.co.uk/Thriller/Thriller.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://mjinf.co.uk/Thriller/Thriller.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> It is just a better estimate, even if they are just rounding the number.

<dl>
<dd>The 50 million figure is from multiple sites with more credibility than one old (July 2005) BBC mention. The MJ fan site has no actual evidence that 'Thriller' has sold another 10m in the last decade, and if it had done so would have still charted highly .. which it has not done. Wikipedia is supposed to reflet accuracy, and although for chart sales this is not possible, the next most credable source is needed. As 'most' credable links say 50 - 54 million, this should stay.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And you don't have any evidence that it didn't. The fact of the matter is that this album continues over twenty years after its release to sell well. It is completely possible that it sold another six million copies in 10 years. By Wikipedia standards BBC is a credible source. Do not bother this figure and argue with me about this anymore please.--<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust6000_91d0.html" title="User:Stardust6000">Stardust6000</a> 23:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>absurd reasoning, but discussion closed. I will however keep removing reference to the BBC link as it is garbage as I explained in the MJ discussion page.</p>

<p>why does the article say that this fact hasn't been confirmed it has been confirmed at the world music awards on wednesday, 11.15.2006 by guiness world records his spokeman never mentioned the figure before this official and genuine announcement</p>
<p>This is not correct. His PR made a news release stating the sales (refer the links), and as for the Music Awards statement, if this can be verified, then it can be corrected in the article. So far, the only mention that people have said, came from Beyonce. Nobody is saying he hasn't, these are saying no reputable source can be quoted yet 60.234.242.196 05:01, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Something I have not seen mentioned or addressed about Elvis' success and worldwide appeal -- was that he did it all without EVER touring outside of the United States...!! It seems about everybody else mentioned on the various lists of entertainers has toured far and wide around the world to promote their music, sometimes with recordings and translations done in different languages... except Elvis. Apparently he wanted to and had offers and backing to do so, but the Colonel (Parker) disagreed with the notion and would not allow it. I recall seeing this on a PBS special about Elvis.</p>
<p>He was stationed in Germany during his hitch in the Army, which may have included some travel to other European countries; his movies were sometimes set outside the US - but did he ever work, travel or vacation abroad, or was he too busy here in the US?</p>
<p>Input please...</p>

<p>What about the most successful artists from other genres? Specifically, I am referring to Tupac Shakur, the most successful hip-hop artist to date. Hip-hop and other genres should at least have a mention of their most successful artists. More importantly though Garth Brooks needs to appear on this page. He is number 3 on RIAA's count so I think he definetly needs a mention.137.99.184.148 12:09, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article speculates on the greatest selling artist <b>worldwide</b>....and <b>for all time</b>. Tupac and Garth Brooks do not qualify under those standards.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 14:22, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Surely Queen is somewhere in the top 5? I can't remember where I read it, but a list not long ago said the top 5 best selling artists were;</p>
<p>1) Elvis 2) Cliff Richard 3) Queen 4) The Beatles 5) Michael Jackson</p>
<p>but I don't have any proof I'm afraid. But it's just a thought....</p>
