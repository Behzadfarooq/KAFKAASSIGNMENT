	    <p>Q: How would you introduce yourself to somebody who didn't know you?</p>
<p>When I'm asked what I do for a living I generally say I'm an events organiser. I think this goes down better than gamer, tournament organiser, LAN centre owner or anything else that might be relevant to me. If the person I'm talking to digs deeper I'll tell them about my gaming past but honestly I try not to get into it since the whole gaming thing takes a lot of explaining. You can imagine how many times I've told the same story now, I get a little sick of trying to convey what Quake tournaments are like. The real problem is that as soon as you mention games you can see the the other person has an image of little kids on a Playstation. So I have to take a few minutes to let them know what online gaming is really like.</p>
<p>Q: How did you get the nick Sujoy?</p>
<p>Sujoy is just my name. I spent my early days of Quake 1 experimenting with different names that I imagined sounded cool, but I realised that you don't become cool by picking a cool name. Your own actions will make your name either respected or lame. I decided I'm actually lucky to have a name that will be quite unique online so I decided to use my real name.</p>
<p>Q: How did you get into Quake 1, all those years ago?</p>
<p>I was studying at University when I first discovered Doom2 at our computer room. We had four 486's and someone had installed the game on them all. Whenever there was a free moment I would be playing. Back then I was keyboard only but so was everyone else and pretty soon no-one at my college could come close to me. At that time I didn't know anything about Kali, or using the mouse and I figured I was as good at the game as it was possible to be. That changed when I played a guy from another college who used the mouse and totally destroyed me. Then qtest came out and everything changed. I had been reading about it online and was waiting on the very day it was released. I had to beg and plead to use the only pentium based PC in our computer room, then just gaped at the player models the whole day. The whole concept of playing online was unbelievable to me and I would just stay in the labs all night talking and playing with new people all over the world. I was pretty much hooked from that point. Unfortunately for me the summer came and I had to go home away from the lovely Internet line at my college, so I spent all my money on a 33.6 modem to continue gaming from home (I didn't care about the 300ms ping at this point). Then when I returned to college in October I bought myself a p166 and pretty much played all day everyday for a long time!</p>
<p>Q: What was it that you liked about the game?</p>
<p>The graphics stunned me for a long time, but the thing that kept me coming back for more was being able to play people that were not necessarily in the same room. That was a huge thing for me. I was in my own little world for Doom 2 only playing guys from my college. Eventually they didn't want to play me anymore because I was getting better than them. When I was able to play other people outside of the college it blew my mind.</p>
<p>Q: What is your favourite Quake 1-related memory?</p>
<p>Some of the best times I had was late at night when we'd finished fragging and I'd just be sitting on a server chatting to friends I had made online. We'd spend the time trying different moves, rocket jumps, and just seeing what else was possible in Quake. It was almost like those scenes in the Matrix where Neo is learning to exploit his matrix world. We were seeing what crazy things we could do in our Quake world.</p>
<p>Q: What do you think of the modern Quake/gaming community?</p>
<p>Gamers now have a lot of great things in place for them, but many don't appreciate it all. I think the initial buzz of being there for the very first qtest has stayed with me and I get more out of gaming because of it. Online gaming now is like a ladder everyone's trying to climb at the same time. Most people want to get some kind of fame for themselves by getting to the top of the ladder, but the smart guys are just enjoying the ride.</p>
<p>Q: How did you come up with the lava jump?</p>
<p>I was a little annoyed at the time because there was a demo posted where I kept falling into the lava. I spent a long time just messing about on the map until I realised you could actually build enough speed to get out. I'm the kind of guy that would enjoy the feeling of tricks and silky movement just as much as a duel, so I'm happy to spend hours just trying different moves.</p>
<p>Q: Ever thought of coming back to Quake 1? Would you consider coming back for a charity event?</p>
<p>Every so often I download one of the online quake engines and try it out but I haven't played Quake 1 seriously for such a long time. I guess I don't really want to go back to my best game as a newbie after all these years. When people discuss what makes the perfect game, Quake 1 does always pop into my head. A great game should let the player express his own style and the original Quake had it all. The newer versions only limited the moves you could make in comparison. I think I would love to play some Quake 1 again, but I'd need to have enough free time to do it.</p>
<p>Q: What was it like participating in the legendary TGI tournament?</p>
<p>I was on my decline as a Quake player just then unfortunately as I had started work a few months earlier, so when I wasn't originally invited I did understand that. But when someone dropped out (I can't remember who) I was really pleased to get the invite. I had to juggle all sorts of things to make it there, as I was at some financial training course in New York and had to change flights to make it in time. But it was all worth it. I didn't do all that well but I took a few maps and I think held my own against some great players. It was the experience that was awesome though. That was really my first taste of a really serious tournament and the final game between Laker and Kane will stay in my mind forever.</p>
<p>Q: What exactly crossed your mind when Sectopod did the famous RJ to bunny-hop at MH on DM4 whilst duelling you at TGI?</p>
<p>I had actually never seen that done before so I was shocked at the time. In a good way, though. Seeing great moves like that motivates me to learn more and try doing them in my own style.</p>
<p>Q: How did XSReality/ESReality come to be?</p>
<p>When Quake 3 came out I was starting to get fed up with working in the bank and after QuakeCon 99 and CPL's New York event I realised that it would be possible to become a pro gamer. I wrote a column about it and Hakeem (who had just won the Frag 4 CPL event) contacted me saying he was thinking the same thing. We also enlisted Xenon who we thought was another big personality and went ahead with the idea, pitching to companies for sponsorship. Razer took us up first and soon we had quite a few sponsors backing us. To give them a face for our organisation we set up the original XSReality website. It hosted the links to our sponsors and gave us a place to write some gaming-related articles.</p>
<p>Then pretty soon we realised that the website actually had more potential than our gaming careers so we got together with Stayne (from Stayne's house of demos), Izno (from TrueGamers) and bds (then from Geekboys) to create what we wanted to be the ultimate Quake portal. It started really well and looked like it was going places but around the same time the dot com boom took out a lot of the interest and our sponsors started disappearing also. We were still looking for investment in 2001 but in the end I decided to give it up and move back to London. I missed the site though, so eventually I ended up building my own version. That's where ESReality came from. I'm no web coder and I have no experience with programming at all but I persevered with ESReality because I had a lot of ideas that I wanted to see made. ESReality always suprises me because the site never generated any money but everyone who helps out does it because they just love gaming. That's really good to see.</p>
<p>Q: What are your plans for the future, as they relate to gaming?</p>
<p>ESReality is growing quite steadily, so recently I decided to take it commercial. We're working on advertising deals and looking to do some great new features on the site. There's lots of stuff in the works, I just hope we can see it through as I've got some great new ideas I want to see completed.</p>
<p>My main project right now is with game centres. I got involved in the gaming centres scene after I quit the original XSReality. Now we've finally got funding together to build what we're calling 'Super Centres'. These will be huge game centres with 200 to 400 gaming spec PC systems, located in extremely high profile areas. Right now we're going through legal work for properties in Picadilly Circus (London) and central Birmingham to cover the UK's two largest cities. This is a massive project and something I wanted to see made for a long time. While the traditional game centre hasn't done so well, especially in the UK, I really believe that scaling it up like this will make a huge difference. People won't be worried that they're coming to a place that's too empty, since there will always be some people around. At the same time there are enough PCs that you won't have too much trouble getting one when it's full. We want to build a culture of gaming centres in the UK and thereby generate business for our clubs.</p>
<p>Q: What was your favourite weapon in Quake 1?</p>
<p>I'm torn between RL and LG. I think I'll have to choose the rocket launcher though, just for sheer bouncability.</p>
<p>Q: Favourite Quake 1 map?</p>
<p>DM4</p>
<p>Q: Duel or Team DM?</p>
<p>Duel for sure. I'm not much of a team player when it comes to Quake!</p>
<p>Q: Did you ever play any Quake 1 mods? If so, what were your favourites?</p>
<p>It's been a long time, but my favourite mod was the one where you could become different creatures from the single player game. I can't remember what it was called. Fiend was the best since it had that crazy pounce.</p>
<p>Q: If you could pick up any of the Quake 1 power-ups in real life, which would it be and why?</p>
<p>I'd get Pent then do a real rocket jump!</p>
<p>Q: If the Quake guy had a name, what do you think it would be?</p>
<p>Joey (because of all the hopping).</p>
<p>Q: How do you pronounce xhrl? <a href="http://www.besmella-quake.com/comments.asp?newsid=394453897383176760300926" class="external free" title="http://www.besmella-quake.com/comments.asp?newsid=394453897383176760300926" rel="nofollow">http://www.besmella-quake.com/comments.asp?newsid=394453897383176760300926</a></p>
<p>Zharl for sure.</p>
<p>Q: What does 'BesMella' mean?</p>
<p>Was she one of the ugly sisters?</p>
<p>Q: Any last words?</p>
<p>Pork Riblets.</p>
