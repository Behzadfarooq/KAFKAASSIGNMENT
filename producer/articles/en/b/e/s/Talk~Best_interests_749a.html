	    <p><i>Italic text</i> I have a Question,My soon to be x has already retained a lawyer,He is trying to get custody of my youngest 15 who is ADHD with learning disabilities,he is in 7th grade on a 5th grade reading level.He is on medication at home and school.He is in special Edd at school.He is easily talked into things with promises and his father made him sit there and tell me that he wants to live with dad.My x has been abusive physically,and mentally and for that reason I kicked him out many many times since we have been married.The only time the police were involved was when they escorted me and my kids to a womans shelter.The only other proof I have of his abuse is the Certificates from the anger management classes he had to take in order to come back home.And now my youngest is saying he don't ever remember being punched in the head,or cussed at all the time,and told I can't wait till you f kids are out of this house.My two oldest remember him doing it,and all the other things,they are my daughter 17 and my other son 16.And they said they will tell the judge everything.He said if I give him full custody of my youngest that he will drop the expensive lawyer and we will get the divorce with me signing over custody.But he is filling my youngests head with promises and lies,and I'm so afraid of when the niceness stops I won't be there to protect my son when my x gets angry.I am on welfare and can't work until after the operations on my feet,and I have major depression I think from what I have told you you know why.The last time I kicked him out and told him it was over was because my oldest was yelling at me so he (x)jumped up and put a head lock on my son.I had to practically prie him off him.Then he looked at my oldest son and said if this breaks your mother and I up,(X's words) Come find me when you turn 18 cause I'm gonna kick your a.Then when I asked my youngest why he was mad at his brother for me kicking his dad out he said because he (his brother) knows not to make dad mad.He hasn't payed child support in over 5 months.He said he hasn't been working so the courts won't hold it against him.And when I told my x that I was going to tell the judge everything he did and said to these kids,he (my x) just looked at me and laughed and said wheres all the police reports.I should have just thrown him in jail,instead I just kicked him out and got him away from the kids.I don't know what to do anymore,can anyone give me some advice.Please he can't have custody of my youngest because he has a short temper.Thank you for reading this (70.227.162.129 05:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)) .</p>
