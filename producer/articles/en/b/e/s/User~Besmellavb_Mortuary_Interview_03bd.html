	    <p>vb: Let's try a different take on the obligatory introduction question. Who is Mortuary, Mortuary, and how did you get into QW?</p>
<p>Mort: My name's Dan, and I'm from Melbourne in Aus. I'm 21 soon.</p>
<p>Well, I first saw Quake in single player mode, back in summer '96/'97. I used to play it at my friend's house. My friend's older brother showed me NetQuake/QuakeWorld back in '97 sometime, and I used to go around there and play it whenever I could. It wasn't until sometime in '98 that I eventually got my own connection and PC to play on at home.</p>
<p>vb: What is it about the great game that endears you to it?</p>
<p>Mort: The never ending skill spiral in Quake. You can always be more precise at something. Also the movement/physics in QW really appeal to me. It is quite a hard challenge finding the sweet spot, and getting maximum speed/smoothness. There's nothing like using the physics to their full spectrum, such a free and weightless feeling. The pace of the game, and the AU community itself, are also some of the reasons why I play.</p>
<p>vb: What is your favourite map? What do you think of custom maps?</p>
<p>Mort: My favourite map would have to be... Skull or Aerowalk, I couldn't pick between the two. I like custom maps very much if they're made well. It's quite frustrating when players won't get off the DM2, DM4 DM6 bandwagon. There are some awesome custom maps out there like RF2, ZTNDM3... Hopefully Waterwalk will be an awesome map too. I don't really like DN4 or DM2 as maps very much. I find DM4 to be pretty random, and I have found it takes less raw skill to take opponents down. DM2 I don't like because quite often the other player plays a pretty slow game, and that isn't my cup of tea.</p>
<p>vb: What other games have you played a fair bit, and what do you like about them?</p>
<p>Mort: When I was younger I played NBA Jam on SNES quite a bit. I liked this game at the time because I was into sports a fair bit, and I think I was playing basketball at the time. I actually won a Blockbuster video NBA Jam competition, although unfortunately I was too young to travel to other states to continue with it. I played a lot of total annihilation back in the day too. Wolf3D was awesome aswell. First FPS game I ever saw, I took a great liking to it. I used to play CPMA a fair bit about 2 or so years ago, but the railgun really doesn't do it for me. I also feel a lot more 'weightless' in QW than CPMA too if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>vb: What do you do when you're not foofing people in Quake?</p>
<p>Mort: Well I am heavily into music and arts in general. I listen to pretty much anything except for soul-less crud, like most top 40 stuff, but my main passion in music is extreme metal, and extreme metal drumming. I'm a pretty avid drummer, and take it quite seriously. I'm in a band that rehearses every week and is quite time consuming, and I'm involved in a few other projects. I also love drawing and art quite a lot, it seems to come in creative spurts though, a few months on and off. I have really taken to books of more recent times aswell. I can't quite get into fiction stuff yet, I'm into more research orientated stuff. Origins of consciousness, Shamanisn and other topics of the sort. I also work full time at a fabric wholesales warehouse.</p>
<p>vb: You are world renowned for having your own style of play, is this the result of any specific practice or mindset, or did it come about unwittingly?</p>
<p>Mort: I'd say it was a mindset and practice. Although I couldn't quite tell you exactly how I got there. About 4 years ago I started dueling a lot on lan, and some friends of mine totally changed my QW setup, which made it feel WAY different, for the better... And things went from there. I found it really fun and challenging to advance in QW.</p>
<p>vb: What do you think of the more controversial issues in QW, like playing tight, scripted movement, replacement graphics, clocks, cl_truelightning and fallbunny?</p>
<p>Mort: I don't particurly like playing tight if it is just for the sake of winning. A lot more fun and feeling can be put into your playing by just doing your own thing. Scripted movement hinders your abilities as a player. Manual is so much more controled and precise. So if you use scripted movement you're just making it easier for everyone else. Clocks are OK because anyone can have a clock next to their PC anyway, as long as it isn't timing items I think it is reasonable to have it. cl_truelightning hinders your shafting also, as it just gives you a false reading of what it is actually doing. I haven't thought about fallbunny much, but I think it would be good to have it in the game. Having the ability to continue running after falling from great heights sounds quite good!</p>
<p>vb: Any last words or shoutouts?</p>
<p>Mort: Thanks to everyone who I have encountered during my QW adventures, it has been a great 8 odd years of fun. I've met some awesome people along the way. Shouts to Mike, Third, Venom, the BesMella crew and #TC.</p>
