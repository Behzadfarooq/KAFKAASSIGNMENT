<p>Dear Beowulf. I am fairly new to wikipedia but if I understood it correctly you wrote the trivia section in the TV-series Rome including:</p>
<p>"Battle scenes in Rome depict authentic Roman infantry fighting techniques including the tightly-packed "Roman Wall" of shields, gladius thrusting techniques above and below the "shield wall", and the rotation of troops on the front lines every 30–45 seconds. "</p>
<p>The rotation part makes perfect sense. Having a soldier in the first line fight until he dies and his fellows do almost nothing until it is their turn in the first line seems at best to be a waste of human life. Yet, this is how ancient fighting is generally perceived. Taking turn makes much more sense. Close combat will exhaust you quickly and no matter how skilled you are, when you are exhausted you rapidly become much slower. If you are not rotated away by when, you are pretty much dead meat. I read a piece of historical fiction where the legion was described as fighting in this way, but when the author, Vibeke Olsson, kindly referred me to the original source, Livius, it seemed to talk more about the entire centurias rotating from hastati, to princeps, to triarii. Do you know of an ancient source that claims indivídual roman soldiers actually took turns being in the front row the way it is depicted in the TV-series Rome? Do you know of any source whatsoever you could refer me to on this subject? Please write and tell me at dag@mensa.se so I can present this source/debate/whatever in wikipedia (or you could write it yourself in the article about Rome the TV series, the article on Roman infantry tactics or the article on Roman Legion).

<p>The page you want to eliminate has been around for short enough a period of time, and few enough pages link to it, that I would guess that you could probably roll it into the Harry Potter Magic with out much problem - as long as you update the linking pages.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to say thanks for all the work, I don't want you to think it wasn't appreciated. However, I suggest that next time you do something like your recent edits to <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_sphere.html" title="Dyson sphere">Dyson sphere</a> you should be a little more careful in how you do it. You generated <i>30</i> versions in rapid succession and didn't provide an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a> for any of them. While edit summaries aren't absolutely required, adding them is a good guideline to follow. In this case I checked the diff of your thirty edits, saw that the net result was a large deletion from the article, and very nearly reverted everything because I didn't initially notice that you'd moved the deleted material to a new article. I wasn't going to spend the time combing through 30 edits looking for the one where the deletion occurred to just revert that one bit. Fortunately I did take the time to read the article over in addition to just checking the diffs and saw the link to the new article that time, but a simple "splitting fiction into new article" summary anywhere in those 30 edits would have saved me some bother. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:49, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - I happened upon <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyson_sphere.html" title="Dyson sphere">dyson sphere</a> and decided to listen to the spoken version. Much to my disappointment I found it is synthesized. I do not feel that synthesized article recordings have a place on Wikipedia since:</p>
<ul>
<li>any blind users would already have a speech synthesizer</li>
<li>the result is fairly painful for anyone else to listen to</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion the 'spoken article' template should definitely be removed from the article and the file should probably be deleted, but I would like to hear your thoughts on it before I bring it up at the spoken wikipedia page. -<a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESCEhardt_7145.html" title="User:SCEhardt"><font color="blue">SCEhard</font></a><a href="../../../s/c/e/User_talk%7ESCEhardt_f6c3.html" title="User talk:SCEhardt"><font color="#3D9140"><b>T</b></font></a> 04:01, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The recent changing of the primary External Link URL on the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrioshka_Brain_7b4d.html" title="Matrioshka Brain">Matrioshka Brain</a> page to the Future Hi URL is incorrect. That is *not* the "Matrioshka Brain Home Page" and is instead an outdated version of the original *copyrighted* Matrioshka Brain paper which was copied without permission to do so. The URL should be returned to the original, primary, Matrioshka Brain Home page -- <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which I believe is now once again operational. In general it should be considered poor form to point to copyrighted material which is not obviously on an author approved site unless one is certain that permission to copy has been obtained. It would also be incorrect to indirectly assert that the Future Hi site is "Robert Bradbury's Matrioshka Brain site" when I have absolutely nothing to do with it!

<p>I haven't yet seen anything that addresses the question of how broad a range of frequencies the Arecibo message was transmitted with. I would expect that they used as much of the "water hole" range as possible. I'm sure that the bulk of its "detectability" over long distances comes from the fact that it was "beamcast" using Arecibo.

The effect of narrowband on detectability isn't as obvious as narrow focus, but it's explained with lots of formulae in the Seti@home faq page <a href="http://setifaq.org/faq.html#1.2.3" class="external autonumber" title="http://setifaq.org/faq.html#1.2.3" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. In this faq page it's clearly stated that narrowband transmissions (with a correspondingly tuned receiver) are detectable over much greater distances than (relatively) broadband transmissions like AM radio and TV. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlBunker_d26a.html" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a> 04:07, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I allready corected the real edit that I had overlooked, Sorry. Still, I must say that: The BC dating was there "before" and as far as I know since the "beginning". "He" changed it in a "sneaky" way, hereby I meam that he changed it (importance debatable) whithout making a resume of it (which I didn´t, obviously). I don´t want to start a debate about BC or BCE "worthiness" (I read about them and they are boring) but I remember reading somewhere that: such a "change" must be anounced and, if it is foreseable that there will be oposition, debated in the talk page before making the change.</p>
<p>Let me just clariefy my POV: Believe it or not, I am not a christian, I am a atheist (I don´t believe in any supernatural Indentity who created the universe = god) but as our dating system is calculated at the "official" birth of "somebody" called Jesus of Nazareth, we should use "BC" as it the "most widely known" version. I even didn´t knew of the BCE/CE version and I read a lot of english books (besides other languages). <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 18:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hi, I want to thank you for the good improvements you are doing in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Republic_9497.html" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> article. I am forced to aknowledge that I don´t know all that much about the inner workings of the early Republic being rather more knowlegable in the latter developments. For a long time I was kind of the sole "Keeper" of this article but now it seems more ppl are interrested in improving it (perhaps because the article was really being improved), and that is fine by me. I can only ask you to include your references in the proper place (perhaps I will buy these books, perhaps not). Again, thank you and C U around. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 18:49, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was thinking perhaps it would be useful if some Wiki-admins of great Wiki-skill (I'm thinking perhaps you, <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">Hermione1980</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a>) could work together and create a "speculation" warning template - ie</p>
<div class="notice metadata" id="cleanup" style="text-align: center; background: #efefff; margin: 1em 10%; border: #9F9FFF 1px solid;">This article or section contains <b>speculation</b> and may try to argue its points.<br />

Please remove speculation and discussion from the article.</small></div>
<p>or Template:Speculative or something like that - which would theoretically be used on such wiki-pages as those that tend to attract a lot of rampant fan speculation. It could work much like the "spoiler" template - but alert readers and editors that "the following information is speculative", but is at least reasonable, supported by existing authentic text, or widely believed by concensus - something on those lines.</p>
<p>Some speculation items that seem reasonably probable (eg: In "Book Seven", Harry and his Hogwarts friends are expected to hunt down and attempt to destroy the remaining Horcrux(es), before Harry's final confrontation with Voldemort), or the list of known and "probable" horcruxes that were specifically mentioned by Dumbledore or otherwise in the text, would be allowed. Other posts that are clearly fanatical, agenda-driven speculation (eg: Harry is a horcrux, Harry's scar is a horcrux, Harry's wand is a horcrux, Neville's Toad is a horcrux, etc etc etc.) would be dismissed as having no foundation or supporting evidence in the existing texts, validated interviews, etc. Anything permitted as "authenticate" speculation (yes, I know it is oxymoronic) should have some kind of "chapter and verse" authority, or other reasonably conclusive evidence that anyone could recognize as reasonable.</p>
<p>At least it might help keep some of the random speculation, that keeps randomly and anonymously popping up, "corralled" in a smaller area for consideration. Or perhaps this is a terrible and counterproductive idea... --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> 01:08, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As was hopefully clear from the <a href="../../../t/e/c/Talk%7ETechnological_singularity_43c9.html" title="Talk:Technological singularity">reasoning I posted in the talk</a> for the article, my answer to "Did the article do so before" is a resounding "No". Everyone I pointed at the article reported that they found it rather confusing. In this case, we aren't even talking high school freshmen, but computer science majors and other various IT employees.</p>
<p>However, I am in agreement that the wording of the intro I wrote is too technical. Do you have any suggestions as to how the comprehensibility of the article can be improved? Perhaps you could edit the sections you feel are too technical, or post them on the article talk page for further discussion?</p>
<p>I am certainly not completely happy with my rewrite, but I do feel it provides immense improvements in clarity. I still see problems that need addressed (the second paragraph essentially sandwiches together two unrelated ideas) and I'd like to get as much feedback as possible to ensure a good clean-up rewrite.</p>

<li>The "entire transcript" of the interview was NOT included. only some text related to the denial of boycott &amp; the motives for the boycott were included. this is a complex issue so it does take space. further editing could improve it but it's complete removal from the article seems over zealous. the MCB boycott has been a massive issue in the UK. the boycott has created more headlines than the HMD itself. This is a real life example of the 'side-issue' dominating the main event. my edit reflected that. i'm not trying to debate political issues. however, the MCB boycott has created a major political issue. that's why so many articles have been written about it &amp; the BBC dedicated it's flagship documentary to it. surely wikipedia articles shouldn't ignore this? <a href="../../../v/e/e/User%7EVeej_150c.html" title="User:Veej">Veej</a> 16:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi Beowulf, I notice you altered one of my changes. First, Tom Marvolo Riddle is a redirect, so shouldn't be used as a link, either use Tom Riddle or Lord Voldemort. I am trying to rearrange things so that tom riddle is only linked when it is explicitly only tom who is meant. Otherwise link Lord Voldemort, which includes his whole life history. Anything which is using both names so the reader knows they are the same person should go directly to Voldemort.

<dd>Hi again. Yes, i know there is a mess. The trouble is that there are an awful lot of links which have just grown up without people realising there is an issue. There are quite a few pages where i don't know what is the best way to proceed and I appreciate your point that in context, Slughorn is talking to riddle. However, to mention riddle by name is to make it clear that Riddle and Voldemort are one and the same person. A number of people (not really me, but i respect their POV) have been trying to protect the fact that Riddle and voldemort are the same person, as a plot spoiler. This was the supposed reason for having two separate articles, but in reality that simply did not work as it was immediately plain from either that they are the same person. The only way to protect this information is by rather careful choice of names. Now, I am not convinced this is necessarily worth worrying about, but it has placed itself in my path, so i am stuck with doing so. Suggestions?</dd>

<p>For the moment, I am trying to change any links to Tom Riddle to Lord Voldemort, in the cases where it is plain that there is no secret to be kept.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 16:50, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>this doesn't really belong anywhere else, as I want to know your opinion. Namely, why the Jewish Holocaust — while being a horrific and monstrous event which should never be allowed to happen again — is qualitatively different than other genocides?</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't say it was. Many people do say that, but I'm not qualified to judge. What is quite clear to me, as a UK resident, is that the Nazi Holocaust (of Jews, Gypsies, gays, and others) has a qualitatively different significance <i>in British culture</i> to other genocides. Within living memory, a large number of British soldiers, journalists and military nurses saw these things with their own eyes which they shared with their comrades at arms, and the wider population. That is the reason that there is a Holocaust memorial day in Britain. Holocaust memorial day commemorates the victims, but it is not <i>for the sake</i> of the victims, most of whom perished at the time. It is a cultural phenomenon based on collective British emotional experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Muslims in Britain are mostly post-war immigrants, who did not share this experience either as victims or as liberators. Understandably, Holocaust day may not be particularly meaningful to them. However the attitude of the MCB seems to be that Holocaust day is a commemoration of Jewish emotions, or was instituted at the Jews' request. Nothing could be further from the truth; it is a profoundly British occasion, and commemorates the significance of the Holocaust to British men and women. That is, I suppose, why the MCB's stance has been so widely condemned from every corner of British society. Jewish groups have in fact been relatively forgiving. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 00:17, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Thank you for your answer, and it's pretty much what I thought it would be. It sounds like you're saying that "this genocide over here is personally meaningful to me/us, and this one over here doesn't affect us directly so we don't count it as dearly as the one that does." That's a very human attitude, and I'm not about to say that anyone who has it should be censured for it - but I do think it's wrong. I think all atrocities should be condemned with the same ferocity of loathing. I think the Jewish holocaust should be remembered as it is - but I think so should the Rwandan, and the Cambodian genocides.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I still think you are confusing the moral dimension and the emotional dimension. It would certainly be legitimate to complain if different legal standards were used in punishing different perpetrators for the same crime, or if victims who suffered the same loss were compensated differently. It is unreasonable, however, to complain that a country chooses to commemorate its own history and not to commemorate someone else's. That is a matter of completely free choice for the country concerned. The MCB is entitled to try to influence this choice, but the British are also entitled to reject its influence.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>And, frankly, if the particular "emotional impact" of the Jewish Holocaust can only be maintained by claiming that it is somehow "different" or "worse" or "more significant" than other genocides on the same scale (millions of people), then does it deserve that level of impact? If it gains in prominence only at the expense of denying the significance of other crimes of that type, is that just? I don't think so.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The idea that a genocide deserves or does not deserve things seems slightly strange to me. However I don't think anyone is trying to maintain the emotional impact of the Holocaust artifically. Quite the opposite, really, at least in the UK.. Holocaust day is to help people cope with something that had a great impact when it happened, not to create an impact of its own. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 01:00, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
