Is extinct the right word to use when a nation or ethnic group dies out? I've only seen extinct used about animal species.--<a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonjaaa_33fb.html" title="User:Sonjaaa">Sonjaaa</a> 13:06, Sep 4, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was taught in grade 9 history/social studies that great numbers of the Beothuk were basically rounded up and mass murdered by european settlers, and this was largely how they became extinct.... can't remember any specific texts, but I find it interesting that there's no mention of that here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.216.91.171 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.216.91.171_e0c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.216.91.171">contribs</a>) 08:46, 26 July 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

This page contains quite few small erros, and should probably be rewritten. In response the the above person, that is completely wrong. The Beothuk basically moved inland and starved to death as Europeans drove them from the coast. Which I learned from a 3000 level Newfoundland History course offered at MUN. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 134.153.96.40 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.153.96.40_57a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.153.96.40">contribs</a>) 21:42, 8 March 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I heard that some of the Beothuks were reported to have red hair and other Norse characteristics, from contact with the norse during Leif Erickson's time. Anyone else heard this theory? <a href="../../../e/r/n/User%7EErnestleonard_4bf2.html" title="User:Ernestleonard">Ernestleonard</a> 04:03, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>MUN being Memorial University of *Newfoundland*, wouldn't it raise some questions for the university to completely deny that the Beothuk were eradicated by European settlers in Newfoundland? <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChu.chris_9791.html" title="User:Chu.chris">CKSCIII</a> 00:26, 8 April 2006 (UTC) .....................................</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the link to the Beothuk song no longer works. I contacted the CBC about it but they said they could not release it due to copyright problems. I wrote a letter to the email address I got for the Professor who spoke about it on the program but never got any reply. Can anyone else help out here? It would be wonderful to be able to listen to it again.</p>
<p>As to the Beothuks becoming "extinct" - the situation is rather like that of the Tasmanian Aboriginals in Australia. There are, of course, no "full-blood" people left, and the culture has disappeared - however, there are descendants of the Beothuks (and my family claim to be among them). We are making arrangements at the moment to have DNA studies done and I will report here if and when we get some results. In the meantime you might like to check the link I have just made to an article (downloadable in pdf form) which refers to some fascinating DNA research done at McMaster University on DNA taken from Beothuk skulls.</p>
<p>Finally, as to the question about whether some of the Beothuk had Norse characteristics - I have never heard anything like this and imagine it is probably just a story based on the fact that there was a brief Norse settlement at Anse aux Meadows. As far as I know, the Norse sagas indicate that relations with the "Skraelings" were not friendly (can someone who really knows help out here please?) and so it is unlikely there would have been enough mixing (if any) to make such a major contribution to the gene pool. I would suspect that, if there were any Beothuk with red hair, etc., it would more likely have come from early English, French or Basque fishermen. The drawings of the Beothuk women taken to St. John's show them with straight black hair and features that look mainly Amerinidian. Also, photos of my ancestors, who family tradition insist were part Beothuk, show pronounced typical Amerindian looks. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Hill_e416.html" title="User:John Hill">John Hill</a> 22:49, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
