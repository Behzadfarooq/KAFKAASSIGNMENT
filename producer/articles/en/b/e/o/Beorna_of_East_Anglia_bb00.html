	    <p><b>Beorna</b> (also known as <b>Beonna</b>, <b>Benna</b>, <b>Beanna</b> or <b>Beornus</b>) was a ruler in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Anglia_16c5.html" title="East Anglia">East Anglia</a> from <a href="../../../7/4/9/749.html" title="749">749</a>. The end-date of his reign is not known, but may have been around <a href="../../../7/6/0/760.html" title="760">760</a> AD. He shared his reign with another ruler called <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberht_of_East_Anglia_1ee6.html" title="Alberht of East Anglia">Alberht</a> (Æthelberht), and possibly with another named <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hun_of_East_Anglia_ed21.html" title="Hun of East Anglia">Hun</a>.</p>
<p>The primary sources for Beonna are very few. They consist of bare references to his accession or rule in late chronicles, which until quite recently it was impossible to verify. However during the last thirty years a sufficient number of his coins have been found to show that he really existed, and on these grounds several deductions have been made concerning his rule and identity.</p>

<p>Beanna makes his appearance in an annalistic tradition preserved in late compilations (e.g. <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symeon_of_Durham_cb67.html" title="Symeon of Durham">Symeon of Durham</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_of_Wendover_883b.html" title="Roger of Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a>) in material which may derive from <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byrhtferth.html" title="Byrhtferth">Byrhtferth</a> of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsey.html" title="Ramsey">Ramsey</a>, a writer of c1000 AD (attribution cited in M.M. Archibald). The record states that Hunbeanna and Alberht divided the kingdom of East Angles between themselves. <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_of_Worcester_9895.html" title="Florence of Worcester">Florence of Worcester</a> presents an annal for 758 stating that Beornus was then ruling the East Angles. Beorna also appears after AElfwald and before AEthelred in short regnal lists featuring in the <i>Chronicle</i> of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Worcester_acc4.html" title="John of Worcester">John of Worcester</a> and in the <i>de Gestis Regum</i> of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Malmesbury_3b75.html" title="William of Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, Book I.</p>
<p><a name="The_name_Beonna" id="The_name_Beonna"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beorna_of_East_Anglia_bb00.html" title="Edit section: The name Beonna">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The name Beonna</span></h2>
<p>Since the name Beonna also appears on the coins, but is a foreshortened or familiar form lacking the second part of a diathematic structure, the <i>Hun</i> element in the former annal may be a separate name. Hence a tripartite division of the kingdom might be intended. <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beornred_of_Mercia_25db.html" title="Beornred of Mercia">Beornred</a> emerged for a short time in 757 as ruler of Mercia before being driven out by <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offa_of_Mercia_0a86.html" title="Offa of Mercia">Offa</a>. Archibald cites Charles Oman's suggestion that they could be the same person.</p>
<p>No known member of the <a href="../../../w/u/f/Wuffing.html" title="Wuffing">Wuffing</a> family had a name commencing with B. However there were <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercian.html" title="Mercian">Mercian</a> rulers (including <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beornwulf_of_Mercia_5cf1.html" title="Beornwulf of Mercia">Beornwulf</a>) using that letter. Considering the name of Beonna himself and of Beodric, the name-founder of <i>Beodricesworth</i> (afterwards <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bury_St_Edmunds_b1e1.html" title="Bury St Edmunds">Bury St Edmunds</a>), it has been argued that these were members of a family with dynastic claims both in Mercia and in East Anglia. Hence it is suggested that, following the death of <a href="../../../%C3%A6/l/f/%C3%86lfwald_of_East_Anglia_f50b.html" title="Ælfwald of East Anglia">Ælfwald</a>, a Wuffing claimant Æthelberht or Alberht divided his rule with a member of that supposed family.</p>

<p>The decade of the 750s was turbulent. <a href="../../../%C3%A6/t/h/%C3%86thelbald_of_Mercia_9f9f.html" title="Æthelbald of Mercia">Æthelbald of Mercia</a> had dominion over <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex.html" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>, where <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthred_of_Wessex_37cc.html" title="Cuthred of Wessex">Cuthred</a> had ruled since <a href="../../../7/4/0/740.html" title="740">740</a>. In <a href="../../../7/5/2/752.html" title="752">752</a> Cuthred revolted, and (according to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_of_Huntingdon_d3e5.html" title="Henry of Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>) the East Angles, perhaps led by Beonna, joined forces with Æthelbald against Cuthred in the Battle of Burford Bridge. Several kingdoms were already in turmoil when in <a href="../../../7/5/7/757.html" title="757">757</a> Æthelbald was murdered by two of his own bodyguard. Then Beornred ruled Mercia for a few months, rather unsuccessfully, before Offa (a descendant of Æthelbald's grandfather by a different line) emerged and drove him into a remote part of the kingdom. We have Florence's statement that Beonna was ruling in East Anglia in 758.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beorna_of_East_Anglia_bb00.html" title="Edit section: Beonna's coinage and moneyers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beonna's coinage and moneyers</span></h2>
<p>The coins of Beonna are known from a number of individual finds, but also from two important group finds. One is a series from stratified deposits, from a defensible estuarine settlement near <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rendlesham.html" title="Rendlesham">Rendlesham</a>, Suffolk (a Wuffing royal seat). The other is a hoard deposited around 760 at Middle Harling (Norfolk) on the River Thet, north-east of Thetford. <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thetford.html" title="Thetford">Thetford</a>, at the confluence of the Thet with the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ouse_a9b1.html" title="Little Ouse">Little Ouse</a> and upstream of the important settlement at <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandon%2C_Suffolk_3946.html" title="Brandon, Suffolk">Brandon</a> (Suffolk), was probably also an early seat of power.</p>
<p>Beonna was the first East Anglian ruler (and among the earliest rulers of the English) to have a coinage issued with legends naming the ruler and title - a regnal coinage. He had three named moneyers that are known, Werferth, Efe and Wilred. Of these, the coins of Efe are by far the most numerous, and the obverse dies naming Beonna pass through several different types. Dr Archibald suggests that this may represent intensive issues over a short period for military purposes, rather than a prolonged sequence of issue. Distribution analysis (unconclusive with such limited numbers) may suggest a north-central Suffolk or southern Norfolk mint for Efe, and the same scholar cites Euston, Suffolk, a little southeast of Thetford, as a name possibly derived from Efe.</p>
<p>The Efe reverse is based on the 'standard' type, derived from the foregoing C and R series sceattas, while the radial letters around a central pellet seen in most Beonna obverses may owe more to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumbria.html" title="Northumbria">Northumbrian</a> prototypes. The legends are latin, mixed latin-<a href="../../../r/u/n/Runic.html" title="Runic">runic</a>, or (particularly in Wilred's dies) all-runic. Indeed the Beonna coinage as a whole provides an important dateable runic corpus, and may reflect a distinctive East Anglian preference for runic lettering. Beonna is styled 'Rex' or (runic) 'Ress' by Efe.</p>
<p>Wilred uses a rune similar to W after the name, possibly to mean 'Walda' or ruler. Dr Archibald mentions an early coin of Offa struck by the same moneyer, who may therefore have struck at the end of Beonna's reign when Offa's power in East Anglia was growing. The similarity of Wilred's all-runic pennies to the unique penny of Alberht or Aethelberht I confirms their contemporaneity, as does the archaeological context of the Aethelberht find. Wilred may have worked in south-east Suffolk.</p>
<p>A fourth type of coin for Beonna has no named moneyer, but a reverse showing an interlace motif. One specimen of this type has been found at <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorestad.html" title="Dorestad">Dorestad</a>, and these resemble <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankish.html" title="Frankish">Frankish</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisian.html" title="Frisian">Frisian</a> deniers of the <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maastricht.html" title="Maastricht">Maastricht</a> area in the same period.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beorna_of_East_Anglia_bb00.html" title="Edit section: Context">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Context</span></h2>
<p>Beonna's rule coincided with the anointing of <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pippin_III_e338.html" title="Pippin III">Pippin III</a> and the displacement of the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merovingian.html" title="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> dynasty, and also with the martyrdom of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Boniface_719b.html" title="Saint Boniface">Saint Boniface</a>. His issue of a coinage related to Franco-Frisian types implies a continuing engagement in that sphere. He was probably not a Wuffing but shared power with at least one other who probably was of that dynasty. The preponderance of his regnal coinage in this period suggests his seniority within the arrangement of East Anglian rule. During his reign some measure of East Anglian leadership independent of central Mercian authority seems to be maintained. The written evidences and coins confine our knowledge of him to the period 749-c760. He may have assisted Aethelbald against the West-Saxons in 752, and was possibly connected with the unsuccessful attempt of Beornred to take control of Mercia in 757. With regard to his name, the chroniclers of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_of_Worcester_9895.html" title="Florence of Worcester">Worcester</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Malmesbury_3b75.html" title="William of Malmesbury">Malmesbury</a> (who use the form with 'r', <i>Beorn-</i>) did not have access to his coins (which use forms without 'r' such as Beonna or Benna): but since it is now clear that they possessed an authentic tradition, the form with 'r' has equal validity to the contemporary evidence of the coins. Of the end of his reign nothing is known.</p>
