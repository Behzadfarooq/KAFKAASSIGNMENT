<dd>Wiglaf, you appear to be obsessed with the Beowulf/Hrolfs saga parallels. You are in a minority. See e.g. Bjork&amp;Niles, <i>A Beowulf Handbook</i>, pp. 131-2, which quotes a withering assault by Larry Benson on the theory and concludes, "<i>Hrólfs saga kraka</i> has vanished from the docket. ... [This is] the result of the intrinsic inconclusiveness of the comparison." In other words, the theory exists and should be mentioned in an encyclopedia - but it is <i>not</i> proven, it is <i>not even generally accepted</i>, and it should <i>not</i> be given special prominence in the first sentence of an article for a general audience. I have edited accordingly.</dd>

<dd>Wow, it's really no big deal. You're free to work on every single article to check for POV phrases. BTW, if these two traditions are based on the same original traditions, how on earth can anybody expect 100% alignment? The traditions would be separated by hundreds of years and transmitted orally. If you expect <i>conclusive alignment</i> why bother studying legends?--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 23:31, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am quite suprised that this alignment is so infected. For someone who approaches the issue from the perspective of Norse mythology, it seems like a straightforward alignment. There are many alignments within Norse mythology that are undisputed. However, if treated with the extreme demands for conclusive alignment that some demand in this matter, it would lead to the complete desintegration of most knowledge of Norse mythology. The Beowulf and Hrolf Kraki alignments do not only concern events, but also a host of personal names. There were 100s of Germanic names in circulation (this linguistic analysis of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Norse_fa10.html" title="Proto-Norse">Proto-Norse</a> personal names in Beowulf and Swedish rune stones[<a href="http://www.sofi.se/SOFIU/lup/urnord.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sofi.se/SOFIU/lup/urnord.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.] is in Swedish but anyone can read the list of names), so the probability that the personal names (and their relationships) would be a matter of coincidence is so low so as to be insignificant. If anyone would like to compare this particular aligment with the variations within <i>uncontested</i> alignments, see <a href="../../../h/e/o/Heoroweard.html" title="Heoroweard">Heoroweard</a>, any POV is based on the scholarly works cited.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 07:31, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>A lot of this information about Beowulf and his story is also listed under Beowulf the epic poem. It's been my experience in Wiki that editors try not to repeat information. Just something to think about and likely shoot down. 10/10/05</p>

<p>Would it be worthwhile to include the English spellings of the proper names along with the ones that are now there? Something could also be done on how the names have changed from the original to today. Just a thought...</p>
<p>I've tried to look up something about it, but apparently I couldn't find any consistencies in modern English</p>
<dl>
<dd>We could add "modern" spellings, but it could cause a "soup of names" in they eye of the reader. I think Anglo-Saxon spelling is preferable since is much more explicit and tells the read how to pronounce the name. The TH in Heatholaf (the phoneme Ð) is different from that in Ohthere (the two phonemes T and H).--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 14:18, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>About category selection: I don't understand why he can't be both a legendary king and mythological king at the same time? I think he is also a mythological king of the dark ages as he went beyond legend of an ordinary man to become the allegory of 'kingship' who faught with monsters and dragons. I just read a chapter on Beowulf in the book "Storytelling &amp; Mythmaking: Images from Film &amp; Literature" by Frank McConnell: McConnell who gives Beowulf as the example of the epic King and mythological king because of the allegorical performed to the people making the world safe from chaos. I put this on the talk page for people to discuss. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 19:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, if you insist on categorizing him as mythological, you can do that. I am not impossible. My reasons for objecting to it is the fact that Scandinavian kings from the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a> and onwards enter the realm of semi-historicity. Hygelac is widely accepted as based on a historic figure, and the contemporary Swedish king <a href="../../../o/h/t/Ohthere.html" title="Ohthere">Ohthere</a> is often called the "first historic king of Sweden". You can find older scholarship where Beowulf is held to have been a historic figure as well. Moreover, AFAIK, legend is distinguished from myth due to the fact that legend takes place in real world settings, and was at the time it was composed held to be almost historical if not outright historical, like Beowulf.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 19:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I added a short section on Beowulf as a mythological figure. The myth is that he faught a dragon. After research, historical and legendary men can become mythological men, in the oral traditions a lot of myth may start to build out of their life story. In this sense King Arthur is the best example I can think of another man who became a mythological king. Hopefully with the citation it is a good addition. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 05:26, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be a current debate of successor (Sigelac or Wiglaf). I reverted to Succeeded by: Wiglaf??. In the epic itself, not any reproductions or fictionalizations, Wiglaf stood beside him in his final battle. The epic suggests the kingship would pass to Wiglaf. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 19:12, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, who would succeed Beowulf would have been decided by the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thing_of_all_Geats_2238.html" title="Thing of all Geats">Thing of all Geats</a>, where the freemen would decide whom among the candidates had the most noble origins and was best fit for the job. Beowulf himself was elected because his mother had belonged to the Geatish royal family (compare <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweyn_Estridsson_572f.html" title="Sweyn Estridsson">Sweyn Estridsson</a>). Wiglaf could not claim such origins, as he was only a relative of Beowulf's.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 19:18, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a question, true, but seems stronger than Sigelac...&amp; isn't it possible Wiglaf as a relative of Beowulf is just as noble and "best fit for the job"?. Well, my humble opinion comes from my college professor and McConnel. The Sigelac opinion seems to come from "Beyond Beowulf" but that "is a modern sequel"...fictional, right? If a historical reference discussing the claims to successor can be located and then a sentence added to the article discussing the possible heirship, it would make the article stronger. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 23:31, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sigelac is totally out of the question. Sure, Wiglaf may be as fictive as Sigelac, but genuine legend should take precedence over modern novels. In order to become elected a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_king.html" title="Germanic king">Germanic king</a>, you needed royal blood, or at least to be married to the daughter of the former king (e.g. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stenkil.html" title="Stenkil">Stenkil</a>). In one case, a king got elected because the former king was married to his sister, but that was a case of religious desperation (<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blot-Sweyn_dbf4.html" title="Blot-Sweyn">Blot-Sweyn</a>). As I see it, the only way Wiglaf could become king would be to assemble a warband and kill anyone who opposed him as king. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harald_Fairhair_bbba.html" title="Harald Fairhair">Harald Fairhair</a> did just that when <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viken.html" title="Viken">Viken</a> preferred the Swedish king instead of him, and Norse legends tell of a few tough guys who became kings of Sweden that way (<a href="../../../h/a/k/Haki.html" title="Haki">Haki</a> and <a href="../../../s/%C3%B6/l/S%C3%B6lve.html" title="Sölve">Sölve</a>). However, they were killed very soon. AFAIK, Wiglaf's chances to become king should have been very slim.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 23:42, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
