<p>I've been working on merges (air vehicles, aquatic vehicles, starfighters, support craft, capital ships, and probably cargo ships) to reduce cruft and make everything organized, with main template links to fleshed-out articles (X-Wing, AT-AT, and so on). I do like the idea of having all vehicles on one page for even easier access. Even though we have redirect pages, it is always nice to have everything in one place even with multiple lists. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckiller</a> 22:19, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know he's not everyone's favorite, but being the focal point in three movies does count for something. His page is a complete mess, and since the beginning of this month I've been trying to improve it. It's slow, but I've been meeting with some success. It's just that there's so much garbage there I'm getting bogged down. I'm midway through the first movie in the synopsis now.</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../t/e/n/Image%7ETenshinhanBuu.jpg_de75.html" title="Image:TenshinhanBuu.jpg">Image:TenshinhanBuu.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beowulph_d320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beowulph">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<dd>The new DBZ game on the PS2 provides detailed description for every character in the game. In Tenshinhan's description it states that Tenshinhan comes from an unknown alien race, which explains his third eye and his ability to "divide" himself. In Chaozu's description it says that he's some sort of Vampire (I don't remember exactly what kind) and hence his pale pigmentation. Therefore according to the game none of those two is human. I'm not sure whether you can find this information in the series or in the manga, so far the game is my only source. <a href="../../../h/a/k/User%7EHakkinen_645b.html" title="User:Hakkinen">Hakkinen</a> 16:16, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why did you remove ";Chonoryoku (Psychokinesis)" from Piccolo Jr.'s technique list? I added at the bottom of the sentence that it was an "anime only" move. Now I'm not sure how Piccolo Junior captured Gohan in the manga (If memory serves me right, he just grabbed him), but in the anime, young Gohan was magically lifted by a Psychic ability, likely "Chonoryoku". Please explain to me why you want it removed SO BADLY?... ... ...&#160;!<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonball1986_ab56.html" title="User:Dragonball1986">Dragonball1986</a> 03:56 pm, 06 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you helped create the Wedding Saga. I suggest this get moved to the Piccolo Junior Saga (where it came from) because there is no Wedding Saga.

<dd>Question - if Piccolo Jr. used telekinesis in the anime, that means I can't add <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_characters_with_telekinesis_dcb8.html" title="Category:Fictional characters with telekinesis">Category:Fictional characters with telekinesis</a> for him since <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filler_%28media%29.html" title="Filler (media)">filler</a> contradicts the manga, right?

I suggest you keep an eye on <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecoome_6bc7.html" title="User:Recoome">User:Recoome</a> from now on instead. Zarbon's been <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocked indefinitely</a> and his unblock request was denied so there's no need for you to keep an eye on him anymore. Many of us that dealt with Zarbon in the past have noticed that the abusive user Recoome has acted very much like Zarbon <b>including</b> on the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Action_figure.html" title="Action figure">Action figure</a> article; if you check that article's history page, you'll see that sockpuppets were used by Recoome recently. They were taken care of. Anyways, get back to me on that Piccolo Jr. psychokinesis thing.

<dd>I noticed that you and <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Dragon_Flame_7ade.html" title="User:Dark Dragon Flame">Dark Dragon Flame</a> have been having a little dispute on the Piccolo Jr. article. I'll read to you a quote from the VIZ Dragon Ball manga regarding Piccolo's statement at the 23rd Tenkaichi Tournament: "<i>...of course I look like him!!! I am the Great Demon King's reincarnation!!!!</i>" Doesn't that signify that <b>he is</b> Piccolo Daimao himself? Junior inherited all of his father's memories and abilities up until the time of the Great Demon [Piccolo Daimao] King's defeat. It's not that I'm against you or anything, but I agree with Dark Dragon Flame. He is the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnated</a> son of his former self, get it? It can be confusing at first.

<p>It could have something to do with the fact that you were removing categories from articles (only two that I know of) without stating why.

<dd>Most of the Google hits are titles of things, so "earthling" is capitalized along with many other words that wouldn't ordinarily be capitalized. When looked up in a dictionary, "earthling" is given, and there is no indication that it needs to be capitalized. Furthermore, spellcheck doesn't suggest that "earthling" be capitalized, while it does with "Texan", "American", "Japanese", etc. I realize it doesn't matter all that much, but I spent a good deal of time taking care of double redirects, and I'm not thrilled that my work was undone for something that doesn't matter. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 05:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>well you should of seen how the article discribed Piccolo's power before. And the manga clearly states durring the battle with 17 after Piccolo fuses with Kami that he and 17 are 'dead even'. Also about the giant form thing i admit it is a bit of a stretch to put it on there but I really couln't think of another way to discribe it and it really does look like Piccolo gets bigger for example look at pages 84 and 82. can't we at least mention the increased mass? <a href="../../../d/b/z/User%7EDBZROCKS_09a8.html" title="User:DBZROCKS">DBZROCKS</a> 00:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
