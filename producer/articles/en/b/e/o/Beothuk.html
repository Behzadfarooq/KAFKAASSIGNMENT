<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beothuk.html" title="Edit section: History and culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History and culture</span></h2>
<p><i>Beothuk</i> means "people" in the <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beothuk_language.html" title="Beothuk language">Beothuk language</a>. The origins of the Beothuk are uncertain, but it appears that they were an <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquian.html" title="Algonquian">Algonquian</a> group who displaced a <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset_%28culture%29.html" title="Dorset (culture)">Dorset</a> culture in Newfoundland around 1000 CE. The Beothuk culture appears to be the last cultural manifestation, beginning around 1500 CE, of a group that entered the island of Newfoundland from <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador.html" title="Labrador">Labrador</a> around 1 CE and went through three previous cultural phases lasting approximately 500 years each. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Beothuk lived throughout the island of Newfoundland, particularly in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Bay_d738.html" title="Notre Dame Bay">Notre Dame Bay</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonavista_Bay_34ff.html" title="Bonavista Bay">Bonavista Bay</a> areas. Estimates on the number of Beothuks on the island at the time of contact with Europeans vary; recent scholarship suggests that there were no more than 500 to 700 people, who lived in independent, self-sufficient groups of 30 to 55.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, there are said to have been about 1,000 Beothuk who attended a meeting with <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> and Sir <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Palliser_8457.html" title="Hugh Palliser">Hugh Palliser</a> in 1765 at Chateau Bay in <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador.html" title="Labrador">Labrador</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> This was after more than 200 years of contact with Europeans during which it would be expected that their numbers would have dropped significantly due to the introduction of new diseases and attempts to eradicate them. So, it seems unlikely that their numbers were originally nearly as low as many have estimated. Their wide distribution across much of Newfoundland also suggests that there must have been at least several thousand Beothuk on the island when Europeans first arrived.</p>
<p>Like many other hunter-gathering peoples, they appear to have had band leaders but probably not "chiefs" in the usual sense. They lived in conical dwellings known as "mamateeks", made from poles arranged in a circle, tied at the top, and covered with birch bark. The floors contained hollows used for sleeping, and a central fireplace.</p>
<p>The Beothuk painted not only their bodies, but also their houses, canoes, weapons, household appliances and musical instruments with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_ochre.html" title="Red ochre">red ochre</a>, leading Europeans to refer to them as "Red Indians". This ochring had great cultural significance, and took place in a multi-day spring celebration. It designated tribal identity, for example, welcoming newborn children into the tribe; on the other hand, being forbidden to wear ochre was a form of punishment.</p>
<p>Their main sources of food were caribou, salmon, and seals, augmented by the harvesting of other animal and plant species. The seasonal migratory habits of their principal quarry gave rise to similar movements on the part of the Beothuk. In the fall, they set up fences which were used to drive migrating <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribou.html" title="Caribou">caribou</a> towards waiting hunters armed with bows and arrows. They <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_preservation.html" title="Food preservation">preserved</a> any surplus food for later use during winter. They trapped various fur-bearing animals in order to make clothing.</p>

<p>Beothuk canoes were made of bark, and were curved upward at the ends, with sides that rose to a point, and a V-shaped bottom.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Beothuk followed elaborate burial practices. The dead were usually buried in isolated locations. Bodies were wrapped in birch bark and covered with a rock pile, laid on a scaffold, or placed in a burial box with the knees folded. Burial places were furnished with offerings such as figurines, pendants, and replicas of tools.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beothuk.html" title="Edit section: European contact">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">European contact</span></h2>
<p>It's possible that the natives encountered in northern Newfoundland by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norsemen.html" title="Norsemen">Norse</a> around 1000 CE and referred to as <i><a href="../../../s/k/r/Skr%C3%A6lingar.html" title="Skrælingar">Skrælingar</a></i> ("skraelings") were ancestors of the Beothuk or Dorset inhabitants of <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labrador.html" title="Labrador">Labrador</a> and Newfoundland.Later waves of European arrivals, beginning in <a href="../../../1/4/9/1497.html" title="1497">1497</a> with the Italian <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cabot_6901.html" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a>, sailing under the auspices of the British crown, led to contact with the Beothuk being established.</p>
<p>In contrast with some other native groups, the Beothuk strove to avoid contact with Europeans, and moved inland as European settlements grew, only visiting camps during early contact to pick up metals and other items left behind when Europeans left for the winter.Contact between Europeans and the Beothuk was generally negative for one side or the other, with a few exceptions, such as that of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Guy_0c29.html" title="John Guy">John Guy</a>'s party in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1612.html" title="1612">1612</a>.Settlers and Beothuk came to compete for important natural resources such as salmon and seals, and these encounters led to enmity and mutual violence.The settlers, with superior technology, generally had the upper hand in both hunting and warfare.(For reasons that are unclear, the Beothuk had no interest in adopting firearms.) <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Europeans certainly exhibited callous behavior toward the natives, but the Beothuk for their part seem to have had a strong cultural imperative toward revenge that also caused them to carry out apparently pointless attacks.</p>
<p>In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, several Newfoundland governors tried to improve relations, to little positive effect. Apparently, on 21st August, 1765, Sir <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Palliser_8457.html" title="Hugh Palliser">Hugh Palliser</a> (Governor of Newfoundland, 1764-1768) traveled to Chateau Bay (later renamed York Harbor) in Labrador to meet a delegation of 500 <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> and 1,000 Beothuk and made an oral treaty for peace, friendship and trade with them.A map based on one made by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cook_83d3.html" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> has survived with illustrations of a trading post at Pitts Harbour, an Inuit village inside the Seal Islands, and images of an Inuit longboat and a fleet of kayaks.</p>
<p>Two further attempts to improve relations with the Beothuk were those of naval lieutenants George Cartwright in <a href="../../../1/7/6/1768.html" title="1768">1768</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Buchan_44e4.html" title="David Buchan">David Buchan</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a>.Cartwright's expedition was commissioned by Gov. Hugh Palliser; he found no Beothuk but brought back important cultural information.Buchan was sent by Gov. John Duckworth; though undertaken with the best of intentions, this expedition ended in violence.Buchan's party encountered several Beothuk near Red Indian Lake.After an initial apparently friendly reception, Buchan left two of his men behind with the Beothuk.The next day, he found them murdered and mutilated, owing to the Beothuk's suspicion of the visitors (according to Shanawdithit's later account).To his credit, Buchan didn't attempt to take revenge and even tried to make further contact.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beothuk.html" title="Edit section: Extinction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Extinction</span></h2>
<p>Beothuk numbers had dwindled to 400 by <a href="../../../1/7/6/1768.html" title="1768">1768</a>, and by 1829, with the death of Shanawdithit, they were officially <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extinct.html" title="Extinct">extinct</a>, through a combination of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>small initial population</li>
<li>loss of access to important food sources</li>
<li>diseases, such as <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, introduced by Europeans</li>
<li>violent encounters with settlers</li>
</ul>
<p>Relations with the <a href="../../../m/i/27/Mi%27kmaq.html" title="Mi'kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a>, a native group who arrived in Newfoundland during the colonial period, and with the Labrador <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a>, were hostile but didn't often descend into violence. Relations with the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innu.html" title="Innu">Innu</a> were marked by avoidance more than anything else.</p>
<p>Oral histories assert that a few Beothuk might have survived around the region of the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploits_River_460b.html" title="Exploits River">Exploits River</a> and <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twillingate%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_7a31.html" title="Twillingate, Newfoundland and Labrador">Twillingate</a> for some years after they were "officially extinct."One family history records that a "full-blood" Beothuk woman, known as "Elizabeth," gave birth to Susannah Moody at Lewisporte, near the mouth of the Exploits River, on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_14.html" title="January 14">January 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/3/1832.html" title="1832">1832</a>."Elizabeth" is said to have come "gliding in from the woods" at times to see her baby daughter and a son (birthdate and name unknown - although he was said to have become a doctor in England).Susannah married Samuel Anstey, and had several children, many of whose descendants still live in and around Twillingate. Susannah died in 1911.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>, a 75-year old Native woman named Santu, the daughter of a <a href="../../../m/i/27/Mi%27kmaq.html" title="Mi'kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> mother and a Beothuk father, sang a song in the <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beothuk_language.html" title="Beothuk language">Beothuk language</a> for the American anthropologist Frank Speck while she was on her way to <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_7d1d.html" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> and down to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beothuk.html" title="Edit section: Demasduit (Mary March)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Demasduit (Mary March)</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/m/Demasduit.html" title="Demasduit">Demasduit</a> was a Beothuk woman, thought to be about 23 years old, who was captured near Red Indian Lake in March 1819 by a party led by John Peyton, later appointed J.P. at Twillingate, Newfoundland, and son of John Peyton, Sr., a salmon fisherman notorious for his hostility toward the Beothuk. The younger Mr. Peyton is well known for his significant effots to improve relations with the Beothuk, and was held in high regard by Captain David Buchan, with whom he had travelled into the interior of Newfoundland in search of the Beothuk. His 1819 expedition was approved by the Newfoundland governor who was convinced that it might encourage trade and help to end hostilities between the Beothuk and the English. The expedtion also proved profitable for Peyton since he earned a bounty for the capture of a Beothuk. During the capture, Demasduit's husband and brother were killed, and her newborn baby died a couple of days later. She was named Mary March (following the custom of naming captives after the month in which they were taken) and brought to Twillingate and later St. John's. It was intended by the colonial government that Desmaduit receive nothing but comfort and friendly treatment during her time with the English of Newfounfland so that when returned to her people she could serve as a bridge between the Beothuk and the Europeans. She learned some English and was able to provide about 200 words of Beothuk vocabulary. In January 1820, during a trip back to Notre Dame Bay intended to return Demasduit to her people, she died of tuberculosis.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/o/Beothuk.html" title="Edit section: Shanawdithit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shanawdithit</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanawdithit.html" title="Shanawdithit">Shanawdithit</a> was the last known Beothuk. She was captured in April 1823, when in her early 20s, and lived for several years in the home of John Peyton, Jr. (where she was known as Nancy April), working as a servant. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cormack_eed6.html" title="William Cormack">William Cormack</a> had founded the <i>Boeothick Institute</i> in order to foster a positive relationship with the Beothuk, and study and support their culture. His expeditions found Beothuk artifacts, but concluded that the group was dying out. For this reason, Shanawdithit was brought to St. John's in 1828 in order to help Cormack with what remained of his project. She provided Cormack with drawings illustrating Beothuk implements, concepts, and mythologies, and augmented the knowledge of Beothuk words. She was also able to outline the numerical decline of the Beothuk over the previous two decades, testifying that at the time of her capture, only about a dozen remained. Despite medical care from Dr. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carson_642c.html" title="William Carson">William Carson</a>, Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis on June 6, 1829.</p>
