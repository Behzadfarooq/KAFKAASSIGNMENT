<p>An anonymous user posted the following.</p>
<dl>
<dd>One of the very recent additions to the area of behaviorial finance is called Socionomics. Socionomics deals with the study of aggregate social mood in various countries and regions over time, and how that mood drives human perception of financial and economic value (prices, etc.) but also such disparate social indicators as entertainment attendance and the hem length of women's dresses. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Prechter_34ac.html" title="Robert Prechter">Robert Prechter</a> has recently authored a book by that name.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The reason I removed it was not only because it was put, randomly, in the middle of the history section but because it's not really true. I haven't heard of either Socionomics or Robert Prechter but what is described there is basically the link between economic wealth and happiness. This has been analysed in detail by a number of economists ever since Easterlin (1974) published convincing data showing that the link between income and happiness was not particularly strong. An issue of the quarterly journal of economics was devoted to the topic in 1997, iirc. It is not a new field of investigation by any means, but it <i>is</i> worth mentioning. I have added it to the topics in behavioural economics (where it belongs) and will write a page on it when I have the time. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a> 02:00, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You didn't miss anything by not having heard about both prechter and "socionomics". Prechter is an esoterist, numerologue and astrologue, confusing fractals and the famous/infamous elliott waves and gann numbers, and selling that unappetizing fast broth to naive investors under the lofty "socionomics" trademark&#160;;-)). --<a href="../../../p/g/r/User%7EPgreenfinch_6111.html" title="User:Pgreenfinch">Pgreenfinch</a> 07:59, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The guy who posted that on the BF page has now made socionomics. It might be worth adding what you know about Pretcher and the subject on that page, it's rather fawning atm&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a> 23:34, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<p>Well, this failed the FAC because no one really seemed to comment on it. I'll re-nominate it when I have addressed to some extent the only somewhat valid criticism - many of the sub-pages are incomplete. From the FAC page:</p>
<p>Partial self-nom - I added to pgreenfinch's original behavioural finance page. I think it's a good and well referenced article on a fairly interesting subset of finance/economics.

<li><b>Object</b> for now. Wiki needs definetly much more work on economic subjects and I am happy to see activity in this field, but this article is far from ready from featured status. Did you notice there are two 'Criticisms' sections?? I fixed various minor problems, but this needs more interlinks and expansion, especially where there are lists like 'Behavioral economics topics' or 'Key Figures'. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> 20:16, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The outline of the article is split between behavioral finance and behavioral economics, the two criticism sections are specific to each of those sub-sections. I realise more needs to be done in the sub-topics, I wasn't sure if that was a criterion for having the main page (which is a broad outline of the field) featured. A lot of that stuff I'll fill in when I finish exams. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a></dd>

<p>I've gone and made a seperate page for Behavio<b>u</b>ral economics - I'm an Aussie so I spell the word with a U and didn't realise a redirect had been set up from behavoral economics to here. If people who know about this stuff can go look at the <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behavioural_economics.html" title="Behavioural economics">page I made</a> and give some opinions as to whether we should merge the info on these two pages that'd be greatly appreciated. Finance and economics are obviously different fields, but the two movements are fairly closely related so it might be worth merging. I'd just like a 2nd opinion before doing so&#160;:)</p>

<p>EoT: it seemed to me that the "See also <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_and_economics.html" title="Law and economics">law and economics</a>" didnt belong on the graph with criticisms. Feel free to try it someplace else.</p>
<hr />
<p>BF/BE is one of my pet fields, as you might see in my user's page. Imo, you made a very good job in your behavioural economics page. What is true is that BE and BF are studying more or less the same cognitive and emotional, individual and collective phenomena. But the anomalies that those biases create are a bit different if they take place in financial assets or in goods and services.</p>
<p>Thus the two texts would enrich each other, I think, if merged, with a common section about the human biases at play, and separate sections about the applications in finance and in economics. Btw, I think those biases and anomalies are found not only in markets, but also in public choice.</p>
<p>I suggest that the first of us who find the time to make this combination just do it, or at least start it, but I see no hurry as I think it would need a careful job to make something consistent and comprehensive for the readers.</p>
<p>Btw, not being an English speaker, I have no preference about how to spell behavio(u)ral), even if I use the American spelling that I found more common in the web. Funny thing from a froggy, isn'it&#160;?&#160;;-)--<a href="../../../p/g/r/User%7EPgreenfinch_6111.html" title="User:Pgreenfinch">Pgreenfinch</a> 15:35, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Done</b>. I copied the history section from the other page almost wholesale, expanded the methodology section and created seperate topics/criticisms sections for finance and economics. I added some stuff in the finance section on the equity premium puzzle cause I've looked at it a bit.

<p>Thanks for those who assembled the information on this page. What I'd like to see is more of the following:</p>
<p>The behavioral component of economics most likely has a strong connection to the development of the human brain in the Environment for Evolutionary Adaptation. Some authors have explored the connection between evolution and politics (Darwinian Politics by Paul Rubin), but the evolutionary origins of topics like Prospect Theory seem to have had limited scrutiny.</p>
<p>Pyschologists like Dan Wegner have developed comprehensive summaries of human behavior based on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automatism.html" title="Automatism">automatism</a>. How much of this connects with behavioral economics?</p>
<p>Thanks once again.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the feedback&#160;:) Most of what I've written here comes from articles and material covered in my Behavioural Economics subject. We did not look at anything to do with a link between evolution and any of the material (including prospect theory) nor with automatism. General behavioural models assume conscious but not necessarily rational decision making. As explained heuristics, rules of thumb and social norms are taken into account, but it is generally assumed that a decision are being made consciously. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychobabble_be56.html" title="User:Psychobabble">Psychobabble</a> 01:08, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andrew Lo has an interesting paper outlining a theory of Adaptive Markets, which extends the idea of a market as ecosystem in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/JPM2004.pdf" class="external text" title="http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/JPM2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">this working paper</a> with a nice tribute to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Simon_7d2a.html" title="Herbert Simon">Herbert Simon</a>. It takes a formal approach and does not explore evolutionary traits and trade-offs in the development of the human brain. Fear has obvious roots in evolution, however a Google Scholar search for evolutionary origins of greed yields almost nothing. Perhaps it's misplaced aggression in the context of markets.</dd>
