<dd>Hey Behmod, no problem. You're welcome. Another reason I wanted to add Khamenei was because I wanted an Azeri who was more of an Iranian nationalist rather than a separatist.

<p>Hi, Behmod. Regarding the etymology of the word "ordu" (written in the old <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Turkish_language_f605.html" title="Ottoman Turkish language">Ottoman Turkish</a> script as <span dir="rtl">اردو</span> or <span dir="rtl">اوردو</span>), I've checked a few different sources, both Turkish and English (as the English word "horde" descends from "ordu" as well), and it seems that the word is actually most likely of Turkic origin.</p>
<p>The specific text that you quote, being from the early 14th century, would not really indicate a Persian origin for the word insofar as, by that time, Turkic-speaking peoples had been in contact with Persian-speaking peoples for hundreds of years already.</p>
<p>Although I do agree with you (in <a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html#Smal_number_of_persian_word_in_Turkish" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">your statement</a> to <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a>) that the number of Persian words still present in Turkish is vast (although some of the examples you gave him are no longer actually used, such as <span dir="rtl">جنگ</span>, which has been replaced by <i>savaş</i>), it seems that, in this case, "ordu" actually <i><b>is</b></i> in all likelihood a Turkic word. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 08:55, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re your statement "This word ["ordu"] is a [Indo-European] and does not have Altaic origin. It has the same origin with heorde in old English, herd in modern English, herde in German and Kheordu in P.Gmc and other terms in other Indo-European languages." I'd be interested in knowing where you found this information, since it contradicts what I've found in a number of different English, Turkish, and French dictionaries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, "ordugâh" (اردوگاه) also exists in Ottoman Turkish, obviously borrowed directly from the Persian, and means "military camp" or "encampment" (گاه <i>-gâh</i> being a suffix meaning "place"). —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 17:35, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey, Behmod, regarding the following statement you made on <a href="../../../m/e/h/User_talk%7EMehrdadd_e26e.html" title="User talk:Mehrdadd">User talk:Mehrdadd</a>: "a Turkish linguist told me that Turks borrowed the word 'Ordugah' from Iranians which is definitely a Persian word. It is a question for me, if they had 'ordu' why they adopted 'ordugah' from Persians?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I should have made myself clearer: they (the Ottomans) didn't borrow the entire word "ordugâh" (اردوگاه) per se; rather, the word "ordu" seems to have existed in Turkish already—insofar as it is probably of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_languages.html" title="Turkic languages">Turkic</a> origin—but then, because of the way the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Turkish_language_f605.html" title="Ottoman Turkish language">Ottoman language</a> worked (using a mix of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> plurals and suffixes and so forth), they added on the suffix گاه <i>-gâh</i>, meaning "place", which is a Persian suffix. Thus, the <i>suffix</i> is borrowed from Persian, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the entire <i>word</i> is (though it doesn't necessarily mean that it's not, either). Sorry that I didn't make that clear in my previous message here.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>By the way, I'm not "a Turkish linguist", either. Good luck with your etymological hunting. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 13:59, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If, by your phrase "Turkish linguistic", you meant, "Do you know any Turkish linguists?", then the answer is unfortunately, "No, I don't". If you meant, "Are you familiar with the Turkish language?" (i.e., "Do you know Turkish linguistics?"), then the answer is, "Yes, I'm pretty familiar with how it works." I think you meant the former, though. Again, good luck with your research—or, as one would say in Turkish, <i>kolay gelsin</i>. —<a href="../../../s/a/p/User%7ESaposcat_aabe.html" title="User:Saposcat">Saposcat</a> 14:23, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, you're asking how to revert a page? It's quite simple - simple go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dog&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dog&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a> of a page, click on a version, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dog&amp;oldid=55760589" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dog&amp;oldid=55760589" rel="nofollow">"16:53, 29 May 2006"</a>, edit the page, and save it. Get it? In regards to the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_of_Turkey_7504.html" title="People of Turkey">People of Turkey</a> article, I guess the section should be changed to "History", as it is no longer brief. If things are redundant, you can delete them, and add it to the talk page to make sure you're correct. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 00:54, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My discussion with GM was a discussion just to find actual accuracy, not a debate to prove my idea. If it is a Turkic word, I do not hesitate to accept it, but I need to study more about this subject, I do not want to talk without any references. Now, I am trying to track this word in Indo-European languages. If this word exists in old Indo-European languages, it supports that it has a Indo-European origin. If not it is a Altaic word. By the way, at the moment I found a word in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>(old Indian) that seems to be related to word ordu, but I want to make sure about it. But you know that the oldest mention of this word was in Iranian books and I could not find any older reference for his word in Turkic texts. --Behmod 13:41, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Behmod , I was just amused that how dishonest your so called scholarly discussion is going. I am Iranian too and know Farsi, so seeing the Turk and Turks all over those lines of that peom and seeing how you managed to translate Turk to the beautiful made me smile and shake my head. Please don't tell me the Turk in Farsi vocabulary means beautiful. If you have seen it in any Persian dictionary please let me know.</p>
<p>I am an Azeri and while ago one of Persian users here im Wikipedia asked me how come with a name such as "Mehrdad" I am taking anti Iranian stance. I explained that i am not anti Iranian , in fact I have both Persian and Turkish background, as it goes for ancestry, but the truth is when i see how group of my own country men, trying to cover the truths and conspire to spread mis information I can't help but to be outraged. I find my Turkish friends are much more brave with Truth and I am only taking the side of the truth.</p>
<p>As for the word Ordu, looking at my very average Readers Digest dictionary, under the word horde, it says: 1. A multitude, pack, or swarm, as of people, animals, insects, etc. 2. A tribe or clan of nomadic Mongols. 3. Any nomadic tribe or group. -v.i horded, hording To gather or live in a a horde. [&lt;F&lt;G&lt;Polish horda &lt; Turkish ordu campAkin to Urdu.</p>
<p>The name Urdu as the language in Pakistan is also derived from the same word (Ordu), since this language has been created in the course Turku Mongol rule of Moguls in Indian sub continent. It has Hindustani, Persian, Arabic, and to a lesser extent Turkish influences.</p>
<p>Hope it helps. <a href="../../../m/e/h/User%7EMehrdadd_0feb.html" title="User:Mehrdadd">Mehrdad</a> 15:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Behmod, I got your message, my main point was about the translation of the poem by Khajawi Kermani&#160;:</p>
<p>در اردو هاياهوي ترکان</p>
<p>In this case <i>Chanting of Beauties in the camps</i> does not bare any possible meaning. He is talking of the <i>Yaho یاهو</i> chanted by Turkish warriors in the camp(Ordu). So it is very much related to the word we are discussing about.</p>
<p>I am well aware of different interpretation for the word Turk. The word Turk in classical Persian symbolises the beauty, power, sun, and in some lines by Rumi even symbolis god: Rumi:</p>
<p>پارسی گویم هین تازی بهل -- <b>هندوی آن ترک بش ای آب و گل</b></p>
<p>You who are made of worldly elements, go and be obedient (Indian) to god (Turk).</p>
<p>or Hafiz writes:</p>
<p>بیا که ترک فلک خوان روزه غارت کرد -- هلال عید به دور قدح اشارت کرد</p>
<p>The sun brought the end of the fasting hours.</p>
<p>As for the Turkish in <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal.html" title="Mughal">Mughal</a> empire, you are quite right on the Persian influence as a literary language of the Moguls. But have to remember that Baber and descendants were Turk and in fact Babur's auto biography <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baburnama.html" title="Baburnama">Baburnama</a> is in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chagatai_language.html" title="Chagatai language">Chagatai</a> Turkish. Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Hi again. It doesn't have citations, but I don't think it should be moved down. First off, Britannica says Azeris are a Turkic people, so that's why I think it should be mentioned first. Also, most ethnic groups articles have a genetics section <i>at the end</i>, mainly because genetics is a relatively new thing and we shouldn't base an entire article off of it. Perhaps we could find someone to provide citations. Those are just my thoughts. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 05:00, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw your contributions to the <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azari.html" title="Azari">Azari</a> talk page. Please continue to talk and add. I am an Azari. I have tried to explain that Azaris are Turkic-speaking Iranians. Certain users try and delete the facts we post that prove this. They are claiming that their is either a Turkic race or that the Azaris have nothing to do with Iran or any links. Please continue your good work. You seem neutral and fair. <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.57.230.179.html" title="User:72.57.230.179">72.57.230.179</a></p>

<p>Hey Behmod.

<p>I thought you were an anon, so now I can actually respond to you. Look, the problem is that both Babak and Nezami are from the region of what is today Azerbaijan so I'm including them in the history section. I didn't say they were Azeri or not so there shouldn't be any problems. The painter is an Azeri so we can't do anything about that as that's just the way it is. And the Nezami statue caption explains that both Azeris and Iranians claim him as one of their own so there really shouldn't be any controversy as that's just the truth. The article is controversial b/c everyone wants their own way. I'm just trying to write from a neutral position as I have edited both the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> (featured article now) and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Azerbaijan_7da2.html" title="History of Azerbaijan">History of Azerbaijan</a> and worked with both Iranians and Azeris and most support my work. If some people don't, then unless they can give valid reasons for changing, adding or deleting parts of the article, we'll just have to watch them and try to stop them. I mean I'm okay with a concensus view, if other editors think something is too controversial or wrong, I'll definitely respond. I do want to be fair to all parties involved afterall.

<p>Actually, it would make more sense to first say Caucasian peoples and then Iranians if we are talking about the oldest to newest inhabitants. Also, they don't emphasize Iranian except in terms of culture whereas genetically many refer to the peoples of the Caucasus such as the Albanians and Armenians (as many genetic tests bear out). This is why we had the version we had before. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 22:33, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, welcome back. I'm sorry to have reverted you. It's just that I didn't agree with your edits, and I would prefer if we could get a consensus first before you revert again. Could you show me the whole text of the Britannica article? Where did it say that "Azeris originated from a combination of older inhabitants including Iranian peoples and others who had lived in Transcaucasia since ancient times"? Also, as a word of advice: never revert to Dariush4444. His edits are <i>always</i> biased. Please check the edit history of a page before making major edits.
