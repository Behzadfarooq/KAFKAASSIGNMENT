<p><i>"The Hebrew behemoth is equated with the Persian Hadhayosh, as the leviathan is with the Kar and the ziz with the Simurgh."</i> Equated, really? I'd bet not "equated" except in some interpreter's imagination. Where? When? By whom? Equivalents are so much less informative than distinctions.

According to some christian creationists, dinosaurs must logically have been among the animals Noah brought on his ark. I found it interesting that they noted that the description of the behemoth (huge, dangerous, with a tail like a tree) fits rather well with some species of dinosaurs. Quoting http://www.answersingenesis.org/Docs/2.asp: <i>"In the Bible, in Job 40:15-24, God describes to Job (who lived after the Flood) a great beast with which Job was familiar. This great animal, called ‘behemoth,’ is described as ‘the chief of the ways of God,’ perhaps the biggest land animal God had created. Impressively, he moved his tail like a cedar tree! Although some Bible commentaries say this may have been an elephant or hippopotamus, the description actually fits that of a dinosaur like Brachiosaurus. Elephants and hippos certainly do not have tails like cedar trees!"</i></p>
<p>I found this an interesting (and, I have to admit, slightly humorous) piece of information; would it fit to be mentioned, in an appropriately neutral fashion? I'm too new a WPer to dare to do it myself..&#160;;) MMad 14:15, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Doesn't it seem that the section dealing with the theory that the Behemoth is a dinosaur biased against the dinosaur theory. For example, those two reasons that were listed are innacurate due to the fact that the Apatosaur isn't the only dinosaur that is a candidate for being the Behemoth. Saying that a Sauropod has been proposed would be more appropriate. I'm going to go ahead and change this in awhile. In the meantime if anyone has any suggestions feel free to say something --<a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirLiner_bd44.html" title="User:AirLiner">AirLiner</a> 01:12, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also found this to be rank speculation: "1) grasses were not yet found in the apatosurus's environment and" Using that sort of speculation as evidence is ridiculous.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 02:53, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also there is nothing in the Bible that realy says the earth is such and such thousands years old, even if you take a literal interpretation of it. That stems from a interpretation of a monk in the middle ages trying to figure out the age of the earth. It's a common misconception. It's just a common interpretation from people who claim to take the bible literally, a specific viewpoint. For instance you aren't going to get the same arguement from the Pope in Vatican.</p>
<p>Different viewpoints like there is no apple mentioned anywere in the garden of eden; it says that Adam and Eve weren't the first people created (the rest of humanity was created on the sixth day, were as Adam and Even weren't created until after God has his rest on the seventh); there is no rapture mentioned or referenced anywere (the concept wasn't created until the 1800's or so in the US); Easter is a obvious mistranslation(having entered into christainity at a much later date to attract pagans to convert), etc etc. All the people that beleive those things are operating on a purely matter faith and is not anyway based on a literal interpretation since none of them are realy in the bible. (not saying that it's invalid so much, just explaining that it's not there)</p>
<p>As you can see there is considurable conflict between viewpoints. Saying that people who take a literal interpretation believe this or that because they beleive that science is incorrect is VERY misleading and innaccurate to say the least. (and frankly quite offensive to some people) That section should be removed for accuracy.</p>
<p>Although it's good to mention that this viewpoint is very contriversal (for the reasons already stated in the article). Also saying that different people take different view points is perfectly accurate.</p>
<p><br />
There are modern accounts of a sauropodlike animal called Mokele-mbembe living in Africa. As both creatures are rumored to be dinosaurs, some believe that Mokele-mbembe and Behemoth may be one and the same.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think rumors would be the more appropriate word. Account seems to indicate a somewhat reliable source. I will change it. 70.21.216.114 04:16, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are some major problems with the sauropod theory. Verse 15 states that the behemoth ate grass which would be an immense waste of energy for sauropods lowering theirheads to ground level, then lifting them again. They more likely ate from trees.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Verse 16 says ". . . His strength is in the navel of his belly." Navels are the scar-tissue of umbilical chords which only occur in animals that give birth to live young which sauropods did not.</p>
<p>Verse 22 speaks of trees towering over "him" most sauropods are too tall for that to describe.</p>
<p>Verse 24 shays ". . . His nose pierces through snares." this seems to describe a horned animal. (<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECappuccino_Joe_8707.html" title="User:Cappuccino Joe">Cappuccino Joe</a> 06:29, 10 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>In the Bible, Behemoth is simply one of God's creatures. One of God's greatest creatures, but a creature, nonetheless. Demonologists later said that Behemoth was a demon, with one French demonologist saying that he was the "Wine Steward of Hell," and was the chief demon in charge of the sin of gluttony.--<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApokryltaros_82b1.html" title="User:Apokryltaros">Mr Fink</a> 16:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It is definitely just an animal. and thus "on God's side"(<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECappuccino_Joe_8707.html" title="User:Cappuccino Joe">Cappuccino Joe</a> 06:10, 10 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Would it be inappropriate to make a suggestion in the section that mentions the hippo and elephant? I would suggest the Giraffe because it seems to match many of the characteristics listed in Job.</p>
<p>16 Lo now, his strength [is] in his loins, and his force [is] in the navel of his belly.</p>
<p>The giraffe defends itself against threats by kicking with great force. A single well-placed kick of an adult giraffe can shatter a lion's skull or break its spine.</p>
<p>17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his thighs are wrapped together.</p>
<p>The giraffes tail can measure up to several feet long.</p>
<p>20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
<p>This sounds like the behemoth was a carnovour which eliminates every animal of this size, including any herbivor dinosaurs.</p>
<p>21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
<p>22 The shady trees cover him [with] their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
<p>23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, [and] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>
<p>Also sounds like a carnovour. But this could be simply a statement of fear.</p>
<p>Also from wiki The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest of all land-living animal species. Males can be 4.8 to 5.5 metres (16 to 18 feet) tall and weigh up to 1,360 kilograms (3,000 pounds). The record-sized bull was 5.87 m (19.2 feet) tall and weighed approximately 2,000 kg (4,400 lbs.).</p>
<p>Doesn't seem too far fetched that acient people would fear a creature of this size... hell I'd probably be too.</p>

<p>perhaps i am wrong but grass does not seem like something that would require an advent nor does it seem like something that hasn't been around that long its not liek its the wheel or fire, or the sword we're talking about, its grass something i am fairly sure was around 65 million years ago the statement is misleading and confuzing and i think it needs to be reworked--<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManwithbrisk_2534.html" title="User:Manwithbrisk">Manwithbrisk</a> 01:07, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Would "evolution" or "origin" sound better then?

<p><i>Moreover, some suggest that "tail" is a euphemism for male genitalia. Support for this is based on another meaning of the Hebrew word "move" which means "extend" and on the second part of verse 17 describing the sinew around its "stones" (the Vulgate uses the word "testiculorum"].</i></p>

<p>People seem to ignore verse 24 that says " . . . [his] nose pierceth through snares." when trying to determine what kind of animal the behemoth is. The rhinoceros seems to comply with this. Its nose tends to pierce through things, its herbivorous, large, and has a thick protective skin.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the rhino does not have a cedar-like tail. It's possible that the behemoth is some sort of cerapod or distant, extinct relative of the rhinoceros.(<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECappuccino_Joe_8707.html" title="User:Cappuccino Joe">Cappuccino Joe</a> 02:17, 10 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Verse 16 describes the behemoth's "navel" which, of course is a feature only found in animals that give birth to live young. Dinosaurs are thought to have laid eggs so the behemoth must have been some sort of mammal.</p>
<p>(pov) until I come across some solid evidence I'll have to say this behemoth is some sort of horned creature that has yet to be discovered.(<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECappuccino_Joe_8707.html" title="User:Cappuccino Joe">Cappuccino Joe</a> 06:07, 10 March 2007 (UTC))</p>
