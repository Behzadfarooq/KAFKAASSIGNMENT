<li>I didn't say the subject was unfit for featured status. It <i>is</i>. The article, however, is just simply not detailed enough to be a featured article.

<li>I don't know. Cultural references? Other designs? Potential uses? Surely more can be said than simply how to make one and how to then use it. I'm not an expert on the topic. But if this were to be featured, it would set a really terrible precedent, because up until now, nothing this short has been featured - and any old ones that were this short have since been weeded out. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 14:04, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>As a further example, the history section is terrible, and Securiger gives further examples of ways this could be expanded below.

<li>The reason there is little history is probably that nobody knows the history. This stuff all emerged on long-distance hiking trails, and most of the people who were around at the time were not using online journals to report their inventions. A truly word-of-mouth invention is hard to track. Orcrist 18:19, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. Fascinating, well written article frittered away a whole afternoon for me! - although it is much imporved by the new history section. BTW, some of the external links indicate that there are numerous other designs around. Ideally the article would mention the number of designs, compare top models, and perhaps trace when it became popular for hikers to experiment with them. But that's a heck of a lot of work and I wouldn't withhold my vote waiting for it. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 05:20, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Object, incomplete. Even the links there provide a fair amount of material that is not covered in the article. <s>Specifically (but not limited to) burn time of fuel, ie how much less efficient is it? More details on the construction. I didn't really get an idea of how it worked until I read the external links. Variations on the construction. Is JB weld the <i>only</i> option for building the stove? One of the links refers to foil tape.</s> I could go on, but I only looked at a couple of the external links and found all this. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 14:31, Oct 31, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't need JB weld or flue tape if you make the stove perfectly under the standard design. But that can be challenging, so they both are very useful.Orcrist 18:19, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Recent edits have improved the completeness though I see a bit more that needs to be covered. Also, after the additions the organization of material is a bit awkward. Especially the construction section. Aluminum should not be used, but is the best choice? More could be said about both of those and about the windscreen, why needed, etc. Also some clarification is needed on the variations. What are the "internal" lines in the drawings there for? I think it would be clearer without them, I have no idea what they are trying to show. Is the side burner version more efficient since it blocks the fuel vapor from coming out anywhere but the burner holes? - No problem on that one if there is no data to tell either way, but in general the info on each variation could be epanded. Especially interesting is the more powerful sealed version. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 01:53, Nov 5, 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with this is that many of us have taken the time to build these things but have not published or produced high-quality webpages illustrating the results. Holes on the side are comparable in efficiency to holes on the top. Aluminum cans are good because they don't rust (much) and they are light weight. Steel cans are not so good. The sealed version is interesting, but perhaps it should get its own page, since the design is both more complicated as well as more difficult to make. Orcrist 18:19, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Objections: The history section is too short to be a section, we should expand it. There are no references. The images could use better captions. The <i>variations</i> section should should be expanded and turned into flowing prose. <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESverdrup_2f1f.html" title="User:Sverdrup">✏ Sverdrup</a> 23:07, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Shouldn't happen. Until it runs out of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol.html" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>, the temperature of parts in close proximity to the fuel will not rise much above the boiling point of ethanol (78.4°C). And once it does run out of fuel, it stops producing heat! There is a possibility that peripheral parts immersed in flame, but a long way from the fuel reservoir, could get much hotter. However if operated correctly this will not happen to any part. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 05:34, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The melting point of aluminum is 933.47 K (660,32 °C or 1220.58 °F) It is a very good conductor of heat (which is one of the reasons it can be used instead of copper), and exchanges heat fairly well with air (that's why it is used for Heatsinks in Computers) so you'll need a little more than 1.8 kW of heat for a few seconds to melt it.--<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeelkar_ee7d.html" title="User:Deelkar">Deelkar</a> 14:29, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>I have been doing a bit of research into where the design originated, and unfortunately it seems to evolved from a very old design. The patent linked to above is for a similar design from 1892. The burners where used extensively as fondue burners for fondue cooking. The differences I can see is that the pepsi can and trangia stove both don't use absorbent material in the lower half and they don't have wire mesh across the top of the opening. The design of the internal wall to transfer heat (shared by pepsi can and trangia) must have originated somewhere?

<p><s>The Safesport stove claims to be Pat No 55308, it is stainless steel design and is an excellent stove.</s></p>
<p><s>In answer to Duk question of history, here is what I know User:Eagle</s></p>
<p><s>It was spring of 2000 when I was scoutmaster of a new troop without camping equipment. The stainless steel "safesport" stove (box claims Patent no 55308) I had taken on a woodbadge trip to Philmont seemed perfect, however a source was not forthcoming as the company seems to be out of business. That search for an inexpensive backpacking stove did turn up various sites featuring tuna can and tomato paste (steel) can stoves which as the commercially available Trangia stove worked on the same principle as the "safesport" stove.</s></p>
<p><s>While waiting for a Trangia to arrive via REI, I began experimenting with the can stoves as a potential project for the boys in the troop. Such a project is suitable for metal working meritbadge and stimulate the boys to consider how to make and modify their own camping gear rather than simply purchasing it.</s></p>
<p><s>These experiments included various aluminum can designs that seemed to be new to the web at that time. I was not satisfied with several aspects of the existing design as 1- it required two cans to make one stove and 2- required a separate pot support. A couple of days experimenting resulted in a design that overcame both those limitations, a stove that could be made from one can and that would self support a cooking pot. An unanticipated benefit was that the pot snuffed the central flame causing a higher pressure burn of the alcohol vapor jetting thru the holes only.</s></p>
<p><s>I have used three stoves to support a large pot for patrol cooking.</s></p>
<p><s>This turned out to be a wonderful scout meeting project as the aluminum of the cans is soft enough that ragged edges do not cut young skin and a boy can actually make a first stove in 20 minutes. One technique is to have the older boys learn how to make the stoves with adult instruction, while the younger boys received instruction on rank advancement, then have the older boys teach the younger boys how to make the stove. Many boys continued to practice their stove making skills at home, some becomming quite profecient.</s></p>
<p><s>This design was then taught to other troops and staff at summer camp and camporees over the next couple of years and in 2001 was a roundtable project for other leaders complete with a printed "how to" handout. The top of the can becomes the top of the stove with holes punched using the plastic topped bulletin board pins.</s></p>

Making mistakes when contructing it may cause internal perssure build-ups until it ruptures/explodes. Placing it on something that is sensitive to heat may cause burn marks or even fires.

It is true that we have no obligation or no responibility to educate people into a safety mindset. But we also had absolutely no obligation to participate in Wikipedia either.

The argument "People should be more safety concious" is not a valid argument. I think that argument rather speaks for <i>keeping</i> the information; the argument "If we add a caution section here we have to do it everywhere" is an illegal use of slippery slope reasoning. We are not obliged to do anything. I <i>choose</i> to do it here; The argument "We have already put up the universal disclaimer" does not obligate removal of additional subject-specific cautionary information.</s></dd>

So that's what I what I would like to hear: arguments that speak for active removal of cation information that elevates risk awareness.

<p><s>It might be worth mentioning that sometimes people make the mistake of trying to "blow out" the standard design stove, which doesn't work and is a good way to start a messy fire. The stove "goes out" when it runs out of fuel. One could cover the stove to cut off oxygen, but that's uncommon, since one may not have an extra pot or lid available when hiking due to size/weight considerations. This is the sort of notice that only applies to stoves similar in design to the Pepsi Can Stove and consequently does not appear elsewhere.

<p><s>One of my Wikipedia peeves is the use of the word <i>soda</i> instead of <i>soft drink</i>. People in many regions of the United States not only use different regional slang to refer to soft drinks (i.e. Pop or Coke), but take offence when they see <i>soda</i> used that way in print. It is offensive to insinuate that one region's non-standard slang term should replace its equivalent in another region. Furthermore, words from the general English lexicon should preferred over regional slang terms in Wikipedia. Lastly, since such a stove could be fabricated from a beer can or an iced tea can, a less specific term for such a can would be more appropriate.</s></p>
<p><s>I propose that this article be renamed to either <b>Beverage can stove</b> or <b>Aluminum can stove</b>.

The Pocket Rocket outweighs the soda can, but 10 days of alcohol outweighs 10 days of isobutane. A rough calculation goes as follows. Let one meal consist of boiling two cups of water and keeping it at a boil for seven minutes, since that's what it takes to make many popular instant pastas.

Two of them is enough to last more than 10 meals (it should last 13 or 14 meals). The Pocket Rocket weighs 3.2 oz. That's 19.2 oz. An alcohol stove takes approximately 2 oz. of fuel per meal. 20 oz. of denatured alcohol weighs roughly 21.3 oz (denatured alcohol is comparable in mass to water, and a liter of water mass of 1 kg). The soda can stove weighs .2 oz. That's 21.5 oz, not counting a stove stand or wind screen which are desirable for the soda can stove but perhaps not for the Pocket Rocket.
