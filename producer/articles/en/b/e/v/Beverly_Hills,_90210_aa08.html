The show followed the lives of a group of teenagers living in the posh, star-studded community of <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills%2C_California_4c82.html" title="Beverly Hills, California">Beverly Hills, California</a> and attending the fictitious West Beverly Hills High School and then fictitious <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_University_d49b.html" title="California University">California University</a>. The show was created by producers <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Spelling_a498.html" title="Aaron Spelling">Aaron Spelling</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Star_b7de.html" title="Darren Star">Darren Star</a>. The "90210" in the title refers to one of the suburb's postal codes (or <a href="../../../z/i/p/ZIP_Code_3179.html" title="ZIP Code">ZIP Code</a>).</p>
<p>Originally the central characters were fraternal <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twin.html" title="Twin">twins</a> Brandon (played by <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Priestley_b433.html" title="Jason Priestley">Jason Priestley</a>) and Brenda Walsh (played by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shannen_Doherty_329c.html" title="Shannen Doherty">Shannen Doherty</a>), who moved with their parents, Jim and Cindy, from <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis.html" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> to Beverly Hills. However, during the show's run, its focus shifted substantially. The show addressed many topical issues like date rape, alcoholism, drug abuse, teen suicide and teen pregnancy.</p>
<p>Although the first season had low ratings, FOX stuck by the show partially out of desperation due to the lack of original programming available for the network at the time<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The show gained popularity during the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, when FOX aired a special "summer season" of the show while most other series were in reruns. The series became one of FOX's top shows when it began its season that fall. Viewership increased dramatically and the cast members, particularly Priestley and <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Perry_ca5b.html" title="Luke Perry">Luke Perry</a>, became <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_idol.html" title="Teen idol">teen idols</a>, while the series would make actresses <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shannen_Doherty_329c.html" title="Shannen Doherty">Shannen Doherty</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tori_Spelling_bb89.html" title="Tori Spelling">Tori Spelling</a> household names.</p>

The hired <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitman.html" title="Hitman">hitman</a> inadvertently kills Antonia instead due to the fact that she drives Dylan's car at the time of the planned hit.

<p>The series <i><a href="../../../m/e/l/Melrose_Place_e103.html" title="Melrose Place">Melrose Place</a></i> was initially a <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinoff.html" title="Spinoff">spinoff</a> from the show, as actor Grant Show (who played Jake on <i>Melrose Place</i>) appeared for a multi-episode run as Kelly's love interest. In later seasons, <i>Melrose Place'</i>s development into an ultra-sensationalistic soap opera influenced its predecessor, which headed off into the same direction. However, the initial failure of <i>Melrose Place</i> during its first season created a ban on future <i>90210</i> spinoffs; plans to split <i>90210</i> into two shows (one focusing on the main cast and another focusing on a new group of high school students) upon the graduation of the main cast from high school were aborted.</p>

<p>Star later produced a series <i><a href="../../../g/r/o/Grosse_Pointe_%28television%29_d4de.html" title="Grosse Pointe (television)">Grosse Pointe</a></i>, which satirized the production of a high-school soap opera being filmed in Los Angeles. The show was clearly a <i>90210</i>-style show.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the show that was the subject of parody was the fact that many of the show's cast members were in their mid-to-late 20s and not teenagers. In particular, Luke Perry and <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabrielle_Carteris_2750.html" title="Gabrielle Carteris">Gabrielle Carteris</a> were singled out for most of the criticism regarding being too old to play teenage characters.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> did their own parody of the show when Jason Priestley hosted in 1992. In the episode, it is announced that the zip code <a href="../../../9/0/2/90210.html" title="90210">90210</a> would be changed to <i>90218</i>. Several of the kids took offense to it and reacted in different ways (Kelly and Donna go shopping, Dylan gets drunk, Brandon keeps taking everyone keys and putting them in a lock box feeling they are not able to drive, etc.). In the end, the zip code reverts back to 90210 after protest.</p>

During the sketch, the character of Tori constantly says, "I can do whatever I want because this is my daddy's show." Aaron Spelling took offense to this, and asked for an apology from the producers of the show (he never got one).</p>
<p>The Mickey Mouse Club did a parody sketch called <i>Beverly Hillbillies 90210</i>, combining the characters of both <i>90210</i> &amp; <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i>.</p>
