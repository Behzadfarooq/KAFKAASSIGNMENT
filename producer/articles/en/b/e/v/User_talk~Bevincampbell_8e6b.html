<p>Please refrain from undoing other people's edits repeatedly. If you continue, you may be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocked</a> from editing Wikipedia under the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">three-revert rule</a>, which states that nobody may <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">revert</a> a single page more than three times in 24 hours. (Note: this also means editing the page to reinsert an old edit. If the <i>effect</i> of your actions is to revert back, it qualifies as a revert.)

<dd>Oh, 3RR doesn't apply to successive edits, but rather to <i>reverting</i> the page; it's designed to prevent most edit wars, where two people go back and forth between page versions. It's not so much adding the page that's the big problem, though -- that is an issue, but the bigger issue is when a number of editors are asking you to avoid copy-pasting in copyrighted material, trying to make contact with you, and you just keep putting it back in without any comment or attempt at communication, even after you've been given warning templates. I know that you're new, so I don't expect you (or anybody, for that matter) to be perfect, and I would like to see you contribute wholesomely, and you should know that I generally don't hold grudges... but at the same time concerns like copyright can't go on unaddressed. The content you were copy-pasting would have to be released under the Gnu Free Documentation License, and the release would have to be made on or by the owners of the site in question, if that makes sense. See <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPY_08ab.html" title="WP:COPY">WP:COPY</a> and related pages for more information. I hope that clears things up a bit.

<p>Hello - in response to your message on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAbsolutDan&amp;diff=68115698&amp;oldid=68059649" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAbsolutDan&amp;diff=68115698&amp;oldid=68059649" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, the issue with Blend corp is that, in its current form, it doesn't pass notability guidelines (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a>) for companies/corporations (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>). If you click those 2 links it'll bring you to guidelines regarding notability. If you can prove that Blend corp does in fact meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> guidelines, please do so by citing (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) information from reliable sources (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>).</p>
<p>Regarding your logos, I can see the first one (Image:Blendcorplogo.jpg) wasn't tagged or described and triggered the message you got on your talk page. However the second one you uploaded (Image:Bclogo.jpg) seems to be tagged OK and you haven't received a message about that. Since they're duplicates, I suggest editing the first one and adding {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}} to the top to signify you wish to have it deleted. If you do receive a message later on about the second image, contact the person that leaves you the message and ask what type of information is missing from the image. Bear in mind however that if the article Blend corp is deleted, all the logos will be "orphaned" and will probably be deleted anyway - images on Wikipedia must be used in an article for them to remain. If you want to upload your logo for general use not specifically tied to an article, try <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Commons_7b57.html" title="Wikimedia Commons">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 03:33, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm of the opinion that it's still covered by <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> as it appears to be more of a company than anything else. However if you feel it falls under other another category, feel free to check out those applicable notability guidelines (in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a>) and try to make the article meet one of those. For example, if Blend corp's website is highly notable, it could fall under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</dd>
<dd>If however it cannot meet any of these guidelines, then it will probably be deleted. There is another option, if you're interested: userfying it. Every regular editor here has a userpage that can be used to describe yourself and your affiliations (within reason!). Your userpage is here:</dd>
<dd>User:Webmaster@pbsfm.org.au.</dd>
<dd>Though we generally encourage people to try to make their userpages reflective of their <i>Wikipedia</i>-related activities, the rules for userpages are much more lax, and you could probably put some info up there about Blend corp. You could even ask for the entire article to be userfied - have it be a subpage of your username. If you're interested in doing this, visit the AfD (articles for deletion) listing for Blend corp and copy and paste the following (or similar) at the bottom of the discussion:</dd>
<dd>*'''Comment''': If the result of this AfD is "delete", I request that the article be '''Userfied''' under my username. Thank you ~~~~</dd>
<dd>This will produce the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If the result of this AfD is "delete", I request that the article be <b>Userfied</b> under my username. Thank you &lt;the 4 tildes will produce your signature here&gt;</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If it is userfied, the article would then be at a page like the below:</dd>
<dd>User:Webmaster@pbsfm.org.au/Blend corp</dd>
<dd>If you have any further questions let me know! --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:30, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
