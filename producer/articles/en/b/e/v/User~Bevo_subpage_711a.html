Thus the cows do not slaughter you, you do not slaughter the cows, and the pacifist monks are satisfied.</p>

You again have to fill out forms for the missing cow and for the lost milk. You are then paid to sit on your bum and never put in a decent day's work again.

You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull, which you use to breed to the other cow. Then you create a website and start offering to export sperm from the bull to anyone and everyone, especially emerging markets, over the Internet. After a few weeks, your company completes its IPO on NASDAQ, and a few brokerage firms start coverage with a strong buy rating for this wonderful new Internet stock. Your stock zooms from the $0.10 per share initial offering price to $110, when you sell. The stock plummets back to $0.10 a few months later when the investors who bought it realize that your business has no earnings and never will, despite the Internet presence. Several law firms and the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_f519.html" title="Securities and Exchange Commission">SEC</a> bring various civil and criminal actions against the company, all of the officers and directors and (of course) you, under various fraud theories. You quickly settle the civil cases so the lawyers get paid, but you still have plenty stashed away. You plead <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nolo_contendere.html" title="Nolo contendere">nolo</a> in the SEC case, and you are sentenced to ten years in prison, of which you actually serve seven weeks.

Given that you have two cows, infinitely many cows exist.<br />
First, observe that at least one cow (<span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><sub>0</sub></span>) exists. Let <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/0/b/f0b01fe0a1eec87c634584ac0694fb71.png" alt="\mathbb{C}" /> be defined as the set of all cows and define <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/2/c/92c2d270f0ddfd68f851c13c1f852d9a.png" alt="\mathbb{F} \subseteq \mathbb{C}" /> to be the set of all cows in your farm.

Noting that <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i></span> is an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinal_number.html" title="Ordinal number">ordinal number</a>, that is, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/a/d/1/ad1a06c428ef4fa078bb087db97eabb5.png" alt="\mathbb{F} = \left\{ 1st\ cow,\ 2nd\ cow,\ 3rd\ cow,\ \ldots \right\}" />, the second cow cannot exist independently of the first cow, i.e. <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i>(<i>n</i> + 1) iff <i>E</i>(<i>n</i>)</span>.<br />
Consider the case when <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i> = 0</span>. Since <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><sub>0</sub></span> exists, <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i>(<i>n</i>) = <i>E</i>(0)</span> is true. Similarly, it is given that <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><sub>1</sub></span> exists, and so <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i>(<i>n</i> + 1) = <i>E</i>(1)</span> is also true. Therefore, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/d/9/dd9dd518b74d914890100cf4f3356c4f.png" alt="E(n) \Rightarrow E(n + 1)" />.<br />
Therefore <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/a/7/3a7345ebc7fa68214d7e840597b5e0c8.png" alt="\forall n \left\{ n \in \mathbb{Z}_0^{+}&#160;: E(n) \right\} \Longrightarrow \mathbb{C} \supseteq \mathbb{F} \equiv \mathbb{Z}_0^{+} \Longrightarrow \left|\mathbb{C}\right| = \aleph_0" />. <i><b><a href="../../../q/2E/e/Q.E.D._961e.html" title="Q.E.D.">Q.E.D.</a></b></i><br />
(The flaw: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/d/9/dd9dd518b74d914890100cf4f3356c4f.png" alt="E(n) \Rightarrow E(n + 1)" /> works for <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i> = 0</span> only because <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i>(0)</span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>E</i>(1)</span> are both true by assumption. If <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i> &gt; 0</span>, we only have <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/e/9/2e92703cf83319df96dbd23d94c55ef4.png" alt="E(n + 1) \Rightarrow E(n)" />.

You have two cows. The government takes them and puts them in a barn with everyone else's cows. They are cared for by ex-chicken farmers. You have to take care of the chickens the government took from the chicken farmers. The government gives you as much milk and eggs as the regulations say you should need.</p>

You have two cows.<br />
You fear a revolt by the cows to take over your farm. So, you kill them both. You change your farm into a weaponry mass-production plant to feed yourself. However, you are still starving.</p>

You have two cows. They produce lots of milk until a bear comes and attacks them. They are severely wounded, their children die off, and they refuse to produce milk. They then start to recover and produce milk when federal <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interest_rates.html" title="Interest rates">interest rates</a> rise, still not outperforming inflation but enough to kill your cows off.</p>

You have two cows. They get taken to a remote farm and go through different challenges to win the "immunity idol." Then they vote each other off and a "jury" of other cows pick one to win a million dollars. The winner eats the money and dies from internal paper cuts and the loser goes on to make millions from sponsors and ads.</p>

Some people say you have two <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow.html" title="Cow">cows</a>. Others disagree. Some experts state that anyone who denies the existence of your cows is probably smoking too much <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manure.html" title="Manure">manure</a>, but others revert them and call them <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a>. Eventually, the neighbors get so annoyed that they call the Dairy Committee, which, after spending the rest of the season trying to build a quorum, tells the experts in question that they are no longer allowed to milk your cows. The experts change their names, and within a week are back kicking the by-now-dead cows.</p>
