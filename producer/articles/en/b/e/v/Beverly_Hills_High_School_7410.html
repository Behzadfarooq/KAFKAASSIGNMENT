<p>In the media, students of Beverly Hills High School are typically portrayed as absurdly affluent. For example, in the fictional version of Beverly in the film version of <i>The Beverly Hillbillies,</i> Davids serve students gourmet coffee in the hallways.</p>
<p>Beverly has been featured in many movies, including <i><a href="../../../c/l/u/Clueless.html" title="Clueless">Clueless</a></i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0112697/locations" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0112697/locations" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_Women_Have_Curves_2dda.html" title="Real Women Have Curves">Real Women Have Curves</a>,</i> and <i><a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i> <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0038650/locations" class="external autonumber" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt0038650/locations" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, which featured a scene in Beverly's unique "Swim Gym," perhaps the only gymnasium that has a basketball court that can split open to reveal a recreational-sized, 25-yard swimming pool. The clear-glass backboards originated on this court as did the orange color on the basket hoops.</p>
<p>Beverly has been featured in cartoons, including <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills_Teens_2a84.html" title="Beverly Hills Teens">Beverly Hills Teens</a>. The French animated series <i><a href="../../../t/o/t/Totally_Spies%21_a3fc.html" title="Totally Spies!">Totally Spies!</a></i> also takes place at "Bev High."</p>

<p>Perhaps the most recent published book on student life at Beverly is Hard Lessons: Senior Year at Beverly Hills High School, by Michael Leahy (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0316518158</a>). Published in 1988, it is a comprehensive book that followed Leahy's sociological study of Beverly students in the mid-1980s. In 1984, Beverly had a 100% graduation rate, but three students committed suicide. Leahy "heard so many stories of excruciating academic pressure, cocaine abuse and drifting children" that he decided to study the school's student body by interviewing students, parents, and teachers. He followed the lives of six Beverly seniors from the day they started school until the day they graduated in 1985.</p>
<p>Leahy wrote, "It did not take long during my conversations with Beverly students before I understood that their world was nothing like the one I had imagined from casually observing teenage behavior in malls and at rock concerts. After that initial shock, the task became to listen to students long and carefully enough until I adequately understood the panorama of life at Beverly." Leahy learned that in spite of the media's typical portrait Beverly was "not a den of hedonism." Leahy observed that "Social attitudes and mores appear to be nearly identical to those found in the middle-class high schools of the Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley -- the evidence of drug and alcohol use no more or less high, the discussion of sex and birth control equally as obsessive."</p>
<p>Still, Beverly's academic and social pressures did create problems in the mid-1980s. Leahy quotes a teacher who said in 1985, "The admired kid here is not necessarily the good-looking athlete. The possibility of success in the future is important to someone's overall attractiveness. Kids are already planning their law practices or where they might set up their businesses. Sometimes you can't see their problems through that act of maturity they put on for you. If they're not well adjusted, then that illusion can be a real problem, because some of them are facing pressures that they don't know how to cope with. Your whole worth here, in these kids' eyes, is determined by how well you're doing academically and socially. A 'C' is a horrible grade to them, a failing grade. Sometimes a 'B' is, too. There's been a lot of cheating. The anxiety is only growing worse."</p>
<p>According to the 1985 edition of the school yearbook, "The Beverly Pursuit is the path to success. . . . One wrong move, and the student could be traveling in endless circles. Sure, he will have a chance to roll again, but he will have to take advantage of every opportunity. Sometimes a student will land in the wrong square, but he must be patient. Someday he will be able to cash in all his chips and reach the center of attention. Of course, everyone wants a piece of the pie. If a student does not have the right moves, he will go hungry. . . ."</p>

<p>Beverly Hills High School claims that its Performing Arts Department is "nationally famous for the quality of its musical and theatrical productions and for its famous alumni," and the school claims that the department "is highly visible in the industry, with casting directors, writers and producers attending performances and visiting classes to speak with the students."<a href="http://bhhs.beverlyhills.k12.ca.us/performing_arts/?rn=9087" class="external autonumber" title="http://bhhs.beverlyhills.k12.ca.us/performing_arts/?rn=9087" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Each year around late March to early April, the school hold its annual musical performance by performing arts students.

<p>BHHS now has a very successful competitive Winter Drumline. The BHHS Drumline is in its second competitive season. They compete in the SCPA and WGI circuits. The BHHS Drumline has performed such shows as "A Tour of Technology: The Inner-Workings of a Computer" and "Censor State: The State, The Conceded, The Resistance".

The oil well on the Beverly Hills High School campus</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Owned by the Venoco Oil Company, an oil well on Beverly's campus can easily be seen by drivers heading west on Olympic Boulevard towards <a href="../../../c/e/n/Century_City_071d.html" title="Century City">Century City</a>. The oil well has drilled most of the oil out of Beverly's campus and has been slant drilling under many homes and apartment buildings in Beverly Hills for decades.</p>
<p>As of May 2006, the Beverly Hills High School well was pumping out 400 to 500 <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrel_%28unit%29.html" title="Barrel (unit)">barrels</a> a day, earning the school approximately $300,000 a year in royalties <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1942646&amp;page=3" class="external autonumber" title="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1942646&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, an art studio volunteered to cover the well, which at that point was solid gray in color, with individual tiles that had been painted by kids with cancer. The studio created the design and drew the lines on the tiles, but children painted the tiles in between the lines. The studio made the design rather abstract: the design consists of random shapes on different-colored backgrounds. A ceremony inaugurating the design was held in 2001. The project's name was "Project 9865."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Beverly gained more notoriety when <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erin_Brockovich_1c88.html" title="Erin Brockovich">Erin Brockovich</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Masry_5aae.html" title="Ed Masry">Ed Masry</a> filed three lawsuits in 2003 and 2004 on behalf of 25, 400, and 300 (respectively) former students who attended Beverly from the 1970s until the 1990s. The lawsuits claim that toxic fumes from the oil well caused the former students to develop <a href="../../../h/o/d/Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma.html" title="Hodgkin's lymphoma">Hodgkin's lymphoma</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. The oil well is very close to all of Beverly's sports facilities, including the soccer field, the football field, and the racetrack. Beverly students -- not just athletes but students taking required physical education classes from the 1970s until the 1990s -- were required to run near the oil well. The city, the school district, and the oil companies named as plaintiffs dispute this assertion, claiming that they have conducted air quality tests with results showing that air quality is normal at the high school. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/29/national/main551421.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/29/national/main551421.shtml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/West/01/03/brockovich.beverly.hills.ap" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/West/01/03/brockovich.beverly.hills.ap" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>After receiving complaints about Beverly's oil well, the region’s air-quality agency investigated Venoco Oil and in 2003 issued three "notices of violation" regarding the operation of the well. Venoco's penalty settlement included a requirement that the company maintain continuous air quality monitoring at the high school.<a href="http://www.aqmd.gov/news1/2003/venocosettlementpr.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aqmd.gov/news1/2003/venocosettlementpr.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>On December 12, 2006, the first 12 plaintiffs (of over 1000 total) were dismissed on summary judgment because there was no indication that the contaminant (benzene) caused the diseases involved and the concentrations were hundreds to thousands of times lower than levels associated with any risk. <a href="http://www.cjac.org/publications/news/files/SUMMARY%20JUDGMENT%20ORDER%20-%202006-12-12.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cjac.org/publications/news/files/SUMMARY%20JUDGMENT%20ORDER%20-%202006-12-12.pdf" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>The oil well may have inspired a 1991 episode of the sitcom <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saved_By_the_Bell_a000.html" title="Saved By the Bell">Saved By the Bell</a> titled "Pipe Dreams." In it, oil is discovered at fictional Bayside High School in Pacific Palisades, California. There's excitement about the financial possibilities, but when a company comes in to drill, the character of Jessie realizes that it could be detrimental to the local environment.</p>
