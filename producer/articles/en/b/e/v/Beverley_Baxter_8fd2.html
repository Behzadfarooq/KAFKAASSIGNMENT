<p>Baxter's father (James B. Baxter) was a <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>-born <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> who had emigrated to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and Baxter was born in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. He left school at the age of 15, to work as an office boy for a stockbroker. However, Baxter disliked the work and left soon after to work for the Nordheimer Piano and Music Company where he sold <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">pianos</a>. He was made personal assistant to the owner. In his spare time he composed music, sang in operas, and wrote a novel.</p>

<p>He found that he enjoyed writing and was considering a professional career as a novelist when the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> broke out. In 1915 he enlisted in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Military_Engineers_edf0.html" title="Canadian Military Engineers">Canadian Military Engineers</a> and served as a Lieutenant in the Infantry with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. He was attached to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Engineers_bc48.html" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> for a time in 1918. Baxter received no decorations in the war, saying he was "neither sufficiently forward, nor far enough back".</p>

<p>After the end of the war, Baxter remained in Europe and settled in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. In 1920 he managed to get an interview with fellow Canadian <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Aitken%2C_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook_77d8.html" title="Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a>, who was one of the British "press Barons" seeking to build up the circulation of the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a> to match that of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Harmsworth_42dd.html" title="Alfred Harmsworth">Lord Northcliffe</a>'s <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a>. The interview led to an appointment as a leader-writer and occasional reporter. When something written by Baxter caught the approving eye of editor <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._D._Blumenfeld_6bf6.html" title="R. D. Blumenfeld">R. D. Blumenfeld</a>, Baxter was put in charge of page 4 of the paper which included the editorial, opinion pieces, and letters to the editor.</p>
<p>Baxter was made Managing Editor of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunday_Express_898e.html" title="Sunday Express">Sunday Express</a>, then still a new paper which had yet to find its place, in 1922. Under Baxter's guidance the paper became considerably livelier and its features were remarked upon. After two years, Baxter was moved to the same position on the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Express_36b6.html" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a>, in effect as deputy to Blumenfeld. Baxter, who was nicknamed "Bax" within the office, got on well with both Blumenfeld and Beaverbrook. In 1924 Baxter married Edith Letson, a girl from <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>.</p>

<p>In 1929 when offered a considerable increase in salary to work for the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Chronicle_e0d9.html" title="Daily Chronicle">Daily Chronicle</a> group (Inveresk publications), Baxter made the move; however, within months Blumenfeld retired and he was persuaded back to follow him as Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Express. Baxter increased circulation, which for the first time it exceeded 1,000,000 under his stewardship; in 1933 it topped 2,000,000.</p>
<p>That year Baxter left the newspaper industry to work as Public Relations counsel for the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaumont_Film_Company_14d7.html" title="Gaumont Film Company">Gaumont British Picture Corporation Ltd</a>. In 1935 his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a>, "Strange Street" was published; it illuminated the internal rivalries of <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Street_fda1.html" title="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</a> newspapers and was well-reviewed. He was recruited by Allied Newspapers to be an Editorial Adviser in 1938 but did not hold this post for long.</p>

<p>Baxter was interested in politics and was selected as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> candidate for <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_Green_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_4b78.html" title="Wood Green (UK Parliament constituency)">Wood Green</a> in suburban London in 1935.

<p>His maiden speech in December 1935 argued that the problems of depressed areas in Britain could be alleviated by encouraging emigration to the other countries of the British Empire, and he returned to this theme in several later speeches. He used his experience in the film industry when the issue of a Films Council to encourage more production in Britain was debated; Baxter called for a "dictator approved by the industry" to take charge.</p>
<p>During the debates about foreign policy in the late 1930s, Baxter was strongly associated with support for appeasement. In a debate in July 1938 he called for the United Kingdom to go to Germany helpfully, and not to block Germany wherever she tried to expand. He drew a parallel between Germans and Britons, saying that the two had the same human ambitions and sense of destiny. While a Member of Parliament Baxter often wrote features which were published in various newspapers (especially the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Sketch_6d6f.html" title="Daily Sketch">Daily Sketch</a>), and he became known as one of the most eloquent and persuasive supporters of the government.</p>
<p><a name="Second_world_war" id="Second_world_war"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverley_Baxter_8fd2.html" title="Edit section: Second world war">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second world war</span></h2>
<p>In the early days of the war, Baxter obtained a pledge from the government that there would be no repeat of an incident when the police went to newspaper offices to check on the contents of the next days' papers. He supported <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Chamberlain_8a10.html" title="Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway_debate.html" title="Norway debate">Norway debate</a> of May 1940, and the next morning protested vigorously about the attacks on Chamberlain's character, urging him not to regard the vote as one of censure but to show the courage of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lloyd_George_0b0a.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a>; Chamberlain however decided otherwise and resigned that day.</p>
<p>Despite his allegiance to Chamberlain, the incoming Churchill government appointed Baxter to an unofficial post with the Ministry of Aircraft Production where he was responsible for keeping up production of aero-engines. He became as strong a campaigner for the new Prime Minister as he had been for the old; when <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sydney_Wardlaw-Milne_d9ae.html" title="John Sydney Wardlaw-Milne">Sir John Wardlaw-Milne</a> put down a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Vote_of_no_confidence.html" title="Vote of no confidence">motion of no confidence</a> after the loss of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libya.html" title="Libya">Libya</a> in June 1942, Baxter put down an amendment assuring Churchill of "unqualified support in the introduction of any measures .. for the intensified prosecution of the war". In April 1941 Baxter was in the minority, but with the government, in opposing a motion to keep theatres and cinemas closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>However, Baxter's previous support for Chamberlain was not forgotten. In 1944, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Foot_cf4a.html" title="Michael Foot">Michael Foot</a>, then writing one of the many follow-ups to "<a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilty_Men_0764.html" title="Guilty Men">Guilty Men</a>", imagined a joint effort by a Chamberlain supporter and a Churchill supporter to write a counter. Foot characterised the two as Mr Tadpole and Mr Taper, the two petty politicians in <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli_2257.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>'s "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Coningsby_%28novel%29.html" title="Coningsby (novel)">Coningsby</a>", and while disingenuously insisting that they were fictitious, identified them by titling the book "<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendan_Bracken%2C_1st_Viscount_Bracken_35e2.html" title="Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken">Brendan</a> and Beverley".</p>

<p>Baxter survived the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">1945 general election</a> with a majority reduced to under 6,000. Despite having no official role he was mentioned as a potential future Conservative Party leader by Sir <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hartley_Shawcross_6f3d.html" title="Hartley Shawcross">Hartley Shawcross</a> in July 1946. Baxter was part of the large Conservative rebellion against the Anglo-American loan in December 1945, and in 1948 was one of eight Conservatives to oppose <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Aid_25eb.html" title="Marshall Aid">Marshall Aid</a>. However, he supported suspension of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_Kingdom_4a1f.html" title="Capital punishment in the United Kingdom">capital punishment</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Southgate" id="Southgate"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverley_Baxter_8fd2.html" title="Edit section: Southgate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Southgate</span></h2>
<p>At the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1950_5ee5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1950">1950 general election</a>, Baxter moved constituencies to fight instead at <a href="../../../e/n/f/Enfield_Southgate_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_6f93.html" title="Enfield Southgate (UK Parliament constituency)">Southgate</a>. He was never endangered at any election there. After Churchill returned to power in 1951, Baxter condemned the Foreign Office under the previous Labour government for having been "like a branch of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_State_cf5a.html" title="United States Department of State">State Department</a>".</p>
<p>Baxter was given a <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knighthood.html" title="Knighthood">Knighthood</a> in the Queen's Birthday Honours list of 1954. He continued to support the abolition of capital punishment and acted as a sponsor of Bills to that effect brought in by the Labour MP <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Silverman_e169.html" title="Sydney Silverman">Sydney Silverman</a>, and spent a great deal of the late 1950s campaigning for a reduction in theatre tax. In 1959 he signed a motion deploring the call by some Labour MPs for televising the proceedings of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>.</p>

<p>In 1961 Baxter broke the whip to support a Conservative backbench amendment to restore <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal_punishment.html" title="Corporal punishment">corporal punishment</a> for young offenders. He was very concerned at the Macmillan government's application to join the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Communities</a> lest it damage ties with the Commonwealth, and abstained rather than support the government when it was put to the vote in August 1961.</p>
<p>In poor health, Baxter announced that that Parliament was to be his last. He was criticised in January 1963 by the television programme "<a href="../../../t/h/a/That_Was_The_Week_That_Was_1d99.html" title="That Was The Week That Was">That Was The Week That Was</a>" for having made no speeches since the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1959_4ba6.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1959">1959 general election</a>. Baxter died before Parliament was dissolved, but no byelection to replace him was held due to the imminence of the general election.</p>
