Moncrief - Great article going on a notable high school, I'm glad to see someone tackling it. Don't forget the oil wells and cancer concern.

<p>Removed Trevor McFedries. No verifiable source, link, etc. If you want to include him, you might as well include everyone else who graduated 2005, and have dreams, aspirations to become famous. He's not the only one.</p>
<p>I've updated the Aerial Photograph of Beverly Hills High School, from Microsoft's Terraserver to Google Map. Terraserver was extremely slow. Google Map's version was more faster, better for viewers.</p>
<p>Did Alicia Silverstone really attend Beverly Hills High School?

<p>Sure okay. The only problem is that there are a lot of new clubs and activities that surface every semester. While most of the clubs stay, there are some who quit.

<p>It seems the "Pipe Dreams" episode of "Saved By The Bell" -- <a href="http://www.tv.com/saved-by-the-bell/pipe-dreams/episode/21750/summary.html" class="external free" title="http://www.tv.com/saved-by-the-bell/pipe-dreams/episode/21750/summary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/saved-by-the-bell/pipe-dreams/episode/21750/summary.html</a> -- was inspired by the Beverly's real-life oil well. This seems like the sort of pop-culture cross-reference that would appear in a Wikipedia article. [10 July 2006 -- Sorry I don't know how to properly sign a comment.]</p>
<p>There are two identical pictures of the Swim Gym in the article. Can't someone find another shot to put near the top? Also: doesn't the discussion of Beverly in the 1980s seem a bit lengthy in proportion to everything else on the page? - Dr. Maitland 22:32, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dr. Maitland here again, harping on the same issue as above. Would it be possible to replace one of those photos of the Swim Gym with one of the ubiquitous pictures of the older (i.e., original) campus buildings? - Dr. Maitland 22:32, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took out information about CIF playoffs, because I don't know what they are. I also think that we should only mention Varsity sports teams, because freshman football isn't that important. I also think we should limit the Varsity teams we put into the article to more popular sports like football, basketball, baseball, etc. Lacrosse isn't that popular of a sport.</p>
<p>Beverly Hills High School is not known for athletics. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a></p>

<dd>CIF is, I believe, the California Intramural Federation. The material is encyclopedic, and I'm sure it's important to those who engage in the athletics. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:43, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find it very important to know what sports are offered at beverly. CIF if pretty big at beverly because as far as i know, nearly half of the sports offered qualify for CIF. Also, ALL the sports mentioned are varsity sports, There is not one team offered at beverly that is jv or frosh/soph without a varsity team. I believe the cif section shoudl be restored. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberslice22_5d69.html" title="User:Cyberslice22">Cyberslice22</a>
<dl>
<dd>All the sports offered at Beverly are already listed. When it comes to mentioning how well a particular Beverly sports team did in CIF, if the 2006 Varsity football team won a CIF competition, then it would be worth mentioning. The 2006 freshman football team is not worth mentioning. It may be important to those kids on the freshman football team, but it does not belong in an encyclopedia. We are not talking about college or professional sports. Beverly is just a high school. The freshman teams just aren't that important.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a></dd>

<dd>Beverly Underground is a site written by teenagers still in high school. Everything is written by students but as far as i know, it is funded anonmously. I dont see why adding a link would hurt.

<p>I am an alumni of Beverly Hills High School and from what I understand, Beverly Hills Underground is an independent newspaper that talks about the negative aspects of the school's faculty, programs, students, sports, etc. I have read a couple of articles and I find to be full of crap. A lot of these articles are simply not true, at least when I was there from 1999-2003. User name: Brian</p>

<p>I removed the information about the vending machines, and many of the details about the marching band. Why? Well we can't talk about every single vending machine in every high school in the United States. The only thing interesting about the marching band (that was in the article) is that it plays at Disneyland. But ALL high school marching bands play at high school football games! We don't need to put that in an encyclopedia!</p>
<p>I also would object to any information about high school clubs and any list of classes at Beverly, AP or not. Beverly is not the only school with AP classes!</p>
<p>We have to realize that an encyclopedia article should be written for people who are not connected to Beverly in anyway, because these people are the vast majority of the people using wikipedia! These people don't care about the vending machines, what specific classes Beverly offers, what clubs it has, or the fact that the marching band plays at football games, or the all the detail's about Joel Pressman's singing classes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with this statment. The point of an encyclopedia is to provide as much information as possible. Listing the ap classes and clubs shows the diversity of Beverly and the type of school that it is. not all schools offer the amount of ap programs and clubs that beverly does. also, some parents want to learn more about a high school before sending them to it. mentioning the different programs can provide a parent with more information on making an educated decision.<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberslice22_5d69.html" title="User:Cyberslice22">Cyberslice22</a></dd>

<dd>An encyclopedia is not supposed to have as much as possible! It is supposed to be limited to information worthy of being in an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia article about the planet Earth, for example, does not put everything that could possibly be said about the earth into the article. The same is true for an article about Napoleon, or anything else. An encyclopedia article gives a general overview of the subject. It does not tell you every bit of information known about the subject. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a></dd>

<dd>Using the logic that "an encyclopedia article should have as much information as possible," if we are going to list all the AP classes at Beverly, we should also list ALL of Beverly's classes, to include more information, and because if we didn't include non-AP classes, we would be discriminating against students and parents who are not taking AP classes. In fact, all articles about any University or High School in Wikipedia should have the entire school's course catalog in its wikipedia article, using that logic. This is flawed logic.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a></dd>

It wasn't my idea to put Beverly Underground in the article, but I do not object to it unless it really is true that it has a lot of factual errors, but not just because Beverly claims it has factual errors! We would need a source that is more NPOV than Beverly! It would be crazy to say that we cannot use a source of information about Beverly simply because Beverly does not approve of it!<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a></p>

<p>The media (as I pointed out in the article) portrays Beverly as being absurly affluent. This is what the average person on Wikipedia (who is not connected to Beverly in any way) most likely thinks Beverly is like. This is why it is important to say in the article that the media's image of Beverly is quite absurd. But it is also important to note that while the media image is over the top, it is VERY true that a lot of people who go to Beverly have affluent parents, many of whom are well connected in the entertainment industry. The reason is obvious: there is a relatively high concentration of weathy people and people connected to the entertainment industry in Beverly Hills compared to most cities, and most of them send their children to the public schools in Beverly Hills. So there is some truth to the way the media portrays Beverly.</p>
<p>Beverly officials have been trying to pretend that Beverly is not an affluent school for years, but that is like trying to pretend that the Pope is not Catholic! In spite decades of the efforts by Beverly officials, the mainstream media will not let go of its absurd portrait of the high school and the city. But the portrait that Beverly officials try to paint is just as misleading! (It might be the truth, but it is not the whole truth! A lot of times it isn't the truth!) In order to be NPOV, we need to take a middle ground between these extremes.</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry at your description of a Joel Stein humor piece as "non-fictional." So you're insisting that "it became clear that career day for Beverly Hills High School students is the lamest charity invented since the Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones wedding registry" is a non-fictional statement?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Everything published in the LA Times is non-fiction. It is a newspaper. Opinions and editorials are non-fiction.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a> 14:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not a matter of being "fictional" or "non-fictional." He's writing a HUMOROUS, SATIRICAL piece and including hyperbolic statements designed to amuse.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The statement was not a hyperbole. The statement was an analogy. Stein thinks that both Career Day and the Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones wedding registry are equally unworthy charities. If Career Day were abolished, Stein does not think it would hurt Beverly students anymore than it would hurt Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones if no one bought them anything for their wedding.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a> 14:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Los Angeles Times's fact-checking process does not apply to humor columns in which no one is meant to take sentences such as the one above literally. (And, in fact, any signed editorial is implicitly the opinion of the person writing it and so isn't subjected to rigorous "fact checking" -- let alone a satirical piece. Oh, heavens.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Signed editorials are still subjected to fact checking because even opinion articles contain factual claims. When Stein claimed he went to Beverly asked him to speak for Career Day, he was stating a fact, not an opinion. Even though Stein signed the editorial, the newspaper published it and a publisher has a responsibility to check the facts of what it publishes. The newspaper could be sued for libel if something was said that was untrue EVEN in a signed opinion column! For example, if Stein lied and claimed that he saw the principle molesting children, Stein's column would be slanderous, and both Stein and the newspaper publishing the column could be sued. Likewise, a book publisher could be sued for publishing an opinion book that makes slanderous statements, even if the author signs the book.

<p>There isn't any reason to include three quotes from one satirical editorial in a factual description of a high school.

<dd>First, we aren't including three quotes. Second, it is okay to quote the opinion of somebody in a factual article, as long as it is made clear that it is the person's opinion. When you quote someone, you are making the factual claim that the person really did say (or write) what you are claiming he said or wrote. News articles on the front page of a newspaper which are not editorials virtually ALWAYS contain quotes that are not facts but that are somebody's opinion. It is good journalism to do so! <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a> 15:50, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moncrief (and anyone else who is interested) should read the wiki article on <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">Libel</a>.</p>
<p>This articles makes it clear that even an opinion could be considered libelous. A newspaper would have to make sure all of Stein's opinions are "fair comments." That means that his opinions must be opinions that a reasonable person could have, even if they are biased against someone or something.</p>
<p>So if Stein said "In my opinion, the princple is molesting children in his office" without any other facts to back it up, this would be slander because a reasonable person would not think the princple is molesting children unless A LOT of evidence was provided to him. If Stein had made such a claim, and the paper failed to remove it, both Stein and the paper could be sued for libel.</p>
<p>It is ABSOLUETLY a "fair comment" when Stein claims that Career Day is the lamest chairity since the Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones wedding registry because of his opinion that the students demonstated that they were already well versed in journalism, on air presence, etc. based upon the questions they asked him. along with Steins FACTUAL claim that he at one point gave advice to a student about wheter to go work at "daddy's production company" as a producer or as an executive.</p>
<p>The reason it is a "fair comment" is because the average reasonable person would not find it hard to believe that students at Beverly Hills High School already know a lot about media and that many of them have parents who own production companies and that many of the students are very affluent. Most reasonable people who aren't connected to Beverly believe the image of absurd affluence. Stein's column did not misrepresent the school, he didn't say that robots were serving coffee to students, and his opinion of Beverly is a very reasonable opinion to have.</p>
<p>A good NPOV article presents multiple reasonable perspectives of something. I don't think it is possible to truely be objective, but by presenting multiple reasonable persepectives, we can come closer to objectivity. Stein's perspective of Beverly is not unique -- a lot of people have written articles over the years with the similar perspectives. Some are more melodramic, like an article about rampant cocaine abuse and 3 sucides at Beverly published in the mid 80s. I can probably find that article, but Slien's article is less melodramtic and is far more recent. Therefore I think quoting Stein's reasonable opinions about Beverly help make this article balanced and NPOV. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a> 16:47, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>There is no doubt that many Beverly students are wealthy. In his May 30, 2006 column, nationally syndicated writer Joel Stein described Beverly's student body as "some of the richest children in the nation." Stein wrote that while he was speaking to Beverly's students "it became clear that career day for Beverly Hills High School students is the lamest charity invented since the Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones wedding registry." [3]</i></p>
<p>Joel Stein, yeah right. Attending Career day for a couple hours at Beverly Hills High School does not qualify him as an expert of BHHS' students' economic state. Take this out. It's his opinion, and violates the NPOV principle.</p>
<p>You simply have no right to determine what is good journalism or not. ANY ARTICLE on WIKIPEDIA adheres to the zen of fact support. Joel Stein isn't support by facts, it is his opinion.

Similarly, if he said in a column that he likes <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-N-Out_a81d.html" title="In-N-Out">In-N-Out</a> burgers we wouldn't include that opinion in our article about the chain.

What would qualify someone as an expert on Beverly's student body? The Stein quote does prove that there are people who's parents are connected to the entertainment industry. If you looked at the articles on many of the notable alumni, you'd see that many of them are children of celebrities. But Stein's article is recent. Nobody has written a book on Beverly Hills High School's student body as far as I know, and there aren't that many "experts." I am not sure if there are any experts on Beverly's student body!

<dd>Will, would you say that Beverly Hills High School is a rather unique high school? I would! In fact, somebody actually did write a book about Beverly students in the 1980s, but of course that is outdated now! How many other high school have had so many movies, TV Show, and even cartoons based on it (or it's fiction twin, West Beverly?) The burden of proof is on YOU to find a US high school with a higher media profile! Can you think of ANY high school in the United Stated. public or private, that has been featured in as many TV shows, movies, etc. as Beverly Hills high school? Also I disagree that Joel Stein in an unsuitable source! It really doesn't take a lot to realize that a lot of people at Beverly are wealthy.

That fact isn't in dispute; what's in dispute is your using a humor column written from someone who visited the campus for a few hours as evidence of your assertion. You don't include quotes willy-nilly in an article without reason to do so. It's not necessary to include Stein's comments; the fact that entertainment industry kids attend Beverly stands on its own without this quote. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 21:59, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The truth is, I'm trying to be fair to Beverly. I was the one who pointed out that the media portrays the student body as absurdly affluent, but there is some truth to the steoreotype! And most of the people who read about Beverly Hillls high school are intrested in the entertainment connections and the wealth of the school! That's a reality! I'm not trying to make Beverly look bad! I'm trying to be balanced! Also, I don't think the fact that "entertainment industry kids attend Beverly stands on its own" without mentioning it in the article! That's like saying we shouldn't say that Hitler was a nazi, because that should be obvious to anybody who read the article on Hitler! <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a> 08:22, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stupid people love to make dramatic Hitler analogies. Listen Karmak, nobody is disputing that various students of Beverly Hills High School come from rich, entertainment industry parents. What we are disputing is the nature in which you have been trying to present that information. Like (to use your lame Hitler anology) if someone wanted to start Hitler's wiki-page by stating straight off, "Adolf Hitler was a filthy, murderous Nazi pig and a poor artist," it wouldn't necessarily be INCORRECT, but, it would be irresponsible. Our duty is to responsibly and correctly present opinions as opinions and facts as facts. What you did (as indirectly as possible) was present quotes from an outside opinion article as evidence to support YOUR OWN opinion. By writing, <b>"[Joel Stein] <i>observed that</i> 'from their questions, it was obvious that these kids already knew about the intricacies of journalism, television writing, publicity and on-air work. I was basically giving guidance about whether to work for daddy's production company as a producer or as a development executive.'"</b>, you have subtly manipulated language to serve your own opinion of the validity of what HE wrote of the school's student body. You even (subtly) left out a coma before inserting the quote. Anyway, that's why I altered your submission using more responsible language: <b>"Stein was asked to speak at Beverly Hills High School's 2006 "Career Day", <i>and noted in his article,</i> 'from their questions, it was obvious that these kids...'"</b>, etc...... Stop trying to be clever, Karmak. It doesn't suit you.... And BY THE WAY... For your information: Most of the rich kids at Beverly aren't industry babies. For the most part, industryites send their kids off to private schools like Crossroads or Harvard Westlake. Beverly kids (the ones that live in North Beverly Hills and come from a lot of money, as opposed to the basically middle class kids who live in South Beverly Hills and share a similar zip code) are usually children of doctors, lawyers, rich business owners, etc. Every once in a while your meet a kid of a famous actor/producer/director/singer, but it's usually not like that. Get your facts/issues straight man. Boldy1 01:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's see... I graduated from Beverly in the mid 1990s, and when I graduated I was a part of an elite 10%: People who stayed in the Beverly Hills School System from K-12! There are quite a few Persian students. And it is true than most of us do not come from the entertainment industry, it is amazing how many do in comparison to every other city in the world! In the mid 1990s most persians would drive BMWs to school, so nobody else drove BMWs because they didn't want people to think that they were Persian. The vast majority of the students were Jewish. We were very apathetic toward our sports team, and just about any other school sponsored social event, with the sole exception of the senior prom: Prom was a very big deal. I don't think too much has changed.</dd>

<dd>When somebody asks where you're from, what do you tell them? I proudly tell people that I'm from Beverly Hills! So why are so many people from Beverly Hills embarrassed to say so? Is it because people have a tendancy to assume that you're super rich, and sometimes act jealous of you? Maybe it is because some people want you to tell them about all the celebrities you know, when you really don't know that many. I do experience all of these things from people, (I admit it may be really lame when some German tourist is trying to get you to tell him about all the celebrities you know), but when you aren't afraid to say that you are from Beverly Hills, you gain respect! <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a> 23:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That's Leahy's point!">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beverly was not a "Den of Hedonism!" in the 80s. That's Leahy's point!</span></h2>
<p><i>What Leahy found was that in spite of the media's portrait, Beverly was not a den of hedonism. Leahy observed that "Social attitudes and mores appear to be nearly identical to those found in the middle-class high schools of the Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley -- the evidence of drug and alcohol use no more or less high, the discussion of sex and birth control equally as obsessive." Leahy wrote "It did not take long during my conversations with Beverly students before I understood that their world was nothing like the one I had imagined from casually observing teenage behavior in malls and at rock concerts. After that initial shock, the task became to listen to students long and carefully enough until I adequately understood the panorama of life at Beverly."</i></p>
<p>Users and viewers of wikipedia would appreciate if you, Karmak, would discontinue using information and text in violation of the <b>N</b>eutral <b>P</b>oint <b>Of'</b> <b>View</b> policy that has been firmly rooted in the Wikipedia establishment.</p>
<p>Much like your hap-hazardly placed Joel Stein reference, this quote from <b>Leahy</b> warrants scrutiny, as it his <i>opinion</i>, a concept, it seems, that you have not grasped. If you read the discussion section, other users have agreed that a poignant analysis of the student affluence by the individual Joel Stein is unecessary in the article, as it is the closed unfactual observation of Mr. Stein alone. Not only does Leahy's pessimism portray Beverly in the same light Stein had, this, was written two decades ago. I know you would agree that in two decades, our cultural landscape has shifted dramatically. Conclusively, Leahy's book is inaccurate to serve as a placeholder for an entirely new section.</p>
<p>Your authority from graduating and attending Beverly Hills High school is very important, and valuable to this article. However, should other graduates and or current students be afforded the privilege of incorporating their personal experiences and or retrospective viewpoints, which changes from person to person, this article, and Wikipedia all over, wouldn't be as engaging for anyone, be they are a prospective student or not, to make a personal recollection of their own. A vanilla flavored article, for a lack of a better term, Mr. Karmak, suffices those who are knowledge famished or simply curious as to why Beverly Hills High School should be explored and understood further. Exploring Beverly Hills High School's nooks and cranies, its idosyncracies, and the nit picks which makes any High School experience complete, is up to him or her to personally dive in to, without Wikipedia's guiding hand.</p>

<dd>What you don't seem to understand is that I just pointed my personal viewpoints here on the talk page. Not in the article! It is approiate to talk about the history of Beverly in this article, because the history of the school is sub-topic of the school itself. I wouldn't mind more historical information. This section now very clearly points out that this study was done in the 1980s. But he we do have somebody who qualifies as an "expert" on Beverly Hills High School students in the 1980s. He spent nealy a year or more doing the research, and as somebody who has published a book on this subject, he is somebody is indeed "notable" on the topic of Beverly Hills High School's students in the 1980s. Therefore it is okay to put quotations from him. And frankly, the quotations are quite NPOV. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmak_127f.html" title="User:Karmak">Karmak</a></dd>
