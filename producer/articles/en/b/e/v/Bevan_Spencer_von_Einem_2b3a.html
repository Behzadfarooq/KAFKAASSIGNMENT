<p>The name Bevan Spencer von Einem first came to attention on the night of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">May 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. That night, two <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> men were thrown into the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Torrens_6663.html" title="River Torrens">River Torrens</a> by a group of men. The river banks (or "Number 1 <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_beat.html" title="Gay beat">beat</a>" as it was known) were a place for homosexuals to meet in secret, as homosexuality was still illegal in South Australia at that time. Tragically, one of the men, Dr. George Duncan <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drowned.html" title="Drowned">drowned</a>, however the other man, Roger James suffered a broken <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg.html" title="Leg">leg</a> and was rescued out of the river by von Einem, who happened to be driving by at the time. Von Einem then took James to <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Adelaide_Hospital_27cc.html" title="Royal Adelaide Hospital">Royal Adelaide Hospital</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, rumours were rife that the group of men that threw the two men in the river were <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_unit.html" title="Vice unit">Vice Squad</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">Police</a> and on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">July 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> former Vice Squad officer Mick O'Shea revealed in the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Advertiser_%28Australia%29_18b9.html" title="The Advertiser (Australia)">The Advertiser</a></i> newspaper that the group involved were Vice Squad officers and that there was a cover-up to protect them.

</div>
<p><b>Richard Kelvin</b> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> – c.<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>), was the son of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> television personality <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Kelvin_f121.html" title="Rob Kelvin">Rob Kelvin</a>. He was murdered by Bevan Spencer von Einem in Adelaide, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australia_b9ad.html" title="South Australia">South Australia</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> after having been kidnapped and tortured for five weeks.</p>
<p>At around 6pm on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, von Einem (along with other unknown persons<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>) abducted Kelvin in a <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Adelaide_e628.html" title="North Adelaide">North Adelaide</a> street, just 60 metres from Kelvin's home. Kelvin had just seen off a friend at a nearby bus stop on the corner of O'Connell and Marian Streets, North Adelaide and was returning home for dinner. Several witnesses living near to the Kelvin's home heard cries for help, car doors slamming and a car with a noisy exhaust speeding away. Significantly, Kelvin had a <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_collar.html" title="Dog collar">dog collar</a> in his possession which was likely to have attracted von Einem's attention. Von Einem then tortured, drugged, raped and held Kelvin captive for five weeks, before murdering him and dumping his body on an airstrip near One Tree Hill in the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Hills_650a.html" title="Adelaide Hills">Adelaide Hills</a> area (to the north-east of the city and close to where relatives of von Einem's lived). Kelvin's clothed body was found by a geologist on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>.</p>
<p>The autopsy revealed that Kelvin had most certainly died from massive blood loss from an anal injury, likely caused by the insertion of a blunt object, such as a beer bottle, and he suffered <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruising.html" title="Bruising">bruising</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injuries.html" title="Injuries">injuries</a> on his head and back, which were likely to have been caused by blows. Also traces of four hypnotic drugs were found in Kelvin, including <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandrax.html" title="Mandrax">Mandrax</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/c/Noctec.html" title="Noctec">Noctec</a>. With the drugs as their only firm lead at that stage, police began sifting through prescriptions for those drugs. During their search they found a prescription for Mandrax issued to a B. von Einem, a name familiar to police as he was questioned previously over the deaths of three young men and an alleged sexual assault of another.</p>
<p>Four days after the body was discovered, von Einem was questioned about the murder of Richard Kelvin by police. He initially claimed that he had no knowledge of what happened to Kelvin and said that on the night of abduction he was in bed with the <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flu.html" title="Flu">flu</a>. Police also searched his home in the northern Adelaide suburb of Paradise, where police seized a bottle of Mandrax. Von Einem admitted that the drugs were his and said that he used them to help him sleep. He denied having any other drugs, but police also seized a bottle of Noctec, concealed on a ledge behind his wardrobe. Von Einem also allowed police to take <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair.html" title="Hair">hair</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood.html" title="Blood">blood</a> samples, as well as carpets and other materials for testing.</p>

</div>
<p>As von Einem went on holiday in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> during August and September of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, the case against him began to mount up. Forensic investigators were able to match the many fibres found on Kelvin's clothing to those taken from von Einem's home, along with hairs found which matched those belonging to von Einem. Forensics also determined that Kelvin was murdered between <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> and was dumped at the airstrip no later than the 10th. However, police raids on various locations around Adelaide linked to von Einem yielded few clues. Police also searched for a man who previously claimed to police during the investigation of the murder of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Barnes_e40a.html" title="Alan Barnes">Alan Barnes</a> that von Einem was involved in his death and also that he was a former associate of von Einem. Barnes' fatal injuries mirrored those of Kelvin's closely. The man, known as "Mr. B", was located and informed police in great detail how he and von Einem picked up young male hitchhikers, gave them alcoholic drinks laced with hypnotic drugs, and took them to von Einem's previous home in the Adelaide suburb of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campbelltown.html" title="Campbelltown">Campbelltown</a>, where the young men were abused overnight and sent home the next day. "B" also provided further information about other associates of von Einem, but claimed he took no part whatsoever in any murders. Police also questioned women and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexuals.html" title="Transsexuals">transsexuals</a> who von Einem associated with, however they volunteered little information. With enough evidence, along with the information given by "B", to indicate that Richard Kelvin was at von Einem's home around the time of his death, police arrested and charged von Einem with murder on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Von Einem still denied ever coming into contact with Kelvin.</p>
<p>The committal hearing to determine if there was sufficient evidence for von Einem to stand trial for murder began on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. Faced with evidence from prosecutors suggesting that Kelvin was in his company, von Einem changed his alibi to answer that evidence and claimed that he was in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Von Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, von Einem said that he nearly ran over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Von Einem stated he thought Kelvin had <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexual.html" title="Bisexual">bisexual</a> tendencies and said that the two of them then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to von Einem's home. Kelvin stayed for two hours before von Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near a hospital, and gave Kelvin $20 to catch a taxi home. Von Einem said that was the last time he saw Kelvin. However, there was enough evidence to suggest otherwise, and on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, Magistrate Nick Manos ordered von Einem to stand trial for the murder of Richard Kelvin.</p>

</div>
<p>The trial against Bevan Spencer von Einem for the murder of Richard Kelvin opened at the Supreme Court Building of South Australia on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> before Mr. Justice White. A jury of 12 people (seven women and five men) were selected and were agreed upon by the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosecution.html" title="Prosecution">prosecution</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_%28legal%29.html" title="Defense (legal)">defense</a>. Von Einem pleaded <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_guilty.html" title="Not guilty">not guilty</a>, and his defense was led by barrister Barry Jennings, and was assisted by Helena Jasinski, who was von Einem's solicitor from the start of the police investigation of him in the murder during the previous year. The prosecution was led by Brian Martin QC (who is currently the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Justice_fa52.html" title="Chief Justice">Chief Justice</a> of the Supreme Court of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a>), with assistance from Paul Rofe (now the recently retired Director of the Department of Public Prosecutions). For the prosecution, it was a matter of proving von Einem's guilt (along with unknown persons) by presenting the strong scientific evidence that was gathered during the investigation, and disproving von Einem's story of being in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. For the defense, it was a case of trying make von Einem's story hold up in court, and raising doubts about von Einem's ability to keep Richard Kelvin captive for five weeks and committing the murder.</p>
<p>The prosecution opened their case with the jury being taken to the various sites around Adelaide that were important in the trial, and over the first week they called various witnesses to the stand. Kelvin's parents, girlfriend and best friend were called to testify that Kelvin was an average 15 year old who would not willingly get into a car with a stranger, was <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a> with no <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexual.html" title="Bisexual">bisexual</a> tendencies and that he was wearing the dog collar as a prank. People living close to the Kelvin's then testified that they heard noises and commotion corresponding to the abduction taking place on the night of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a> at around 6pm. <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensic.html" title="Forensic">Forensic</a> <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathology.html" title="Pathology">pathologists</a> were called to testify about the injuries to the head and anus on Kelvin's body and the likely cause of his death, and <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmacists.html" title="Pharmacists">pharmacists</a> gave evidence of the excessive amount of different hypnotic drugs von Einem had been prescribed (5172 tablets and capsules of six different brands of drugs between <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_15.html" title="December 15">December 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>), and showed that von Einem often had prescriptions for drugs issued from different chemists on the same day or during the same weeks. And various police who worked on the case testified to their investigation of von Einem since they first questioned him about the murder, as well as their visit to von Einem's home where a police officer claimed that von Einem's bedroom appeared to have been unusually cleaned quite "extensively".</p>
<p>Forensic scientists were called next to testify firstly when Kelvin died and when his body was dumped in the Adelaide Hills area, and a leading <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entomologist.html" title="Entomologist">entomologist</a> claimed, from the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larvae.html" title="Larvae">larvae</a> cycle of <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flies.html" title="Flies">flies</a> that were on the body, and comparing these to the larvae cycle of flies on a dead <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog</a> that was nearby, that Kelvin's body must have been dumped on the airstrip near One Tree Hill on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Other forensic scientists were called to testify about the hair and fibre samples collected that were linked to von Einem himself and his home. Hairs from von Einem were found on and inside Kelvin's clothing and of 925 fibre samples found on Kelvin's clothing, 250 came from von Einem's home environment, with just seven from Kelvin's home. The scientists stated that if von Einem's story was true, then there should be a very small amount or even none of the fibres and hair samples from that night still on Kelvin's clothing some 36 hours later, let alone five weeks later. Faced with such damning scientific evidence, the defense tried to counter this during cross-examination by floating a possible theory that after von Einem's last contact with Kelvin, he was abducted by other people, who stored his clothing for five weeks before murdering him and re-dressing him. While the forensic scientists conceded that this was a possible scenario, under recross-examination by the prosecution, they conceded that it would be still unlikely given the whole science of how fibres and hair are transferred from surface to surface over time. The prosecution then rested their case.</p>
<p>The defense opted for von Einem to give an unsworn statement from the dock, rather than given sworn evidence from the witness box. In his unsworn statement, von Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened in his life between <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_11.html" title="July 11">July 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. He again claimed on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a> he picked up Kelvin in North Adelaide, drove him to his home, and then dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu for the next week after that and did not return to work until <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>. Von Einem said he was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did remember what he did on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a>, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that he was at a relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a friend on the way home, went straight to bed and went to work the next day. Von Einem also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which he sold on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. Von Einem closed his unsworn statement by again claiming his innocence.</p>
<p>The defense then called various witnesses in an attempt to corroborate von Einem's story. The witnesses included colleagues and friends of his to testify of him being unwell and at home during the first week of Richard Kelvin's captivity. Also testifying for the defense was the geologist, who while walking his dogs through the airstrip discovered Kelvin' body on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, recalling that he was walking in the same area on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a> during the early afternoon and the body wasn't there at that stage. Others called to give testimony for the defense were the woman who purchased von Einem's Ford Falcon who detailed the condition of the car, and the relative who hosted the birthday party on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a> who said that von Einem and his mother arrived there at 5:30pm and left at 10:30pm. Photographs of the party that included von Einem were also tendered to the court. Finally, the defense called von Einem's mother to testify about her son's activities over the weekend when Richard Kelvin was kidnapped. Under cross-examination, the prosecution were able to show inconsistencies in her current testimony compared to her earlier statements to police about von Einem's whereabouts on the weekend of June 4-5, which weakened von Einem's case considerably as this highlighted von Einem's change the previous February of his account of what happened on the night of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>.</p>
<p>In their summation, the prosecution stated that the evidence they presented proved that von Einem's story was full of lies and inconsistencies, and that he did murder (with the help of others) Richard Kelvin. They also stated that his admittance of picking up Kelvin showed that he was in contact with him on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a>, the fibres and hairs proved that von Einem was with him at the time of just before and/or at the time of death, and the drugs proved von Einem was with Kelvin in between those times. The prosecution also answered the doubts raised by the defense about when on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a> the body was dumped at the airstrip, by suggesting that von Einem could have dumped the body sometime very late on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_10.html" title="July 10">July 10</a> or in the early morning of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_11.html" title="July 11">July 11</a> before von Einem went to work for the day.</p>
<p>The defense stated in their summary that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that von Einem was guilty of murder and also weren't able to establish the exact cause of Kelvin's death, so therefore the jury must give von Einem the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice White then gave his summation of the trial, and in the early afternoon of <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">November 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the jury retired to consider their verdict.</p>

<p>After 7½ hours of deliberation, the jury returned to give their verdict. Bevan Spencer von Einem was found guilty of the murder of Richard Kelvin and was automatically sentenced to life at Yatala Labour Prison with Mr. Justice White imposing a non-parole period of 24 years. Under South Australian law, a third of the non-parole period could be taken off for good behaviour in prison. Based on this reckoning, von Einem could conceivably have been eligible for parole in late <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General of South Australia immediately appealed the leniency of the non-parole period, and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_29.html" title="March 29">March 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia increased the non-parole period to 36 years, a record at the time in that state. The earliest von Einem could be released on parole was therefore on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">October 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008.html" title="2008">2008</a>.</p>
<p>Von Einem's defense team (now consisting of barrister David Peek with assistance from Helena Jasinski) appealed the conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia and requested that a new trial be set. The basis for this appeal was the evidence given about Kelvin's heterosexuality, the references to von Einem's own heterosexuality through the trial and the negative impact that might have had on the jury, and also how Mr. Justice White in his summation did not include the testimony given by von Einem's relative about his attendance at the birthday party on the day Kelvin's body was dumped. The Court of Criminal of Appeal rejected the appeal, saying that the trial was conducted fairly and just throughout, however they did concede that Mr. Justice White should have included the evidence relating to the birthday party.</p>

<p>Bevan Spencer von Einem was the leading suspect in the unsolved murders of four other young men between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, and police continued to pursue leads on those cases in the years after his murder conviction. The four murdered were Alan Barnes in June <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, Neil Muir in August <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, Peter Stogneff in August <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> and Mark Langley in February <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>. In February <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, the State <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">Coroner</a> at the time in South Australia, Kevin Ahern, ordered an inquest into the deaths of these four young men, and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, the State Coroner in his findings stated that manner and circumstances in which the four were murdered was very similar to that in the case of Richard Kelvin, particularly the murders of Barnes and Langley. The reward for any information leading to an arrest for the murders was increased to $250,000, and this was later increased to $500,000 in September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.</p>
<p>Following the inquest, police pushed on with their investigations and attempted to locate von Einem's former associates to question them about the murders. And during <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> media interest in the four unsolved murders increased, with extensive news coverage in Adelaide about who was involved in the murders. The media dubbed those involved "The Family", an alleged group of homosexual child sexual abusers possibly involving high-profile Adelaide establishment figures (<a href="../../../p/h/y/Physician.html" title="Physician">doctors</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyers</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">judges</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politicians</a>), a theory that still persists to this day, although police who have worked on the cases believe that the group doesn't involve any high-profile people in Adelaide. However, fuel was added to the rumours of a conspiracy, when on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, von Einem gave his one and only interview from prison, given to <i>The Advertiser</i> journalist Dick Wordley. In the interview, von Einem again pleaded his innocence in the murder of Richard Kelvin and of the four other young men, and regretted taking his lawyer's advice to keep silent during the early stages of the Kelvin investigation. He also hinted that he could name people that could help police with their investigation, but feared for his life if he did and also claimed that his life was already threatened once by two police officers who ordered him not to give evidence in the inquest into the death of Dr. George Duncan in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after von Einem's interview, police interviewed "Mr. B" again who was now living in <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. "B" gave a statement about the Alan Barnes murder that convinced prosecutors to grant him <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immunity.html" title="Immunity">immunity</a> if von Einem was brought to trial. Police, now with "B"'s statement and the similar fact evidence from the Richard Kelvin case, then arrested von Einem at Yatala Labour Prison on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> for the murder of Alan Barnes. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">November 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, von Einem was also arrested for the murder of Mark Langley. Police were never able to obtain enough evidence for charges in the murders of Neil Muir and Peter Stogneff, though in the case of Muir an Adelaide doctor was tried for his murder in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> but was found not guilty.</p>
<p>The committal hearing to determine if von Einem should stand trial for the murders of Barnes and Langley began on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_5.html" title="March 5">March 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> before <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magistrate.html" title="Magistrate">magistrate</a> David Gurry. Von Einem plead not guilty to both murders, and his defense counsel (now consisting of barrister Mark Griffin with assistance from Marie Shaw) immediately claimed that it would be an abuse of justice for their client if he was ordered to stand trial given the mass coverage of the murders in the media in the past year. The prosecution was led again by Brian Martin QC, who was assisted this time by Tom Birchall, and their case against von Einem relied on evidence of the Richard Kelvin murder, with the details of the crime being so strikingly similar to the murders of Barnes and Langley. The prosecution's case also relied on evidence given by former associates testifying to von Einem picking up boys <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitchhiking.html" title="Hitchhiking">hitchhiking</a> and sexually abusing them, as well as "B"'s sensational evidence being in the company of Barnes and von Einem at the time just before Barnes' murder. "B" also gave startling allegations of von Einem being involved in the unexplained <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaumont_children_disappearance.html" title="Beaumont children disappearance">Beaumont children disappearance</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, as well as the disappearance of two girls at the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Oval_4c84.html" title="Adelaide Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. However, these allegations were unable to be proven. Another witness also came forward to claim he'd seen von Einem and Barnes together drinking in the weeks before Barnes' death. Also entered as evidence was samples taken from Barnes' body which showed that sedative drugs were present. Little evidence was presented for the murder of Mark Langley, as prosecutors felt if they could prove that von Einem murdered Barnes, then it would naturally follow that he murdered Langley as well.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_11.html" title="May 11">May 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Magistrate Gurry ordered von Einem to stand trial for the two murders of Alan Barnes and Mark Langley. Von Einem's defense counsel appealed the decision, launching an abuse of process action in the Supreme Court of South Australia to achieve a permanent stay of proceedings, as well as stating that the huge media interest in the charges would result in their client not getting a fair trial. Proceedings began on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_19.html" title="June 19">June 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> before Justice Kevin Duggan, and six months later on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Justice Duggan released his findings. He ordered von Einem to stand trial, however he expressed concerns with most of the prosecution's evidence.</p>
<p>The pre-trial hearing began on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">December 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> in the Supreme Court of South Australia, with Justice Duggan as the presiding judge. The prosecution decided after Justice Duggan's findings two days earlier to have von Einem tried separately for the murders of Alan Barnes and Mark Langley. Justice Duggan ruled that the evidence relating to the Richard Kelvin murder and from the various associates of von Einem and hitchhikers was inadmissible, although he did rule that "B"'s evidence could be heard, but with the defense allowed to question the evidence as it was being given. This was a shattering blow for the prosecution's case, and on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, on advice from the Attorney-General of South Australia, prosecutors withdrew the charge for the murder of Mark Langley. The prosecution tried to continue with the charge for the murder of Alan Barnes, however with the problems of getting enough evidence admitted into court from associates about von Einem picking up hitchhikers to convict von Einem still too great, the final charge was withdrawn on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. The prosecution, on the advice of the Attorney-General, then entered a <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nolle_prosequi.html" title="Nolle prosequi">nolle prosequi</a> for the Alan Barnes murder charge.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_29.html" title="January 29">January 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the Sunday Mail reported that von Einem is currently being investigated for allegedly raping an inmate several times at Yatala Labour Prison.</p>
