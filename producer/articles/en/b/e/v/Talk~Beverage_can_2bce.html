<dd>In North America, we usually call steel food cans "tin cans," even though there's no tin in them (I think in other parts of the world they may just be called "tins"... not sure if the "tin" on "tin can" stuck because "tin" is a generic term for food containers, or because they really used to be made of <a href="../../../s/n/_/Sn.html" title="Sn">Sn</a>). So the name/phrase/pronounciation "aluminum can" may be just as legitimate as "tin can," even if it isn't absolutely right. I think it is Wikipedia's policy to use <i>aluminium</i> when referring to the element (a legitimate case for consistency), but we're not really worried about elemental aluminium here, we're talking about a secondary product. What if they were popularly called "Aluminy Cans"? Would we still make the fuss? Plus, if we go around changing every little regional quirk, you'll have Americans and British fighting revert wars over the use of "biscuit" before long.</dd>

<dd>I believe plastic is used too - a plastic coating on the inside to protect the aluminium from the stuff that aluminium can't stand, unlike (presumably) stomach walls&#160;:P a chemistry teacher "proved" it when (I think) he left the inside of a can empty but soaked the outside in conc.

<p>It seems to me that the move of this article to "aluminium can" was out of order. Naming policy says that articles should respect the convention used by the original author of the article, which in this case was the American spelling. Policy says nothing about renaming articles to make them consistent with the titles of other articles. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 06:44, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the links to the dialects because they didn't seem relevant to the topic, nor entirely accurate. At one point it was change from North American English to United States English (later to AmE) under the supposed claim that Canadians spell it "aluminium". A Google search of .ca sites, however, gives "aluminum" a 5 to 1 advantage over "aluminium", strongly indicating that Canadians use the American spelling, not the British spelling. In any case, whoever knows the word will recognize the spelling they are familiar with, and don't need to be directed to irrelevant articles on English dialects that don't mention the aluminium/aluminum spelling distinction. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 04:15, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whatever. Aluminum is the dominant usage in English-speaking North America, and it's going to stay that way for the foreseeable future.

<p>I am skeptical of two claims in the following text: "The stay-on-tab has had a huge impact on the environment. If you took all the tabs that have stayed on from 1970 to today - tabs that would be on the ground - they would amount to a couple of trillions."</p>
<p>First, what is the source for "a couple of trillions"? This ought to be <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">substantiated with a citation</a> for the number of cans manufactured since 1970. If nothing else, such a cited source may help guide updates to this number as the years go by: "1970 to today" is a non-constant span of time.</p>
<p>Second, why does staying on matter from an environmental standpoint? You're still consuming metal and energy resources to manufacture the cans, and that metal still ends up in trash heaps whether the tab and can are attached or not. Is there a recycling angle here? Are stay-on tabs more likely to be recycled with the accompanying can? I suppose that's possible, but it's certainly not manifestly true, and therefore should also be <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">substantiated</a>.</p>

<p>I used to work at a can plant running two lines that made 1.6 million cans a day, five days a week. Most large market can plants run 4-10 lines 7 days a week. (Newer plants at much faster speeds.) There are 50 + can plants in the US give or take.(May actually be hundreds, You would have to look up the number of plants of each major manufacturer plus the beer companies that run their own plants.) So some simple math gives you trillions of cans produced in one year.(Conservitively.) So yes that statement is in line if not not even a litte small.--Sean697 05:15, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beer cans allegedly vary in quality from batch to batch, and the oil coating the can may adversely change the taste of beer to a greater extent than for soft drinks. Such substandard cans are then apparently used for soft drinks whose consumers allegedly "won't know the difference".</p>

<p>All cans go through a washer after forming before printing. There is no oil on them at all. The coatings, while changing greatly over the years, are more like a varnish and desinged to have no taste. Some oil may get on the outside of the can from the necking process but it is not likely unless the machine is leaking oil and not operating correctly. The inside of a finishe can is usally spotless before filling with no oil whatsoever. Older can coatings are purported to have had a flavor that was discernable but newer coatings are pretty much flavorless. Now coating defects do happen periodically and they catch most of them before shipping but if you do get a can you may get an aluminum taste from the beverage disolving the metal. If it hasnt ate a hole in the can already. They actually take test cans from every few thousand and pour a conductive solution in the can and test conductivty and from outside of can to the inside. Should be none or very little. If it conducts electricity the coating is defective and that whole batch of cans would have to be sorted and possibly scrapped.--Sean697 05:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps someone can answer this, but in Europe I've noticed the cans are magnetic (hence not made of aluminum). An engineering friend of mine says the cans are <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel.html" title="Steel">steel</a>, with a <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tin.html" title="Tin">tin</a> inner lining, and aluminum is only used for capping the ends. Is this a European thing, or are the cans only coated with aluminum (like US coins that are primarily made of zinc)? - <a href="../../../i/s/t/User%7EIstvanWolf_aaa4.html" title="User:IstvanWolf">IstvanWolf</a> 07:52, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
