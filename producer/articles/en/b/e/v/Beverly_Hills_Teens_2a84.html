<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills_Teens_2a84.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Bianca Dupree</b> - A scheming, raven-haired beauty who believes she comes first above all things. This arrogant diva can often be seen riding around in her long, light pink limo with her dog, Empress, and her chaffeur, Wilshire. She is very jealous of Larke's relationship with Troy and is constantly scheming to ruin it. She is also not above sabotaging the plans of the other teens; she once tried to ruin Tara's entry into a beauty pageant. Her chauffeur, Wilshire, is desperately in love with her, but she prefers to step all over him, despite the gang's efforts to bring them together.</li>
<li><b>Blaze Summers</b> - A blonde cowgirl who resembles a darker blonde version of Larke. Folksy and laid back, she is friendly to everyone. Her good-natured attitude attracts the attentions of a prince, with whom she falls in love.</li>
<li><b>Buck Huckster</b> - As his name implies, he is a slick shyster type always looking to make a fast buck. His obsession with money and wealth is derailed after he has a dream which shows him what his future will be like if he does not change.</li>
<li><b>Chester McTech</b> - The boy genius with a lab of his own, complete with a dress designing machine and the ability to help almost anyone at his school. Because of his great intelligence and ingenuity, he is often pressed into service by Pierce and Bianca (typically separately) to further his or her own agenda.</li>
<li><b>Empress</b> - Bianca's small, pink poodle with a nasty bark comparable to Bianca's attitude. She often helps Bianca complete a task to make Larke's life a little harder, such as destroying Larke's gigantic floppy disks. Her one and only enemy is none other than Larke's cat, Tiara.</li>
<li><b>Gig</b> - The brown-haired male rocker who plays alongside Jett. He is quite outspoken, and has a distinct accent that could be interpreted as British. A bit of a ladies' man, Gig once dated both Larke and Tara at the same time until Jett revealed his secret. He and Jett agreed that they would not date each other, but he appears to have feelings for her nonetheless, becoming jealous if she expresses interest in someone else, or vice versa.</li>
<li><b>Jett</b> - The blonde female rocker with extremely "big" hair and the exaggerated Valley Girl voice. She disapproves of Gig's womanizing ways, but, in spite of being a bit of a flirt herself, is apparently smitten with him. She and Gig earn a record contract in one of the show's last episodes.</li>
<li><b>Larke Tanner</b> - The blonde-haired, blue-eyed golden girl of Beverly Hills who's head-over-heels in love with the resident jock, Troy. She drives a bright pink Ferrari, usually accompanied by her pet cat, Tiara. She is a model and often wins many of the contests that she enters, although Bianca tries hard to sabotage her. Kind-hearted and sweet to the core, she is Bianca's complete opposite.</li>
<li><b>Nikki Darling</b> - The very definition of a drama queen, she is an aspiring actress with a very dramatic demeanor, especially against unfairness in the fashion and beauty world.</li>
<li><b>Pierce Thorndyke III</b> - The egotistical girl-crazy snob, who is blissfully unaware that he is not the Casanova that he believes himself to be. He often teams up with Bianca in her ultimately unsuccessful schemes to come between Larke and Troy, because while Bianca wants Troy, Pierce wants Larke, although he did woo Tara on occasion as well. In spite of his personality issues, Pierce does have the occasional endearing moment.</li>
<li><b>Jillian Thorndyke</b> - Pierce's annoying younger sister, who tries to be much more adult than she is.</li>
<li><b>Radley</b> - The surfer dude, complete with tan and lingo. Anywhere a wave can be had, Radley is there. Surfing is his life. He is close friends with Troy and Gig.</li>
<li><b>Shanelle Spencer</b> - The lone African-American of the bunch. She is intelligent and level-headed; the voice of reason among the all the kids. She also has a sly sense of humor.</li>
<li><b>Switchboard</b> - The self-dubbed "Guru of Gossip," Switchboard will stop at nothing to find the latest dirt to dish at the teen club. Her real name is Brenda.</li>
<li><b>Tiara</b> - Larke's fluffy Persian cat. Like her owner, Tiara is well-mannered and loves to play. She is, however, easily intimidated by Empress.</li>
<li><b>Tara Belle</b> - The Southern belle. She possesses a pronounced Deep South accent and sports a somewhat more demure look, showcasing pearls and ruffles. Polite and ladylike to a fault, Tara's demeanor sometimes is mistaken for naivete.</li>
<li><b>Troy Jeffries</b> - The school jock and the most popular boy in Beverly Hills. Despite this, he only has eyes for Larke.</li>
<li><b>Wilshire Brentwood</b>: Bianca's chauffeur and doormat. He is very much in love with Bianca, but she ignores him until he gets into danger, after which she kisses him. His favorite color is white. Wilshire is always kind to Bianca's "friends." He is seemingly the only member of the gang who genuinely likes Bianca's scheming, me-first attitude. When she briefly tried to become a more considerate person, Wilshire stated that he didn't like the new Bianca.</li>
