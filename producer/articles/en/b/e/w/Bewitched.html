<p><a name="Premise" id="Premise"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewitched.html" title="Edit section: Premise">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Premise</span></h3>
<p>The focus of the show (which was initially entitled "The Witch of Westport", according to the <a href="../../../a/%26/e/A%26E_bb38.html" title="A&amp;E">A&amp;E</a> <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">Biography</a> of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Montgomery_e173.html" title="Elizabeth Montgomery">Elizabeth Montgomery</a>), was on the mixed marriage of a nose-twitching <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch.html" title="Witch">witch</a>, Samantha Stephens (Montgomery), and her mortal husband, Darrin, played by <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_York_0d5a.html" title="Dick York">Dick York</a>. The series' basic premise was that witches were a separate, almost godlike race that tended to either ignore or look down upon mortals. Samantha's mother, Endora (played by <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Moorehead_5cd1.html" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>), disapproves of Darrin (as indeed do most of Samantha's family, except for her Aunt Clara, Uncle Arthur, and Cousin Serena, all of whom are, not coincidentally, considered somewhat uncouth (or, in Clara's case, senile) by the rest of the family), and many episodes revolve around her using magic to make life difficult for her non-magical son-in-law, whose name she invariably mispronounces as "Derwood," "Darwin," and other variations even less complimentary.</p>
<p>Darrin works for <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMann_and_Tate_5725.html" title="McMann and Tate">McMann and Tate</a>, an advertising agency, and his boss, Larry Tate, is a common presence on the show (though Mr McMann appeared only twice during the series). Despite Larry, along with his wife, Louise (<a href="../../../i/r/e/Irene_Vernon_f70a.html" title="Irene Vernon">Irene Vernon</a>, and later, <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kasey_Rogers_9a90.html" title="Kasey Rogers">Kasey Rogers</a>), witnessing plenty of strange events, neither of them ever learned of Samantha being a witch.</p>
<p>The Stephenses live at 1164 Morning Glory Circle, though the city and state have remained semi-ambiguous. Although most fan websites and some publications have listed the show's location as Westport, Connecticut (and, in episode 193, 'Just a Kid Again,' there was a direct referral), other on-air references gave the location as New York: Aunt Clara stated in Aunt Clara's Victoria Victory that the home was in New York; Larry Tate also referred to their home in New York. Numerous other references were made to New York City, Upper New York, Queens County, and Nassau County. The town of Patterson was specifically referred to in episode, 'Soapbox Derby' (incidentally, the Montgomery's place in Patterson was reportedly Elizabeth's favourite house of the two she grew up in). There are very few references actually made to the family living in Connecticut, though a couple were made to the family's moving or travelling there on rare occasions.</p>
<p>Across the street lived a retired couple, Abner Kravitz (played by stage and movie actor <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Tobias_1b91.html" title="George Tobias">George Tobias</a>) and his nosy wife, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladys_Kravitz_7f2e.html" title="Gladys Kravitz">Gladys Kravitz</a> (played first by <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Pearce_82b0.html" title="Alice Pearce">Alice Pearce</a>, who won a posthumous <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_in_television.html" title="1966 in television">1966</a> <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy</a> for the role; following Pearce's death in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> from ovarian cancer, the character was played by <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandra_Gould_55b2.html" title="Sandra Gould">Sandra Gould</a>). On the studio backlot, the Kravitz's place was actually down from the Stephens' house exterior. Both home's exterior doors opened to cemented walls or support beams, as the interiors were shot elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is the first series to have an estranged married couple, Endora and Maurice. While Maurice occasionally pops in with arm-candy, Endora is not usually connected to another male. Their separation is inferred and subtextual, as divorce was still taboo at the time. (In the episode, "Samantha's Good News", Endora did file for divorce via an "ectoplasmic interlocutory", so as to wrangle Maurice's affection.)</p>
<p>Although Endora casts countless spells on Darrin, she never outright removes him from Samantha's life, as she could no doubt easily do, by wiping his memories of her, teleporting him where Samantha cannot find him, or performing any other spell of such potential permanence. Endora's goal seems to be to pressure Darrin into leaving Samantha out of exasperation at Endora's intrusions or outright fear for his life, but Darrin's love for his wife overcomes every obstacle Endora throws at him, eventually earning him her exceedingly begrudging respect.</p>

Dick York and Elizabeth Montgomery from a 1964 episode.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The member of Samantha's family that Darrin tolerates most easily is the lovably bumbling Aunt Clara (played by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marion_Lorne_a44b.html" title="Marion Lorne">Marion Lorne</a>, who won a posthumous <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_in_television.html" title="1968 in television">1968</a> for the role). An aged witch whose powers have begun to wane, almost all of her spells end in disasters. She was in 27 episodes and the Aunt Clara character was not continued (nor the absence explained) when Lorne died during the fourth season. A similar character, Esmeralda, played by <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_Ghostley_c2dd.html" title="Alice Ghostley">Alice Ghostley</a>, would later make appearances starting in the 1969-1970 season. (Ghostley first appeared in a second-season episode as Naomi, the Stephens' klutzy, albeit well-meaning maid, whom Louise Tate commissioned as a brief replacement to her own maid, coincidentally called Esmeralda.)</p>
<p>Samantha's mischievous cousin, Serena, was another important character later on, first appearing in season two. Ever the troublemaker, Serena often chased after Darrin (York) in attempt to steal him away from Samantha. (Also played by Elizabeth Montgomery, she would be credited as 'Pandora Spocks' once becoming more regularly cast.)</p>
<p>Veteran actress Mabel Albertson (sister of Jack Albertson) played Darren's straight-laced mother. The character often complained of "a sick headache" when she caught a magic spell in action. Adding to the fun was the Stephens' witch daughter Tabitha, and the later-added baby boy Adam, as well as various witches, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warlock.html" title="Warlock">warlocks</a>, and mere mortals, along with an occasional <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elf.html" title="Elf">elf</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leprechaun.html" title="Leprechaun">leprechaun</a>, <a href="../../../n/y/m/Nymph.html" title="Nymph">nymph</a>, and other such supernatural beings. The program made use of then-progressive <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_effect.html" title="Special effect">special effects</a> to work its magic, and the story lines were imaginative and good-natured, appealing to all ages. Most episodes ended with Darrin, having been the victim of witchcraft throughout the episode (often with a spell put upon him by Endora), affirming his love for Samantha and acknowledging that, like it or not, he would have to acclimate himself and accept witchcraft as part of his life.</p>
<p>Endora's buffoon-like brother Arthur (Paul Lynde) makes several memorable appearances. In one episode, Arthur befriends Darrin and teaches him a phony ritual that will set Endora straight. Darrin performs the silly ritual to the outright bewilderment of his wife and mother-in-law. After Arthur spends the next three minutes in rip-roaring laughter, it becomes clear that Darrin was set up. The trio get even with him when Darrin seemingly causes Endora to vanish. The episode ends with Arthur playing a harmless <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practical_joke.html" title="Practical joke">practical joke</a> on his sister Endora--a telescope that blackens the eyes.</p>

The drop in ratings was <a href="../../../i/r/o/Irony.html" title="Irony">ironic</a> in light of the fact that Sargent had been the original choice to play Darrin, but had been under contract elsewhere in 1964; however, it should be noted that Dick Sargent was first considered for the role of Darrin only when actress <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Grimes_807e.html" title="Tammy Grimes">Tammy Grimes</a> was first offered the role of Samantha, before William Asher and Elizabeth Montgomery became involved with the show.</p>
<p>Asher's first and only choice was Dick York since "he was too perfect for the role". Erin Murphy said on "E! Entertainment" that Elizabeth Montgomery preferred Dick Sargent's Darrin (York's ongoing shooting delays would have been a financial liability on Montgomery's newly formed Ashmont company, via longer hours, and script rewrites). Kasey Rogers, Bernard Fox, Mabel Albertson and Sandra Gould said that Dick York's "mugging" or animated facial expressions were what really made the character. William Asher claimed that Dick York's screen kisses were more "passionate". The series also had two Gladys Kravitzs, two Louise Tates and two Frank Stephenses. However, the switch between the two Darrins has become the epitome of TV's major cast changes, far more recalled/referenced than such other recasts as the two Lionel Jeffersons, two John-Boy Waltons, and others.</p>
<p>In an early episode Samatha had no reflection, because she wasn't mortal. Subsequently, the no-reflection angle was dropped, as the entry mirror showed just about every witch and warlock who swooped in.</p>
<p>In 1966, the show saw Samantha give birth to daughter Tabitha, played by <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twin.html#fraternal_twins" title="Twin">fraternal twins</a> Diane and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erin_Murphy_6430.html" title="Erin Murphy">Erin Murphy</a>. Tabitha took after her mother with her witch abilities, adding to Darrin's worries. In 1968, Diane Murphy was dropped as the sisters began looking less and less alike. The Tate's son Jonathan, who was 1 1/2 years older than Tabitha, was seldom seen or referenced after season 4, but made a final appearance in season 7. The character had been named Jonathan after David White's real life son (whose death made headlines in 1988). In 1969, <i>Bewitched</i> introduced Adam Stephens, played by Greg &amp; David Lawrence. Many saw this new baby addition as a sign of decline, or what would now be referred to as the show "<a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">jumping the shark</a>". Adam initially didn't display any powers, but started to do so in the last few episodes of the series.</p>

<p>Montgomery wanted to end the series at the conclusion of the fifth season, not only because of Dick York's departure, but because both she and her husband, the show's producer <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Asher_ed53.html" title="William Asher">William Asher</a>, were getting tired of the series and wanted to move on to other projects, but ABC did not want to drop one of its top-grossers. Since the series was one of the network's few hits, they offered Montgomery and Asher significant pay raises for another three seasons plus part ownership of the series (the last season was produced by Ashmont, a production company owned by Asher and Montgomery). By the seventh season, the story ideas had started to run dry, with many older episodes being remade. Alice Ghostley had departed to join <i><a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayberry_R.F.D._107a.html" title="Mayberry R.F.D.">Mayberry R.F.D.</a></i> in 1970, but would return in season eight for a few appearances (in particular where she straightened <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_13dc.html" title="The Leaning Tower of Pisa">The Leaning Tower of Pisa</a> in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and in another episode where she conjured up <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>). After the seventh season, Abner and Gladys Kravitz were written out of the show. By the last season (1971–1972), episodes were being remade almost word for word and even Agnes Moorehead's Endora was seen less. The series was moved to Saturday nights in January <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> and was pitted against the hit show <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_In_The_Family_6782.html" title="All In The Family">All In The Family</a>,</i> which proved to be a virtual death knell.</p>
<p>Bewitched finished the 1972 season at no. 72 in the ratings (Variety, May 24, 1972 pg. 35). ABC had planned a ninth season, according to the network's contract with Montgomery and Asher, but with the ratings so low, Asher offered to produce another series in place of a ninth season.</p>

<p>Sol Saks, who received credit as the creator of the show, wrote the pilot of <i>Bewitched</i>, although he was not involved with the show after the pilot. Initially, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Arnold_8df8.html" title="Danny Arnold">Danny Arnold</a>, who helped develop the style and tone of the series as well as some of the supporting characters who didn't appear in the pilot, like Larry Tate and the Kravitzes, produced and headed writing of the series. Arnold, who wrote on <i><a href="../../../m/c/h/McHale%27s_Navy_5f93.html" title="McHale's Navy">McHale's Navy</a></i> and other shows, thought of <i>Bewitched</i> as being essentially a romantic comedy about a mixed marriage; his episodes kept the magic element to a minimum, with one or two magical acts to drive the plot but Samantha usually solving problems without using magic. Also, many of the first season's episodes were <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegorical.html" title="Allegorical">allegorical</a>, using supernatural situations as clear metaphors for the real-life problems a young couple would face. Arnold stated that the two main themes of the series were the conflict between a powerful woman (Samantha) and a husband who can't deal with that power (Darrin), and the anger of the bride's mother (Endora) at seeing her daughter marry beneath her. Though the show was a hit right from the beginning, Arnold battled with ABC, which wanted more magic and more farcical plots.</p>
<p>Arnold left the show after the first season (he would later co-create <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_Miller_93ba.html" title="Barney Miller">Barney Miller</a></i> with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_J._Flicker_ee3f.html" title="Theodore J. Flicker">Theodore J. Flicker</a>), leaving producing duties to his friend Jerry Davis, who had already produced some of the first season's episodes (though Arnold was still supervising the writing). The second season, produced by Davis and with <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Slade_7c1d.html" title="Bernard Slade">Bernard Slade</a> as head writer, included somewhat wackier plots, with mistaken identity and farce becoming a more prevalent element, but still included a number of more low-key episodes where the magic element was not front and center.</p>
<p>With the third season and the switch to color, Davis left the show, and was replaced as producer by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Froug_d8b1.html" title="William Froug">William Froug</a>. Slade also left after the second season (he would later create another popular <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen_Gems_7190.html" title="Screen Gems">Screen Gems</a> series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Partridge_Family_c79e.html" title="The Partridge Family">The Partridge Family</a></i>, which, like <i>Bewitched</i>, went through a recasting of a role). According to William Froug's autobiography, Asher himself wanted to take over as producer when Jerry Davis left, but the production company wasn't yet ready to approve the idea. So Froug, a former producer of <i><a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilligan%27s_Island_f6c0.html" title="Gilligan's Island">Gilligan's Island</a></i>, was brought in as a compromise. By his own admission, Froug was not very familiar with <i>Bewitched</i> and found himself in the uncomfortable position of being the official producer even though Asher was making most of the creative deicisions. After a year, Froug left the show, and Asher took over as full-time producer of the series for the rest of its run.</p>
<p>With the departure of Arnold, Davis, and the other writers from the first season, and Asher's increasing creative control, most of the episodes from this point on would be more formulaic and more about magical shenanigans than the romantic comedy <i>Bewitched</i> had been in its first season.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewitched.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The show's producer's were worried in late 1963 that the deep South would reject the show's <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a> premise. A few <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalist</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> organizations, claimed that the show whimsically portrayed occultic powers and put them in an appealing package (Montgomery). Some groups cited that the show's witches and warlocks had no surnames (except for Dr. Bombay) because Wicca is steeped in goddess lore and worship of Mother Earth (early in the series, Darrin asked for Endora's last name. Endora responded, "You'd never be able to pronounce it"). Series fans saw any such criticism as being paranoid. <i>Bewitched</i>, like "The Wizard of Oz", avoided such dark controversies. Furthermore, the series celebrated Christmas- a Christian holiday- in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>.</li>
<li>Agnes Moorehead, who played Endora, was a Reformed Presbyterian and practicing Christian, and presumably would not have participated in a series had she thought it was promoting the occult.</li>
<li>Dick Sargent worked at masking his sexual orientation. Early bios listed comic actress/writer <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fannie_Flagg_520d.html" title="Fannie Flagg">Fannie Flagg</a> as his fiance. In 1970 he was the celebrity bachelor on a "Dating Game" episode and chose one of the bachelorettes as his date. While Sargent and Lynde were both gay, there have been erroneous postings of Agnes Moorehead as either gay or bisexual. According to most who knew her well, she was heterosexual.</li>
<li>Montgomery had an affair with Richard Michaels<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, a director of the show, during the filming of the eighth season. According to Michaels interview on ET, the set hairdresser acted as their go-between. They finally revealed their relationship after the finish of the season. Her marriage to producer <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Asher_ed53.html" title="William Asher">William Asher</a> ended and so did the series. The show had been picked up by ABC for a ninth season, but the magic had already left both the marriage and the series. Montgomery moved out of their house and in with Michaels, with whom she spent two and a half years before they parted.</li>
<li>TV Land erected a 7' bronze statue of Samantha Stephens in downtown <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salem%2C_Massachusetts_1cf8.html" title="Salem, Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a> in June 2005. The "Bewitched Statue" portrays Samantha Stephens riding a broom, resting on a crescent moon. The statue has been a focus of controversy from both Christian fundamentalists who charge the statue promotes witchcraft; and from groups who charge that the statue makes light of the 20 innocent people who were executed for witchcraft in Salem in the year 1692. Coincidentally, during the 1970-1971 season, in a multi-part story arc, Samantha, Darrin, Endora, Serena, Larry, and Louise took a trip to Salem, Massachusetts. For Samantha, Endora and Serena it was for a witches' convention while for Darrin and Larry it was a business trip.

The show had several continuity issues, most notably the ages of Tabitha and Adam (who should have been 11 and 8 years of age in 1977). The Samantha and Darrin characters never appeared in the spin-off series, though Bernard Fox, Sandra Gould, and George Tobias made separate guest appearances as Dr. Bombay, Gladys Kravitz, and Abner Kravitz, respectively.</p>

When Jack Wyatt (Ferrell), a failing <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> actor, is offered the chance of a career comeback playing Darrin in a remake of <i>Bewitched</i>, all he has to do is find the perfect girl to play Samantha. He finds Isabel Bigelow (Kidman), who really is a witch. It is set in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> rather than New York. The storyline bears some similarities to that of the movie <i><a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell%2C_Book_and_Candle_a88c.html" title="Bell, Book and Candle">Bell, Book and Candle</a></i>, often cited as one of the primary inspirations for the original series.

<li>Samantha and Darrin Stephens made a cameo in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flintstones_047c.html" title="The Flintstones">The Flintstones</a></i> (see above).</li>
<li>Samantha and Darrin Stephens were the first live-action TV couple, with the actors not married to each other in "real life," to sleep in a double bed (Mary Kay and Johnny Stearns shared a bed in an earlier sitcom but were married in real life). The episode in question, "Little Pitchers Have Big Fears," aired on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, 1964. Despite popular belief, it was not <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Munsters_6ced.html" title="The Munsters">The Munsters</a></i> (which showed Herman and Lily first sharing a bed in the episode "Autumn Croakus" on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">November 26</a>, 1964) or <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brady_Bunch_bf64.html" title="The Brady Bunch">The Brady Bunch</a></i>, which didn't air until 1969. <a href="http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/bedtime.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/bedtime.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. When Don Grady ("My Three Sons") learned that he and his TV wife were given separate single beds, he told CBS brass that rival network ABC allowed Darrin and Samantha to sleep in one double bed. Soon thereafter, the single beds were replaced with a queen size bed (where the two could lie together without close proximity).</li>
<li><i>Bewitched</i> proved to be very popular with young girls when it first aired in Japan, and is considered to be the inspiration for the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magical_girl.html" title="Magical girl">Magical girl</a> genre of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>.</li>
<li>A slip in genealogical continuity can been seen as Uncle Arthur is referenced as Endora's brother, and Serena is referenced as being Samantha's cousin "on her father's (Maurice's) side of the family". Nonetheless, Serena calls Arthur "uncle", and was close to Endora who was estranged from Maurice.</li>

<li>The first reference was made in the episode "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cleveland-Loretta_Quagmire_8991.html" title="The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire">The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire</a>", when <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewie_Griffin_46b0.html" title="Stewie Griffin">Stewie</a> was watching <i>Bewitched</i> on TV where Endora turns Darrin into an elephant. Samantha begs for Endora to turn Darrin back into a human, and she obliges. Darrin then begins raging at Endora saying that he is tired of her constantly abusing him, and he retaliates by splashing <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Water_1caa.html" title="Holy Water">Holy Water</a> on her while saying, "The Power of Christ compels you, bitch!", while the Holy water burned on Endora's face. <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Brown_d172.html" title="Cleveland Brown">Cleveland</a>, who was angry at the time, said, "I hate <i>Bewitched</i>!", and turned over the couch with Stewie on it.</li>
<li><i>Bewitched</i> was referenced again in the episode "<a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_Love_%28Family_Guy_episode%29_4e47.html" title="Jungle Love (Family Guy episode)">Jungle Love</a>", when Stewie was watching the 2005 <a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewitched_%28film%29.html" title="Bewitched (film)">movie version</a> in a theater when <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Ferrell_2075.html" title="Will Ferrell">Will Ferrell</a> made a corny joke on-screen (<b>Isabel</b>: Guess what, I'm a witch! <b>Jack</b>: Guess what, I'm a <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Clippers_fcf3.html" title="Los Angeles Clippers">Clippers</a> fan!).
