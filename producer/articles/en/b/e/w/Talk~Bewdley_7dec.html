<p>I live close to Bewdley and have never heard about this; I can also find no sources substantiating it. Could somebody provide a source for this information? --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShastrix_ede0.html" title="User:Shastrix">Shastrix</a> 22:58, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I live <i>in</i> Bewdley, and I can assure you that we are most definitely English! It sounds like one of those laws like the one supposedly allowing people in Chester to shoot Welshmen with longbows (or whatever it is), and I can see no value at all in leaving it in. So I've hacked it out. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> 16:16, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Going back over 1,000 years, the border between England and Wales was the River Severn. This put the small community that later became known as Bewdley, firmly on the Welsh side. Now it's at least 25 miles to the east of the Welsh border. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.18.239.61 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.18.239.61.html" title="User talk:82.18.239.61">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.18.239.61_b3eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.18.239.61">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I'm not really sure how much of a community there <i>was</i> here a thousand years ago. A little bit of vaguely relevant trivia, though: Wribbenhall (the part of the town on the eastern, ie English, side of the river) was at one time slightly derogatively known as "the Christian shore". I have no proper sources for this, so it can't go in the article, but I have heard it more than once. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 15:58, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In Wribbenhall ( The Christian East shore of the river) There used to be a hangmans post at Catchems End and as the name suggests that was where they used to catch them alright!! But there is also a street called Westbourne st. ( formerly Whispering st.) This is where the criminals used to whisper for the ferry man to take them accross the river into the safe welsh side. As to the confusion above, basically Bewdley developed as an English town crossing point of the river and so has always been an English stronghold and it just so happened to build up a lot on that side of the river and there used to be a gate to Wales up the street called Welsh Gate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.132.181.244 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.132.181.244_7681.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.132.181.244">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Have you got some sources for any of that? Some of it might fit quite well in the article if so - the Whispering Street stuff would be nice to have - but it shouldn't go in without those references. Regarding Catchems End, my copy of <i>Bewdley in its Golden Age</i> mentions (p6) several examples of Bewdley being used as a sanctuary town. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 01:43, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! I think the picture of the street is a bit boring. Could someone near Bewdley or from Bewdley take a new Picture and put it here. This can be this famous bridge from the side or the townhall from the front or the whole city from birdview. That would be great. <a href="../../../s/v/o/User%7ESvonHalenbach_c270.html" title="User:SvonHalenbach">StefanvH</a> 09:49, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry you think it's a boring picture. I'm biased since I took it, but I rather like it, as Load Street (what you can see in the photo) is the main street of Bewdley, and both its relative width and the style of the buildings on either side are very characteristic of the town. Having said that, I'd be happy to add more photos, although there is a limit to how many can sensibly be added to a relatively short article. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 16:19, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you Loganberry! I agree with you about the number of photos, but the famous telford bridge would be a nice addition in my opinion.I don´t wanted to insult you. I am sorry. I just ment there is very much grey in the picture(from the street). Someone like me, who doesent know Bewdley can get the impression Bewdley is just a long street with some houses. It is proberbly better to make that picture again from "dogperspective" (some inches above the ground with a strong tilt upwards (with houses, cars, people, the church?, and some sheepclouds with polarisation-filter)). Interesting for me would be the (church?) and some houses. What do you think about that? <a href="../../../s/v/o/User%7ESvonHalenbach_c270.html" title="User:SvonHalenbach">StefanvH</a> 13:11, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't worry; I'm not offended at all, and actually a picture of the bridge would be a good addition to the article. About the Load Street photo: the grey is less noticeable on the full-size picture, but you still have a point. Maybe the best thing for me to do would be to upload several pictures to the Commons, and pick out a couple, and then if this article becomes longer in the future, I or another editor can add more pictures from there. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 02:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I may join in this discussion. All photos can be improved upon, especially with such comments as made by Stefan. However, I can confirm from personal knowledge that Load Street is very difficult to photograph. Both sides of the road have buildings ranging from Georgian gentleman's houses, hotels, banks, civic buildings and Victorian shops and houses and finally the church as an building in the middle of the road. The photograph, in its large format, is quite good at giving the overall impression as to what the street looks like from the river bridge. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonBarton_d922.html" title="User:DonBarton">DonBarton</a> 12:23, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've uploaded a picture of Bewdley Bridge that I took a few weeks ago. There is currently repair work going on to fix part of the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balustrade.html" title="Balustrade">balustrade</a>, so some other possible views of it aren't possible at the moment without showing a lot of unsightly temporary barriers - you can actually see them in this picture (near the centre of the bridge), but from this angle I don't think they're too intrusive. As for the possibility of more photos, I don't see why not, but I think we'd need a longer and more detailed article first to stop it looking overbalanced with so many pictures. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 23:51, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, I've added someone else's picture of the station. I'd have no complaints if anyone had strong views for substituting another, but I think three photos in total is about the maximum sensible for an article as long as this one currently is. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 02:41, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the article can bear four photos now, so as suggested above I've added one of the Guildhall. That seems to fit best in the <i>History and Government</i> section, and the Load Street picture in the <i>Town Geography</i> section, so I've moved them to fit. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 13:25, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've removed the table at least for now, because it doesn't seem suitable for a town within a two-tier authority (district and county), as Worcestershire is. The population thingy shows the figures for Wyre Forest as a whole (just under 100,000), which is so misleading that we're better off without it. I'm also not happy with the idea that we should simply mention the town council under "Politics", seeing as both the district and the county council have far more power. The infobox on the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester.html" title="Worcester">Worcester</a> page is there because Worcester is in itself a local government district; the format is not suitable for a town such as Bewdley which is not itself a district. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 00:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, i can accept that. Hi, again Loganberry! --<a href="../../../s/v/o/User%7ESvonHalenbach_c270.html" title="User:SvonHalenbach">StefanvH</a> 11:37, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello to you too! I'd better make clear that I don't have any problem with an infobox <i>per se</i> except for the minor complaint about the way they tend to overwhelm pages' appearances. If there is an infobox around which <i>would</i> be suitable for this page, then by all means go ahead and add it. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 11:52, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
