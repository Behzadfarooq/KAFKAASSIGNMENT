<p>To me, these two words are synonyms, and when editing relevent articles (such as this one) I try to use both words to avoid repeating the same word over and over again. But all of my edits have been changed to use 'fertilization' exclusively, never mentioning 'conception' in the article. Any ideas why? <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 15:32, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, the article is <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">Fertilisation</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conception.html" title="Conception">Conception</a> redirects there. But second of all, there has been an effort by the ACOG to define "conception" at implantation. TO avoid confusion, I personally use <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">Fertilisation</a> if I am talking about the union of a sperm and egg. However, I am not the one who changed your edits so I cannot speak for them.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification re:ACOG. On spelling, the 'z' spelling gets 18 million hits on Google. The 's' spelling gets only 3 million hits. The Wikipedia article indicates that both spellings are acceptable, but that the 'z' spelling is more widely used. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 01:13, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In regards to spelling, its a matter of British English vs. American English. The normal convention is to pick one and use it consistently throughout the article. I personally think it is a hassle to have to add excessive code in order to avoid a redirect and get the spelling correct, by typing [[Fertilisation|fertilization]], so I just stick with the Brittish spelling for ease. I bet there is a big discussion about the spelling over at that talk page.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:19, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes and I should add that Google results are frequently criticised for establishing prominence of a term. They only reflect internet usage and are therefore biased to Americans and especially not reflective of Indians and others who use English in less developed countries <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 12:02, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The edit refers to "established pregnancy" as a medical term, but it's not one I'm familiar with. In one location, it seems to be used synonomously with implanted pregnancy (replaced the phrase 'detectable pregnancy'), while in the other location it seems to mean a pregnancy further along (discounting early pregnancy losses). Does anyone have a link to a definition? <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 01:20, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Some anti-abortion groups acknowledge the postfertilization effect of breastfeeding, but defend it based on the bioethical <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_double_effect.html" title="Principle of double effect">principle of double effect</a>. Use of hormonal contraceptives, including EC, is usually motivated by an intention to avoid pregnancy - when one of the proposed mechanisms operates after fertilization, they consider these methods immoral. Breastfeeding is motivated by - and has the primary effect of - nourishing a child. Because the intention is presumably not related to avoiding pregnancy, they do <i>not</i> consider immoral any secondary, or double, effect of harm done to unimplanted embryos.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The way I see it, these groups must therefore agree that breastfeeding can cause abortions (under their view) but it's acceptable because it's a secondary effect and not part of the primary purpose. And I guess this means that any woman who continues breastfeeding to avoid pregnancy is as bad as someone who uses EC etc... I'm not suggesting we include the later but I do think we need to mention that they accept that breastfeeding can cause abortions assuming it's the case which it must be <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 12:18, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I question that any woman would breastfeed primarily as a method of birth control. Breastfeeding is painful for the first several weeks as the nipples toughen up. Infants generally feed for 20-45 minutes at a time, with 1.5-2 hours between the starts of feedings, including at night. That means mothers of newborns can have an infant latched on for up to 12 hours out of every day. And if extended breastfeeding is practiced (in the U.S., anything over a year, although the WHO defines it as anything over two years), the challenges of breastfeeding a toddler also make breastfeeding probably the most inconvenient form of birth control ever. I just cannot see any woman going through that unless their primary motivation was to provide the best nourishment possible for their child. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 13:46, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm arguing that a woman would not breastfeed unless her primary reason was to feed the child. Most women only use LAM as birth control if they were going to breastfeed <i>anyway</i>. While I can see help in avoiding pregnancy as being one of several factors that makes a woman choose to breastfeed, I just can't see it being <b>the</b> factor. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 19:11, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Recent edit warring: I personally think the previous version was better than the recent edits that changed the title. This article is about the beginning of pregnancy controversy, and the only reason breastfeeding infertility is mentioned is because one of the definitions of pregnancy would thereby define LAM as abortion. Also, a fact tag was recently placed on something that seems like common sense. Could that tag be further explained please? Is this citation (last paragraph) ok to add to the article if it really is needed? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=4&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=fd92772f01a5c709&amp;ex=1304654400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=4&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=fd92772f01a5c709&amp;ex=1304654400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">NYT Magazine</a>--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 00:06, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The topic of the section is not breastfeeding infertility. The topic is the controversy over whether breastfeeding can cause abortions. A more accurate description than "breastfeeding infertility" is needed.</p>
<p>What definition is being tagged as unsourced? That pregnancy is sometimes defined as beginning at fertilization? That's the main topic of this article and is well-sourced in the "Definitions" section. That abortion is often defined as ending a pregnancy? A define:abortion search on Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:abortion&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;ct=title" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:abortion&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;ct=title" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> shows that six of the seven top hits have "termination of pregnancy" or "loss of pregnancy" as part of the definition.</p>
<p>Or is it the connection between the definition of pregnancy, the definition of abortion, and the conclusion that breastfeeding is abortifacient? The cite later in the breastfeeding section <a href="http://www.epm.org/articles/BreastfedAbortions.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epm.org/articles/BreastfedAbortions.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> says so: <i>On page 63 of the 5th edition of "Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions," you mention a physician as stating that breastfeeding can cause abortions.</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=4&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=fd92772f01a5c709&amp;ex=1304654400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07contraception.html?pagewanted=4&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=fd92772f01a5c709&amp;ex=1304654400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">This site</a> also draws the connection: <i>if the emergency contraception pill causes abortions by blocking implantation, then by the same definition breast feeding may as well.</i> As does <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/abortioncontraception/p/MorningAfter.htm" class="external text" title="http://atheism.about.com/od/abortioncontraception/p/MorningAfter.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>: <i>So, if emergency contraception is an abortifacient, so is breast feeding.</i></p>
<p>I would be happy to add one or more of these sources to the article if it is clarified for me what is being questioned. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 00:12, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the entire section needs work, currently reading as if breastfeeding is a common cause of abortion. It needs to downplay this, as breastfeeding stops ovulation and it is not often that fertilisation occurs. It is also confusingly worded, saying that, if pregnancy is defined by implantation, then not implanting is abortion - surely this should be if pregnancy is defined by <i>fertilisation</i>. The section after (Affected birth control methods) deals with this better, and I would question the need for a seperate section on breastfeeding.</dd>
<dd>I don't think the article correctly establishes the arguments about the classification of methods as contraceptives or abortifacients. It should be explicitly stated that if <i>this</i> definition of the start is used then <i>these</i> types of birth control methods are seen as abortive. I'm going to try a slight reorganisation which I hope will fix this. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 19:41, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read the article up until the "Ethics of preventing Pregnancy" point, and found most of it really good, however in this section there are a couple of phrases which I don't like and one which I don't even underestand.</p>
<p>I'll start with the one I don't understand, "The intention of a woman to prevent pregnancy is an important factor in whether or not the act of contraception is seen as abortive by some pro-life groups." What exactly does this mean, I read it a few times and it still confuses me. Please can someone rephrase it or explain it here?</p>
<p>Now to the bits that bother me. "Some pro-choice groups have expressed concern that the movement to recognize hormonal contraceptives as abortifacient will also cause breastfeeding to be considered an abortion method." Have expressed concern? They are trying to trip people up saying "well if this is abortive so is THIS! What do you think about that". Of course that might not be the best thing to say, but "express concern" come on...</p>

<dd>Breastfeeding prevents embryos from implanting. However, women who breastfeed do not intentionally prevent those embryos from implanting - it is a side effect of feeding their child. The intention of the woman (feeding her child) makes the embryo death associated with breastfeeding moral. But the exact same effect (preventing embryos from implanting) is, according to these groups, immoral if caused by the Pill - because the woman is intending to prevent pregnancy.</dd>

<p>I am reverting the last edit by Andrew c to the last version by me though I have no intention of violating the 3R rule.</p>
<p>Reasons: 1. Some of the references are not really references at all and haven't contributed in any way to the content of the article. As such shouldn't they be in a separate external links section? Andrew c's seems to have missed the point behind my change. As he says, " websites can be used as references". And I agree with him. My issue is that they are being used as references even though they aren't.</p>
<p>2. Also, even if they can indeed be shown to be acceptable references, reverting is a blunt tool and wiped out other changes I made to the article. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPoweroid_35e1.html" title="User:Poweroid">Poweroid</a> 16:54, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. If you remove references, you need to put a fact tag after the claims because now the claims are not cited. The first footnote is helpful, while not exactly a reference, it is an example the debate in the format of a medical journal. Instead of removing the note, I'd suggestion prefacing it with the words "For example..." The second and third links are references for a hospital and a medical company supporting the LMP gestational age counting. If we can keep the reference for doctors supporting the statement, I don't see why the hospital and medical company needs to go (if anything, combine the 3 different sources into one footnote). Finally, the 4th footnote that was removed is a clear citation of a pro-life organization considering EC to be an abortion. If we remove that note, we no longer have a verifiable source on this view. I still support including these footnotes as they were. However, I'd be interested in hearing counter arguments, and views from other editors.</dd>

<dd>2. I understand that reverting can remove helpful and neutral changes, and I apologize if I removed helpful content. However, your wikilink the terms <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraceptives.html" title="Contraceptives">contraceptives</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menstruation.html" title="Menstruation">menstruation</a> isn't helpful because the first is a redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_control.html" title="Birth control">birth control</a>, which is already linked to in the same sentence (menstruation is a redirect to Menstrual cycle, so adding brackets around the term is less prefered than to creating a soft redirect by typing [[Menstrual cycle|menstruation]]). However, I will try to be mindful of removing helpful content in the future when doing reverts. I apologize if my revert came off as too aggressive. I hope we can work these matters out!

<p>Hmm. Helpful points Andrew. OK, let me edit again to take account of your comments above and see if you approve. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPoweroid_35e1.html" title="User:Poweroid">Poweroid</a> 17:54, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Instead of keeping the reference for doctors and adding the references to hospital and medical company I'd have preferred to remove all three references. However I have, in fact, restored the two I deleted.</p>
<p>With respect the pro-life group I don't have any pro-life or pro-choice agenda but just didn't think that it merited being quoted as a reference rather than just where I've got it now, in external links. I'm open to other editors' views.</p>
<p>I've taken your advice on the wikified links and have reversed my original edit + modified the menstuation one. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPoweroid_35e1.html" title="User:Poweroid">Poweroid</a> 18:20, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Statements in Wikipedia articles, especially if they are possibly controversial, need cites - proof that Wikpedia editors are not just making this stuff up.</dd>
<dd>The statement "professionals have debated the issue in medical journals" needs to be supported by proof. A citation to such a debate provides support for the statement.</dd>
<dd>The statement <i>"Use of these drugs... is seen by some pro-life groups as immoral... because of the possibility of causing what they believe to be an abortion."</i> also needs support. A citation to a pro-life group stating that oral contraceptive pills cause abortions provides support for the statement.</dd>

<dd>Renaming the citation section to "footnotes" or something may be more accurate, but the main issue is that Wikipedia articles need to be verifiable.

<dd>I've just noticed you've changed the references all back to pretty much how they were before I edited the article at all. And it's probably how Andrew would prefer it too. To me it looks all screwed up and, unlike other articles, has references all over the place even when they are more appropriate in External Links. I'm not into edit wars but when I get a chance to read up some more on what constitutes valid references - and do some more research into how references are used in other articles - I'll be back with a more persuasive argument. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPoweroid_35e1.html" title="User:Poweroid">Poweroid</a> 12:56, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>External links are for general information on a topic. If the validity of a specific sentence or paragraph is being supported, that's when references/footnotes are used. My concern on removing the current footnote system is that it destroys the connection between the specific sentences/paragraphs and the evidence used to support them. This makes the article more difficult for a reader to independently verify. At least, that's my understanding of it. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 22:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe the source used "American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Terminology Bulletin. Terms Used in Reference to the Fetus. No. 1.

Searching google for "Terms Used in Reference to the Fetus" gets 48 hits, also pro-life sites. Does Ferrylodge have a copy of this source, or is the actually source a secondary source which is claiming to use this ACOG Bulletin? I think the best thing would be to find a good, reliable source (not a pro-choice/life site) that explains the history of the controversy, and site them instead.

<dd>You quote one line from the Bulletin "Conception is the implantation of a fertilized ovum." Everything else seems to be personal commentary/OR. I could do the same thing.
<dl>
<dd>Traditionally, pregnancy was defined as beginning with fertilization. However, with advances is medical knowledge things began to change. In 1959, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Min_Chueh_Chang_028d.html" title="Min Chueh Chang">Min Chueh Chang</a>'s successfully performed <a href="../../../i/v/f/IVF_bd31.html" title="IVF">IVF</a> in rabbits. The scientific consensus was beginning to recognize how imprecise the traditional definition was. Test tubes did not become pregnant, even though they contained fertilized eggs. With a greater understanding of the female reproductive system, coupled with technological advances in IVF and birth control, it was becoming gradually clear to the scientific community that pregnancy began when a fertilized egg was implanted on the uterus wall. This is exemplified when the ACOG announced in 1965 that "Conception is the implantation of a fertilized ovum." This change however is sometimes criticized in the abortion debate arena by those who personally believe human life begins at fertilization.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Of course this is over the top, and I would never suggest it be part of the article. I do think we should cut down on the editorializing in the current version, and perhaps find a neutral, reliable source that summarized the change, because right now all we have sourced is a single sentence from the Bulletin.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 17:50, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm in agreement with Andrew c that quoting a single line from the ACOG document is not a "direct quotation." "Conception is the implantation of a fertilized ovum" seems to be the only bit of the <i>Terminology Bulletin</i> <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Conception+is+the+implantation+of+a+fertilized+ovum%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Conception+is+the+implantation+of+a+fertilized+ovum%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">anyone feels like quoting</a>. The current version is especially problematic given the fact that it makes the unsourced, speculatory assertation that the issuing of the bulletin by ACOG was motivated by political ends. It might have just as well been that the bulletin was an attempt to refine to the definition of pregnancy to bring it into alignment with the new scientific evidence from the IVF experiments. The simple fact is that we don't have a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> to back up an assertation that there was an underlying motive either way, and, thus, including the suggestion in the article is counter to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<p>I believe the way that this is referenced is misleading (I tried to change the wording to be more accurate, but I feel it shouldn't be there). Langman's doesn't go out and give a straight forward definition of pregnancy. The citation mentions how gestational age is counted. It mentions Last Normal Menstrual Period (LNMP) (roughly a 40 week pregnancy) and it mentions counting from fertilization (roughly a 38 week pregnancy). It chooses to count from fertilization. This doesn't mean that they are defining pregnancy as starting at fertilization. This is a book on Embryology, and of course part of embryo development occurs during fertilization. No one is arguing that an embryo magically starts to develop at implantation. The focus of Langman's is the embryo, so it isn't strange at all that they start counting at fertilization. The focus is NOT on the woman, or pregnancy in general. On top of that, on page 41 they discuss contraception. They mention IUDs, oral hormonal contraception, and mifepristone (among others). They say that the pill works be preventing ovulation, they say it isn't clear that IUDs prevent fertilization or implantation, but they clearly consider IUDs contraception, and they say the mifepristone is an abortifacients . Judging by this, it is clear that Langman's does not support the arguments put forth in this article that certain forms of controversial BC are abortifacients. So a) they never say that pregnancy starts at fertilization (they say embryo development starts then) and b) they clearly say that IUDs, while possibly preventing implantation are not abortifacients. I'd propose removing that sentence, and possibly finding another medical text to replace it (if one exists).-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 00:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first sentence under the Beginning of the Controversy section, states that the word "conception" has been used in reference to the beginning of pregnancy long before the discovery of fertilization, however, when clicking on the fertilization article, it says that it is also known as conception (which is a bit confusing). Also the reference to what most dictionaries said by the 1960s is misleading, because I think it implies, at least indirectly, that that has always been the definition of pregnancy.

<ul>
<li>I broke up the one long sentence in the introduction into two sentences for easier readability.</li>
<li>I changed "are considered" to "might be" abortifacient, since most of the proposed post-fertilization mechanisms have not been proven.</li>
<li>I added a wikilink to the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fertilisation.html" title="Fertilisation">fertilisation</a> article (which uses the British spelling)</li>
<li>I re-added the modern dictionary definition "from conception until birth" that had been moved from the "Definition" section to the history section.</li>
<li>I removed the commentary on how implantation "makes more sense" out of the "Definition" section and back into the "detectable pregnancy" section where it is more obviously commentary and not a definition.</li>
<li>In the history section ("beginning of the controversy") I changed "more generally" to "originally" and removed the tangent about contemporary definitions.</li>
<li>I renamed "Claims of abortion" to "Birth control - mechanism of action" which I believe is more descriptive - the section is <i>mainly</i> describing how birth control works. I also did a copyedit on the first paragraph in this section.</li>
<li>I changed "Birth control methods that are alleged to be abortions" back to "Possibly affected birth control methods" for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>"Possibly affected..." is shorter</li>
<li>Whether or not one defines pregnancy at implanation, these methods are still "possibly affected" by having postfertilization mechanisms. I believe focusing attention on the question of the existence of postfertilization mechanisms (with the "possibly affected..." title) is better than focusing attention on the morality of preventing implantation (with the "...alleged to be abortions" title).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I re-added the deleted section on the ethics of preventing implantation. I don't understand why it was deleted.</li>
<li>I deleted "acting as an early sign that a pregnancy may occur" from the paragraph on EPF - it implicitly defines pregnancy as beginning at implantation. NPOV dictates that this article only describe the different definitions, not offer statements (either explicit or implicit) about which definition is correct.</li>
<li>I removed the qualifier "fertilized" from "zygote". One, it is the ovum that is fertilized, not the zygote. Two, I don't think zygotes resulting from processes other than fertilization (cloning?) are at all relevant to this article.</li>
<li>I removed the commentary on chemical pregnancies (those that can be detected with hCG blood or urine tests - "chemical" tests - but never grow large enough to be seen on an ultrasound - a "clinical" test). One, it did not add anything to the article. Two, a woman's personal feelings about the significance of an early miscarriage will vary widely from woman to woman, and implying that all chemical pregnancies are not worthy of "notice" is possibly offensive.</li>
