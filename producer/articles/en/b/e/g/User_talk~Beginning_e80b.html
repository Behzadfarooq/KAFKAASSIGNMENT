<p>Re: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>'s county seats: You should read what I put into the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Talk%7EConnecticut_5441.html" title="Talk:Connecticut">talk page</a>, and read the links there. They've got some slightly more concrete information about when/why seats were abolished. Also, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Connecticut_counties_924f.html" title="List of Connecticut counties">List of Connecticut counties</a> doesn't necessarily contradict your statement, since it calls them "historic" county seats, plus it does point out that counties are only geographic. - <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlutor_2e6a.html" title="User:Plutor">Plutor</a> 12:38, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for poking me. As I said on the Talk page, I was hunting for the transcript earlier, but I had to abandon the search to go run some errands. A partial transcript of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,133712,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,133712,00.html" rel="nofollow">the first night</a> is available, but the nickname was first used on either the second or third, and so far I can't locate it. I'll keep looking, though, and I won't object to you noting that it's not officially sourced yet. The interview in which it was originally said is due to be rerun on Fox News Monday night, so hopefully they'll stick the full transcripts up soon. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBeginning_2e6d.html" title="User:Beginning">Beginning</a> 03:54, Oct 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was attempting to make the "people from X state" categories more uniform. If you go to the category <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People_by_U.S._state" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People_by_U.S._state" rel="nofollow">People By US State</a>], you'd see that its a mess. There seems to be no uniform way to do this and it is resulting in multiple pages with the same imformation. The most prodominant way people have been doing it is by saying "people from X" so I was making an effort to move all of the other categories that aren't uniformed into more uniformed names. It just makes sense--<a href="../../../1/3/0/User%7E130.184.11.129.html" title="User:130.184.11.129">130.184.11.129</a> 22:31, 15 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>California has 109 colleges in its system. See <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Community_Colleges_system_c9b1.html" title="California Community Colleges system">California Community Colleges system</a>. Most of them are funded through community college districts that cross city lines, which is why they are <i>not</i> called city colleges because they are often funded by residents of several cities as well as unincorporated areas. The prior phrasing was vague and ambiguous; it implied that <i>all</i> California community colleges are city colleges! Only the largest cities have city colleges because the city populations are so large that the city college can draw almost all its students from that one city. I hope this clears things up. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 16:28, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're not in disagreement at all about the facts, so that's good. I do not see the same problem as you regarding the wording since the sentence clearly said "often" and not "always," but by all means, if you think something is unclear, then it should be improved, and I think it has been. The problem with your fix was that it listed Los Angeles is the only example California city with city colleges. Since California has more municipally-funded two-year colleges than any other state, Los Angeles really shouldn't be cited as the only example in light of that. The fact that they are (relatively) common in California, especially when compared to other states, is notable enough to mention that it's a system used especially within the state. Hopefully, this is resolved now, and we can continue having civil discourse with the edits on that page. &#160;:) <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBeginning_2e6d.html" title="User:Beginning">Beginning</a> 17:05, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Frankly, I also agree with you. We can't mediate with someone who doesn't want to post one message at a talk page. More drastic measures, however, will be necessary, as it was a general consensus to include the important info on the article (that's what you called mediation for). These people aren't abiding to consensus so well. Have you got any ideas to solve it other than locking the page? The policies say it's only a last resort. <b><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">fetofs</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../f/e/t/User_talk%7EFetofs_75a9.html" title="User talk:Fetofs"><font color="maroon">Hello!</font></a></sup> 12:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been looking for someone who can help with a question and I think you are the person to do it!! I have reciently joined the Wikipedia world as a way to promote my favorite women's college that is no longer a women's college, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_University_for_Women_5e18.html" title="Mississippi University for Women">Mississippi University for Women</a>. Last night I created a category for similar schools, and I'm not sure exactly what to call it. Currently its called Category:Women's Colleges that are Coeducational but it has been suggested that since that name is a contradiction of terms it should be something else. I would be interested in hearing your opinion. Thank you in advance, <a href="../../../m/u/w/User%7EMUW_Fan_d885.html" title="User:MUW Fan">MUW Fan</a> 21:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw your category and template and hesitated to suggest any changes to it because I wasn't sure where you were going with it at the time. I agree that the title for both the category and template should be <i>Former women's universities and colleges in the United States</i>, but I would advise you against changing it yet because the discussion is still active. Aside from that, welcome to Wikipedia, and I hope you'll be able to bring some unbiased, non-promotional/POV material to the project. Let me know if you need any help along the way. <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBeginning_2e6d.html" title="User:Beginning">Beginning</a> 20:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
