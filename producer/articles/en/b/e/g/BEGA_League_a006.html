	    <p>The BEGA League are a fictional group of characters for the popular <a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyblade.html" title="Beyblade">Beyblade</a> <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a> series. BEGA League only appear during the third season, are are seen by fans as the enemy for aiding Boris. The team consists of Garland, Brooklyn, Ming Ming, Mystel and Crusher.</p>
<p>After the World Championship in the <a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyblade_G-Revolution_39b2.html" title="Beyblade G-Revolution">3rd season</a> in the anime series, Boris Balkov, the enemy and "bad guy" in the first season buys the whole BBA and renames it as BEGA. He tries to make <a href="../../../t/y/s/Tyson_Granger_839a.html" title="Tyson Granger">Tyson Granger</a> and his friends think that he has changed, but after the battle between <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demolition_Boys_ba41.html#Tala_Valkov_.28Yuriy_Ivanov.29" title="Demolition Boys">Tala</a> and Garland from the BEGA organization, he and his friends come to the conclusion that he hasn't changed. Tyson and his friends go on to fight in the Justice 5 Tournament in which the most shocking news is that <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kai_Hiwatari_4731.html" title="Kai Hiwatari">Kai Hiwatari</a> has joined BEGA with Tyson's brother, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiro_Granger_53e4.html" title="Hiro Granger">Hiro</a>. Tyson's brother trains the BEGA bladers as they turn out be a big surprise for the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Bladebreakers.html" title="Bladebreakers">G-revolution</a> ( the new name for the re-formed Bladebreakers). Kai joins the G-revolution when he loses to Brooklyn, the most powerful blader of BEGA, in the preliminaries. The BEGA league or the BEGA bladers have 5 members namely Ming-Ming, Crusher, Mystel, Garland and Brooklyn. Tyson and his friends have a very tough battle during the Justice 5 Tournament. Daichi loses to Ming-Ming, Ray loses to Crusher, Max ties with Mystel, Kai wins over Brooklyn and Tyson wins over Garland. This tie between the two teams is to be resolved by a tie breaking match between Tyson and Brooklyn. Brooklyn goes crazy after losing to Kai and during his and Tyson's fight, they both float into the air and destroy a lot of the surrounding area. Sometime during the fight, the rest of the bladers call out their bit beasts to help Tyson. Tala wakes up from his coma calling out Wolborg and Kai(who is standing very dangerously on top of a pillar) revivifies Dranzer who had been destroyed in defeating Brooklyn. Eventually, Tyson calms Brooklyn down and they come to a conclusion that they will blade in the most simple way as the BEGA loses its power and BBA regains its status but in a smaller and a simpler way.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/g/BEGA_League_a006.html" title="Edit section: Ming Ming">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ming Ming</span></h2>
<p>Ming Ming has two sides to her. The seemingly innocent teen who wants mostly to be a famous pop star and Ming, the older version of herself which she transforms into in battle. Her bitbeast gives her this transformation ability. Like Crusher, she was blackmailed by Boris Balkov and has to work hard to keep her place in BEGA. She may not look strong but in battle she is a fierce competitor; her strength and determination come from her dream to be a pop star. She does have a wicked side to her, but it is soon overcome by emotion when she realises working under Boris' wing is the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>Ming Ming usually likes to sing with her band during her Beyblade matches. Most of her opponents seem to think this is her way of distracting them, but in reality she uses it as a way to concentrate. Ming Ming does seem very self absorbed during the series, but when she and Crusher were sent to smash <a href="../../../t/y/s/Tyson_Granger_839a.html" title="Tyson Granger">Tyson Granger</a>'s beyblade so that he couldn't compete against Brooklyn, she realised that cheating is completely wrong, and called off her beyblade from the attack.</p>
<p><a name="Brooklyn" id="Brooklyn"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/g/BEGA_League_a006.html" title="Edit section: Brooklyn">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brooklyn</span></h2>
<p>Brooklyn is the strongest competitor in the series which Tyson has to face. He is a naturally good Beyblader and doesn't need to try in order to win. There are two sides to his personality. First, the calm and seemingly gentle side and then the wild, vicious side. Like Tyson he is at one with his bitbeast, but Brooklyn forms physical traits of his bitbeast, for instance wings form on his back that reflect his bitbeast Zeus's wings.</p>
<p>His childhood reflected strongly in his personatily. Because he always won, the other children did not want to play with him, so he was often left alone. During Brooklyn's Beyblade match with Tyson, because of Kai defeating him, he has turned a little insane. Brooklyn has always beybladed using only his natural ability, and because that was good enough to win he never put much energy into his matches. He realises that by using combined power and his abilites, he could create much more damage. He someone manages to create a black hole that sucks himself, Tyson and all the people spectating into his mind. He only calms down once Tyson explains to him the true meaning of Beyblading.</p>

Garland</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Garland is a confident blader who aims to be a champion of the BEGA league. He came from a family of many sports players, all his brothers and sisters have been champions in their sports except him. He chose Beyblading to follow his dream of becoming champion like them. He is proud of his Siebald family name and fights for it. He is arrogant at times due to his confidence and underestimates bladers such as Tyson.</p>
<p>Garland follows his families principles of winning during his Beyblade match against Tyson. He first appeared by defeating both Bryan and Spencer of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demolition_Boys_ba41.html" title="Demolition Boys">Demolition Boys</a> at once, indicating his powerful Beyblade. He was so strong and aggressive during his beyblade match against Tala Valkov of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demolition_Boys_ba41.html" title="Demolition Boys">Demolition Boys</a> that he put him into hopital. Garland realises during Tyson's match against Brooklyn that although BEGA work together, they aren't a true team.</p>
<p><a name="Mystel" id="Mystel"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/g/BEGA_League_a006.html" title="Edit section: Mystel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mystel</span></h2>
<p>Mystel is quite a mysterious character by nature as quoted from a Beyblade episode "The Mysterious Mystel" and is seen to be quite quirky. His style of dress gives the impression he could be of Egyptian nationality. He spends his time in high places lurking around his team mates whenever they need to meet. He has strange abilities that makes it seem like he can float in mid-air. Water is his element and he uses it well.</p>
<p>Mystel is a nice guy all round. He appears to have befriended <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Kon_e470.html" title="Ray Kon">Ray Kon</a> and the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Tigers_%28Beyblade%29_6e79.html" title="White Tigers (Beyblade)">White Tigers (Beyblade)</a> when he first appears. He nearly persuaded ray to join BEGA. Mystel seems to have a very free spirit, and is a very happy person. He is believed to be the youngest of the team.</p>
<p>Though Mystel looks and dresses Egyptain-like, he is of Greek nationality.His Bit-Beast Poisedon should have given that away seeing as Poisedon is a Greek god, not Egyptain.</p>
