<p>The etymology of the names <b>Beghard</b> and <b>Beguine</b> can only be conjectured. Most likely they are derived from the old Flemish word <i>beghen</i>, in the sense of "to pray", not "to beg", for neither of these communities were at any time mendicant orders; maybe from <a href="../../../b/e/g/Bega.html" title="Bega">Bega</a>, the patron saint of <a href="../../../n/i/v/Nivelles.html" title="Nivelles">Nivelles</a>, where, according to a doubtful tradition the first Beguinage was established; maybe, again, from <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambert_le_B%C3%A8gue_df0d.html" title="Lambert le Bègue">Lambert le Bègue</a>, a priest of <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge.html" title="Liège">Liège</a> who died in <a href="../../../1/1/8/1180.html" title="1180">1180</a>, after having expended a fortune in founding in his native town a cloister and church for the widows and orphans of crusaders.</p>

<p>As early as the commencement of the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> there were women in the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a> who lived alone, and without taking vows devoted themselves to prayer and good works. At first there were not many of them, but as the century grew older their numbers increased; it was the age of the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>, and the land teemed with desolate women—the raw material for a host of neophytes. These solitaries made their homes not in the forest, where the true hermit loves to dwell, but on the fringe of the town, where their work lay, for they attended to the poor. About the beginning of the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a> some of them grouped their cabins together, and the community thus formed was the first <b><a href="../../../b/e/g/Beguinage.html" title="Beguinage">Beguinage</a></b>.</p>
<p>The Beguine could hardly be called a <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nun.html" title="Nun">nun</a>; she took no vows, could return to the world and wed if she would, and did not renounce her property If she was without means she neither asked nor accepted alms, but supported herself by manual labour, or by teaching the children of burghers. During the time of her novitiate she lived with "the Grand Mistress" of her cloister, but afterwards she had her own dwelling, and, if she could afford it, was attended by her own servants. The same aim in life, kindred pursuits, and community of worship were the ties which bound her to her companions.</p>
<p>There was no mother-house, nor common rule, nor common general of the order; every community was complete in itself and fixed its own order of living, though later on many adopted the rule of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscans.html" title="Franciscans">Third Order</a> of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Francis_79e4.html" title="Saint Francis">Saint Francis</a>. These communities were no less varied as to the social status of their members; some of them only admitted ladies of high degree; others were exclusively reserved for persons in humble circumstances; others again opened their doors wide to women of every condition, and these were the most densely peopled. Several, like the great Beguinage of <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghent.html" title="Ghent">Ghent</a>, numbered their inhabitants by thousands.</p>
<p>Such was this semi-monastic institution. Admirably adapted to the spiritual and social needs of the age which produced it, it spread rapidly throughout the land and soon began to exercise a profound influence on the religious life of the people. Each of these institutions was an ardent centre of <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a>, and it was not the monks, who mostly dwelt on the countryside, nor even the secular clergy, but the Beguines, the Beghards, and the sons of Saint Francis who moulded the thought of the urban population of the Netherlands. There was a Beguinage at <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechlin.html" title="Mechlin">Mechlin</a> as early as <a href="../../../1/2/0/1207.html" title="1207">1207</a>, at <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> in <a href="../../../1/2/4/1245.html" title="1245">1245</a>, at <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvain.html" title="Louvain">Louvain</a> in <a href="../../../1/2/3/1234.html" title="1234">1234</a>, at <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruges.html" title="Bruges">Bruges</a> in <a href="../../../1/2/4/1244.html" title="1244">1244</a>, and by the close of the century there was hardly a commune in the Netherlands without its Beguinage, whilst several of the great cities had two or three or even more.</p>
<p>As the 13th century progressed they tended to become <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mystics</a> and relied less and less on their own labour, often turning to begging instead. In some cases, this shift toward mysticism caused problems for the Beguines. For example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marguerite_Porete_ae56.html" title="Marguerite Porete">Marguerite Porete</a>, a French Beguine and mystic, was burned at the stake in Paris in 1310. She was condemned by the church for heresy and accused of being a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Spirit_2b3d.html" title="Free Spirit">Free Spirit</a>. She was finally condemned and executed for her refusal to remove her book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mirror_of_Simple_Souls_910b.html" title="The Mirror of Simple Souls">The Mirror of Simple Souls</a></i> from circulation.</p>
<p>By the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a> some communities were absorbed by monastic and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mendicant_order.html" title="Mendicant order">mendicant orders</a>, and others developed into <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flagellant.html" title="Flagellant">Flagellants</a> or other practices considered heretical. In <a href="../../../1/3/1/1311.html" title="1311">1311</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_V_d233.html" title="Pope Clement V">Pope Clement V</a> accused the Beguines of spreading heresy, and they were persecuted under <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXII_2681.html" title="Pope John XXII">John XXII</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Urban_V_21b7.html" title="Pope Urban V">Urban V</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_XI_1ff9.html" title="Pope Gregory XI">Gregory XI</a>. They were rehabilitated in the <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a> by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Eugene_IV_9b21.html" title="Pope Eugene IV">Eugene IV</a>. Most of these institutions were suppressed during the religious troubles of the 16th century or during the stormy years which closed the 18th, but a few convents of Beguines persisted until the early 20th century in parts of Belgium, among them those of Bruges, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lier%2C_Belgium_223f.html" title="Lier, Belgium">Lier</a>, Mechlin, Louvain, and Ghent, which last numbered nearly a thousand members in 1905; the last Beguine of Belgium died in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, in <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnhout.html" title="Turnhout">Turnhout</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/g/Beguines_and_Beghards_4f96.html" title="Edit section: Beghards">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beghards</span></h2>
<p>The widespread religious revival of which the Beguinage was the outcome brought forth also about the same time several kindred societies for men. Of these the <b>Beghards</b> were the most widespread and the most important. The Beghards were all of them laymen, and like the Beguines, they were not bound by vows, the rule of life which they observed was not uniform, and the members of each community were subject only to their own local superiors; but, unlike them, they had no private property; the brethren of each cloister had a common purse, dwelt together under one roof, and ate at the same board.</p>
<p>They were for the most part, though not always, men of humble origin—weavers, dyers, fullers, and so forth—and thus they were intimately connected with the city craft-guilds. Indeed, no man could be admitted to the Beghards' convent at Brussels unless he were a member of the Weavers' Company, and this was in all probability not a unique case. The Beghards were often men to whom fortune had not been kind—men who had outlived their friends, or whose family ties had been broken by some untoward event, and who, by reason of failing health or advancing years, or perhaps on account of some accident, were unable to stand alone. If, as a recent writer has it, "the medieval towns of the Netherlands found in the Beguinage a solution of their feminine question", the establishment of these communities afforded them at least a partial solution of another problem which pressed for an answer: the difficult problem of how to deal with the worn-out workingman.</p>
<p>Albeit the main object of all these institutions was not a temporal but a spiritual one, they had banded together in the first place to build up the inner man. While working out their own salvation they remained mindful of their neighbours in the world, and thanks to their intimate connexion with the craft-guilds, they were able to largely influence the religious life, and to a great extent moulded the religious opinion of the cities and towns of the Netherlands, at all events in the case of the proletariat, during more than two hundred years.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the wretched and down-trodden class from which the Beghards were generally recruited, and the fact that they were so little trammelled by ecclesiastical control, it is not surprising that the mysticism of some of them presently became a sort of mystical <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheism.html" title="Pantheism">pantheism</a>, or that some of them gradually developed opinions not in harmony with the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, opinions, indeed, if we may trust <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Ruysbroeck_e652.html" title="John of Ruysbroeck">John of Ruysbroeck</a>, which seem to have differed little from the religious and political opinions professed by <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchists.html" title="Anarchists">anarchists</a> of later centuries. Such heretical tendencies of the Beghards and Beguines provoked disciplinary measures, sometimes severe, on the part of ecclesiastical authority. Various restrictions were placed upon them by the Synod of Fritzlar (1259), Mainz (1261), Eichstätt (1282); and they were forbidden as "having no approbation" by the Synod of Béziers (1299). They were condemned by the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Vienne_2071.html" title="Council of Vienne">Council of Vienne</a> (1312), but this sentence was mitigated by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_XXII_aa12.html" title="John XXII">John XXII</a> (1321), who permitted the Beguines, as they had mended their ways, to resume their mode of life. The Beghards were more obstinate and during the 14th century they were repeatedly condemned by the Holy See, the bishops (notably in Germany), and the Inquisition. Even the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> admits, on the other hand, that men of faith and piety were found among the Beghards. In their behalf <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_XI_70aa.html" title="Gregory XI">Gregory XI</a> (1374-77) and <a href="../../../b/o/n/Boniface_IX_82e8.html" title="Boniface IX">Boniface IX</a> (1394) addressed Bulls to the bishops of Germany and the Netherlands. An echo of the theological errors into which the Beghards fell is found in the doctrine of <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quietism_%28Christian_philosophy%29_c752.html" title="Quietism (Christian philosophy)">Quietism</a>.</p>

<p>Before the close of the Middle Ages Beghard communities were in full decline; they waned with the waning of the cloth trade, and, when that industry died, gradually dwindled away. The highest number of these medieval foundations in Belgium were 94. They were reduced (1734) to 34 and (1856) to 20. Their membership in 1631 was 2,487; in 1856, about 1,600; in 1828, 1,010;</p>
