<p>At present the term "vicious circle" is given as a synonym, though so far as I know the meaning of the term is entirely different. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>I think "vicious circle" means something different, something more akin to "self-fulfilling prophesy". For example, if you lack confidence, fewer people will like you, so you will lose confidence. It's a vicious circle.</p>
<p>Actually, I must correct myself: dictionary.com agrees with you that "vicious circle" has a logical definition, too.</p>

    Bob: How do you know that the Bible is the word of God.

We have (2) implies (1)

<p>How about someone putting in an -actual example- of the classical useage instead of just logical arguments that DO NOT show how this term was used and why it was improper. All this discussion is nice, but you don't show the term 'begging the question' in classical useage ANYWHERE. Which makes this page rather un-informative to people without PHD's in rhetoric.</p>

(1) Bob: Using science, logic, and reason is the only valid way

If Bob uses science, logic or reason to support the truth of (1), 
he is begging the question.

<p>Fowler, in <i>Modern English Usage</i>, distinguishes between <i>Begging the Question</i> and <i>Circular Argument</i> as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Arguing in a Circle: The basing of two conclusion each upon the other. That the world is good follows from the known goodness of God; that God is good is known from the excellence of the world he has made.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Petitio Principii or Begging the Question: 'assumption of the basis'. The fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself. Arguing in a circle (see above) is a common form of p.p. That foxhunting is not cruel, since the fox enjoys the fun &amp; that one must keep servants because all respectable people do so, are other examples of begging the question or p.p., in which the argument is not circular.</dd>

<dd>In other words, circular arguments are particular instances of <i>petitio principii</i>, but not all cases of begging the question involve circular arguments. -- <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicapica_4069.html" title="User:Picapica">Picapica</a> 09:44, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The OED says merely, "Taking for granted the thing to be proved." This is consistent with Merriam-Webster and the American Heritage Dictionaries: "Take for granted or assume the truth of the very thing being questioned" Fowler stands among only a handful (most citing Fowler) that suggest the meaning is actually "The fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself." The distinction is subtle but important. the OED/MW/AH position is that you judge a statement begging the question without knowledge of what the listener will believe. Fowler's suggests that the listener's willingness to believe determines whether the speaker is begging the question. This is much more commonly known as the Fallacy of many questions.</p>
<p>That point aside, I think you are mistaking the contrast in Fowler between begging the question and circular reasoning--mistaking in the sense of making one a subset of the other. Fowler distinguishes circular reasoning by a requirement of at least two arguments and two conclusions. Each conclusion uses the other in its premises. This is a pretty standard definition of circular reasoning but it is not a subset of begging the question. begging the question is distinguished by involving only one argument and conclusion. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefanbojark_9066.html" title="User:Stefanbojark">Stefanbojark</a> 02:18, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let me moderate that a bit. Further research brings up the question how one can count arguments. With one acception: a formal syllogism is well defined. Begging the question is appropriate against a single syllogism. Fowler suggestions that a charge of circular reasoning isn't. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefanbojark_9066.html" title="User:Stefanbojark">Stefanbojark</a> 03:02, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I think this page should not be a redirect from "circular reasoning" - there is clearly a need for both the pages. It also seems to me that the phrase "beg the question" is a turn of phrase that has come to be associated with a class of argument but is subject to variations in usage. On the otherhand "circular reasoning" (while also a turn of phrase etc...) is more descriptive and a invites a more literal interpretation. A reader can guess that involves something to do with reasoning and cirularity whereas in order to understand the usage of the phrase "beg the question" one has to know that it has nothing to do with begging and dosn't necessarily involve asking questions... --Wigi 04:57, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>(for discussion previously listed here see history)</p>
<p>I changed the article back to include the assertions of correctness. Incorrect common usage does not equal change of definition especially considering how recently this became common. Changing the meaning of a phrase (especially without need) makes communication very difficult. Since many people come to wikipedia as a reference it is best and accurate to maintain that there is a "correct" definition. There are those who may argue about the existence of "correctness" but that should be saved for philosophical debate. We should go on trying to maintain standard to protect the utility of language and not fragment it with colloquialisms.</p>
<p>We can and do mention common usage. That is certainly enough. We need not say that the common usage is now correct.</p>

<p>p.s. how many people would now like to change the pronunciation of nuclear to Nuk-u-lar since so many people say it incorrectly (including the president)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Catskul, you need to concede that one person's "correct" usage is merely opinion. It's not a philosophical debate; it's an established position within <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a>, which is a scientific discipline and thus excludes value judgements. Those who wring hands about "declining standards" are shown up by the fact that language change is inevitable (*when* is the timeless, perfect <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>? Is it <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_Century_16f1.html" title="19th Century">19th Century</a>? <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_Century_2cc3.html" title="11th Century">11th Century</a>?). Societal custom may impose certain views on certain usages (in this particular instance, the stigma would have to be pretty weak), but that can only be reported, not endorsed, as per NPOV. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 00:10, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Quite obviously, this is not is not an argument of "one person's usage". Lingusitics is a soft science, which does, in fact, (and should) include value judgements, but that is beyond the point. The length of time and the spread of the usage are open to debate in adopting a new accepted definition. I dont think that inclusion of the vernacular as being (just as) correct is based on any linguistic study or linguists' concensus which makes your insistance much more about opinion than my stance.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An important point about this use of the phrase is that it seems to come not from intentional re-use (a la popular use of the word cool) nor by abstraction or analogy (for instance using "sharp" to describe someone's intelligence). Rather it seems to have come about by observation of the use and then misused in a failed attempt to immitate writing or speaking style. Its unlikely for someone to have come up with an obscure phrasing like "begs the question" for the vernacular meaning, without haveing taken it from the expression referring to the logical falacy. It can be further argued that misuse of the phrase which might otherwise be harmless degrades the ability to communicate the original meaning which is a valid point against its use.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you want to argue about the utility of calling something correct or incorrect, then I maintain that this is a philosophical debate as one could always argue that there is no such thing as correct. One typically looks to the history of language to determine standards to base the lable of correctness. I will therefore hold the assertion of correctness based on the history and the utility of maintaining the longer held definition.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will wait a bit for you to respond and discuss this with you further before I make an attempt to re-insert the assertions of correctness.

<dd>Actually it is. The consensus among virtually all linguists (as opposed to amateur language pundits) is that there is no linguistic basis for the supposed superiority of some dialects/usages over others. It is of course possible that there may be some utility in attempting to standardise usage (although it is usually a futile effort), but there is no striaghtforward linguistic basis for choosing between usages. Therefore, (a linguist might say), while its perhaps reasonable to define Standard English, it's not reasonable to call non-standard English "incorrect" — it's just non-standard, in the same sense, for example, that certain sizes of screw are non-standard.</dd>

<dd>So have a great number of expressions in Standard English. In fact, I think that the common (mis)usage of "begging the question" stems from the fact that its actual literal meaning is something like "this inevitably raises the question". The standard usage is far more idiomatic, stemming from a rather far-fetched etymology, and therefore anyone who did not know the idiom would naturally go for the nonstandard interpretation.</dd>

<dd>Right, but that's just your POV. Other people (e.g. academic linguists) have a different POV. NPOV requires, therefore, that we don't call any useage incorrect or correct, but rather explain the range of opinion regarding that useage (which of course includes the opinion that it is straightforwardly incorrect). <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 01:13, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One more thing. There is, so far as I know, no Wikipedia policy which prevents "philosophical" issues being introduced on articles which are not explicitly about philosophy. Therefore, even if you are correct that the argument for not making value judgements about usage is in some sense "philosophical", this does not work very well as a justification for not mentioning that argument in the article. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 01:24, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>By extension of your argument, then, I could say that there is also no such thing as "correct" or "incorrect" spelling, only standard and nonstandard. However,"correct" and "incorrect" are used as useful lables to guide standardization. Quite obviously the meaning of "true" or "false" cannot be used for this meaning of correct and incorrect in as much as I couldnt say "the sky" is false or "an elephant" is true. If you look at the definitions of "correct" you will see that "conforming to standard" is one of the listed meanings. Calling something incorrect in this context is only a stronger form of calling it non-standard.</dd>

<dd>Personally, I would like to stick to calling it incorrect. Resistance to calling it incorrect seems more POV to me than otherwise, in this case cosidering what I am trying to argue. It seems the resistance is simply about the connotation of the words "correct" and "incorrect". Whereas most people who want to know if something is correct or not are really looking to find what the standard is, those who understand the concepts behind "correctness" would be willing to use with "incorrect" usage if that was their intention. In that respect, this article serves all who would use it by use of the lables "correct" and incorrect"</dd>

<dd>If we cannot agree, I am willing to concede to something like calling it non-standard, and mentioning that it will be regarded as incorrect by those who are aware of the more formal meaning. I would consider this a bit silly, however, since incorrect and non-standard are simply varying degrees of the same thing in this context. Since this is a community encyclopedia we cannot assert authority, and Im sure the arguement in the future regardless of what the outcome is presently.

<dd>Spelling isn't really analagous. All adults without actual mental disabilities speak fluently and grammatically in their own dialect(s), as any linguist will tell you. However, it is not the case that every adult has mastered a particular orthographic system — people who spell words incorrectly are in fact spelling words incorrectly — they are not using some other, less privaledged, <i>system</i> of spelling. Virtually everybody is innately competant in spoken language, but written language is a different matter.</dd>

<dd>Except that in this context, "incorrect" refers to non-standard. I imagine that there are useages within BEV that are considered to be incorrect, or non-standard. You might see this in sub-urban culture where highschool students attempt to use BEV and mis-use it. BEV is its own dialect, and that said does not conform to American English standards, in some cases changing grammar as well. Many things within BEV can be said to be incorrect in the context of American English but correct in the context of BEV. However, a dialect system and a single divergent usage are not the same.</dd>

<dd>The problem essentially lies with the equation of "standard" with "correct". Wherever a prescriptivist grammarian would say "incorrect", a linguist will say "non-standard". And of course, standards are not invariant either: manuals of style, prescriptive grammars, etc. will differ. Standard English was different 200, 100, or 50 years ago, and there are slight regional variations. Because BEV is not a prestige variety, with the backing of governments, authors, etc. no-one's really interested in standardising it. It is impossible to say what makes "correct" BEV - you could make an attempt as characterising something as characteristically BEV, but there's hardly going to be a black William Safire poking speakers if their version is inconsistent with his, since he can't appeal to authority to say that he's better or more correct. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Lacrimosus</a> 23:28, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you wish to use incorrect in that sense, then you must qualify it (e.g. "incorrect Standard English"). Personally, I think that "non-standard" is more parsimonious, and carries fewer misleading connotations. Why do you feel the need for a "stronger" term than non-standard? What is the extra meaning that you wish "incorrect" to convey? So far as I can see, it can only be some kind of predjudice against non-standard varieties of English.</dd>

<p>It's worth pointing out that we are talking about a misuse of a phrase, not a spelling error or a whole dialect.

<dd>Misuse according to whom? Wikipedia is not affiliated to any particular authority on English usage. The supposedly incorrect meaning of the phrase is perfectly coherent if you read it literally (parallel, for example to "he was practically begging to get expelled"). The existence of the two common usages should be noted, along with various opinions on which (if any) is preferable/correct. Ironically enough, your argument begs the question in the traditional sense. You wish to convince us that one usage of "begging the question" is a misuse, and you begin by stating without argument that it is a misuse. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 22:06, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this is not one of life's big issues for me, so I won't interferer too much; indeed, I have no wish to convince you, as you claim, of a misuse of the language - if you can't see that it is a misuse, then tough luck to you, perhaps you should have chosen better teachers.</dd>
<dd>Nor is the analogy with English usage in ethnic subgroups relevant, unless you wish to claim there is an ethnic minority consisting of semi-literate reporters and columnists. That the phrase appears coherent is also irrelevant.</dd>
<dd>The authority you question is several hundred years worth of English usage. To beg the question is to commit a particular logical fallacy, and the phrase is needed in order to refer to that fallacy. This is and ought to remain the primary use for the phrase. You ignore the pedagogic function of an encyclopedia. There <i>are</i> standards for spelling and usage in English; they are taught from infancy through primary school and upward, and used throughout the Wiki. It is important to explain the fallacy, and the meaning of the phrase.</dd>
<dd>Now, read carefully what I am advocating: <i>the new usage should be noted in the article and nothing more</i> - it certainly does not deserve equal status to what I call the correct usage. I did not say that it should be described as a misuse, although I did say that I think it is indeed a misuse. As Marcus Aurelius put it, "People should not be sharply corrected for bad grammar, pronunciation or provincialism; it is better to introduce the proper expression tactfully oneself, in one's reply" Hopefully you will now see that I do not wish much that is different from your own desire. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 09:12, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You misunderstand the purpose of the analogy. The point is that different people (either in ethnic/social/economic groups or as individuals — it doesn't matter) use words and phrases in different ways. There is no principled way of deciding which people are using a phrase in the correct way. There are, to be sure, a small number of people with mental disabilities who are unable to learn to speak any language fluently. Everyone else is able to speak a perfectly systematic and grammatical language, and while it may be useful to standardise certain patterns of usage, it is pointless to be dogmatic and inflexible about what is "correct" and "incorrect". Standardisation can at most be a very limited and pragmatic affair (limited, because it would be impossible to write anything remotely approaching a comprehensive grammar and lexicon of English).
<dl>

<p>I'm not sure where this fits in to the discussion of the fallacy, but the entry really ought to clarify what begging the question <i>means</i>. To beg the question is to make a statement that leaves something important out. It is <b>not</b> another way of saying "raising the question", it means "<i>not</i> raising the obvious question", or "<i>not</i> answering the actual question". <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 07:25, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, Tannin, I thought the article dealt with the more recent version of the meaning of the phrase rather well. My inclination would be simply to say that it was a bastardisation, and shouldn’t be in the encyclopaedia. Instead the article points out how it relates to the circularity, and goes some way to showing how this misuse of the term came to be popular. I can accept that. But I would hate to see the disappearance of the old meaning – what I would call the <i>correct</i> meaning. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 11:37, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Are you suggesting that the description of the colloquial (contemporary? commonly used?) definition in the article is inverted, Tannin? Or have I misunderstood? If I haven't, I agree with you and wonder what was wrong with the title I suggested. <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 11:43, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well the entry <i>does</i> say: <i>In popular usage, however, the phrase is often taken to be synonymous with "raising the question"</i>, which is clearly incorrect. We really need to do something about that. This isn't a case of alternative meanings where a phrase can mean a couple of different things, it's a case of just plain wrong. Wikipedia is better than that. Well ... it ought to be. ;) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<p>(PS: who is being confrontational, for the love of Mike? It sure ain't me. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, no-one then, clearly :-) I was just whingeing a bit about how you'd phrased the title. Be happy. <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 17:20, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>PPS: There is no "more recent definition". So far as the phrase goes (as opposed to the debating trick or logical fallacy) to the best of my knowledge, there is only the corrrect meaning; the other usage (meaning "asking the question") is just something ill-educated people sometimes say when they are trying to sound better-educated than they really are. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>There's some truth in that. However, it's still widely used, even if only ironically or jokingly. <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 17:25, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So wait, am I the only one who thinks that this ceases to become a simply a logic thing, and that the concept (and therefore the article) has entered partially into the realm of linguistics? Shouldn't it be a little kinder to those who use it in a different way? Let's check out the line "Such usage is seen to be incorrect." Who sees this as incorrect? Logic peeps? Cause I'm pretty sure linguistics peeps wouldn't say that. It be on its to being just another expression (even if ill-educated people use it. They speak too, and you can't just ignore that and call it wrong). Can language not be allowed to evolve? You get what I'm sayin' here? Just seems like you are dissin' anyone who has ever used it 'wrong.' I'd also like to say I'm scared shizzless to be arguing with folks who are fond of _logic_.

<p>There is another usage of "begging the question" I have come across-in Isaac Newton's discussion of a proposed explanation of elasticity-the proposal posited "springs" that connected molecules. Newton pointed out this "Begs the Question" by explaining springiness of macroscopic objects in terms of springiness of microscopic objects. Apparently Newton felt that this was just postponing a real explanation for elasticity. This kind of "begging the question doesn't seem circular to me.--Richard Peterson 21:15, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That sounds to me like the (disputed) meaning given right at the bottom of the article, where "the phrase has nothing to do with arguments in logic at all and merely refers to raising an issue." <a href="../../../r/_/l/User%7ER_Lowry_a00e.html" title="User:R Lowry">R Lowry</a> 22:30, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is a sense of “begging the question” that means roughly failing to address the issue. Newton meant that in explaining the springiness of big things by saying the stuff they are made of is springy, one has not actually explained what it is to be springy. Indeed, this sense does not appear in the article. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 02:47, Apr 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, since Newton was not "badly educated", the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescriptive_grammar.html" title="Prescriptive grammar">prescriptive linguists</a> will probably not decree his usage to be "incorrect" ;) <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 11:22, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whether this statement is true really depends on <b>how</b> you prove each assertion. They both can be proved in about 10 seconds using a short yet convincing argument with ellipses (<tt>...</tt>). For example:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>= (1/2)(244)(245) = 29890.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If you want more mathematical rigor, they can still both be proved equally easily using <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addition.html" title="Addition">summation notation</a>.

<dd>Search on google for "begging the question" and click the define link and you'll get <a href="http://www.answers.com/begging+the+question&amp;r=67" class="external free" title="http://www.answers.com/begging+the+question&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/begging+the+question&amp;r=67</a> . Interestingly, that page also has the Wikipedia page for "begging the question" on it. Anyhow, they give the The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms definition of BtQ:
<dl>
<dd>"Take for granted or assume the truth of the very thing being questioned. For example, Shopping now for a dress to wear to the ceremony is really begging the question—she hasn't been invited yet. This phrase, whose roots are in Aristotle's writings on logic, came into English in the late 1500s. <b>In the 1990s, however, people sometimes used the phrase as a synonym of 'ask the question' (as in The article begs the question: 'What are we afraid of?').</b>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This is the way our page should be. It lists the definition of BtQ in logic, then mentions how this differs from the popular usage, without saying outright that the common usage is wrong. People almost certainly shouldn't use the phrase to mean, "raising the question," since we already have a perfectly good way to say that, namely, "raising the question." However, it is Wikipedia's policy not to take sides on <i>anything</i>. Not only does Wikipedia not say that 9-11 was terrorism, they don't even say that the Holocaust was wrong. That's just the way Wikipedia is. Every claim about the correct way to do things must be prefaced by, "this group claims this is right, but that group disagrees." It kind of stinks that Wikipedia has to say, "Most people consider the Holocaust to be evil," instead of "the Holocaust was evil," but that's just the way it has to be.

<dd>I've already explained this to you. When a phrase changes its meaning, you loose the ability to express its original meaning using that phrase, and gain the ability to express another meaning, so there is no net loss. It is entirely possible to express the concept of begging the question without using that particular phrase. To be sure, some subtleties of connotation may be lost, but the same goes for "raising the questions" vs. "begging the question" (nonstandard use).
<dl>

<dd>I didn't say that there was a replacement phrase, but the concept is expressible. "circular argument", or "petitioning the premise" (not sure if I remembered that right...) cover most cases. And you get a useful, stronger form or "raising the question" (the nonstandard meaning of "begging the question" is not an exact synonim for this). In any case, the new usage of "begging the question" is now so widespread that in practice you just <i>can't</i> use the phrase to refer to the logical fallacy without confusing the majority of your audience. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 01:10, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is unreasonable to ask for a descriptivist source on this specific issue. Descriptivists argue against prescription in general, and do not bother to discuss every single rule of usage ever proposed. I've added a reference to a good statement of the general descriptivist POV. Presumably you don't mind having all POVs on this issue included in the article, given that we already have three paragraphs explaining the prescriptivist POV.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 22:18, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That reference should be in an article on the general descriptivist POV, not in this article.

<dd>As I said, you're in no position to preach about reverting, and your comments on edit wars are childish.

This is because the first statement is making a much larger assumption than the death penalty statement, so has a much larger chance of being wrong (hence 'weaker argument'. There are a huge number of different intentional acts of killing a human being, so to condemn every one as being wrong makes for a weaker argument than just saying one is wrong. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 21:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read the discussion above with some sense of horror. It appears that we cannot say that an incorrect usage of the term "begging the question" is incorrect, because no use of language can ever be incorrect. But this seems absurd. The reason people use "begging the question" incorrectly is because, in general, they are ignorant of the actual meaning of the phrase. This is rather different from, say, calling the Police "the pigs." It would be absurd to say "it is incorrect to refer to the police as 'pigs,' because all police officers are, in fact, human beings." This would be absurd because the person using the phrase knows what a pig actually is, and is not using the word in this sense. But this isn't the case with this usage of "begging the question." For it to be an alternate usage, those using it have to be, at least in some sense, aware of the primary meaning, and how this came about. This is patently not the case with misuse of "begging the question," which is a technical term with a specific meaning that people who use it to mean "raise the question" are simply unaware of. Surely some kinds of lines have to be drawn, or else we are just encouraging stupidity and ignorance. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 02:28, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In a word, no! Somebody's standard of usage is just that - somebody's standard, and not necessarily somebody else's. Linguistics isn't interested in elevating some form of language over some other form, any more than a phycisist would be interested in "proving" that clockwise planetary revolution is inherently superior to counter-clockwise revolution. From NPOV, all we can say is: "this is the way certain people use this phrase, and this is the way certain other people use this phrase". We can note that it's assumed to be correct <i>from the point of view of</i> prescriptive grammar, but we can't simply state, in the absence of a scientific proof, that a given usage expresses ignorance. A linguist makes a note of usage conventions in the same way a sociologist describes clothing conventions: they analyse their effect in society, and the perceptions of the people who encounter them. We don't "encourage" "incorrect" usage any more than a sociologist advocates <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudism.html" title="Nudism">nudism</a>: we simply categorise and seek to explain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question is: how is it <i>provable</i> that people using "begging the question" to mean "raising the question" are wrong? They are using it <i>differently</i> from the traditional sense, but language always and in all places is subject to change which is often assumed to be the result of "ignorance". For example, a person might use the word "dilapidated" to describe a wooden shack, while being "ignorant" of the "original meaning" of <i>dilapidated</i>, which originated in "having thrown stones". A modern-day speaker of French is most likely "ignorant" of the fact that the <i>ne. . .pas</i> construction originally meant "not a step". Language use changes; that's a simple feature of human communication. Labelling a given change as ignorant may affect its societal approbation, but doesn't stop it from happening. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 03:24, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When it comes to language, "50 million Frenchmen can't be wrong." "Begging the question" has two meanings in English today. In technical fields, it means circular logic, but to the public at large, it means "raising an obvious question." If you try to pretend that the second usage isn't firmly entrenched you're just putting your head in the sand. It's impossible to be widely read and not see people using btq in the second sense. You may disapprove of it, but your disapproval is based on your own feelings about the merits of retaining the old usage, not the comprehensibility of the phrase. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, there's no such thing as correct or or incorrect, right or wrong. Wikipedia is just an observer, not a judge. We may all wish the second usage would die out, but we can't let our feelings override Wikipedia's neutrality. Back to your example, if people said "the cops are pags," then we could say "pag" is wrong, because no native English speaker uses the word "pag." However if they say " Cops aren't pigs. They're <i>bad</i>," with "bad" in the '80s sense of meaning "good" then all we can do is note that the usage is confusing, but not condemn it. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlj7_e64d.html" title="User:Carlj7">Carl</a> 04:34, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But the idea that there is no correct usage of language is itself a POV. At any rate, I agree that language usage does change, and that there is a fine line between an incorrect usage and a new meaning. But that doesn't mean that there are some things which can be described as an "incorrect usage" and which cannot appropriately be described as a "new meaning." Your pags example, for instance, is clearly well on that side of the line. While, say, my pigs example is clearly on the other side of the line. Use of the term "begging the question" is more vexed. Yes, it is used in the sense of "raises the question" to an unfortunate degree. On the other hand, while it might be pedantic, it isn't obviously absurd to say to someone who uses it in that sense, "that is an incorrect usage of the term 'begging the question.'" If that is the case, then it is obvious that it is at least arguable that there is such a thing as an incorrect usage, and that this, in particular, is an example of it. Which means that to just say "languages change, and there's no such thing as correct usage, so it's not wrong to say that 'begging the question' can mean 'raising the question'" is just as POV as to say, "it is incorrect usage to use the term 'begging the question' to mean 'raising the question.'" <i>Both</i> ways of going about it are clearly POV, and wikipedia can't simply subscribe to descriptivism because it seems on the surface to resemble NPOV policy. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 04:46, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All this "we must be descriptivist" stuff is a POV, and also wrong. This article is meaningless if it is a discussion of the colloquial phrase "begging the question". We don't have an article for every colloquial phrase. It only makes sense as a discussion of the logical fallacy <i>petitio principii</i>. It is worth noting that some people are ignorant of the logical fallacy, but the article shouldn't pretend that the two uses are equal, or give too much time to the colloquial and mistaken use.  :) — <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelpful_Dave_4207.html" title="User:Helpful Dave"><i>Helpful Dave</i></a> 09:51, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NPOV stands for <i>Neutral Point of View</i> not <i>No Point of View</i>. Obviously, No-POV is basically impossible, so, as the next best thing (well, besides actually knowing the truth), the Wikipedia just states what it is that everyone says about an issue and doesn't make judgments between them. Clearly, it's not worth having a whole Wikipedia article (as distinct from Wiktionary definition) about b.t.q. meaning "raises the question." So, it's fine for the article to focus almost exclusively on the meaning of the term within logic. But it's wrong for the article to declare that anyone who uses the term differently from how it's used in logic is incorrect. That's the kind of judgment that doesn't fall under the rubric of neutral. It's fine for <a href="../../../k/o/a/Koala_bear.html" title="Koala bear">Koala bear</a> to point out that saying "bear" is <i>technically</i> incorrect since koalas aren't bears, but it would be wrong for "Koala bear" to say that "Koala bear" is incorrect and leave it at that, since koala bear is perfectly valid English. It's just bad biology, that's all. In normal usage, "begging the question" is usually used in a way that's synonymous with "raising the question." You did it yourself John, as a joke I suspect. All the article needs to specify is that this usage is different from the usage used within logic and frowned upon by people who think it's a waste of a perfectly good phrase. Other people feel differently. End of story. No need to try to asset what's correct or incorrect. People aren't dumb, if you tell them it's frowned upon, they'll figure out whether to consider it incorrect in their own minds by themselves. They don't need our coaching for that. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlj7_e64d.html" title="User:Carlj7">Carl</a> 10:09, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Language changes all the time. It's useless to complain that "gay" really means "happy". More recently, it's become useless to complain that "hooking up" with a friend really means getting together or meeting with that person, rather than having sex with them. The modern usage of "to beg the question" has in fact now become the dominant meaning, and <i>ipso facto</i> in a certain very definite sense it cannot be considered incorrect. Language is not morality after all... murder would still be wrong even if a majority voted in favor of it, but language usage involves no such sacrosanct principles.

<p>Curps, et al - of course, there is no easy way to draw the line. But that doesn't mean that one can't say that some usages are clearly wrong. To assert that a usage is right <i>only</i> because it is the main one used is, in fact, a POV - a descriptivist POV. I think the annoyance over this particular usage is because a) it confuses the meaning of an actually useful term, to no apparent gain; and b) its use seems to arise largely out of a sort of pretentious ignorance - that is to say, people use it because it sounds more sophisticated than "raises the question," but the only reason it sounds more sophisticated than raises the question is because of a vague awareness, without actual understanding, of the philosophical meaning. At any rate, I will once again assert that linguistic pedantry is a POV with a longer pedigree than descriptivism, and I will demand, again, that while NPOV is wikipedia policy, descriptivism is not, despite some superficial similarities between the two. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 15:21, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, and that POV should be mentioned in the article. No-one is suggesting that the entire article should be written from that POV, as you seem to be implying.

We need to have both POVs in the article, which means that we can't just label the modern usage incorrect without qualificiation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(Somewhat offtopic). A good part of the reason why people "pretentiously" use impressive-sounding phrases without being aware of their standard meaning is because they want to impress prescriptivist language snobs. If people would only focus more on what people said than how they said it, perhaps people would be encouraged to speak more directly. It's quite often the case that certain words or phrases have a dual status as techincal vocabulary and ordinary usage (e.g. "momentum", "chaos", "postmodern", "fish"). It goes both ways: sometimes ordinary usage gets turned into technical vocabulary, and sometimes technical vocabulary gets adopted as part of ordinary usage. In both cases, there is usually a change in meaning — possibly out of ignorance, or possibly because technical writing and everyday conversation don't find the same meanings useful. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 15:50, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing wrong with not knowing obscure vocabulary. But <i>misusing</i> obscure vocabulary is something else again, especially in writing. (Much can be forgiven in speech. But articles titled things like "Dog's Illness begs the Question: How can you save money on car insurance?" are unforgiveable) At any rate, I am also not saying that the colloquial definition should not be mentioned. Obviously it should at least be mentioned. And I don't think the article is bad. But it is tilted a bit towards the descriptivist POV. (I'll also note that some of the discussion was just wrong, as the claim in the history section that the "literal meaning" of begging the question means raising the question, which is ridiculous). At any rate, would it be POV to describe the "raising the question" usage as a "colloquial usage"? This seems an admirable compromise to me. Since prescriptivism and descriptivism generally differ in how they view colloquial expressions, this acknowledges the point of contention without taking either side. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 15:52, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me add that in all the usages you mention - momentum, chaos, postmodern, fish - the technical and the ordinary usage are fairly closely related to one another, although there are obviously differences. In this case, the "ordinary" usage has nothing to do with the technical usage. Let me add that our page on <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momentum.html" title="Momentum">momentum</a> is about the physics term, with only a very brief notice about the "figurative usage." And that most of the other cases you mention (except postmodern) seem to be instances of normal usage becoming technical, rather than vice versa (and this may be true of momentum as well). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 15:57, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, this seems to be something of a retreat from the more general criticisms you were making earlier.

<dd><i>the claim in the history section that the "literal meaning" of begging the question means raising the question, which is ridiculous</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is? As I think I said somewhere above, it's parallel to cases such as "John was begging to get punched". If not from the literal meaning, where does the popular usage come from? It's certainly closer to the literal meaning of the phrase than the standard meaning is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>At any rate, would it be POV to describe the "raising the question" usage as a "colloquial usage"? This seems an admirable compromise to me.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure. Colloquial has some inappropriate connotations (for example, that the usage is restricted to uneducated people, or informal conversation). I think "popular" and "non-standard" are better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree on your points re technical and popular usage, but I don't see how they are relavent. Usually the techincal usage and popular usage are somewhat analagous, but there is no reason why that should be taken as a condition on legitimate usage. The technical usage of "normal" in physics, for example, is completely unrelated to the popular usage, but neither is considered incorrect. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 16:22, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The modern usage is not colloquial. In most of the cases where people use the modern meaning, including newspaper articles or headlines, they are not intending to be colloquial (as they would if they used the word "ain't" for humorous effect, for instance). I think most of them believe that it is the standard meaning, or sometimes the only meaning they are aware of. (And yes I ended that sentence with a preposition)</p>
<p>With all due respect, when you use the phrases "gets me so angry" and "unforgivable" to describe your motivations for editing the article, you are letting your emotions get the better of you. You are looking high and low to find a pretext to somehow include a condemnation of the modern usage in the article.</p>
<p>Encyclopedia articles by their very nature aim to describe things (as opposed to signed opinion pieces, or essays, or other advocacy). Opinionated writing certainly has its place, even in articles that mainly try to be informative (for instance, <i>The Economist</i> or earlier editions of the <i>Encyclopedia Brittanica</i>). The problem is, Wikipedia cannot adopt any such opinionated "house style", because of its very nature as a resource that anyone can edit. The only way to achieve any kind of consensus is to require a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>. What you are trying to portray as a descriptivist POV is in fact pretty much official Wikipedia policy.</p>

<p>Curps - I certainly do not demand a condemnation of modern usage. But I do not wish to see the article explicitly condone modern usage, either, when there is a large group of people who feel that this usage is incorrect. Cadr - yes, my most recent comment did <i>seem</i> to be backing down a little. There's a few reasons for this - first, my initial comment was more in reaction to the earlier arguments here on the talk page than to the article itself, which does a better job of it, I think. Second, I was, I think, being a bit purposefully argumentative. I more wanted to get the ball rolling on debate than to actually express my view, which is certainly not (<i>pace</i> Curps) that Wikipedia should condemn modern usage. My degree of personal anger or irritation at this, while real, is not terribly high - I am not a philosopher or logician, and I rarely use the term, over all (although I try to avoid using it incorrectly). As to technical vs. everyday use of words - certainly, there are instances where the technical meaning bears very little relation to the everday meaning. In almost all such cases, though, the technical meaning was the derivative term. It is not as though the physics meaning of "normal" came first, and then people, knowing that "normal" was a fancy physics term, made up a meaning for it that was unrelated. As to "colloquial," I agree that this doesn't seem quite right. That said, I shall fish around for another issue so as to satisfy my deep-seated need (not consciously realized until last night) to obtain a condemnation of the "new" meaning. Which shall be: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. Nor, says that page, is it a usage guide. As such, the only encyclopedic thing about the term "begging the question" would seem to be the term from logic. While some mention of the other term is perhaps in order, I think I'd prefer to see it like that in <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momentum.html" title="Momentum">momentum</a> - a brief note towards the end of the article. It could be just something along the lines of what we already have. As it stands now, I think my biggest issue is that the article seems to give the usage dispute as much space as the term from logic. I don't really feel that there needs to be a moral condemnation of the everyday usage, and I will explicitly disavow any intention to do anything like that. But I do think it is problematic to act as though the two meanings are equivalently <i>encyclopedic.</i> The non-scientific usage of momentum is much more legitimate than this usage of begging the question, but it is barely mentioned in the article. Whatever we may think of the legitimacy (or illegitimacy) of using them, we do not have articles on <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irregardless.html" title="Irregardless">irregardless</a> and I could care less. The reason there is an article on begging the question is because of the logic term, not because of the non-standard usage, so there's no reason to more than briefly note the additional usage. Does this make sense? Have I used too many different arguments over the course of this discussion to be credible? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:25, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you were taking issue with my POV which I stated here, namely that in language usage a majority is always <i>ipso facto</i> correct. But I didn't inject that POV into the article, which merely states (factually I believe) that the modern usage has now become more widespread than the original usage and that it is criticized by proponents of the traditional usage.</dd>

<dd>Yes, Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and if the modern meaning truly was the only meaning then it would not warrant its own encyclopedia page (if it did, we could set up a proper disambiguation page in the standard way). But unlike "momentum", where technical and popular usage co-exist peacefully, there is a somewhat notorious usage dispute for "begging the question", and that does warrant prominent mention. Arguably, the modern usage, and the dispute over it, <i>is</i> the most prominent topic associated with the phrase "begging the question"... I can't even recall the last time I might have had occasion to use the expression in its traditional meaning (and you also mentioned you rarely use it). A short paragraph of a few sentences is not overdoing it, and because of the prominence or notoriousness of this particular usage dispute, it really ought to be mentioned in the introduction. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 00:28, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Curps, I chose "irregardless" and "I could care less" as examples of articles we do not have because those are also the subjects of notorious usage disputes. In addition to not being a dictionary, wikipedia is not a usage guide (says so on the same page as wikipedia is not a dictionary - got a problem with that, take it up there). I'd prefer, at least, that the usage dispute not be mentioned in the intro. That said, I found the old phrasing with "The traditional meaning of begging the question is..." to be the most exceptionable part of the article. If you're willing to stick with my revised opening, and if everybody else would prefer that the newer meaning be mentioned in the introduction, I would be willing to abide by that. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 00:36, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>But it is the case that the popular meaning of "normal" came first, and then physicists, knowing that "normal" was an oridnary, widely used term, made up a meaning for it that was unrelated. Moreover (and you really have to admire the raw nerve of the physicists here!) they did this in full knowledge of <i>perfectly servicable terms</i> such as <i>right-angle</i> and <i>perpendicular</i>. So how come this is OK and the reverse isn't? Physicists presumably don't have any more right to coin new and largely unnecessary usages than ordinary people.</dd>

<dd>I think there's some disagreement here on the basic facts of the article.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly. The vast majority of the article is about the technical meaning. However, about half of the introduction is about the other meaning. This doesn't seem appropriate to me. I also don't like the fact that we begin with "the traditional use of the phrase <b>begging the question</b>..." It should, I think, be more like the <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momentum.html" title="Momentum">momentum</a> article, which simply begins, "In Physics, momentum is..." <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 23:10, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re Wikipedia is not a usage guide/dictionary, we presumably all agree that the popular usage of the phrase has to be mentioned simply in order to avoid any confusion on the part of the reader?

The focus is now on the existence of the controversy, and the dictionary definition of the modern usage serves as the setup for mentioning the controversy.

<p>This paragraph in this talk page is an example of an area of wikipedia that would be so great if it could somehow be made workable. This linear presentation of positions on a small smear of topics makes it hard for me to add, in a constructive way, to one issue that I would like to add to: whether NPOV means that there are no absolutes and that anything may be right. Before I can do that in a constructive way, I need to read and understand all the above text. That is asking too much, so I don't plan to do it. But that makes this paragraph just one example of something that is worth doing if it just were not so hard and also futile, since the next person would have a higher hill to climb than I had, and it is already too high for me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a good point you raise there - I've just read through it all and it is a lot - as an example of a long dispute and the application of NPOV it has some value, but I wouldn't read talk pages of this length on every article.

<p>It would seem you cannot describe or justify the use of logical reasoning without using a logic-based description or argument.</p>
<p>If I were to say "Logic is no (good) way to reason anything" how could you defend the use of logic without using a logical defense?</p>
<p>Is it possible to truly think outside the confines of logic (including faulty logic)? If you could somehow use another form of reasoning, one assumes that form of reasoning could only be reasoned by either self-reasoning again or yet another form of outside reasoning which is either self-reasoning or reasoned by yet another form of reasoning... etc. But of course, these are only logic-based assumptions which one may not be able to justify using...</p>
<p>Is this entire premise logical? If so, then "logic" would seem illogical (or at least faulty/circular) and thus the premise would not be very logical.</p>

<p>You're confused about terms. You're question isn't "is logic circular?" Your question is "how can the use of logic be justified?" Since the act of justification normally requires the use of logic, clearly there is no way to "justify" the use of logic by conventional means. Now, based on whether or not one considers appeals to "one's natural sense of the universe" to be appeals to logic, it may be possible to "justify" logic in the sense that one can say, "logic seems to be self-evidently true." However, if the person searching for a justification were to press for a "deeper" reason that logic "must" be true, it seems that such an approach would be self-defeating, since the act of providing a deeper justification of logic is contingent on one's pre-existing belief in logic. In other words, the question can be further rephrased as "can you prove that logic must logically be true, without using logic?" The answer is "no," but this is hardly defeating, since the question is clearly a trap. Why do we need a justification for logic in the first place? Does the inquirer really in doubt about the veracity of logic, or is the inquirer merely attempting to stir controversy? If an inquirer is determined to doubt everything, is there really anything that can be said to make the doubter stop doubting? Someone determined to doubt is by definition determined to doubt. There's nothing that we can say to change that determination, if it really is fixed. Instead, it's a more intellectually fulfilling goal to ask, "exactly how little logic can I assume is self-evident, and still produce the usual results?" --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlj7_e64d.html" title="User:Carlj7">Carl</a> 15:51, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course the obvious initial rebuttal to that would be "But didn't you arrive at this conclusion by using logic? So what value is there in it (and yes, using logic to refute your use of logic is an irony not lost on me)? Is this not circular 'something', beyond just semantics?". But such a rebuttal is probably neither constructive nor particularly relevant.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose the real question is simply the old chestnut of whether or not there can be things such as "truth", "justification", "self-evidence" etc., considering the apparent pitfalls in arriving at any of these concepts (and I may now have indeed veered off into something best suited for another discussion page). That is of course taking a very "human-mind-centric" view of things, but I'm afraid I don't have much of a choice as that is currently the only point of view I have at my disposal and thusly I probably shouldn't expect any satisfactory answers.</dd>

<dd>Well, should one not hesitate to begin thinking about anything before one has first fully (or at least satisfactorily) wrapped their head around "thought" in the first place?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You can certainly apply logic with success if you believe in the notion of self-evident truths, ie "logic tells me 1 + 1 = 2, and so enough, it does!" and therefore justify its use by saying "it simply works" (but of coarse - is it not merely more logic to equate working with justification? - anyway...). If you believe in intuition why question your intuition when you can know of, and trust your intuition intuitively? If you believe the Bible why question the Bible if the Bible says the Bible is true?</dd>
<dd>But do these positions still not hinge on a form of logic? By what means do we discover the initial beliefs of "self-evidence" or "intuition" if not by reasoning them into existence (by means of our notoriously fallible perceptions no less)? Even if by saying "certain things seem to stand apart from logic, true in-and-of themselves, therefore they exist and are true." How can you ever escape the "therefore"(aka logic)-aspect of any type of thought/belief, and what (if any) trust can you put in it? (I'm sure I'm not wording these problems well enough to avoid semantic demolition, but I find them hard to articulate otherwise).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As an inquirer, I am not as you put it "determined to doubt" (though it may seem), I simply can't help it. If a situation is doubtable, should I not then have doubts? And what situation is not doubtable? I may employ some aporetic or semantic method to dismiss, or "deal with" an issue at face value, but if I can't get any "deeper" as you say, should I not find this a little troubling? If there isn't anything "deeper" is this not an equally troubling predicament?</dd>

The question "can you prove that logic must logically be true, without using logic?" is circular, in that by asking for an <i>proof</i>, you are presupposing the use of logic (think: can you have an <i>illogical</i> proof?).

If you can trust it, how? If you just accept it how can you really be satisfied (and if not, have you really actually accepted it?).</dd>

Firstly, just the alternative of "not using logic" seems only a logical reaction for one wanting to react against logic (not necessarily something I wish to do anyway..only understand it better). But if I did go ahead then I surmise there would still be a form logic underlying my choice of illogical statements (or non-statements) in my illogical post, whatever form that may take, leaving nothing new to choose from or be satisfied with. If someone else can demonstrate how this is to be done without logic I would be eager to see it.</dd>

<dd>If there is no readily apparent alternative to logic however, this still does not necessarily justify it anymore than being born without legs justifies the notion that walking is impossible - unless of course everybody is born without legs, but how do you prove this? It may appear that you can use nothing but logic, but then try to prove this beyond appearance. It seems beyond my abilities, structured by a robotic function of my limitations, rather than some pretense of "understanding" my limitations (ie: Socrates' "I only know that I know nothing" etc.) from which I could venture out under the assumption that my thoughts and actions may still have some sort of meaning (if there can be such a thing as "meaning").</dd>

<dd>Agreed, but allow me to depart on the epilogue that the level of uncertainty I am (at least personally) still able to experience (by seemingly inexorable option, mind you, and not by "determination") still cannot, by definition, preclude the <i>possibility</i> of "leaving logic behind" (or breathing underwater for that matter - as insurmountable as such concepts may presently seem), and thus prevents me from arriving at such a conclusive finitude for the moment - though I shall certainly bring my posting on this issue to a conclusion now. --<a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddyouard_a84b.html" title="User:Eddyouard">eddyouard</a></dd>

<dd>I apologize, but you raise further questions in my mind rather than pacify it. You must stop tempting me to clarify my thoughts (to both you and myself) if you wish to conclude the discussion.</dd>
<dd>Your sentence "the very ideas of possibility and necessity only occur within the bounds of logical discourse" suggests (to me at least) potential other options of thought/discourse - which I'm sure was not your intent as we both acknowledge the difficulties of "leaving logic behind". To clarify then, might we simply state that "possibility occurs - period", in which case we may then question "so what is possible?"</dd>
<dd>I’m sure you wouldn’t say the <i>possibility</i> of "not using logic" is actually a logical possibility, but that the notion is really a logical <i>impossibility</i> (in that a logically wrong possibility, according to logic, is in fact simply an <i>impossibility</i>). But here I still perceive a hint of circularity (wrong term perhaps?) – not in the sense of being “wrong” (since according to logic it seems actually quite right), but just somehow incomplete (I’d point to Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems if I understood them better, though considering their own use of logic they probably only point back towards it, and are probably irrelevant in this context anyway). Suffice it to say, when you can only fight fire with fire, there is little hope of ever putting it out. And while you might say: "Yes, I am on fire - in fact, I am fire - there's nothing to fight, lest I put myself out", I am still compelled to ask "By all appearances I am on fire - I may in fact be fire - but as only fire, who would I be to determine what I am?" Logic may tell me logic is all I have, but logic does not seem to tell me whether all I have is all there is to be had, nor if what I have is essentially worth having.</dd>

<dd>Please do not construe this as some stubbornness born of an argument on my part, I do not see the discussion as such. I would truly like to "believe" such conclusions (or really any conclusion), and by the nature of my doubt it would seem I am unable to really <i>disagree</i> with any position (only doubt it) anyway. You have in fact helped further convince me of the futility of challenging logic/thought by any logical approach. But likewise, articulating my persistent "meta-uncertainty" (justified or not) by logical means should be equally futile (a likely excuse, I know, but unavoidable by your own admission).</dd>
<dd>Indeed, certain people much smarter than I (string-theorists, etc.) will tell you that the <i>possibility</i> of 10 (or even more) dimensions is a potential logical <i>necessity</i> to rectify their logical view of the universe, despite being unable to logically articulate such a concept to themselves (let alone anyone else) while limited to their 4 dimensional perceptions. An admittedly flawed analogy, but I still see this more as a <i>function</i> of the limitation, and not an <i>understanding/acceptance</i> of the limitation. Though we may both declare we are limited by logic (though you may chose a word/p.o.v. other than "limited"), what better purpose does logic serve (perhaps impulsively) than to challenge such apparent limitations? Even if it’s to no useful end (fore if my use of logic [as fallacious as it may seem] leads me down such useless paths why should I not then question my logic further?) I still hold out hope of transcending the function, even without expectation…</dd>

<p>Essentially, it seems to be saying that the new meaning is bad because it doesn't mean the same thing as the old meaning. It does not have the same emotional weight and does not make the same kind of criticism. But that's no surprise... it's an entirely different meaning! It would be a surprising coincidence if, for instance, "occupation" (job) and "occupation" (military occupation) carried the same emotional weight and connotations.</p>
<p>It also makes the unjustified claim that emotional vestiges of the old meaning carry on to the new meaning. I don't think so: the overwhelming majority of those who use the new meaning are entirely unaware of the traditional meaning... in fact, that's probably <i>why</i> they use the new meaning.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the word I used as an example ("occupation") once had a sexual connotation a few centuries ago and was banned from use in polite society. It would be hard to argue that there are any lingering "emotional vestiges" from this old meaning, precisely because nobody is even aware of the old meaning.</p>
<p>In any case, it's a stretch to say that the traditional meaning of "begging the question" has some kind of serious negative emotional impact. Essentially, it just describes muddleheaded thinking or confusion, not making an accusation of lying or deception.</p>

<dd>"In the fallacy of circular reasoning, which is often called begging the question, you assume to be true what you are supposed to be proving. But that's also true for all valid deductions, where the conclusion (what you are trying to prove) is derived from the premises or assumptions. This difference is that, in circular reasoning, <b>the conclusion is contained in a single premise or assumption</b>, while in a deductive argument the conclusion is derived from both premises." --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStefanbojark_9066.html" title="User:Stefanbojark">Stefanbojark</a> 20:19, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In fact I was thinking more of Fowler's definition, which is given further down the page; perhaps it is because I am British. I have therefore rewritten my main example to account for the prevailing mood. Furthermore, I have tried to make the example as uncontroversial as possible, staying away from abortion or the death penalty, or indeed foxhunting. As for removing links, it's generally bad form to include a half-dozen citations at the end of a line, and of the six the latter required registration and the former was an offshoot of a website that wasn't about grammar, logic or style. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 10:22, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, well the Fowler brothers were never very traditional either. In many ways, Fowler reflects how common usage of the term had evolved around the turn of the century.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You should understand that this page has been in various rather horrid states---to the extent of being cited in the mainstream media as an example of how confused the definition of this term has become (and in a manner much to wikipedia's discredit). Pearl and I worked at it for a long time and did quite a bit of research to make it as complete as possible--especially as regards to thoroughly reviewing the original context of the term and its evolution. Those links were there as a convenience to hold on to some modicum of sanity. I personally think that the Oxford English Dictionary link is important and valuable. Many libraries have a subscription, and the OED is an authority in a way that some of the other sources are not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The treatment of this in the Prior Analytics is rather lengthy, but I think Fowler can be put in the following context:
<dl>
<dd>If then begging the question is proving what is not self-evident by means of itself, in other words failing to prove when the failure is due to the thesis to be proved and the premiss through which it is proved being equally uncertain <i>(sounds like Fowler, but then we get)</i></dd>

<dd>So it might be that Fowler isn't being innovative per se but rather just brief. i.e., Fowler states the first point but not the either/or clarification.

<p>I submit that it should be possible to express what is meant by 'incorrectness' with an operational statement which does not characterize anyone's usage as being incorrect, and does not set up a standard of correctness. In this case, we could say something like the following: When people with a basic education in logic or philosophy hear the phrase "begs the question" used in the sense of "raises the question", most of them will think that it is inconsistent with their understanding of what it is to "beg the question". Most others will probably think nothing of it.</p>
<p>This is clear, non-judgmental, and states the consequences of the usage plainly. The reader can then fairly evaluate whether he is willing to accept those consequences.</p>
<p>I suspect that most arguments about correctness and incorrectness in English usage are pointless, and time spent on them is wasted. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStedder_0794.html" title="User:Stedder">Tex</a> 21:43, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As it stands, the article does not express a judgment over whether the common usage is correct or not, but merely notes that there are those who view it as incorrect. This is true and noncontroversial, and your version is awkward and goes out of its way to avoid the word "incorrect." <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:27, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, the article is OK by me as it stands. My note was directed at the wrangling over correctness here on the Talk page. And my version is certainly awkward.

<p>I was thinking of pretty much the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The term has two meanings. The earlier meaning is "x". The more recent meaning is "y". The x-People think the y-People misuse the term. The y-People are not aware that there are x-People.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or possibly another formulation that would be more acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li>The x-People are smarter than the y-People.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to find a characterization of the two groups, so that one understand a possible social implication of adopting the usage x vs usage y. (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinGugino_164a.html" title="User:MartinGugino">MartinGugino</a> 12:07, 30 March 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>A recent change to the example shown as a syllogism changed it to an ordinary implication, and not a fallacy at all. It became p implies q, suppose p, thus q.

<p>Here's the thing. If you say "p implies q, suppose p, therefore q", it's correct logic. But you are supposed to be giving an example of a fallacy.

<p>The article as it stands now asserts that "begging the question" means that the question is not truly answered and thus "begs" to be. I don't see this as agreeing with the proper Latin translation or any other source I can find. As I understand it, the person committing the logical fallacy is also the one doing the begging. They are, in effect, begging (or petitioning, which would be a better word) the question or principle to do something that it isn't capable of doing, i.e. prove itself correct. I'm changing the etymology section of the intro to be consistent with Latin dictionaries and the rest of the article. (unsigned)</p>
<p>I think that some of the etymology I have seen here of this phrase is more of a mnemonic quality than reality-based.

<dd>If the English words "begging the question" were taken from the Latin words "<i>petitio principii</i>" then "beg the question" does not come from "beget the question." The Latin word "<i>petitio</i>" means to ask or to request. So, "<i>petitio</i>" means "beg (ask)." This is evident in our word "petition" which means "request." As a result, "begging the question" is derived from the ancient Latin language and its "<i>petitio</i>," not from the more recent English language and its "begetting."<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 23:52, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Lestrade<a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.67.html" title="User:205.188.116.67">205.188.116.67</a> 23:51, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</dd>

<p>The fact that "beg" means "evade" should be made clear in the very beginning of the article. The whole rest of it makes no sense to someone who assumes, correctly, that "beg" means "plead". Actually, I don't see the dual definition clearly explained anywhere in the article.</p>
<p>And if the word really has both meanings, then how exactly is the modern usage incorrect? The prescriptive folks might have an argument if "beg" didn't already have the "ask/plead/implore" meaning, but it does, and that meaning is the most commonly used by far.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The supposed etymology of the standard (i.e. "correct") use of the phrase is that it derives from "beggaring the question".

<p>The use of "beg the question" to mean "raise the question" instead of its proper meaning of "presuppose what is to be proved" is the result of ignorance. The speaker who misuses the phrase is simply unaware of the correct meaning of the words. This can only be corrected by education, self or formal. Therefore, due to the powerful imitative influence of television, it will probably not be corrected and its misuse will become generally accepted. Most people do not have the head for trying to understand phrases that relate to logic. The general public will use it incorrectly because it sounds unusual and striking.

<dd>Words change and usages change. Then everything is allowed and a word can mean whatever anyone wants it to mean. In order to communicate their thoughts, people have agreed by convention that certain words will designate certain concepts. If we want to subscribe to a "change is good" attitude with regard to words, then we will be left with extreme ambiguity and, ultimately, a private language for each individual. It will be as though every statement is a code that must be broken and translated. As an example, I will end with the statement: "Sediment so gryphon won't easel in climate net." Thus, words change and usages change. <a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 11:54, 27 June 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</dd>

<dd>Actually, that's <i>not</i> how usage changes, and you know it. Talking about things being "allowed" rather misses the point: how do we <i>stop</i> language change? The attitude displayed by some people, that all language change is a result of insufficient education, hardly stands up to analysis - how much more educated are we on average than the average speaker of Elizabethan English? And why is it that conservative linguistic forms are more frequently found in rural and out-of-the-way areas than in cosmopolitan centres? It's not about subscribing to a "change is good" attitude: it's simply a matter of describing, analysing and <i>living with</i> the changes that do occur. What you say about every statement being a "code that must be broken and translated" is fundamentally true - and what you say about convention is also true. Language usage changes because the conventions of language users change. At any rate, this discussion has already largely taken place on this page. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus">speak up!</a></small> 22:05, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Coming to the end of this long discussion page, I feel the 'new usage of the word' debates have largely come to a conclusion and are no longer of much use here. They also use up the majority of the page, despite the article mainly being about logic. Since the page has now reached over 100kb, perhaps they could be grouped together and made into an archive? As I'm still a relative newbie to this process, perhaps someone more familiar with archiving could help? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard001_655e.html" title="User:Richard001">Richard001</a> 23:49, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the first example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Only an untrustworthy person would run for office. The fact that politicians are untrustworthy is proof of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>is really crummy. It can be translated to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposition. Only untrustworthy people would run for office.</li>
<li>Proof. Politicians run for office. Politicians are untrustworthy people. Therefore, only untrustworthy people would run for office.</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that politicians are untrustworthy people proves that only untrustworthy people would run for office.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems to me, if we are to mince words, that the problem is moreso that one can argue that the fact that politicians are untrustworthy (the example puts this forward as a fact) only proves that untrustworthy people win elections, and that it says nothing about who actually runs for office. And if we were to mince words some more, we can argue that trustworthy people would run for office, but simply have not. Empirically, the first sentence in the example is a hypothesis, and the fact that politicians are untrustworthy is evidence. In other words, it is not clear to me what the author was thinking when he wrote that example (and it quite frankly makes "Begging the question" seems like a while lot of nothing). Something better might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only untrustworthy people run for office. Since only untrustworthy people run for office, then all politicians are untrustworthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>or something along those lines.</p>

<p>I was disturbed to see a confusion between the validity and soundness of an argument in the opening sentence! : "In logic, begging the question, also known in Latin as petitio principii is an informal fallacy occurring in deductive reasoning <b>whereby the logical structure of the argument is <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundness.html" title="Soundness">sound</a></b>, but an unstated co-premise is false." But if the co-premise is false, then strictly speaking, the logical structure of the argument is valid, not sound. As a consequence, I've decided to change 'sound' to 'valid'. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmileNoldeSinclair_a36e.html" title="User:EmileNoldeSinclair">EmileNoldeSinclair</a> 20:03, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The articles on Wikipedia have been a Godsend for quick references and sensible, easy-to-understand explanations. The definition and description of "Begging the Question" is the exception. It is just too complex for beginners like me. I don't know what those symbols mean, or how they apply. Talk to me in words. I can do words quite well.</p>

<dd>I agree. Most of Wikipedia's logic articles are fairly poorly explained. The example arguments are poor, as well. Serious editing is definately needed. <a href="../../../j/h/p/User%7EJHP_d3aa.html" title="User:JHP">JHP</a> 02:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do think the intro has gone downhill a little in terms of clarity (and using terms - like "co-premise" - that are nonstandard even in logic doesn't help). Maybe I'll retool it sometime this weekend. On the other hand, I wouldn't mind more specifics on where it's too complex and I don't know what symbols TWS is referring to, as I don't see a single logical symbol in the entire article. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 19:20, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the introduction of the article, it says that "Begging the question" is a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">Logical fallacy</a>. But in the second paragraph of <b>Examples</b> it says that it is an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informal_fallacy.html" title="Informal fallacy">informal fallacy</a>. In recent minor edits to the page, I provided a link to informal fallacy, it was previously written as "non-formal fallacy" without the link, is there a difference between a "non-formal fallacy" and an informal fallacy? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpyyoungman01_91af.html" title="User:Grumpyyoungman01">Grumpyyoungman01</a> 05:04, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is there even such a thing as "formal" and "informal" fallacies? I got that impression from the logical fallacy page hence my edits to its introduction and the creation of a new stub on informal fallacy. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrumpyyoungman01_91af.html" title="User:Grumpyyoungman01">Grumpyyoungman01</a> 05:10, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just made a number of changes including addressing this concern. If Wikipedia is using "logical fallacy" to mean "formal fallacy", then it was indeed incorrect to call BtQ a logical fallacy. (The difference is that a formal fallacy fails simply by virtue of the logical form of the argument, as "If P then Q; not-P; therefore not-Q"; an informal fallacy may be, and in the case of BtQ always is, logically valid, yet fails anyway due to some feature of the <i>content</i> of the argument.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Along the way I ditched the stuff about the fallacy of many questions since it was not clear to me from what was written a) what the connection between that and begging the question was supposed to be, and b) how the example given had anything whatsoever to do with Many Questions fallacies. I can kinda-sorta see how a) could be answered but I'm not at this moment prepared to articulate it properly; so I just zapped it, at least for now, as it's not central to the article. I think it's better off with no mention of the connection than with a poorly-written and misleading section on it, though better still would be a well-written and accurate one. <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplePlatypus_df26.html" title="User:PurplePlatypus">PurplePlatypus</a> 00:20, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How would you go about citing the source of basic logic? While you could cite the history and human development of the idea, and commentary on it, the logic itself is a priori.

<p>Using statements related to a religion as examples of a fallacy seems rather needlessly offensive, no matter how standard the example may be.</p>
<p>How about "A fossil of organism C is an evolutionary descendant of a fossil of organism A, therefore there is a missing link organism B". Evolutionary descent presupposes the missing link, and the missing link presupposes evolutionary descent.</p>
