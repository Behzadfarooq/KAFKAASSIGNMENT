<dd>No...No change in her name is needed. Although Beyoncé is well-known by her first name for music, she is usually credited as "Beyoncé Knowles" in movies. For example, here's Beyoncé in a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0443489/Ss/0443489/DGbeyonce.jpg.html?hint=tt0443489" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0443489/Ss/0443489/DGbeyonce.jpg.html?hint=tt0443489" rel="nofollow">Dreamgirls promotional poster</a> and the credit for Beyoncé in the <a href="http://www.dreamgirlsmovie.com/dream_girls_movie.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dreamgirlsmovie.com/dream_girls_movie.html" rel="nofollow">Dreamgirls movie</a> itself. lwalt 05:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This needs to be changed to just "Beyonce", as several people have noted. Beyonce is most known for being a singer/songwriter, and her stage name is "Beyonce". The only rationale against this that i've seen was that she's credited in movies using her real name, but this is a convention used in movies very often for "crossovers". For example, in the films "Four Brothers", "Revolver", and "Idlewild", <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre3000.html" title="Andre3000">Andre3000</a> is credited by his real name "Andre Benjamin", yet his wikipedia page is still titled "Andre3000", as it should be. How can you look at the movie credits and decide on that, but ignore her album covers? The fact is, no one ever ever ever ever refers to her by her full name. It is retarded that this hasn't been changed.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheonejanitor_527e.html" title="User:Theonejanitor">Theonejanitor</a> 11:06, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beyonce is great and she really can sing...though I have to admit she carrie her beats well. Even as much as I love her she can be a bit intimidating at times by her presence her beauty and her talents and of course that beautifully curveous body which is hard not to envy.</p>

<p>I think your comments sound like some crazy conspiracy theorist's rants. Beyonce's bio reads pretty much the same as most celebrity bios on Wikipedia. It basically lists her accomplishments as an entertainer. I do not personally think she is that talented; however, she has undeniably had a lot of commercial success as an entertainer, which is why she is famous. The article focuses on the aspects of Beyonce's life which make her noteworthy. What the heck do think the article should talk about?</p>
<p>The only controversy involving Beyonce concerns her alleged mistreatment of animals--involving her decision to wears fur and to sponsor a clothing line which has fur and leather items, and also her decision to tape an alligator's mouth shut for a photo shoot. This controversy is highlighted in the bio and is not glossed over.</p>
<p>By the way, the reason dead stars bio's don't have the disclaimer about libel is because there is generally not a claim of action for libel against a dead person (I know there are some exceptions, but this is the general rule).</p>
<p>No one bought off Wikipedia. You bitterly gripe about the article, but you don't offer any suggestions as to what "dirt" the article should include about Beyonce. HMMMM.</p>

<p>Beyonce was named after her mother's maiden name, in order to carry out the family last name since there was a shortage of males in the family. I know many people of different backgrounds visit this website, and may know people from their country with the last name beyonce. Can someone from a different culture, tell me where the name came from? I believe it is french or italian. beyonce grandmother(tina knowles mother) appears to be a bi-racial.</p>
<p>Actually, her mother's maiden name is spelled "Beyince", but it is spelled the same way. Tina Knowles just changed the "i" to and "o" to make it look more like a first name.</p>

<p>Well, first I must say I'm impressed by Beyonce's vocals on her track "listen", and I'm a fan. However, I find it difficult to believe she has a 4 octave range, and is compared to the artist this new section says she is. I think if there are no references found in a certain time, then it should be deleted. It just seems like a over-hyped fan spitting out non-sensical romance words. Mforeman 03:47, 22 February 2007 (UTC)mforeman</p>
<p>All I know is that if beyonce has a 4.2 octvave,then kelly should have 4.4 cuz they can hit higher than b,michelle should be a 5.0 . and why does her vocals keep being deleted!!!!!.</p>
<p>No......Kelly doesn't have a higher range thatn Beyonce. Beyonce's range has to be around five octaves in my opinion, because her lowest not is like an A2. I heard her do something really really low while she was doing her runs at the end of "Dangerously In Love", and she hit a C6 in the Destiny's child song "Happy Face," but I'm sure she can sing in the whistle register higher than that. I wish she would use it again so we could know for sure.24.164.197.116 00:12, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that in almost every article I read, there's a controversy section that gives a stage for some random advocacy group to voice their opinion about the subject. Is this really necessary? It's usually radical organizations like Peta, who want to advocate their own opinion in nearly every subject. Eating meat or wearing fur does NOT make that person controversial. I think a system needs to be put into place at Wikipedia that limits the ability of advocacy groups to make every article their platform.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Proposal:</b> The way the section reads (at present) in this article, PETA basically executed a publicity stunt. The stunt had little to do with Beyoncé and more to do with PETA. As a result, it seems hardly relevant to this particular subject. One editor made the point in his/her edit summary that it's notable because it was covered in the press. However, that raises the question over whether or not every incident the press covers should be included in a subject's biography. I would argue that it isn't. At any rate, in this case, I think it would be useful to create something along the lines of a "List of Celebrities Confronted by PETA" which includes a brief description of each documented incident. Sections such as the one discussed here would certainly find a home there.

<dd>I removed the section from the PETA article because it is already mentioned in their article (see 2006 in <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html#Timeline" title="PETA">PETA#Timeline</a>), and it was placed into the article with an extremely POV title as you stated. I have cut down the section in the article. Maybe it needs to be moved or merged into another section, but there is no reason to remove it completely when it is notable and well referenced, might as well remove the "Philantropy" section which has absolutely no references. This article reads with an extreme positive POV about Beyonce. It's no surprise that the one thing that is not completely positive about her is being continually removed. The section does not attack her; it just states a fact, a fact that was reported in the mainstream media and continues to be controversial. I also fail to see how the sourcing is not proper as you stated on my talk page. Firstly, the section is sourced by articles from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_4298.html" title="The Sydney Morning Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>; I don't see how we can get any better/notable sources than those. Secondly, it is one of the few sections in this article that actually cites reference, compare it to the trivial and extreme fancruft in the "Records and achievements" section, if anything is not notable it's that stuff. --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">musicpvm</a> 01:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Short answer: no. Longer answer: no, it's copyrighted. Using the cover is fine to illustrate the album when placed next to critical commentary about the album. However, using any copyrighted picture to illustrate her does not work since the picture would be replaceable. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 07:16, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Here's what I was thinking of putting in Beyonce's vocal profile, but I didn't want to add it because it would just get deleted. Please correct me if you have other information.</p>
<p>Classification: Dramatic-Mezzo Soprano</p>
<p>Highest Full Voice Note: F#5 in "Free" by Destiny's Child</p>
<p>Highest Note: E6 in "Happy Face" by Destiny's Child</p>

<p>Actually, I just checked the notes from "Listen" and "Free" and the highest notes in those songs are in fact the same note, so I guess it doesn't really matter which one is used.Jdot01 22:41, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Everysingle day someone writes that Be's Wembley cd/dvd sold 2 million in the US... i guess this is beacause it's certified 2xPlatinum by the RIAA, but platinum for Videolongform are for 100,000 copies shipped, not a million like for albums!</p>
<p>The same fake thing with DIL sales, which sold 8 million worldwide according to her sites, not 11 million...</p>
<p>It's quite easy to know the worlwide and US sales of B day as it's still charting and we can have accurate data, so please, stop putting fake sales, as it will only make this article an unreliable source!</p>

<p>All of the information there is verifiable. Do I need a source for her classification or something, because I know I don't need one for the notes she sang.Jdot01 13:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You need to cite a reference for all of it. It looks like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> to me since it doesn't have a citation. It's also been the subject of some controversy in this article (I'm not sure why - I didn't follow it that closely) and the best way to resolve that controversy is with unambiguous citations supporting the asserted facts. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 14:41, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well it would make sense for the song to be the research. I'm willing to look for a source on her vocal classification though, because I've seen that somewhere before.Jdot01 16:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you need a reference stating that "In song ___, she ___ (hit a particular note, held a note for a period of time, etc.)." It would be original research for us to claim to have listed to a song and identified a particular note as the highest, lowest, longest, etc. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 16:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)beyonce is a english soprano</dd>

<dd>Its hard to say exactly what Beyonce is cause she can more than comfortably sing Alto. Her lowest I've heard was a Bb2. And her highest was only E6 and it was kinda shouted. I think in order to be a soprano she should be able to hit C6 easier than she does. Kelly does it easier than Beyonce. Shes a Mezzo or alto. <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMyke209_395a.html" title="User:Myke209">Myke</a> 05:26, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well that's the definition of being a Mezz-Soprano. A Mezzo-Soprano isn't a full soprano, but they can sing alto comfortably and soprano also. Kelly is a Spinto Soprano, because her comfortable register is higher than Beyonce's, but Beyonce's vocal range is higher. I would appreciate it if someone could help me find a source for the vocal profile.Jdot01 23:29, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
