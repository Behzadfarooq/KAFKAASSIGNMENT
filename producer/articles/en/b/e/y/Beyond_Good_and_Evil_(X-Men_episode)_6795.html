Apocalypse</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Beyond Good and Evil Part 1 begins in Cairo, in 3999 A.D. <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_%28comics%29.html" title="Cable (comics)">Cable</a> and him men go to <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_%28comics%29.html" title="Apocalypse (comics)">Apocalypse</a>'s pyramid to destroy him because Apocalypse is recharging his energy, so he's currently weak and will be easily destroyed. Cable opens the door leading to Apocalypse's pyramid and they go inside. Cable trips on an alarm and rubble falls and he is separated from the others and battles Apocalypse. It turns out that it was a trap by Apocalypse to get Cable's time-traveling device, so that he can time-travel. Then Apocalypse disappears with Cable's Time-Traveling device.</p>
<p>Then we go back to May 11, 1959. Here we see a scene from <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Man%27s_Worth_5918.html" title="One Man's Worth">One Man's Worth</a> episode. <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Fitzroy_4776.html" title="Trevor Fitzroy">Trevor Fitzroy</a> is stealing lifeforce from Xavier with his mutant power, but <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine_%28comics%29.html" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storm_%28comics%29.html" title="Storm (comics)">Storm</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_%28comics%29.html" title="Bishop (comics)">Bishop</a> save Xavier and Fitzroy opens a time portal and runs away. Then Bishop takes off his armband and goes back to his time in 2055 AD.</p>
<p>When Bishop arrives at his future he can't step through the time portal because of some disturbance in the portal. Then Bishop is sucked back in and lands in the Nexus, or Axis of Time. He sees someone and asks him where he is. The other guy calls himself Bender. Bender says that this is the Axis of Time and all time travelers travel through the Axis. Bender tells Bishop that Apocalypse threw him off-course and he landed in the Axis, and point towards a portal and says that's the Axis of Time. so, Bishop starts going towards the axis to go back to his time-line.</p>
<p>Then we go back to the present. Here Jean and Cyclops are getting married again. When they are leaving in their car <a href="../../../r/u/c/Ruckus_%28comics%29.html" title="Ruckus (comics)">Ruckus</a> stops the car with his scream, with that Jean and Cyclops fall unconscious (The Professor had turned off the security for the wedding). The <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasty_Boys_a499.html" title="Nasty Boys">Nasty Boys</a> accompanied by <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertigo_%28Marvel_Comics%29_ca9d.html" title="Vertigo (Marvel Comics)">Vertigo</a> attack the X-men. The Nasty Boys Succeed and take Jean and Cyclops. They toss Jean into a portal and step into the portal, leaving Cyclops behind. The X-Men go searching for Jean and Cyclops; they find Cyclops, but not Jean. The professor tries to use Cerebro to find Jean, but he can't find any trace of her. Suddenly <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mister_Sinister_cc42.html" title="Mister Sinister">Mister Sinister</a> comes in the room and attacks The Professor and Jubilee, and then takes the Professor.</p>
<p>Back in 2055 AD, Forge tries to get the portal working and to get Bishop back. He says that the portal is working and Bishop should have arrived. He says that his tracer is pinpointing to North-East US in late 1990's. So, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shard_%28comics%29.html" title="Shard (comics)">Shard</a> offers to go back to find Bishop. Shard arrives at the present, where Sinister is taking the Professor. She and the X-Men try to stop Sinister, but he brings the Nasty Boys through the portal to distract them. The X-Men quickly defeat the Nasty boys. Sinister goes through the portal, leaving the Professor.</p>
<p>Then we go back to the Axis. In there Jean is held captive in some sort of an energy field. Soon Mister Sinister arrives there, through the portal. Apocalypse is also at the Axis and says that he told Sinister to bring her, then this episode ends with a To Be Continued....</p>

<p>Part 2 starts in the Present at the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27ar.html" title="Shi'ar">Shi'ar</a> Imperial Palace. A few ships led by Lilandra's sister, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deathbird.html" title="Deathbird">Deathbird</a>, attack the Palace and get inside the palace. They apprehend <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lilandra_Neramani_a012.html" title="Lilandra Neramani">Lilandra</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_%28Marvel_Comics%29_c1a0.html" title="Oracle (Marvel Comics)">Oracle</a>. Then <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladiator_%28Imperial_Guard%29_a182.html" title="Gladiator (Imperial Guard)">Gladiator</a> comes to rescue them. He stops Deathbird, but Apocalypse comes through the time-portal and grabs Lilndra. Then Deathbird brags about being the new empress of Shi'ar, and that Apocalypse had promised her that he would get rid of Lilandra. But Apocalypse drops Lilandra, instead he takes the Oracle. After this Lilandra talks to Xavier, telepathically, and tells him that someone named Apocalypse from Earth took one of her psychics named Oracle. Xavier then tells Cyclops to assemble all the X-Men.</p>
<p>Back in the Axis of Time, Jean asks Sinister why he's working with the Apocalypse. He tells her that Apocalypse promised to give him a chance to create a new breed of humans, that he will personally select and genetically engineer. Jean says that it will take generations and he can't live that long. Then Sinister says that here he can exist in all times and jump to any time through the portal to see his results. Jean asks where is here. Suddenly the Oracle is sent to the Cell next to Jean's and Apocalypse tells her that here is the Axis of Time, where all the times cross. Apocalpyse continues to tell Jean that she will remain here imprisoned forever. He said that when he was traveling through time, he was sent off course and into the Temporal Control Center of Existence. It took him centuries of searching to discover its powers. Outside the Axis Bishop still is trying to find a way into the Axis of Time, so he can go back to his time.</p>
<p>Back in the Present, Xavier thinks that Apocalypse and Sinister may be trying to use psychics for something. So he tells X-Men to use Cerebro to find all the Psychics on Earth and keep an eye on them.</p>

<p>Then we go to <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archangel_%28comics%29.html" title="Archangel (comics)">Archangel</a>'s Castle in England, still in the present. Psylocke breaks into Archangel's Castle to steal. When Archangel comes she runs and jumps of a cliff, but Archangel saves her. When Archangel lands on the roof <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psylocke.html" title="Psylocke">Psylocke</a> uses her Psychic katana to knock him out. Wolverine and Shard come to London to find Psylocke because she is also a Psychic. Back at the castle, Archangel wakes up and finds that Psylocke has filled up his car with valuables and is about to leave. He decides to follow the car. Wolverine sees Psylocke and also goes after her. Shard sees Archangel and warns the Professor. Psylocke tells Archangel that she steals for a good cause, but Archangel doesn't listen; then the start fighting.

<p>Part 3 begins where Cable and Tyler try to break into the government building to steal a time-traveling device, in 3999 AD. Cable's men create a distraction and also go to destroy the defensives around the building, so Cable can sneak in. Hope, Dawnsilk, Boak, and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrison_Kane_6365.html" title="Garrison Kane">Garrison Kane</a> run into heavy resistance by some robots around the building. Cable finally manages to get inside the building. Cable uses a big spaceship to go back in time, but it malfunctions. Apocalypse knows about Cable going back in time as he is watching him.</p>
<p>Cable lands in the Present time near the X-Men's mansion. At the mansion Cable tells the X-Men that they found something called the Lazarus Chamber in the future. He says that Apocalypse goes to it every hundred years and hibernates to recover, and that's how he has lived for thousands of years. He says that he destroyed the chamber in 3999, but Apocalypse grabbed his time traveling device and now can go to any time before the Chamber was destroyed to recover. The professor reads Sabretooth's mind and learns about Apocalypse's plan. So the X-Men, Archangel and Cable decide to go back in time to destroy the Chamber of Lazarus, when it was built. Meanwhile, Apocalypse can see everything that they are doing at the Axis of Time.</p>

At night Storm causes a diversion, while the others get inside the pyramid. When they open the door to enter the pyramid, the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsemen_of_Apocalypse_bcc8.html" title="Horsemen of Apocalypse">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a> attack. Cable, Wolverine, Beast, and Professor X goes inside while Cyclops, Gambit, Storm, and Archangel fight the horsemen. A while later the horsemen go back in the pyramid to save the chamber and start fighting with Beast, Wolverine, and Cable. Then the others come to help. When the X-Men go in the Chamber they find that Mystique was posing as Apocalypse and it was a trap. Then there's huge light and Cable finds the X-Men on ground. Apocalypse takes the Professor to the Axis of Time. Right here part 3 ends.</p>

<p>Part 4 begins in 1200 BC in Ancient Egypt. Cable drops a bomb in the Lazarus Chamber to destroy it, and they run outside. The entire Pyramid gets demolished. They go back to the time machine. Beast says that all the kidnapped psychics must have been taken to the same place and time, so Xavier wore a homing device in case he was captured. Apocalypse is still watching the X-Men and says that destroying the Chamber can't harm him now, since he is in the Axis of time, which is outside any time. Here we also see Wolverine he must have jumped through the portal to save Xavier.</p>
<p>The X-Men come back to the present-time. Beast uses Cerebro, and finds that Xavier was taken outside of time to the Nexus, or Axis of Time. Cable then takes off without the X-Men.</p>
<p>Back in the Axis of Time, Apocalypse begins his plan. All the Chambers where the psychics where held begin to float around the Axis. Bishop sees that and asks Bender what's going on, Bender tells him that he's stealing time. Magneto and Mystique tell Apocalypse that he said he would explain what he's doing. Apocalypse says that the balance of good and evil has prevented him from his destiny to rule the universe. Now he has found a way to break that balance by using the energy of the most powerful psychics in the Universe. Their psychic energy combined will stop the Axis of Time, which will stop time itself and all existence will end except the the one in the Axis of Time. He plans on creating a new universe that he will create as he sees fit, and then he will be able to rule the Universe unchallenged.</p>
<p>Then Magneto gets angry because Apocalypse had promised him to create an alternate future where mutants will rule. Apocalypse tries to kill Magneto, but Mystique comes from behind and stops Apocalypse. And the Horsemen and Nasty boys start go after Magneto and Mystique. So to save themselves they try to free Wolverine. Magneto frees Wolverine, while Mystique buys him some time. Then Cable lands his time-traveling ship lands at the Axis. But Apocalypse begins his plan and everyone in the universe start to fade away and time stays still and the time portals start to disappear.</p>

<p>Everything outside the Axis of Time portal also start to disappear, Bishop has to run to keep up. Bender tells Bishop that Apocalypse is messing with the entire space-time continuum. Bishop hadn't seen that blue ring around the Axis of Time portal and shoots at it. His bullet hits Psylocke's chamber and she is freed. Then he frees a few others, which stops Apocalypse's plan and returns everything to normal. Apocalypse and his four horsemen deal with Bishop while Wolverine faces Mr.Sinister and the Nasty Boys. Wolverine manages to deflect Sinister's blast destroying the orb and releasing the psychics. Cable shoots Apocalypse, knocking him down as well as breaking apart the Axis of Time. The power of the psychics is greater than that of Apocalypse so they bring him and everyone else outside of the Axis. When Apocalypse comes out of the Axis of Time, he ceases to exist because Cable had already destroyed his Lazarus Chamber. Then everyone goes back to their times. Right here the Beyond Good and Evil ends. At the end when everyone has left the Axis of Time, Bender revealed himself to be <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortus.html" title="Immortus">Immortus</a>.</p>
