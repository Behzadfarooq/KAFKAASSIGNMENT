<p>After <a href="../../../t/y/s/Tyson_Granger_839a.html" title="Tyson Granger">Tyson</a> became the 2-time world champion, <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Tate_c65e.html" title="Max Tate">Max</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Kon_e470.html" title="Ray Kon">Ray</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kai_Hiwatari_4731.html" title="Kai Hiwatari">Kai</a> leave the team so that they have a chance to beat Tyson and become the world champion themselves.

<p>The BBA tournament rules are changed to a round robin system, with each team having 2 players per match with up to 2 reserve players. There are six teams at the beginning. Five tournaments are held one after the other in five different countries around the world: the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, each consisting of three matches. The matches can either have two rounds with a blader from each team plus a third round with the two winners if a tie occurs, or a single 2-on-2 battle. After these five tournaments are held, the three teams with the most losses are eliminated and the next two teams battle to determine who will battle in the finals against the team with the most wins. The final matches work in the same way.</p>

<p>Boris, the secondary villain from the first season, returns and creates the new <i>Beyblade Entertainment Global Association</i>, or BEGA, replacing the BBA. The BBA headquarters are bulldozed and elsewhere, the new BEGA headquarters are revealed. Boris tries to fool Tyson and co. into believing he has made up for his past, as he is apparently trying to help the future of bladers around the world. After a while however, they see what Boris is trying to pull. The Blitzkrieg Boys try their hand at taking down Boris' bladers, but they fail, as one of his strongest bladers, Garland Siebald, damages their blades beyond repair and badly injures their team captain Tala Volkov (Yuriy Ivanov in Japanese version) to the point where he is brought to the hospital. Tyson challenges BEGA's best to a battle, and Boris decides to hold a 5-on-5 tournament in one month's time.</p>
<p>Tyson and Ray decide to have a beybattle on their own, as Ray was the only one who didn't get to face Tyson properly in the World Championship tournament. The battle is intense, but Tyson eventually wins by a narrow margin. However, their blades are trashed and in no condition to be used in the tournament. Even worse, BEGA has now taken control of all the Beyblade shops around, so they can't repair or rebuild their blades. Luckily, the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Starz_1369.html" title="All Starz">All Starz</a> show up and give Kenny a bunch of brand new parts. Kenny makes new beyblades for Tyson, Daichi, Max, Ray, and Kai. However, Kai had decided to join BEGA to once again try to beat Tyson.</p>
<p>At the time of the tournament, Tyson still hasn't decided who should fill in for Kai, and they decide to wait for him, as nobody else is capable of controlling the new Hard Metal System beyblades.</p>

But as Barthez readies his team, we learn he's devised a special spider web-like tape that is supposed to shoot out of his team's blades and trap their opponents in an inescapable web. Miguel is torn and knows that if they follow his coach's plan they could win, but he feels he'd rather lose with respect than cheat.</td>

Kai wants them to be evenly matched so that he won’t have any advantage in battle. Because of the power levels involved, Mr. Dickenson unveils a new stadium dish, hidden under the floor of the main stadium. It is a square mile large, and in the style of an outdoor environment. Tyson is used to more traditional indoor stadium designs, but feels he is up for the challenge. Tyson begins to draw on the skills he learned from his previous battles, while Kai’s focus is on his exceptional abilities and his single-minded desire to be the best. The battle rages on…</td>

The fight is incredibly intense and what’s even more amazing, it looks like the two combatants are so evenly matched, there might not be a winner. And that’s exactly what happens! At the end of the battle, Kai and Tyson drop out at the exact same time! Now a dilemma arises. Mr. Dickenson has to make the final decision and he’s leaning toward calling it a tie because he’s afraid that if they continue the battle, someone could get hurt. But Kai steps up to the plate and pleads his case for the battle to continue, which it does! As the fight resumes, the intensity is felt throughout the arena. Again they are evenly matched and it looks like no one will take it, when… they both mount a final assault! It’s huge!

<td colspan="3">It’s mid-way through Tyson and Brooklyn’s final tie-breaking ‘Justice 5’ match which could give BEGA a stranglehold on the entire sport of Beyblading. Having suffered his only previous defeat at the hands of Kai, Brooklyn’s thirst for revenge takes the form of an unearthly power. Not only has his Beyblade Zeus given Brooklyn sinister black wings with which to fly, it’s generated a giant vortex in the sky that is wreaking havoc on the city. Buildings are crumbling everywhere. The entire world is being enveloped by the growing darkness. Only Tyson can stop Brooklyn before it’s too late. Summoning his own formidable power from Dragoon, Tyson flies into the sky to convince Brooklyn to cease the negative emotions that are causing the havoc. When reasoning fails, the pair continues their battle above the ever-crumbling city. The tide turns in Tyson’s favor when he’s able to summon the spirits of his teammates’ blades and merge them with Dragoon, which evolves into the most powerful Beyblade ever. By probing deeper into Brooklyn’s psyche, Tyson learns that his foe’s anxiety stems from childhood isolation at being a genius so early in life. Tyson makes Brooklyn see that Beyblading is a pure sport to be enjoyed for one reason alone – the love of the game. Brooklyn calms down. The chaos ends. And the pair continues their match simply for enjoyment. With BEGA’s HQ in shambles, the upstart league and its owner Boris are ruined. Mr. Dickenson’s BBA league restarts, but in a much more modest form. And kids everywhere – including Tyson and his friends - return to the simple, purest form of Beyblading.</td>
