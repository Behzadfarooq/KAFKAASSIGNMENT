<p>I fixed up a handful of small typos and the like that I found. I also changed the wording or some sentences just the tiniest bit here. If I made a mistake, let my know, though I didn’t change any of the actual information since I know next to nothing about real beyblading. I came here because I like the anime show, then stayed to edit some small typos I found ^^.</p>
<p>Under ‘The Types of Engine Gear’, this sentence: “It can be spun in either the left or right direction with also the direction of the normal launch.” Sounds a bit funnily worded, but I can’t quite put my finger on how to change it.</p>
<p>Under the ‘Heavy Metal System’, I changed the format to be like how the basic beyblade parts are explained under ‘Basic System’. It was difficult/messy with those long comments in between each part in parenthesis explaining them.</p>
<p>Under ‘TV Series’ there was this part: “…though generally quite similar…” I’d have to say that many people would be willing to argue that. Most of V-Force didn’t even have to do with the World Championships, and in G-Rev the entire team was split up and battling [I]against[/I] each other, not with each other, and the whole big world-domination schemes were really quite different in S1 and G-Rev ^^;. I took that bit out, but if it bothers anyone, they can put it back in, that OK?</p>
<p>I put double-brackets around a couple words here and there, such as ‘CGI’ since not many people would know what those are, but I’m not very good with editing and links and the like, I can only do the most basic linkage(the double-brackets). Besides that, I’m putting brackets around only words that I myself don’t know, so even if I knew how to do the whole disambiguation thing, I wouldn’t know where to direct the link. However, I’ve only put double-brackets on 2 or 3 words.</p>
<p>Under ‘Beyblade Revolution’, this part: “BBA tournament rule is changed to round robin system, with each team having 2 player per match with up to 2 reserve players.” Sounds weird, but I’m not exactly sure what they were trying to say, so I don’t know how I should change it exactly.</p>
<p>Under ‘BBA Tournament Teams’, I changed some stuff, just small things like ‘Mr. Tao’ to ‘Sensei Tao’, but I’m not sure if I redirected the link to an nonexistent thing or something. If someone could check them and fix anything I might’ve scrambled, that’d be wicked.</p>
<p>Also, beyblade was pased of an actual Japanese toy called a 'beigoma' I believe(I might've written it wrong). It's this simple metal top with a simple design on the top, and what you do is wind a rop all around it, then somehow twirl it or something... um, a very old game, with only 1 factory that still made them, when Beyblade became a hit apparently that factory started to gain profit. I read it in an article somewhere, but... I dunno' where I'd find it now. Maybe it's in Wikipedia? However, I don't really know the ropes of Wikipedia and larger edits, so I'm leaving it to others. Besides, this is my first edit ever, I believe ^^;.</p>
<p>Another thing, under 'Basic Systems', would it be better if the different parts were 'listed'? It'd stand out better and look nicer, but I didn't know what it'd look like while I was editing and didn't know it'd look so blendish without them. Maybe I'll do it later if no one else does. Oh, and same for under' Heavy Metal System', since I changed the format to be like 'Basic System'.</p>
<p>Also, is there a page that shows the original and dubbed names of all the characters?? Because in this article, many of the names shown were dubbed and I know many of the original names but I'd have no idea where to put it and how to put it in.</p>
<p>Another point I'd like to make is that this article seems to really lean much more towards the actual beyblade toy, not the show. Perhaps the show and toy can be split up? They're just too different to mix, and the anime/manga series is usually the thing someone is looking for when searching for beyblade, but the information of the beyblade toy is also very thorough and good. So... split it? Or is it already split? Sorry if it is, but then it'd be weird to have little sections on the show here if it was like that too.</p>
<p>Oh, also, this page could use some cleaning up and stuff, though it's rather snazzy as it is. It just seemed strange sometimes as I edited.</p>
<p>Well, I hope I didn't bug you guys(is there even anyone there?), but I'm just new to this Wikipedia and editing stuff, sorry in advance for any mess-ups or annoyances! <a href="../../../x/o/s/User%7EXOSAF_e0c2.html" title="User:XOSAF">XOSAF</a> 22:18, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've made an attempt to get this page organised a little more because it looks scruffy and too unorgainsed with far too much info to swallow on one page. I've made a seperate page for Beyblade parts and added a beyblade List possible page. Unfortantely I have no info to fill that page yet. Hopefully this can become the framwork for everyone to work on. I'm not a expert on Wikipedia so I'm not doing a serious and total revamp from scratch.</p>
<p>The page now looks smaller, shorter, then it did before. But hopfully its easier to get around. I'd like that Beyblade characters list to become a A-Z listing, but for now, its okay. I don't know what everyone thinks of all what I've done, but I feel it looks better at least, but thats my opinion.</p>
<p>I've added to the system section a list of beyblades for a link. however I can't set up this page as I don't have time right now. I have some of the toys cause my bro collected them. I will start this at some point at the weekend.</p>
<p>My only crib is that whoever changed the bladers section to go to that long unnesscary list of characters has somewhat screwed me over. I set it up so I could later write a page of info on each character. Its no prob for me, I can alter it back. But I've been too busy to set it all up. That long list is okay, but complex and confusing I'd like to see it got rid of. Hence why I tried to write an indivialual page for each character. I'll reset it up this weekend.</p>

<dd>Good try, bu I don't think this was a very good idea. The subarticles created really don't stand on their own, and it hides content that readers might be interested in. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:35, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I know it bugged me... If I had time I'd rewrite the new sub pages into a better format but sadly I don't. Trouble is its really complex to set up certain aspects of the info. I used to be a member of one of the major Beyblade fan sites and I can say from experience the problem with Beyblade is too much info and no one knows how to fully organise it well. Most fan sites only deal with either the anime or the toy... And even fewer with the manga.</p>
<p>Speaking of the manga... We need somone to start writing up info on that... I only have volumes 1 - 3. We need someone with info on ALL 14 vols. Currently I think the english realise is up to 10... But there was another english translation released in Austrila that completed the 14 vols.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go asking around the old hang outs for links to sites and such like. -<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 18th Feb 2006.</p>

Where did the HMS system information go? There's not even a subarticle for it I believe. I know quite a few external links. Those of you who know about off the chain.net and damashii should know that those sites have shut down, but there are others--Katashi 21:04, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm definitely not an expert on this anime/manga, so I'm going to need someone else to verify that the criticism of Beyblade is prominent enough to be represented on Wikipedia. My first impression is that the section is swimming with POV material, but it is not beyond repair, and does have valuable information. In particular, if the source of this criticism can be cited, then it can become passable. Something like being below Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokémon should be backed up with credible statistics. <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVindictive_Warrior_9bec.html" title="User:Vindictive Warrior">Vindictive Warrior</a> 07:40, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
