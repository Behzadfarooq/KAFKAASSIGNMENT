<p>Beyonce highest note is a D6. I dont know if she can go any higher. If you listen to her, you see that she does not sound strained or anything when she sings this D6 note, so I think she could go higher; If this really was the top of her range, the notes would probably be weaker. On the other hand, its true what another person said. If you say E6, then you might want to say F6-G6-A6-B6-C7-D7 etc. Since its her 'highest recorded note', or 'highest heard note', you will have to leave it at D6 until she demonstrates that she can sing higher. I love beyonce to death (<a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist">look at my page by clicking here</a>), but she cannot sing A2. That note is 'reserved' for singers like <a href="../../../t/o/n/Toni_Braxton_1c73.html" title="Toni Braxton">Toni Braxton</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> etc. The lowest she can go is C3. In the song 'She cant love you' or 'DIL', she hits the E3 or was it D3 (not sure), but you can listen and realise that she was using the absolute bottom end of her range. If she went any deeper, she would sound strained. Remember, range isnt simply the notes you can hit, its the compass of notes at which you can sing effectively and comfortably.</p>

<p>C3-E6 is 3 octaves and 3 notes so her range is 3.3 octaves why do people keep on changing it to 3.5?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJournalist_823c.html" title="User:Journalist">Journalist</a> says</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am the one who keeps changing it to 3.5 octaves. I always put 'approximately 3.5 octaves' to show that it is not an exact measure. If 8 notes = 1 octave, how can 3 notes be .3 octaves?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>C3-E6 is 3&amp;3/8 octaves. Its closer to 3.4 octaves than 3.3 octaves and because we do not know exactly what is her range, a good estimate is 3.5 octaves. If you really look at it, you would see that if she sang 1 more note, she would have full 3.5 octaves. If people keep altering and vandalizing the Vocal profile, it stands a good chance of being deleted from the article!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But there is 7 notes in one octave</p>
<p>ex. C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 A1 B1 = 1 octave</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Correction</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, there are 8 notes in 1 octave, hence the name <b>OCT</b>ave. Example <b>C1</b>, D1, E1, F1, G1, A1, B1, <b>C2</b> is one octave. If you were still counting, you would then begin at C2 and then count to the next C on the piano and so forth (from C1-C2 is 1 octave, C2-C3 is another octave). I suggest that you read the "<a href="../../../o/c/t/Octave.html" title="Octave">octave</a>" article and you will understand. And to reiterate, if the 'vocal profile' is altered incessantly, it could be deleted from the main article!</p>

<p>The article says Dangerously in love has been sold 13 million worldwide - I think it may be incorrect cause many sources says that her solo sold about 7.5 million.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That seems more accurate. The chances of her debut album being able to sell 13 million copies worldwide nowadays is highly unlikely. Perhaps worldwide sales tallies should just be left out until someone can provide a source to go along with them. - Triggy
<dl>
<dd>Are you sure about that Triggy? According to an article I read on BeyonceWorld, DIL sold in excess of 9 million copies worldwide. Doesn't that figure seem to make sense? After all, we all know for a fact that it was 4x platinum in the US and worldwide sales are usually a good bit more than double US sales. <a href="../../../j/2/r/User%7EJ2rome_32e5.html" title="User:J2rome">J2rome</a> 6 July 2005 03:52 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, according to the page "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_best-selling_music_artists.html" title="List of best-selling music artists">List of best-selling music artists</a>", the average Worldwide/US album sales ratio is 2.99. If you multiply 4 million by 2.99 you would get 11.96, and I know it's not that high but it furthers the argument that it must be more than 7.5 million. <a href="../../../j/2/r/User%7EJ2rome_32e5.html" title="User:J2rome">J2rome</a> 6 July 2005 07:59 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Beyonce is not that big outside the U.S. Same with Christina Aguilera,her debut has been sold 8 million U.S. and just more than 4 outside U.S. The average Worldwide/US Christina debut album sales ratio is 1.5</dd>
<dd>Her Label ( Sony/BMG Music ) said, in april 2004 (9 or 10 months after "Dangerously In Love" was released), that her album just sold 7 millions of copies, with 8 ( or more ) platinum certifications around the world. Since then i think the album sold more than 8 millions, because DIL still strong in some charts around the world even this year, and now, with 2 years of life, "Dangerously In Love" album just have more than 8 millions of copies sold, with 9 or 10 platinum certifications ( what means copies sold by some people in the media, but in real is the number of copies shipped how you all knows).</dd>

<p>66.8.251.70</p>
<p>beyonce is the hottest female artist that i know of. baby boy drives me crazy anytime i listen to the song.</p>
<p>I wonder if B. K. is truly afro-american? I mean in some photos she looks white enough to be herrenvolk! Maybe she follows the footsteps of pop king Jacko to albino-dom. Hope her ass won't fall off just like Jacko's nose, though she shakes it so intensively, that I am really worried.</p>
<p>I deleted the final paragraph under "Controversy" because of its non-neutral POV. Something about Beyonce's distinguishing traits could be added, but not in that way (something about a "mesmerizsing look" she gives men, according to the writer).--66.8.251.70 02:12, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Deleted following paragraph, 9 Feb 2005:</p>
<p>"One should note however that Beyoncé's main skill is none of the above, but her ability to give guys a truly <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesmer.html" title="Mesmer">mesmerizing</a> look. One that makes men unable to think or make sound judgement about her. Beyoncé observation (even via TV screen) does cause dependence and sensory isolaton, especially in teenagers."</p>

<p>I found that in happy face she hits an E6 not a D6. I recorded it on my musebook tuner.</p>
<dl>
<dd>i agree with Journalist cause i think you know what you talkin bout. 3.5 octaves sounds right because based on the notes recorded and heard, she has APPROXIMATELY that range. Maybe later we'll see just how high she can go.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know who the above are, but I'm afraid that this all counts as <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, and can't be included.

<p>That doesn't really signify, though, as the notes themselves are the original research. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:24, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As per the policy on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, I will be removing the contested "Vocal Profile" section until someone can manage to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> an official external source for this artists vocal capabilities. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 16:21, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, dont get me wrong but, if a controversy story can get an space in the main page of the article, i dont see the problem in the thoughs of the people about her vocal ability getting space in the main page too. you see, the thoughs of the people about it, making changes every time, its so unoffcial as and controversy story about the artist. this was an radical decision that just made the beyonce´s page lost info, and contested info, ok, but its too contested like many of other things in the whole article.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that I understand all of this, but it misses the point. The "vocal profile" section goes against a specific and clearly stated Wikipedia policy that prohibits original research. You seem to be saying that another part of the article is unacceptable for another reason; if you're right, then that's reason for removing it, not for including this. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:17, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>C3-E6 is 3 octaves(C3-C6) + 2 notes(D6-E6) which is 3.3 noy 3.4 or 3.5</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually C3-E6 is 3 octaves and 3 notes. C3-C6 is 3 octaves, then you say C6, D6, E6 (3 NOTES). You start counting from the last note where the preceeding octave ends. Remember, when counting, youll say <b>C5</b> D5 E5 F5 G5 A5 B5 <b>C6</b> D6 E6 F6 G6 A6 B6 <b>C7</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>FROM C5-C6 IS ONE OCTAVE, THEN C6-C7 IS ANOTHER! THE 'C6' COUNTS AS THE LAST NOTE FOR THE 5th OCTAVE AND THE FIRST NOTE FOR THE 6TH. So when you reach C6 for beyonce, you would start again at C6 and say 'C6, D6, E6'. I know its coufusing, but DO YOU UNDERSTAND?</dd>

<p>I do not like how Beyonce looks in this article. The first picture looks sleazy. It needs to be changed. This is her biography.</p>
<p>-&gt; funny, I thought the picture didn't look sleazy enough. It should be sleazier to reflect her personality.</p>
<p>If your referring to some songs like naughty girl being sleazy is not true. She is a grown up, beautiful, single woman and is entitled to feelings like that with boys. Most woman will experience that sometime, it's natural and it's not like she will just take any cheap guy. She's only referring to one guy, she is a nice woman.</p>

<p>I wouldn't put Beyonce in the multiracial category, simply because most Black Americans have some caucasian ancestry. You'd have to add everyone! But maybe if there's some list of guidelines somewhere that outlines how many generations back you're allowed to go before it's too diluted to make you "multiracial," then you could go by that, though I doubt anything like that exists, since racial designations can be, after all, arbitrary, unscientific, and meaningless. But that's a different argument entirely. Nrclptkrkr41 21:20, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not really... Most African Americans (over 50 percent and I believe the true approximation is 70%) are pure African but multiracial in the terms of the various African countries they originate from. A study published on PubMed.com on the racial admixture of African Americans is where this research comes from. In the study a lot of African Americans informed the researchers that they had multicultural ancestry- but the genes did not reflect this diversity of origin. Perhaps culturally a lot of African Americans feel compelled to claim European ancestry when in reality they have none. The <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_mentality.html" title="Colonial mentality">colonial mentality</a> could be the reason for this. I suspect that a lot of the mixed race Black Americans feel that "all Black people are mixed" because the only Black people they may ever see and interact with are within their historically isolated populations.</p>
<p>So if you mean multiracial as in descended from non African ancestors- then no. Most African Americans certainly do not have Caucasian blood. The study showed that Creoles compose a large part of the multicultural diversity-as most Creoles have Caucasian blood- and without them the mixed race African American population would be even smaller and more isolated than it is today. The belief that African Americans are predominately multicultural is a huge misconception. Perhaps in time this will be the case- but not now. We are a diverse people- city by city you'll see great genetic and cultural differences.</p>
<p>Study the history of African Americans and you'll clearly see that there are a great deal of intra-racial problems that have occurred because of diversity and racial differences within this ethnic group. African Americans with Caucasian ancestry have historically lived in isolation from other African Americans. They were either self imposed to do this or they were forced to due to racism within the Black community. Those who did not do this were regarded as anomalies while growing up because they were such an unfamiliar sight."The Color Complex" by Cathy Russell et Al. can shed some more light on this.</p>
<p>I am in favor of Beyonce being classified as both African American, Creole, or multiracial because she represents a minority within African American diversity. She is one of the many Black entertainers that can have their success attributed to mixed features. Piratescat 06:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I apologize for the misconception. A friend of mine who is an African American Studies major and African American herself had said something like 80% of African Americans whose families have slave origins have at least one caucasian ancestor, and I had heard similar "facts" in the past, though the published studies and books you referenced are more valid than the word of a lay person. Sorry about that. I suppose then Beyonce is multiracial. Thanks for clearing that up. Nrclptkrkr41 05:21, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Beyonce wouldn't be considered mixed or multiracial. That just the image she makes of herself.. She isn't even Creole. Unless Tina's father was white..she isn't either..she'd be multiracial. A multiracial person is= 1 or both parents are biracial. A Creole is more white than black..example a mulatta mom white dad., the white being French or spanish or a mix of the two...it isn't every light skinned black with a french surname. It's like whites who claim "native" blood..it doesn't count if your grandmother was part..that is too far..that's ethnic cleansing Almost all white Europeans have Asian blood..Indo-European,Celtic so on but they are not seen as mixed or even Asians to anyone..just white lower class whites...while in the black world it's reversed. m~sierra</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Another Point of View</b></dd>
<dd>Many Africans that were brought to the New World, too, were already mixed across ethic/racial lines. So, non-negro bloodlines were presence in many since sub-Saharan groups already had experienced years of ethnic fusion with Persian, Arabic, Syrian, Semetic, and Asian groups. You will find lingustic and cultural influences among Indigenous sub-Sarhan Africans of other regions that have existed for eons. This aspect of their societies wasn't the only part of them left behind. So the Caucasian ancestry could have been introduced in one's bloodline way before their African ancestors set foot on American soil. Doesn't mean they showed apparent signs of having caucasian ancestors, either.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, there I feel there is a difference between being multi-ethnic and multi-racial. Being that most of Beyonce's recent forefather probably identified as either Black or Creole, I'd consider her a multi-ethnic Bi-racial woman who identifies as being Black. However in the singer Vanessa Williams' case, who has a similar blended aesthetic appearance, it has been implied that all of her recent ancestors identified as Black people, despite no being full-blooded sub-Saharan types. I'd consider her a multi-ethnic Black woman due to her distant muli-ethic heritage and her current inherited racial identity.</dd>

<p>Beyoncé is a light skinned Black woman just like her mother, get over it people. [Nita 12:10am CST September 25, 2006]</p>
<p><i><b>Hypocracy?</b></i> I feel that this use of the term Mulatto is not politically correct. I am disturbed that wikipedia.org would apply this terminology when there are so many other non-controversial ethinic descriptions available. There are other living persons notated in wikipedia that state the ethnicity of a person as being multiracial or of mixed race. A "race of black people" were kidnapped and brought to the Americas in chains during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. In slavery this "race of black people" were treated like cattle or property. If a slave-owner (Caucasian, Dutch, Spanish, etc.)desired sexual relations, [which according to the antibellum social code he would not get from his wife]blatantly went out the to slave cabins and 'took' a slave woman and satisfied himself. This led to the insiduous inbreeding that has produced the mixed race of known as "Mulatto". There are other negative and pejorative terms for this mixed race of peoples [octaroon, quadroon, red, high yellow] High yellow is described in the wikipedia article referenced here-- High Yella or High Yellow: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_yellow" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_yellow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_yellow</a></p>
<p>To clear up this freudian slip please reference the wikipedia article 'Glossary of terms for multiraciality': <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terms_for_multiraciality" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terms_for_multiraciality" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terms_for_multiraciality</a> it contains a list of non-offensive ethnic descriptions.</p>
<p>For sometime now I have considered wikipedia.org as somewhat of an internet authority. From time to time I refer to this site for personal knowledge and current information. I now question the significance and validity of any information listed here. SxzBlu 09:43, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mulatto is not politically correct?? It never bother me.. It's like the term "Native American"..this is only correct to whites us with indian blood call ourselves indian..it's white folks who claim to be offended..the ones who doesn't have enough of that ethnic blood ..the ones who have to tell people or you wouldn't know..who feels the need to fight others who use these words. m~sierra</p>

<p>The human race is one and we have all been interbreeding for centuries. Whenever two races meet a significant minority will interbreed with no necessary ill effects. Indeed what is the American race? What is the European race? The whole concept of race is dubious these days. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyTheFatCat_c201.html" title="User:SmokeyTheFatCat">SmokeyTheFatCat</a> 22:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a whole huge discussion on this issue anywhere on Wikipedia that involves categories or lists of "multiracial" people. You may want to join that discussion (and possibly consider the issue sufficiently raised here — soon there will be no room to discuss anything else about the article, and we've pretty much gotten off the discussion of these terms as related specifically to Knowles, anyway). <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 21:35, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The group, then named "Girl's Tyme", were heartbroken after averaging only three stars (out of a possible four), losing the competition.

<p>Once again, 11 Million is an inflated number. That article is the press release but with minor revision. Record labels inflate sales in press releases and throughout the media because of the current state of the industry.</p>
<p>DIL sold 4.4 Million in the U.S. DIL did not perform as well as it did the states. However, the album did well in major markets such as the U.K., Germany, and Australia. 11 Million just isn't a realistic amount. I'm going to go with the more probable amount of 8.5 Million.</p>

<p>Actually... It sold 6 million in 2003... that is what it says on the timeline. I have read other sites stating sales of 14 million +, but I believe 11 million is much more realistic (think about it, it spawned one of the biggest hits "Crazy In Love")</p>

<p>I think that <i>Check on It</i> should have pop in the genre. The song is a kind of bubblegum.

<p>Is Creole really a single? I uploaded a better promotional photo than the over sexy one and Beyoncé is R&amp;B and pop singer not soul. Someone is very wrong.

<li>Okay. The official numbers are NO LESS than 11 million. Access Hollywood - earlier this year stated that AT LEAST 11 million were sold. So these reports of 8 million are OUTDATED. Think about it - if it sold 6 million WW in 2003 alone - BEFORE "Me Myself And I" and "Naughty Girl", 11 million is DEFINATELY an acceptable number concerning the worldwide success of "Crazy In Love" and "Naughty Girl"<br />

<p>No, No, No! These values are sales inflation, go to official music world wide scan like, united world charts, media traffic, soundScan, EPBI and you'll see how much the album have sold, 16 million it is impossible, I'll say once again columbia did not manage to produce to many copies, there is no demand, the album sold about 8 million, go to beyoncé official site and there is showing how much the album sold</p>

<p>Eduemoni - you are reporting the wrong person for the 16 million vandalism - someone else was the one who originally posted the number -- not who you think it is (they e-mailed me and asked me to explain this to you because they say you keep warning them) Anyway - sales are NOT 16 million as I have only heard that cited on www.BeyonceWorld.net. Sales around 9-12 million seem a bit more accurate. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirby2725_e592.html" title="User:Kirby2725">Kirby2725</a> 15:49, 16 October 2006</p>
<p>Ok - Beyonce's timeline lists that as of 2006 (BEFORE the release of B'day) she had a worldwide career sales of over 50 million units. As it has been proven that Destiny's Child (as a group without solo sales) has sold 39 million units worldwide.<br />
50 Million Career Sales<br />
-<u>39 with Destiny's Child</u><br />
11 Million Solo sales<br />
Which means that as of 2006 Dangerously in Love HAD in fact sold 11 million units. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirby2725_e592.html" title="User:Kirby2725">Kirby2725</a> 18:13, 16 October 2006</p>

<p>I strongy believe Beyonce is a R&amp;B AND pop artist. Her music has strong pop influences; it is very incorrect to label her as a pure R&amp;B artist.

<dd>I don't feel strongly about it either way, but let me just say that Junkie's obsession with dumping/swiping genres is very annoying. He's doing it repeatedly and obsessively, and minus edits summaries. In particular, he seems to think <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Timberlake_c6d4.html" title="Justin Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> isn't an R&amp;B artist, even tho most of his solo singles chart on U.S. R&amp;B and his album debuted at #1 on U.S. R&amp;B.

<dd>Yes, I have noticed this as well. The user seems to have personal views on what genre(s) certain artists fit into and while that is fine, these views are not in line with popular belief, and are in turn POV. The R&amp;B genre should definitely be included in the Justin Timberlake article. The user has been asked many times to stop removing genres, since February 2006 when he was editing with <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E200.138.194.254.html" title="User:200.138.194.254">200.138.194.254</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/User_talk%7E200.138.194.254.html" title="User talk:200.138.194.254">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_200.138.194.254_0d4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/200.138.194.254">contribs</a>). --<a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusicpvm_88b6.html" title="User:Musicpvm">musicpvm</a> 21:27, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I don't see anything pop on Beyoncé's music. Just because she has some danceable songs? As I've already said before, she has more soul songs than pop ones (although she's not as soulful as Alicia Keys, for example). I mean, her <i>Dangerously In Love</i> samples many soul songs. If you considered all genres Beyoncé has recorded on, you'd also have to include funk ("Work It Out," "Creole," and even "Crazy In Love" and "Check On It" have some funk influences). So I'd say Beyoncé's a pure R&amp;B musician. Her music sounds too much like Amerie's one, which is also an R&amp;B-only artist. If you compare Beyoncé's music with Destiny's Child's one, you'll see notable differences – Destiny's Child has this hip-hop-sounding R&amp;B/pop style. And if you compare it with actual pop-R&amp;B singers' one, you'll also see differences. As for Justin Timberlake, I did NOT create that sockpuppet. Just because he/she has the same opinion as mine? Anyway, I don't want edit wars, I just want to be in peace with everyone. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunk_Junkie_3b3d.html" title="User:Funk Junkie">Funk Junkie</a> 23:13, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't want to seem frivolous or unencyclopedic, but ... to have an article of this length and detail and not mention that Knowles has been publically noted as a "best-dressed" celebrity seems a little funny, especially in light of the notable detail that her mother designs most of her clothes, very unusual among the rich and famous. I didn't put it in myself because I didn't see an appropriate place to note it without watering down the article, and because I don't have the source in front of me. The article in <i>People</i> (2006, I believe) had a stunning picture of a purple iris dress; if there is a GFDL picture of the singer wearing the same dress, it would be a good addition. Again, not trying to weigh down the article with trivialities or overshadow her entertainment career with something superficial; it simply seems worth noting at <i>some point</i> in the article. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 21:35, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong - I absolutely love the song and it is great that it has been so successful, but I believe that it shouldn't be placed into her "Singles" category until it has officially been released as a single. --<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirby2725_e592.html" title="User:Kirby2725">Kirby2725</a> 00:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think its necessary to give single information for non-mainstream official releases. 'Upgrade U' has not been yet officially confirmed to be released. 'Dangerously In Love 2' was released only to radio with no music video - and was not a mainstream released single. Her mainstream releases were 'Work It Out', '03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde", "Crazy In Love", "Baby Boy", "Me, Myself and I", "Check On It", "Deja Vu", "Ring The Alarm", "Irreplaceable" and soon to be "Listen" (assuming they release it to the mainstream audience, which they may not due to the current success of "Irreplaceable") .<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirby2725_e592.html" title="User:Kirby2725">Kirby2725</a> 23:27, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Number 1 her birth records are private and should not be put into the public without her consent. Number 2 THAT'S HER DAMN BUSINESS. (Personally if it's true I think it would be great.)It would explain why she's dating a 35 year old Jay Z.(NitaReads 21:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>It seems like another internet hoax to me. Honestly, there has been videography of Beyoncé and <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Rowland_e89b.html" title="Kelly Rowland">Kelly Rowland</a> when they were children. Kelly's birth year is noted as February 11, 1981, putting her birth seven months prior than Beyoncé's September 4, 1981 birth. If she was really 32, when Kelly was 8, Beyoncé would have been 15. Destiny's Child's released home videos clearly dispute these false allegations of her age, Beyoncé, Kelly, LaTavia, and LeToya are clearly close to one another in age.

<dd>As long as the reports regarding the dispute over her age is in the public arena, particularly attached to apaprently official Texas documents (which, frankly, are public records and therefore available for viewing or by order), it should be included in the article, even with a caveat.204.126.251.245 16:14, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>everyone can see the records for themselves on the public govt documents provided on USA people search, which has two different beyonce's born to the same parent, one is 26 and the other is 33. i think they falsified it, because they all i have been born on the same year as Britney Spears, who was popular at the time because of her youth, so they all wanted to fall into that band wagon.--Juju 18:35, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you please sign your comments by typing four tildes (~). Also can you elaborate? I saw the nuclear attack message and it looked alarmingly real.

<p>Thanks for the tildes, I forgot how to do that. It looked VERY real, I did look into it right away. I've only ever seen it on this page and I haven't looked at the edit history. If it's not there, I can only imagine it was because it wasn't entered in manually. As I mentioned earlier, it seemed automated.24.68.226.166 05:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
