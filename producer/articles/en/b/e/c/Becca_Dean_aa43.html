<p>Becca arrived in Hollyoaks as an undergraduate in 2001. She was a naïve fresher who forged a relationship with fellow student <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Nash_53e7.html" title="Jamie Nash">Jamie Nash</a>. The pair began to date but Jamie was a love rat who two-timed her with her best friend Eve Crawford. When Becca found out she dumped him but despite this, Becca always saw a different side to Jamie and shortly they got back together, but it didn't last. He was tragically killed in the minibus accident on a potholeing trip, which also killed <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_Sankofa_330b.html" title="Theo Sankofa">Theo Sankofa</a>.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Becca discovered she was pregnant with Jamie's baby. Feeling she was not ready for motherhood, Becca had an abortion against the advice of Jamie's sister, Jodie.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/c/Becca_Dean_aa43.html" title="Edit section: Unlucky in love">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unlucky in love</span></h3>
<p>She later embarked on a relationship with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Bell_%28Hollyoaks%29_5bdd.html" title="Alex Bell (Hollyoaks)">Alex Bell</a> but things were complicated. Alex had a strained relationship with <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Green_0d51.html" title="Anna Green">Anna Green</a>, the mother of his son, Charlie. Alex used Becca to make Anna jealous which worked as Anna blamed Becca for the tension between herself and Alex. Sadly, for Becca this relationship ended when Alex decided to take a job in Hong Kong. Her next relationship was with <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Morgan_%28Hollyoaks%29_6113.html" title="Adam Morgan (Hollyoaks)">Adam Morgan</a>, who was recovering from the car accident caused by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_Hutchinson_1254.html" title="Mandy Hutchinson">Mandy Richardson</a> that landed him in a wheelchair. Becca provided unlimited support through Adam's time of need. Becca was distraught when Adam accepted a place at a film school in New York. She begged him to stay, but her pleas were all in vain, as Adam went anyway. At one point Becca even enjoyed a brief liaison with local firefighter <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Davies_%28Hollyoaks%29_6654.html" title="Ben Davies (Hollyoaks)">Ben Davies</a>, the best friend of her future husband <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Dean_1f1a.html" title="Jake Dean">Jake Dean</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/c/Becca_Dean_aa43.html" title="Edit section: Relationship with Jake Dean">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Jake Dean</span></h3>
<p>Becca and Jake have experienced tension in their relationship; most recently, after Jake found out she had been visiting ex-student Justin, who had an unrequited crush on her, in prison and most notably when Jake had an affair with <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Hunter_c05f.html" title="Lisa Hunter">Lisa Hunter</a> that resulted in him passing on an STD. Although the affair ended when Jake realised he was madly in love with Becca, the guilt proved too much and his first marriage proposal became a confession. The two broke up but Jake was determined to win Becca back and did so with a knight in shining armour style proposal in the village. The two married although Becca still feared she was making a mistake up until she said 'I do'.</p>
<p>The marriage suffered problems almost immediately, as Becca feared she had made a mistake and Jake's possessive behaviour increased when she visited her pupil <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Burton_4578.html" title="Justin Burton">Justin Burton</a> in prison after being pressurized by his sisters. Jake also had money troubles following his parents’ disastrous mortgage, felt he had let Becca down, while Becca felt her marriage was a mistake, and felt trapped and alone.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/c/Becca_Dean_aa43.html" title="Edit section: Relationship with Justin Burton">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Justin Burton</span></h3>
<p>On Christmas Eve 2005 she went to Justin's house and admitted she was jealous when she found out he had slept with Nicole (even though he hadn't) and this led to a passionate kiss. The next day she went back after spending most of Christmas Day playing happy families with the Deans. They slept together and she later told him it was a mistake even though it was obvious she still had feelings for him.</p>
<p>Becca told Jake that it would be a good idea for them to start a family together, which she would later regret as having children with Jake became the last thing on her mind. She told Mandy she had had an affair with a teacher, Mandy later found out the identity of her teenage lover. When Justin told her he was leaving, she begged him to stay. She later claimed this was from an academic viewpoint only. The affair with Justin started up again on St. Valentine's Day leading her to be torn between two men who both loved her desperately but in different ways. The shock news of her beloved father's death left her feeling more confused and distraught than ever. Nancy was very angry with Becca because she went to see Mr. Hayton before he died, when in fact, Becca had intended to go to see Mr. Hayton so that she could spend a weekend with Justin, which she later regretted.</p>
<p>Becca fell pregnant and did not know who the father was. Viewers witnessed Jake's violent streak, having raised a fist to Becca (and attacking Justin) after learning of her affair. Becca then slept with Justin again, then later attempted suicide before admitting her love for him. She decided to keep the child and raise it with Justin, who moved in with her - a decision that angered Nancy when she was not consulted first.</p>
<p>She lost her job as a teacher after the school became aware of her relationship with Justin, and for a short while she and Justin struggled financially living off his child benefit and wages from his job at Il Gnosh. They were briefly engaged (Justin having proposed with a ring bought with Becca's credit card) until Becca finally tired of his immaturity and ended the relationship, kicking him out of the flat.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/c/Becca_Dean_aa43.html" title="Edit section: Unjustly Arrested">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unjustly Arrested</span></h3>
<p>Enraged, Justin went to the Police and made false statements accusing Becca of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_grooming.html" title="Child grooming">child grooming</a>, being a sexual predator and statutory child rape. He claimed that Becca had pursued him for months and forced him to have sex with her when he was only 15 years old. If found guilty Becca could have received 14 years penal servitude and consequently could have been forced to have her child adopted.</p>
<p>However she received a custodial sentence of two years. She went into labour as the verdict was announced and gave birth to a boy named Charlie. When Jake came to see Becca in prison, they agreed that Jake would care for Charlie until she was released from prison. However, at the end of the visiting session, she could not part with her newborn son and took Charlie with her to grow up in prison. As she walked off after abusing their agreement, Jake was left distraught and furious that his (potential) son had been taken away from him. Now that Jake is unable to care for the baby he is certain to be his. He doesn't want his supposed son to be brought up in prison or to be adopted. He thinks it will be best for Becca to let Jake look after him. Even though Becca doesn't want to be parted from her son, she knows that prison is no place for a baby. She decides to give the baby to Jake. On Jakes next visit to the prison, Becca is angry with Jake for letting her child be kidnapped. Eventually Becca and Jake agree they want to be a family again, when Becca comes out of prison.</p>

<p>During a drunken night at the Loft Justin admitted to Warren how he falsely had Becca imprisoned. A disgusted Warren ordered Justin to inform the Police. Justin went to visit Becca in prison and made a promise to have her released. As she was awaiting the decision of her release, Becca was brutally attacked by her cell mate, Fran, in a fight that would later prove fatal. She was rushed to hospital with Jake and Nancy by her side. Becca made Nancy promise she would sit her A levels and Jake told Becca he loved and forgave her.</p>
<p>Becca died at 11:45 AM on February 15th 2007 of internal bleeding.</p>
