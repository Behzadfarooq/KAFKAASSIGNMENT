<p>The Article mentions all sorts of sources about Becky's Israeli origins. I assume this has something to do with her playing a Jewish girl on "Joan of Arcadia", however there is absolutely no base for that in fact. In fact a second-hand-quoted article I found quoted on IMDB states that. I suggest this article be revised... <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906345/board/nest/13585744" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906345/board/nest/13585744" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906345/board/nest/13585744</a> --SeeFood 17:21, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
She is not Jewish (<a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/searchview.php?id=13281" class="external free" title="http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/searchview.php?id=13281" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/searchview.php?id=13281</a>). I am going to revise this whole birthdate/place section; that article says she's a Chicagoan.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 07:54, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

As the person who originally quoted the IMDB piece here, I do want to note that if you go in now IMDB changed the whole bit about "Sivan" being the real name and being born in Israel. I did note that most biographical info on her at the time was sketchy and contradicting.</p>
<p>While I believe the article that you noted and that the whole thing about Becky being Jewish and from Israel was in error, I do want to note that even in this day and age, some actors/actresses are very coy in interviews about being Jewish or even simply of Jewish "descent". Howard Stern claimed he was only "half Jewish" until some celebrity biographers dug dirt and took him to task and he admitted otherwise. Ironically, Sarah Michelle Gellar claimed the same thing until Howard Stern grilled her on his show as well (in reality, she is of full "Jewish descent", but it appears she and her mother converted to Christianity). Actress Gina Gershon also denied that she was Jewish for a long time. So sometimes you really can't believe anything you read regarding this matter.</p>

<dd>Hey Hairymon! I remember you from the List of Jews thread. Remember you asked me about Neve Campbell and some of the July bombing victims? I was an anon back then. It's true some celebrities are "coy" in a sense, although I would disagree about Gershon. She just was never really asked her religion, and I've seen plenty of mentions about her being Jewish in recent years, if she was once really coy she certainly isn't anymore. I don't think Gellar converted to Christianity, or else she would have told Stern about it in March '99 when he really drilled her about it. Stern claimed to be half Jewish so that anti-Semites won't call in and criticize him for being Jewish. He explained that on Larry King. As for Wahlstrom, she is really minor-level and I seriously doubt she would give an interview with the Jewish Journal just to deny that she's Jewish. If anything, she's coy about being NON-Jewish! Hence the Israel rumours, etc. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 00:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't go through these too often so sorry for taking so long to respond.</p>
<p>If you read my piece above, I don't think Becky W. is being coy at all and that the whole Jewish/Israeli thing was probably some Internet rumor related to her character on Joan. I was just noting the coy thing in general. I also agree with you that Gina Gershon probably was never really asked it, so it's not really being "coy".....but I actually got the "coy" bit from some articles about her which didn't give specifics on how she was "coy".</p>
<p>You may be right about Stern but I disagree about Sarah Michelle Gellar. Though I'm a bit tired to go back and bookmark them right now, there are lots of articles about her "antics" (I put that in quotes because I honestly think what she does is her business and I don't care). She has worn crosses at some interviews and in an interview with her mother her mom claimed the whole conversion bit. Some say that it's all fake and some big spite thing against her father, who I think left when she was a toddler and who she supposedly has no contact with and has utter hate for. I also think no matter how much she was grilled by Howard Stern she's not going to say conversion, etc. for ironically the same reasons that Howard did the half-Jewish bit; just like Howard didn't want to get anti-Semite calls, maybe Sarah didn't want to get "hate mail" from the kind of people who think things like "every Jew who intermarries is a 'traitor'", or stupid statements like "Hitler couldn't kill us, but you will on your own 'free will'". Again, I was just stating what is out there and this is my theory on Sarah Michelle Gellar.</p>
