<p>Does anybody have any specific references to a row with Wayne Coyne? I've found a few stories out there, most notably <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/flaming%20lips%20frontman%20confused%20by%20beck.s%20oddness" class="external text" title="http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/flaming%20lips%20frontman%20confused%20by%20beck.s%20oddness" rel="nofollow">this ContactMusic story</a>, but it hardly seems substantive enough to be included in an encyclopedia article. Is this it, or are there other stories out there? <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagicmat_a07a.html" title="User:Magicmat">Matt T.</a> 04:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can somebody cite references for the whole bit about Mutations originally being planned for Bongload and Geffen releasing it against his will? I'm not really doubting it, but I don't recall hearing about this before.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added two; the story has been widely reported. I made a revision to the article, because it said Geffen released it without Beck's permission. Geffen had a legal right to release the album, so it didn't need Beck's permission. But there's no question that Beck had intended for it to be released on Bong Load. If the two cites I provided don't satisfy the need for documentation, I believe I can find others after some more digging. Candy 04:51, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"He has been described as a modern-day Prince, albeit to a lesser creative extent)." Being compared to Prince is not entirely scholarly, but saying people are "compared" to other people is commonly done so we can let that slide. However, to add "albeit to a lesser creative extent" is VERY uncscholarly. A comparison is an opinion, but the level of creativity is comepletely subjective. If Beck is compared to Prince that can be proven, therefore fact. Lesser creative extent should be omitted.</p>
<p>I have this to say about beck. only that he is the greatest musician since. . .ever. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBLARG%21%21_56ae.html" title="User:BLARG!!">BLARG!!</a></p>

<p>The part referencing his appearance on SpaceGhost should be deleted, or edited. The episode they referenced is called "Knifin' Around" and had Thom Yorke, not Beck, as the guest other than Bjork on it.</p>
<p><br />
Beck did appear on Space Ghost though. It was in episode 36, "Edelweiss" <a href="http://snard.com/sg/guide/?ep=36&amp;fmt=0" class="external free" title="http://snard.com/sg/guide/?ep=36&amp;fmt=0" rel="nofollow">http://snard.com/sg/guide/?ep=36&amp;fmt=0</a> . Ja2ke 02:00, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a great article, but I've found one small piece of information that is not true; Johnny Cash never rejected 'Sing it again,' because it never was submitted to him; Beck considered it to be 'rubbish,' (his precise words) according to an interview back in '95. So, I've just straightened that out.Drom 00:24, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Removed a reference to the Scientology rumor; not only was it badly formatted, but it has been debated to death on usenet and on Beck's old bbs.

<dd>From the NY times magazine (3/6/05): "Like his wife and his father, Beck is a Scientologist." It goes into more detail too.

<dd>Was absent. I added it to the "trivia" section.
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to edit the Scientologist reference. I have never come across any reference to him identifying himself as such. While it is true that many close to him are admitted Scientologists, I have not seen anything in which he states an association with the organization. Whether he is or not, I could not say, but the man keeps many personal issues (his relationship with Leigh Limon, his marriage to Marissa Ribisi and their child, his religious affiliation) out of the press. He has his webmaster, Truck, discourage such discussion on the official Beck bulletin board system. If you show me a reliable source indicating a self-declared affiliation with CoS, I'll relent. (If it's in the NYTimes.com article, could send me a copy? It requires payment now, not just registration.) (One more note: Beck's MySpace profile, which was created by Truck and Interscope, shows J.R. "Bob" Dobbs of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_SubGenius_4efb.html" title="Church of the SubGenius">Church of the SubGenius</a> in the background, perhaps a goof on the Church of Scientology (both CoS)). <a href="../../../c/i/g/User%7ECigarette_faa9.html" title="User:Cigarette">Cigarette</a> 22:00, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am editing the scientology reference to put it into the biography section and to give it its own section. A person's religious membership is very unlikely to be a "trivial" part of their life, no matter how uncomfortable that particular religion might make some people.</dd>

<dd>I've found no proof on any sources of Beck being a Scientologist, provide a <i>free</i> source for everyone and we'll put it up. The links that are free just describe possibilities of Beck being a Scientologist, and none seem true or factual. This all seems like crap to me, so please provide the best information you can, because this all seems like myth and legend, stories and lies. You know, some people still think Hilter is alive, under the ice caps of the Artitic, waiting... but you know what, no proof. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillsy_23c0.html" title="User:Willsy">willsy</a> 20:20 10, February 2006</dd>

<p>The Scientology section reads as though the Sunday Tribune interview was the first time Beck confirmed the rumors that he was a Scientologist. However, the New York Times interview of March 6, 2005, predated the Tribune interview by three months. I would like to revise the section to reflect that. But that is a fairly big revision so I thought I would post about it here to see if there is any objection. By the way, re comment by willsy above, the NY Times is a free site (though it does require registration). Beck has commented on the fact that he is a Scientologist in a handful of interviews by now; it is an established fact. Candy 07:36, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I edited the reference to Marissa Ribisi that said she has "gone so far as to maintaining" her Scientology website. Those websites were all done several years ago and they are mostly outdated; hers definitely is, so it's not in any sense maintained. Also, having one of those sites doesn't suggest any particular extent of involvement (as implied by "gone so far"). Many people created those pages at lower levels. If one wants to make a point about the extent of her involvement, it would be more meaningful to cite the level she has reached (Clear) and her 18 years of steady involvement. I don't think that's necessary, though, in a Wiki entry on her husband. Candy 22:54, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just realized the article referred to "many public denials" by Beck that he was a Scientologist. This actually, as far as I know, is not true. In 2000 a reporter wrote, in an article based on an interview with Beck, that he was not a Scientologist, but she did not explicitly state that he had denied it to her; even if you infer that he told her that, it's still only one time. I've read a huge number of interviews with him and never seen him quoted as denying he was a Scientologist, though for a time he did refuse to answer questions about it. If anyone can provide citations for actual quotes by Beck denying it, please do. Until then I think "many" is inaccurate. Candy 05:52, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just removed a section somebody wrote about the lyrics to Exoskeleton being a Scientology reference. Beck has stated a number of times that the speech in question is a dialogue between Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers about what the ultimate album / album of the future would be like. Furthermore, on the message boards at Stewoo.net, Beck's bassist Justin-Meldal Johnsen confirmed that none of the lyrics on The Information were about Scientology. Finally, the text I deleted was pure speculation, which has no place in an encyclopedia. Dnewton 19:36, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think its from Jewish law/custom, I'm not sure the correct term, where being a Jew depends on if your mother is jewish. (David Cross does a bit about it.) Although I thought I read somewhere that Beck's mother wasn't Jewish, but experimented with it. I'm not sure if it matters. At any rate, I don't think he self-identifies as Jewish. That list has a few discrepancies if you look at it, it includes people who have Jewish fathers, not technically Jews by in the strictest sense, and it also has people who don't self-identify as being Jews. Anyone feel free to correct me if and where I'm wrong. --<a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKanadier_af07.html" title="User:Kanadier">kanadier</a> 05:54, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sometime in the late 90's I saw a bit on MTV News about Beck and the Beastie Boys, and it was mentioned that Beck was Jewish. Whether or not he has ever been a practicing Jew, I'm pretty sure that he identifies as such, at least on some level. I'm not sure if his mother converted when she "experimented" with Judaism or not, but if she did, that would make Beck Jewish by default. The Opressed One 15:24, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>85.250.13.19 10:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)Can someone please explain, why famous people always get a credit of being jewish in Wikipedia? I mean, if someone has any of jewish roots, even as distant as "paternal great-grandmother", as Beck, Wikipedia's articles always mention it in the first place. On the other hand, one can rarely see mentioning of other nation's ancestry. Thanks to the authors of Beck's article, they did mention his Swedish and Norwegian roots. But sadly, authors of the various other articles on famous people aren't so impartial. Please, explain that phenomenon to me. Sopostelnik 12:37, 21 February 2007</p>

<p>Beck is not a jew. He likes to say he is because scientologists think that saying so will open them doors to success. Scientologists are fucking nuts and believe in conspiracy theories (the jewish control over Hollywood and the media), so they try to befriend jews or lie about being one.</p>

<p>Chris, there is no reliable source for Beck's birthplace being Africa. (I have never even seen that mentioned as a possibility until I came here!) On the other hand, there's a plethora of sources for L.A. I believe his mother has even been quoted on that subject, and if anyone would know, she would. If you want more backup on that I will find it for you, but it is clear that you have found a number of L.A. citations yourself. I think it's safe to trust them.</p>

<p>I've edited the paragraph about <i>The Information</i> down because of numerous outdated and conflicting attempts to include the latest news. (For instance, there was contradictory info about which song would be the first single and which songs and videos were currently on the official Beck website.) It's generally a good idea, when you add new copy, to make sure outdated copy in that area is removed. Also, since the official website frequently changes the videos and songs it has posted, trying to keep tabs on what is posted there, and when, is a ceaseless task and not very helpful if the info is not kept up-to-date. Also, I think that sort of news is outside the general scope of Wikipedia; if I'm wrong about that please don't hesitate to correct me. Candy 13:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Re: as far as I know, Beck is not a poet; if he is, pls provide cite</p>
<p>I didn't put in the original "poet" text, but I will defend it.</p>
<p>Beck is a poet. There's a poem he wrote in the liner notes of Mellow Gold, and a couple in the Playing With Matches book. There's also all that talk of the magazine he did as a kid, Youthless, which was suposedly a poetry magazine.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't want to figure out how to put in references, but they do exist. Dnewton 18:02, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was the one who removed it. The fact that someone has written a few poems doesn't seem like basis enough to call him a poet here. Also, as far as I know, copies of Youthless are not available, so we don't actually know what was in it. It seems to me that listing Beck as a poet devalues the term, not because he's not a talented person, but because it suggests that anyone who's written a few poems should be considered a poet. If that were the only the criterion, then I suspect Wikipedia would have to add the word "poet" to descriptions of many people. I'd think that, to be described as a poet, one would have to have a body of work, not jsut a few published poems. Further, I don't think I've ever even seen Beck claim to be a poet (which would at least make me feel that there was a compelling reason to consider listing him as one).

<p>Anon user, if you want to set a standard, Beck's mother was Jewish, and her mother was Jewish, it's stated in the article. A person is Jewish if their mother is Jewish. "According to Halakha (Jewish law), only a convert or a child born to a Jewish mother is counted as Jewish. " See the WP page <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a>. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 06:52, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Halaka (Jewish Law) only refers to the religion. Having a Jewish father does not subtract someone from a Jewish ethnic category. That is why people with Jewish fathers but gentile mothers are still listed as Jews on wikipedia. Beck was not born Jewish by religion. Therefore this is irrelevant. 141.213.212.16 06:58, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His ethnicity has nothing to do with it. Even if he is a Scientologist, a Swedish member of the Church of Satan or a Christian from Belize, he is a Jew by birth according to Halakha. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 07:00, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Halakha Law is not used on wikipedia. People with Jewish fathers are still listed as Jews. If you wish to go by Jewish Law, I suggest you start removing people with Jewish fathers who were not raised in the Jewish religion from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a>. 141.213.212.16 07:06, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By WP standards, Beck is Jewish, even if he is non-practicing. He self-identifies, and has Jewish heritage via his mother. It's enough, and the category should stay. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 07:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you've given up on the Halakha Law argument? He admits he has Jewish ancestry which is not the same as self-identifying. What exactly is he going to do, DENY he has it? If he is non-practicing, wasn't raised in the Jewish religion, and is one-eight Jewish...how on earth can he be considered a Jew (especially if he mother even isn't)?? 141.213.212.16 07:13, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>His mother is Jewish! If his maternal great-grandmother is Jewish, then his grandmother is Jewish, then his mother is Jewish, then he is Jewish. Whether they are Swedish or Swahili, it still applies. The religion of his maternal great-grandfather, et al, doesn't matter, since being Jewish comes from the mother. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 07:20, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can only be Jewish in two ways: ethnically or religiously. There's not some magical element that exists that makes someone Jewish that isn't biological or cultural. Jewish ethnicity is not determined by who your mother is. Ethnicity/genetics are simply the same everywhere - they are from both parents. Jewish religion is, however, matrilineal in the sense that someone born to a Jewish mother TRADITIONALLY adopts the Jewish religion. Since his mother states she was "somewhat" raised Jewish, this can barely qualify her as being a Jew through law. Beck himself was born to when his mother was already a Scientologist, therefore he was not raised in the Jewish religion as it would TRADITIONALLY be held. Please understand. I can't imagine how Judaism can exist outside of religion and ethnicity. 141.213.212.16 07:27, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, if one parent is Swedish, and the other parent is Italian, then what does that make their offspring? If, as you say, Judaism exists as an ethnicity, and Bibi Hansen is Jewish, among other ethnicities, then wouldn't that make Beck Jewish as well, even if he is now a Scientologist? If she is Jewish, from her mother's side, and Spanish from her father's side (as an example), isn't she is still Jewish, as is her son?</p>
<p>Being Jewish ethnically is not the same as being Jewish culturally. Even if I didn't eat latkes at Hanukkah and go to Passover seders, I would still be Jewish by blood. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 07:33, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Beck is also of Swedish, Norwegian, and likely English or Scottish descent too, among god knows how many other ethnicities. Being 1/8th Jewish by blood is not significant enough to merit a category. Notice on Beck isn't in Swedish categories like <a href="../../../s/w/e/Category%7ESwedish_musicians_6185.html" title="Category:Swedish musicians">Category:Swedish musicians</a> or Norwegian categories like <a href="../../../n/o/r/Category%7ENorwegian_musicians_370c.html" title="Category:Norwegian musicians">Category:Norwegian musicians</a> nor is he on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Swedes_7017.html" title="List of Swedes">List of Swedes</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Norwegians_69e3.html" title="List of Norwegians">List of Norwegians</a>. Is having Jewish ancestry somehow more important than the Norwegian and Swedish ancestry, and so that's why we should record it more predominantely? I'm sorry, if the question isn't about religion/culture anymore, then I can't see where this is going anymore. 141.213.212.16 07:47, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it's not. Feel free to add the Swedish-Americans or Norwegian-American categories. That's what they exist for, and there's no limit on the number of categories one person can be placed in. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 20:46, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why do you not feel the need to add them, curiously? There is a limit to when someone has significant Swedish or Norwegian ancestors. It's impossible for me to stress this anymore than I have. Given that Beck is 1/8th Swedish, that's exactly why he's not on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Swedish_Americans_4eb8.html" title="List of Swedish Americans">List of Swedish Americans</a> or <a href="../../../s/w/e/Category%7ESwedish-Americans_c44b.html" title="Category:Swedish-Americans">Category:Swedish-Americans</a>. So why....may I ask...is he in a Jewish-American category when he has the same extent of Jewish heritage? 141.213.212.16 23:40, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If he's not Swedish, and he's not Jewish, then what is he? Ethnicity is made up of lots of smaller parts. What category would you suggest we apply here? <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 23:48, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody is denying he has Swedish and Jewish ancestry. It says it straight in the article for god's sake. If we found out Beck's great great great great grandfather was Chinese, is he a Chinese musician now? No. There is a certain extent to which ancestry is not relevant for categorization. Typically it's at or especially beyond 1/4th descent. 141.213.212.16 01:26, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Who decided that? You? If so, there's a lot of work for you to do, removing people from categories. Mandy Moore is listed on the Jewish musicians page, and she has a Jewish paternal grandfather, and certainly does not identify as Jewish. That's one of many examples. Regardless of how much Jewish ancestry Beck has, (and he certainly has enough to qualify as Jewish) he self-identifies. That should be enough to satisfy you. <a href="../../../c/k/e/User%7ECkessler_bf72.html" title="User:Ckessler">Ckessler</a> 03:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um...it's been decided and implemented on nearly all lists and categories. Do you honestly believe <a href="../../../i/t/a/Category%7EItalian_writers_7000.html" title="Category:Italian writers">Category:Italian writers</a> has every writer who has any Italian descent in their blood? Because the Mandy Moore article slipped through, doesn't mean it will be spared. Point out other examples then. They need to be corrected equally so. 141.213.212.16 05:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Guys, it's very simple. It all depends on what the sources say specifically about each person (and especially since there are a lot of definitions listed on <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a>). Since there is a source that refers to Beck as Jewish - well, Beck himself - in the JVibe interview. And another reference that refers to Beck as "Jewish".<a href="http://www.indexmagazine.com/interviews/bibbe_hansen.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indexmagazine.com/interviews/bibbe_hansen.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> There are no sources that refer to Mandy Moore as Jewish, only her grandfather, so she shouldn't be listed as that. Same thing for the other categories. If there are sources that are reliable and decree Beck as Norwegian-American, Scottish-American, or anything he can be listed as that as well. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 07:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beck is not indie rock, he is on a major label. Please dont add "indie rock" to that long list of genres.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. look at the flaming lips and modest mouse. they're signed to major labels and are still indie rock.</p>
<p>there are WAY too many genres listed. we should make them more general, instead of listing every fuckin genres beck has dabbled in.</p>

<p>In "(2004–present) Guero and The Information" the article says that European customers got "The Information" CD's with both "Inside out" and "This Girl That I Know", however I bought in Germany a CD containing only "Inside out" as an additional track. (I bought a version that included a DVD with all the music videos and Sticker 4 ( <a href="http://www.jeffreyscottbernstein.com/beck/images/sticker4.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jeffreyscottbernstein.com/beck/images/sticker4.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> ) just with the difference that it didn't include a sticker for "This Girl That I Know"). What I want to point out is that probably only British customers got both additional tracks.</p>
