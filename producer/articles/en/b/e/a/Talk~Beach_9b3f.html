<p>I just wanted to let it be known that I greatly expanded the list from various online sources. I tried to sift through tourism sites that had a blatant conflict of interest in promoting certain beaches, but I may have failed. Also, some had ambiguous punctuation leading to uncertainty about what was a beach in which division of what island belong to which country. So some of all that may be wrong, and I won't be offended if it needs to be changed. <a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokerboy_c727.html" title="User:Tokerboy">Tokerboy</a> 05:21 Dec 9, 2002 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(a) could you be more specific about "not encyclopaedic"? You mean it is a taboo subject that one ought not to talk about? Are omissions in other encyclopedias a reason to avoid subjects?

<dd>(a) No no no, nothing of the sort. All I'm saying is that the article is about beaches, not beach towels. Well, you can use a towel for all kinds of things: You can use it to blow your nose, wipe the tears from your eyes, strangle someone, clean an apple you are about to eat, etc. etc. When I say this part is not encyclopaedic I mean that it is irrelevant <b>in this context</b>, not taboo.</dd>

<p>Patrick, this article is rambling and badly written, and contains some silly information, such as the stuff in Beach Use. Are you going to bring the piece up to snuff yourself or are you going to let people like <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> do it?

<dd>I would point out that the entire section on towels, except perhaps a link, belongs under the article on <a href="../../../t/o/w/Towel.html" title="Towel">towels</a>. There is nothing unique about the beach - towel connnection. Towels are more often seen at swimming pools! In Hawaii we prefer to use reed mats (oriental substitute for towel).<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 17:36, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Marshman, the longer I look at the section on Beach Use, the more inane it seems, like it was written by a couple of school kids. I would scrap the whole section. Maybe someday someone can write something meaningful over the history of bathing habits, if that kind of social history is known, but in the meantime... -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 20:30, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--- For Patrick: The most important lesson you can learn about writing is called economy of words. In any article, it is important to present the useful points in as few words as possible. I know this sounds crazy, given an open slate like Wikipedia, but the reason has to do with the reader, not us contributors. Reading takes time, and readers want to "get there" in the shortest way possible. Your text is what we call rambling. It incorporates links just to have links, and text in an attempt to cover everything. Everything remotely having to do with beaches cannot be included in the article on beaches. For example, there is no end (in this deletion instance) of the objects that can be formed of beach sand, so there is no point in listing some and linking to the articles on the real objects. Economy of words says we include only the basics to get the idea across -- "sand castle" achieves that purpose, and provides a link to where beach play of the sand castle sort can be expanded as you or others see fit (still adhering to the principal of economy of words). It is inappropriate to take up lots of space discussing sand play in an article on beaches. The same goes for the presentation on towels. A single line with a link to towels will suffice. Under the towel article, more detail can be provided on this aspect with a link back to beach.-- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 21:27, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since you clearly enjoy writing, I would not want to discourage you one bit. But to become a good writer (and that is not easy) you need to learn by putting your stuff out there and then accepting the brutal edits of others as lessons. That is how I learned, from my professors putting lots of red ink on my efforts. And do not think that others here are not equally quick to knock out stuff I write. It is happening. My attitude is "whoa. There is a lesson for me" not "protect my contribution". - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a></dd>

<dd>Marshman, I thought your points above were very well stated. I believe learning to write good encyclopedia articles means developing a critical eye for what should be included and what not, to produce well-organized, well-written, balanced articles containing the right amount and right kind of information. I also learned an immense amount from people who <i>red-lined</i> my writing efforts in the past. There are some excellent editors here, and we all can learn from each other. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 15:23, 15 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the Wikipedia meta pages can be edited like all the other ones; have a go at it.

<p>I had this sound file my brother created last Christmas when we were at a beach in South Carolina, so I posted it in a Sounds of the Beach section in this article. I figured it would go great somewhere on Wikipedia since making your own nature recording takes care of any copyright concerns.</p>
<p>The file is a little on the large side (1.00MB), but I feel that in it's present state, this .ogg really goes a long way towards making the listener think they're standing there on that beach, which fits in nicely with an article about beaches.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't really sure how to integrate it into this page. I knew I could make a "Sounds of the Beach" article, but I didn't feel like tryping something like that up. If someone wants to in the future, they're free to do it. I also didn't want a sort of "click here" thing sitting somewhere on the page, so I thought I'd just put the file in it's own little section in this article now.</p>

<p>Longest beaches: there is a note in the article text that "longest beach" is claimed by several. Wikipedia has multiple suggestions on this. The Cox's Bazar page says that it (C's B) is. The Marina Beach page says that Marina Beach is the second-longest after Copacabana Beach. The Copacabana page doesn't mention the subject. I am a newcomer to Wikipedia (as you'll notice from the lack of links, and possibly -- although I hope not -- incorrect editing on this page) and don't know where to bring this subject up, since there are at least three conflicting pages. Should I create a note on each page, or will this one suffice? I certainly don't know the right "answer" for this, so I can't do the useful thing and go and edit the pages I think are wrong. --<a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">telsa</a> except I don't seem to be logged in, sorry, 2004-12-27.</p>

<dd>I'm unable to determine what your question is? Is it where to write this note? Looks ok here.

<p>According to many tourist guides, Marina beach is the longest or second longest beach in the world. This just seems to be nonsense to me, there are so many beaches that are said to be longer. 12 km is not that long at all.</p>

<p>The sunset picture is gorgeous and may find usefulness somewhere. But this is an encyclopedia, not a place to promote travel destinations or your favorate snapshot. This is an article on beaches. The sunset picture shows a sunset, not a beach, and is therefore not approriate for this article. Also, addition of commercial links is generally considered poor form. Beaches of India may be valuable for an article on India? - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 19:26, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm trying to write articles about the beaches in here, but there's no real dividing line between most of them, but they have different names, sometimes the same beach has two or three names, despite being the same beach with no rocks dividing even the waters. What are the possible divisions between beaches? rivulets? Rocks (throughout the beach or just in the boundary between the water and the sand? any idea?!--<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 14:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The beach-dune system is still poorly understood and often misunderstood, reason why we devoted a large chapter on it in our section on oceanography. See <a href="http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/beach.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/beach.htm" rel="nofollow">Dunes &amp; Beaches</a></p>
<p>This chapter leads on to controversial discoveries about why we are losing our beaches. Although this part has not been confirmed by mainstream science, it nonetheless forms an important challenge to our (scientists') understanding, which is important for all. <a href="http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/beachgo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/beachgo.htm" rel="nofollow">Disappearing Beaches</a></p>
<p>I suggest placing links to these chapters in related headings of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Seafriends is a non-profit charitable organization for saving the sea (and beaches). Feedback appreciated. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloor_Anthoni_ec1a.html" title="User:Floor Anthoni">Floor Anthoni</a> 01:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
