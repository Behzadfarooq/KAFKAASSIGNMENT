<p>Around <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, Beanie Sigel was involved in an incident that stemmed from Jadakiss claiming rappers from Sigel's home city of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> got their style &amp; flow from Jada.

<p>The incident continued even after <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Simmons_b7e8.html" title="Russell Simmons">Russell Simmons</a>, owner at the time of <a href="../../../d/e/f/Def_Jam_80c2.html" title="Def Jam">Def Jam</a> (the label which Jay-Z's <a href="../../../r/o/c/Roc-A-Fella_e4b5.html" title="Roc-A-Fella">Roc-A-Fella</a> was under and Ruff Ryders was affiliated with through DMX) forced the two to declare a brief truce.

<p>While he was in jail, it is said that none of the State Property members except for Oschino came to visit him. He told Dame to pass the word on that State Property was no longer in effect, until after he was released. When the split between Roc-A-Fella owners occurred, Dame made it clear that Beanie's intentions were to move State Property to his new <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Dash_Music_Group_0a72.html" title="Dame Dash Music Group">Dame Dash Music Group</a>.</p>
<p>However, only 4 out of the other 6 members chose to move to the record label. Oschino and Omillio wanted to stay on Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam records with Jay-Z. When questioned, they claimed they were signed by Jay and never needed State Property or Beanie Sigel to make them popular. When he was released from jail, Sigel had a few choice words for his friends, claiming "I still love them like brothers... I just don't know if we can make music again."</p>
<p>It was thought that Sigel had chosen to sign with Dame; however, this is unclear, as he was present at <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay-Z_fefb.html" title="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>'s <b>I Declare War</b> concert in 2005. He recently stated his next Def Jam release would be a mixtape, which would fulfill his contract with them. He is currently working on his new album, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Solution_%28album%29_aaea.html" title="The Solution (album)">The Solution</a>.</p>
<p>It appears Beans has chosen to side with Jay-Z after all, as he recently stated that he would never work with Dame Dash again <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HNVmuERf4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HNVmuERf4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and several members of Roc-a-Fella appeared at his birthday party. <a href="http://board.rapbasement.com/showthread.php?p=6114557#post6114557" class="external autonumber" title="http://board.rapbasement.com/showthread.php?p=6114557#post6114557" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He has confirmed that he is still a member of Roc-a-Fella via a radio interview. <a href="http://www.zshare.net/audio/dj_absolut-beanie_sigel_phonecall-onsmash-com-allister-mp3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zshare.net/audio/dj_absolut-beanie_sigel_phonecall-onsmash-com-allister-mp3.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>In September, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, a jury acquitted him of charges that he nearly shot to death a man on a crowded city street two years prior. In August, Sigel left federal prison after serving nearly a year on a federal weapons charge that stemmed from a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> traffic stop in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>Sigel also has fallen behind in child-support payments. He was briefly jailed in November until he paid $27,000 in child support and $2,000 in fines, but seems to be paying off his debts.</p>
<p>With the case behind him, Sigel now plans to "make music, make movies and work on his clothing line," said his attorney, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortunato_N._Perri_Jr._8f80.html" title="Fortunato N. Perri Jr.">Fortunato N. Perri Jr.</a> The case was the last in a series of criminal charges against Sigel, who has a long arrest record dating back to his days growing up in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Philadelphia_3cb3.html" title="South Philadelphia">South Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Sigel was convicted of assault for a fight in 2003. He agreed with the prosecutor's version of events, and was convicted of misdemeanor simple assault. He was immediately sentenced to two years probation plus $180 in court costs.</p>
<p>The charges stem from an argument between Sigel and a man who said the rapper punched him in both eyes, breaking his left eye socket, during a January 2003 argument outside a Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>In Oct. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, his step-father, Sam Derry was murdered.</p>
