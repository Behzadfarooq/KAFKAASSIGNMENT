<p>The point of Wikipedia is to provide free information. Restricted-use images are to be avoided. I realize that the CC-licensed photo I uploaded is not the best, so please try to find a better one; but do <i>not</i> replace it with an unlicensed, copyrighted photo. The tag for the previous image specifically says that the image is only to be used "[w]here no free equivalent is available or <b>could be created</b>" (emphasis mine). That certainly isn't the case here.

<p>From the section on Grand Royal Magazine: 'The 1995 issue of the magazine contained the first print reference of the expression, "mullet," to describe the hairstyle.'</p>
<p>This is untrue and there is no proof that the Beasties coined the term "mullet" to describe that particular haircut. Nor is there any proof that Grand Royal was the first publication to print the word "mullet" in reference to that (there needs to be defnitive proof, and there really is none. Just saying you can't find any referenced before that 95 issue of the mag is not enough).</p>
<p>I've removed that line from this article before, but someone else who seems to be adamant about the B-Boys association with the mullet keeps putting it back.</p>
<p>I am removing the line again. If you want to say that the B-Boys constantly joke about mullets (as evidenced in their song "mullet head" and a feature on mullets that appeared in Grand Royal magazine) that's fine, because it's true. But to say they somehow originated the name, the idea, or popularized it as a comedic haircut is not accurate.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for proof that the Beasties coined the term "mullet," the Oxford English Dictionary supports it, and that trumps every other source on etymology as far as I'm concerned. The OED says: "Apparently coined, and certainly popularized, by U.S. hip-hop group the Beastie Boys (see quot. 1994)" A PDF version of the entry is available at <a href="http://www.andover.edu/library/courseguides/ay2005/SS/Etymology/mulletoed.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.andover.edu/library/courseguides/ay2005/SS/Etymology/mulletoed.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. See definition #9.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm putting the claim back in. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnson2995_78a9.html" title="User:Anson2995">Anson2995</a> 22:25, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I actually am going to dispute the Oxford English Dictionary's claim that the Beasties "coined" the term. I will concede they did "popularize" it, but if you look on the actual wikipedia page for the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullet_%28haircut%29.html" title="Mullet (haircut)">mullet</a>, it points out that the term "mullet-head" is used in the film "Cool Hand Luke," George Kennedy's character uses the term to describe Southern men with long hair with short sides. So I think the OED actually got that point wrong (note that they say "apparently").</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I believe the fact that the term Mullet is used in "Cool Hand Luke" in reference to a character's haircut means that the term existed before the '95 Grand Royal magazine article. I do think there is ample evidence to say that the Beastie's popularized it, or put it on the cultural map. But they didn't come up with the term.</dd>

<dd>The term "mullet-head" is used three times in Cool Hand Luke, once in reference to Luke (Paul Newman) and twice in reference to Koko (Lou Antonio). Both men have crew cuts, so it's obviously a term of gerneral derision, not a reference to their haircut. The Random House Historical Dictionary of Slang says that the term "mullet-head" was first mentioned in print in 1857, meaning "a stupid ignorant person." Clearly, that's the context in which Geroge Kennedy's character (Dragline, fwiw) uses it in Cool Hand Luke. The question here isn't about the use of the term "mullet-head" or even "mullet" as a general insult, but the use of the word to describe a particular hairstyle. I vigorously dispute the claim that it was used that way in Cool Hand Luke.</dd>

<dd>I guess I don't disagree with your point that the term wasn't originally invented by them, that the term was probably a bit of existing slang that they picked up on. But I do think the evidence suggests that they were the first one's to use it in mass media or in some published form, and as you say, it's hard to dispute that they popularized it. I think that both points are important and should be conveyed here, and I'd be interested in whether you think what we've done that adequately.</dd>

<p>Kudos to the person who had the balls to change the genre from "rapcore" to "hip hop." Although they may occasionally experiment with rapcore, and were a great influence on rapcore, the group is first and foremost rap. Putting down just "rapcore" as the band's main genre shows how ignorant people are of the Beastie Boys' influence in the hip hop community and secured place in hip hop history. The Beastie Boys were one of the very first popular rap groups, along with Run-DMC. Both Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys are responsible for shaping rap music into what it is today, both musically and lyrically. And for all new schoolers, the Beastie Boys profoundly influenced gangsta rap (along with Schooly D, the Beastie Boys were the first rap group to talk about guns, drug and alcohol use, car jacking, and gang activity. Just listen to "Licensed to Ill" and "Paul's Boutique!") Just because they are white and experiment with punk, metal, and alternative music does not make them a rapcore group. That is absurd. Yes, they have played rapcore-like music in the past. But so has Run-DMC. Are the Beastie Boys and Run-DMC rapcore bands? Hell no.</p>

<p>The first image in the article should illustrate the topic at hand in a clear and complete manner. The freely licensed picture is garbage for that purpose. It's blurry, underexposed, and you can't even see Adrock's face. See the fair use rationale on the image page.

<dd>Sorry I didn't see it. That topic was a bit old and unrelated. But really, the free image is free but it is seriously <b>garbage</b>. It doesn't even do its job. Just because it's free shouldn't override the fact that it is almost worthless encyclopedically. I guess I have to restate the point that you can't even see one of the member's faces! The other faces are muddied and one is partially obscured. Imagine if all the fair use pictures on Wikipedia were replaced by bigfoot-esque poor quality, but free-use, photographs. That would certainly do more harm than good. I'm dissapointed that you reverted back to the poor picture without taking into account these concerns, and I'm not going to change it back to the fair use picture without further discourse. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User_talk%7EZiggur_1cf1.html" title="User talk:Ziggur">Ziggur</a> 01:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's really two issues here. One is whether it's okay (legally and according to Wikipedia policy) to use the publicity photo, and the second is whether the CC-licensed concert photo is too poor-quality to use. As I said before, I don't see how we can use the publicity photo; especially see point #2 of the template, which states it's only okay to use if "...no free equivalent is available or <b>could be created</b> that would adequately give the same information". This would apply to something like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Image%7ERobertJohson.jpg_80a7.html" title="Image:RobertJohson.jpg">the photo</a> of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Johnson_cfbb.html" title="Robert Johnson">Robert Johnson</a>, of whom only two photos exist, and obviously no more can be created. It is certainly <i>not</i> true of the Beastie Boys, as anybody can go to one of their concerts and create a new, CC-licensed photo. I just can't see how using that photo is acceptable in this case. You seem to be arguing that it's better to have copyright-infringing, high-quality photographs than legal, amateurish photos; by that logic we could take every poorly-written article and replace it with a verbatim <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> entry.</dd>

<dd>The other point is that the current photo is crappy. I think you overstate it, but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a photo. As I've argued above, I don't think going to the previous photo is an option. So... is this photo so bad that it would be better to have nothing at all? I think that just like with articles, we should start out with something sub-optimal if we have it, and wait for somebody to improve upon it. I'm sure if we're just patient somebody will upload a decent, properly-licensed photo (it's also possible that Nasty Little Man Productions will respond to my request for an unencumbered publicity photo). However, if you feel strongly about it we can remove this picture and leave it blank. —<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChowbok_9a99.html" title="User:Chowbok">Chowbok</a> 03:48, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So because a free equivalent photograph could in theory be created of every living person, and even some dead, all of the fair use photographs of these people (musical groups as well) should be removed from Wikipedia? I just don't follow that logic. Of course I agree that if a free equivalent picture is available it should be used, but what I argue is that the free picture in question is not even near equivalency to the fair use picture for reasons already given. I commend you for asking to use a publicity photo under a free license, but it should not affect whether or not we use a free or fair use image for the moment.<br />
<br />
Also, the fair use photograph that I uploaded is low quality which I explained on the image page under its fair use rationale. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User_talk%7EZiggur_1cf1.html" title="User talk:Ziggur">Ziggur</a> 05:21, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, most of the fair use images on Wikipedia are, in fact, in violation of the terms, and should be removed. You don't seem to understand that the quality of the picture I uploaded in no way affects the copyright status of the photo you uploaded. I don't know how to make this any clearer. It says right in the tag that you can't use that image if free images exist or can be created. This fails on <i>both</i> counts. The point of Wikipedia is not to provide pretty pictures. It's to provide a freely redistributable encyclopedia. Instead of devoting your energies arguing that it's okay to use that publicity photo when it clearly isn't, why not spend your time helping me find an acceptable unencumbered picture?</dd>

<p>I'm not sure who thought up of the quote "Their song "Brass Monkey" was referenced in the Lucasarts adventure game, "Escape From Monkey Island", in which there was a small brass monkey powering a furnace. When examined, the line, "Brass Monkey, That Funky Monkey" can be heard."</p>
<p>This is completely false information. Brass Monkey did not come out until Liscense to Ill which was in the 1980's. The first Monkey Island Game to ever come out came out in 1990 so there is no way that this information is true. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Number17 (<a href="../../../n/u/m/User_talk%7ENumber17_473f.html" title="User talk:Number17">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Number17_7af0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Number17">contribs</a>) 17:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small>Number17 17:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm confused. If LTI came out in 1986, why coudn't a reference to it be made in a game published in 1990? <a href="../../../a/m/p/User%7EAMProSoft_ad55.html" title="User:AMProSoft">AMProSoft</a> 21:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I didn't see Eugene Gore listed as a contributing musician anywhere on the page. I see him listed as the violinist for the CD <i>The In Sound From Way Out</i> released in 1996. He was featured in the song Eugene's Lament. I went ahead and added him in.</p>
