<p>Look, if there's a source provided, then pretty much <i>by definition</i> it's not original research.

<dd>It seems to me that the Santos page falls into OR under "new analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimbo Wales, that would amount to a 'novel narrative or historical interpretation'." The page collects materials from the web to string together a theory that Santos and MLB are lying about his age and that his real birthdate is 1972, with no source whatsoever other than speculative extrapolation from said materials - i.e he went to college but no official records say he did, therefore he is four years older than he says he is. If this is a coverup, why hasn't there been a story about it anywhere else on the web, let alone from a reliable source? I really don't care if he was born in 1972 or 1976. I think that the inconsistencies are facinating, and I think the page should report them. I just think the page as it is now engages in speculation that qualifies as OR.--<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaker342_47c6.html" title="User:Beaker342">Beaker342</a> 01:04, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Beaker342, thanks for your explanation on my talk page... I've made some comments and suggestions to you there, not sure if I'm supposed to respond there or here. AdamC387 16:04, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello again. I'm fine with many of your edits, but I have some strong concerns about a couple. Please take the time to read my response on my talk page (not sure if I'm supposed to put it here or not). I don't know why I'm not allowed to edit the Kristol page and use my judgment about what I think is important for the world to know. Isn't that what Wikipedia is about? Just because you don't think the quote is relevant -- why should that trump my view that it is? AdamC387 23:21, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please look at my edits to Kristol. I think these are consistent with the policies you have brought to my attention. I really don't think that just because I made a mistake by citing blogs that my substantive contributions should be questioned, especially since I have agreed to correct my mistake re: blogs. AdamC387 23:50, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I saw your last edits on Kristol. I'm happy with the changes you just made. I'm about to go on vacation for a week, but when I get back I'll do more research to find specific discussion of the implications of this quote. The quote is significant for many reasons not the least of which Al Franken has talked about it a lot and I know there were op-edds that discuss it and what it says a pre-war tone of extreme confidence that today is compared to a common mantra from many neocons (including Kristol) that the war would have gone great had Bush done things differently. I'll try to make it more clear when I edit it later. BTW, the original offsetting was not something I added -- someone else did that originally after I added the quote. I'm not sure why it shows up as my edit. I'm fine with removing it. AdamC387 02:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am sick of seeing people trying to be politically correct just not to offend someone (not you - I am commenting about others). The information on the topic should be its judge, jury and executioner. If you want to start editing pages then how about going and looking at the fools who continually list wikipedia as a cult. Ill happily leave off the comments if we can get rid of the self appointed do-gooders.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not privy to the editing controversy you cite. There are clearly unproductive editors out there, though in my experience they tend to lose the battles more often than not. If someone kept adding Wikipedia as a cult to an article, you are well within your rights to revert their edits. However, calling them a "fuckwit" is not productive. As you said yourself, let the contributions of unproductive editors speak for themselves. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaker342_47c6.html" title="User:Beaker342">Beaker342</a> 05:06, 30 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that some people will continue to add things back in even if they aren't correct. I think those sorts of people are fuckwits. That is my opinion and I can state it on my page. However I have removed it in the interest of calm and rational thought. You know that when Weird Al has a little comical stab at wikipedia and its editors, that something isn't right.--<a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDementation_4d52.html" title="User:Dementation">Dem</a> 13:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
