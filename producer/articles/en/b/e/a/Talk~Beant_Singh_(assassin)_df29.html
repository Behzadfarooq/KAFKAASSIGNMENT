<p>I dont think that they should've been killed because they stood up for their religion and they were doing the same thing that someone else might have done if they had injustice being done to their religion. I would've done the same thing. We shuld repeat history and stand op for our religion. What they did to us was not fair and we should go back and do the same to them.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../s/a/t/Talk%7ESatwant_Singh_8b88.html" title="Talk:Satwant Singh">Talk:Satwant Singh</a> for an explanation of this reversion, since the same passage is involved in both. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 18:48, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone moved this article without moving the history. I've done the move correctly but the new version was a long way from NPOV, and was also largely about Indira Gandhi and not the article subject. I've pasted it here rather than copying it into the article.</p>
<p><b>Beant Singh</b> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satwant_Singh_f1a2.html" title="Satwant Singh">Satwant Singh</a> were bodyguards to the former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. On 31 October 1984 they assassinated <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indira_Gandhi_d446.html" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>, the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_India_664d.html" title="Prime Minister of India">Prime Minister of India</a> at her residence for her attempt to crush the secessionist movement of Sikh militants, led by Jarnail Singh Bindranwale, she had ordered an assault upon the holiest Sikh shrine in Amritsar, called the "Golden Temple". It is here that Bindranwale and his armed supporters had holed up, and it is from the Golden Temple that they waged their campaign of terrorism not merely against the Government, but against moderate Sikhs and Hindus. "Operation Bluestar", waged in June 1984, led to the death of Bindranwale, and the Golden Temple was stripped clean of Sikh terrorists; however, the Golden Temple was damaged, and Mrs. Gandhi earned the undying hatred of Sikhs who bitterly resented the desacralization of their sacred space.Around sixteen bullets were fired in her chest and abdomen. Indira Gandhi was declared 'greatest woman in 1000 years' by BBC in an online poll beating Queen Elizabeth I, Marie Curie,Mother Teresa and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Beant Singh was killed by gunfire at the scene of the assassination. Satwant Singh was arrested and later sentenced to death, along with conspirator Kehar Singh.</p>

<p>DJ Clayworth in my changes i had included so much about the history, and Indira Gandhi in order to explain why we should consider beant sing as an assassin, Indira Gandhi is a very well known person in history and her assassinating should be considered assassination no matter what, i had included reason why they killed her to keep pro Khalistan people like Zafarnamah happy. I'm very happy with your work but I'm not sure if pro Khalistan people are going to think about it same way. I'm sorry i misjudged u(i got confused looking at history, i still don't know what u did), i hope you are going to think about what happed same way.</p>

<p>Thanks for your message. Yes I understand that page moves can be confusing at first. You tried to rename <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beant_Singh_%28bodyguard%29_314c.html" title="Beant Singh (bodyguard)">Beant Singh (bodyguard)</a> to <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beant_Singh_%28assassin%29_a04f.html" title="Beant Singh (assassin)">Beant Singh (assassin)</a> by making the first one a redirect and creating a new article at the second. This is not the way to do it, because all the history of the article is lost when you do this (it stays at the original name). What I did was to delete the new article you created at <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beant_Singh_%28assassin%29_a04f.html" title="Beant Singh (assassin)">Beant Singh (assassin)</a> and to move the original article to that name. I then copied the text that you put in the new article to the talk page, so that it wasn't lost.</p>
<p>I have no problem with calling the article <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beant_Singh_%28assassin%29_a04f.html" title="Beant Singh (assassin)">Beant Singh (assassin)</a>. Assassin just means "someone who kills a prominent person", which is exactly what they did. However I do have some issues with the other things you wrote. The trouble is that there is dispute about the causes of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bluestar_7344.html" title="Operation Bluestar">Operation Bluestar</a>; some see it as a legitimate operation to remove armed terrorists. Others as as organized killings of a religious minority by a government bent on oppressing that minority. The important thing here is that Wikipedia does not try to sort out which of these views is true. What we do is described in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>; in essence we don't try to decide which view point is true, we report all points of view. Only a few months ago I had to explan this to another editor editing exactly these articles, insisting that Beant Singh be described as a saint and hero for killing the 'evil' Indira Gandhi. If you look at the history I was just as insistent that their viewpoint was not presented as the 'true' one.</p>
<p>The second point is that to try to explain all the subtleties and viewpoints about Operation Bluestar and who thought what about it that takes a lot of space, so we try to do it in one place only - the article <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bluestar_7344.html" title="Operation Bluestar">Operation Bluestar</a>. For this article we don't get into the details about it. Instead we record the undisputed facts only. Here the undisputed facts are that Beant Singh killed Indira Gandhi in revenge for Operation Bluestar, and that he saw Operation Bluestar as an attack on his religion (we're not saying he was right, just that he saw it like that). There is a link to Operation Bluestar so readers can go and look up more details if they want.</p>
<p>Please do add more to <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beant_Singh_%28assassin%29_a04f.html" title="Beant Singh (assassin)">Beant Singh (assassin)</a> or <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Bluestar_7344.html" title="Operation Bluestar">Operation Bluestar</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indira_Gandhi_d446.html" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>. As long as you remember the neutraility principle you will have no trouble. Thanks for your contrubutions. <i>(I have copied this reply to <a href="../../../a/n/m/User_talk%7EAnmol.2k4_76c2.html" title="User talk:Anmol.2k4">User talk:Anmol.2k4</a> as well)</i>. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 15:05, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
