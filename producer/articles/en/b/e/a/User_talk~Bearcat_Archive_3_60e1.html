<p>Hey... we got off on the wrong foot with the effort by a few of us editors who were previously uninvolved in that particular list to clean up the citational standards for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a>. But despite whatever snippiness both sides might have shown, I know you're acting in good faith, and in ways that make sense given the pages you've specifically worked on, and the problems you've encountered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Outerlimits really seems to continue to be solely concerned with some kind of chip on his shoulder. S/he seems like one of those rather childish existing editors: specifically ones who not just feel ownership in the list, but accuse anyone trying to improve it of various types of bigotry. For example, somewhere completely different (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_jurists_bebc.html" title="List of Jewish jurists">List of Jewish jurists</a>), the first time I asked for names to be cited I was accused of being a follower of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_1249.html" title="Protocols of the Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>. Obviously, the accusation in this context is variations on slanders of homophobia (made, to my mind, even more absurd by the fact I've actually written a fair amount in academic queer theory; but I guess that's neither here nor there).</p>
<p>Well, anyway, it's now gotten to the point Outerlimits tracking down and lying about various stuff I've written outside WP (which isn't hard to do: I have a WP article on me that's linked to from my user page; and from there to other sites is simple enough). For example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people&amp;diff=34451829&amp;oldid=34451062" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people&amp;diff=34451829&amp;oldid=34451062" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34456831" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=34456831" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It's not that I'm really concerned about the personal attacks <i>per se</i>, I'm not that thin-skinned. But when an editor goes to those kind of lengths, it certainly usually portends a near future of increasing disruption of the editing process, and often futher so-called "wikistalking" (though that term is slightly silly, I know).</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe a stern word from an admin, and someone who has edited the list in question, might be able to get the user to cool his/her heals a bit. Or any other thoughts? <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 06:56, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, yes, spamming administrators would be one way of resolving interpersonal problems. Another might be to <i>not</i> storm in, bringing reinforcements with you, and insist on doing things your way without discussion. You could stop calling people childish, or even not launch disingenuous campaigns against what you characterize as "identitarian" lists, insisting that others perform the task of finding the citations you profess to want, not in order to further your stated goal of improving documentation in Wikipedia (which could be done on <i>any</i> article), but rather in furtherance of your agenda of decimating such lists. - <a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOuterlimits_49f0.html" title="User:Outerlimits">Outerlimits</a> 07:23, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again, Bearcat. You were so very helpful over on that other article that we initially miscommunicated on, that I'm writing to see if I can tempt your interest in an entirely unrelated thing. Short story: I decided to try to get the quality of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_c079.html" title="Ward Churchill">Ward Churchill</a> up to some better standards. Churchill is a controversial figure, much daemonized by the right-wing USAian press, so he attracts a lot of drive-by POV mongers and vandals. Actually one really aggressive one managed to get himself blocked for 60 days (it followed some other RfAr decision stuff though).</p>
<p>There's another editor, <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokey5945_7115.html" title="User:Pokey5945">User:Pokey5945</a> who is pretty much a single-issue editors. That is, the large majority of his edits (and all his initial month or so) were on Churchill's page. He started out with a definite anti-Churchill perspective, but mostly kept edits relatively factual, or at least allowed editing (mostly by me... there aren't a lot of people working on it) to get more NPOV tone. Unfortunately, he's become increasingly aggressive in trying to push an editorializing agenda with time. Actually, I refactored the page just yesterday to put about half the material in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_%28misconduct_allegations%29_0f1a.html" title="Ward Churchill (misconduct allegations)">Ward Churchill (misconduct allegations)</a>, per length concerns and some previous discussion on the talk page (and a bit of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> on my part); so today's problems are mostly on that child article.</p>
<p>Anyway, he got a 3RR warning in the past for some POV stuff he put in (but just a warning from admin <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a>, as Pokey5945's first infraction, and assuming lack of knowledge on rules). Tonight's effort is Pokey5945's repeated blanking of some counter-balancing material by a scholar named Tinker (who basically defends Churchill and criticizes a guy named Brown who attacks Churchill). Pokey5945 hasn't yet 3RR'd on this one, but I'd like to "cut it off at the pass"). I'm thinking that maybe a word from someone other than me would have a tempering effect. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 06:50, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your kind intervention to the talk page before. Trying to keep this one sane is really even worse than trying to protect some GLB topics, as you've done (believe it or not). So the latest is User:Fighterforfreedom. Looks like he's up to some no-good. (Actually, vaguely connected, Fighterforfreedom has also insisted on my talk page that I make some sort of allocution about my sexuality... God only knows why).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I took some effort to refactor some of the content to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Churchill_%28misconduct_allegations%29_0f1a.html" title="Ward Churchill (misconduct allegations)">Ward Churchill (misconduct allegations)</a>. Figherforfreedom has repeatedly reverted to a version prior to a page refactoring. His/her edit comments claim that this had something to do with a concern with POV; but the change is simply making one overly large page rather than two reasonable size ones. Both of the pages, on a controversial topic, definitely pose a POV quagmire, but this user doesn't even seem to be pushing any POV except that pages should be &gt;32k in size via this particular edit. I have some vague hunch from this user's contribution history (and talk page that s/he keeps blanking) that s/he somehow perceives getting rid of the refactoring is more anti-Churchill... but this narrow issue really has nothing whatsoever to do with pro- or anti- viewpoints, it's just about <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>.</dd>

<p>I know TVOntario has a little template on the far right of the screen listing some of the specs (analog channel, call sign, etc.). I'm wondering if the same thing can be done with Knowledge Network, Access (CJAL), and Saskatchewan Communcations Network.</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed you left messages in a few places (well, one anyway) referring to a controversy over using "American" vs. "United States" for category names like "fooian foos". It seems to me like this controversy is cleared up pretty decisively at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28categories%29_Usage_of_American_cf3f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)/Usage of American">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)/Usage of American</a>. Feel free to point that out to people who want to start a controversy - esp. the part about being a "strong preference". Also point out that its parent <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28categories%29_ac1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)</a> is an <b>official policy</b>. (I read that you don't agree with the controversy and I certainly don't either - and neither do any of the several South American, Central American or Canadian people I know who would be very confused if you referred to them as "American" - but I thought you might like the evidence to support that position). &#160;:) —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 04:00, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You asked for a source. Previously I heard the number on Sirius, but it was on a show from a caller. That was unreliable. I agree with you on that one. This was researched by the Channel 100 News team. They work for Sirius and are a news team. They have reliability and as I said it is an estimate. Estimate.</p>
<p>I can see you are from Canada and have a liking in politics. Try to not be biased.</p>
<p>Just another note:</p>
<p>"Some media commentators have also suggested that Sirius Canada was not willing to pay the syndication fees required to broadcast Stern"</p>
<p>You posted this in <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_100.html" title="Howard 100">Howard 100</a>. First off it is not true nor is it a fact. Someone suggested this. How do you verify that the statement is true? You said Wikipedia only allows things posted on their site that is verified. I guess you are the exception to the rule?</p>
<p>You are clearly being biased.</p>

<p>What makes me think you are being biased is the fact that you have a high interest in the Canadian government and don't seem to like Stern at all. You add comments by unknown media outlets that are clearly against Stern (Like the comment I posted above) and then remove any comment that might make Sirius and Howard Stern look good.</p>

<p>Hey Bearcat, there was a discussion a while back at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Electoral_districts_in_Canada_Election_results_4c92.html#Chronological_order" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Electoral districts in Canada/Election results">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Electoral_districts_in_Canada/Election_results#Chronological_order</a> about whether the reuslts should be in chronological or reverse chronological order. The consensus seemed to be, more or less, in favour of reverse chronological order. As part of a clean-up of current Canadian electoral district articles, I've been following that sort-of consensus, and have done all ridings except those in Quebec, which I would do eventually. Whichever way it is to be done, I think it makes sense to pick one order and use that for all current ridings, rather than having some one way and some the other. Perhaps you could weigh in at the discussion above and try to restart it so that we can finalize a consensus before either of us does more work working at cross-purposes.

<p>I know how pipetext works. Their radio show was called "Radio Free Vestibule", not "The Vestibules", so sorting it under "The Vestibules" would be incorrect.

<dd>Moving the page to "Radio Free Vestibule" doesn't seem right since the page is about the group, not their radio program, and the group now calls itself "The Vestibules".

<dd>That is a major stretch. The city's own logo has the "Sudbury" 5 times larger than the "Greater". Their business website is sudbury.ca.

<p>...instead of...</p>

<p>As I said, I find it hard to read.</p>

<p>Personally, i do not get CBLFT-TV-17 on my television. I only recieve analogue, anyway. However, it appears it was moved from channel 68 (analogue) to 67 (digital). That is just its transmitter call-sign.</p>

CBLFT-TV WAS on channel 17 in Sarnia, but they must have taken the analogue signal down, putting CBLFT-DT 68 in its place.

<li>In the normal course of things, I would join WikiProject Sexology and sexuality and edit it to include Wikiproject Pedophilia as a subproject. Do you have any objections or comments on that.</li>
<li>We are considering renaming <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pedophilia_8fc0.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia">Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia</a> to Wikiproject Paraphilia, for various reasons.

<dd>No one's <i>entitled</i> to anything. Thought I'd get that out of the way. With that said, I'm a completely uninvolved party who hadn't seen the other AfDs; if you can put content into the bio saying what notable things he's <i>accomplished</i>, say briefly why those things matter, and get <i>any</i> sort of press coverage linked in, I will strongly consider throwing my support in to keep this article. Otherwise, the AfD is simply too contentious to be worth getting involved. I know, it's a bit of heavy lifting, but if you get that done, you can Speedy Keep future attempts at this by showing the obvious evidence of notability. As it is, being an ignorant American, I have no idea what the Vaughan Council is and why it's at all relevant; people voting to delete might find themselves in the same situation.

<p>Wikipedia began as an open effort to create an encyclopedia of the people, by the people, for the people. Sadly, its bureaucracy has put an end to those goals. To this end, we must promote a peaceful revolution to reform it. We must eliminate the undue influence of certain people and remake Wikipedia as a people's encyclopedia. We, the reformers, are led by TJWhite who endured only briefly before suffering an indefinite block. Visit his <a href="../../../t/j/w/User%7ETJWhite_a68d.html" title="User:TJWhite">user page</a> to see our ideology, roughly outlined. I for one do not condone his call to vandalism. Instead, by using the power of the people, we can reform wikipedia. Join us to recreate an encyclopedia where all are equal; an encyclopedia that does not strive to become Brittannica, but rather seeks to be a one of kind encyclopedia for all of the people of the world. Please pass this message in some form to as many people as you can. Secondly, petition for the unblock of TJWhite, the one who began our glorious movement. Finally, link to his page from your user page and express your sentiments for reform on your page.

<p>I looked at other wiki articles of Ontario cities that compare to the city of Vaughan, Brampton (5th largest in Ontario), London (6th largest in Ontario), Markham (7th largest in Ontario) ,Vaughan (8th largest in Ontario), Windsor, (9th largest in Ontario) Kitchener (10th largest in Ontario <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brampton%2C_Ontario" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brampton%2C_Ontario" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brampton%2C_Ontario</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%2C_Ontario" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%2C_Ontario" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%2C_Ontario</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markham%2C_Ontario" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markham%2C_Ontario" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markham%2C_Ontario</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor%2C_Ontario" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor%2C_Ontario" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor%2C_Ontario</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchener" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchener" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchener</a> All of them don’t have any members of council even listed on their cities articles and none have personal articles and only a couple of the mayors have articles (which could be for other accomplishments). There is a definite conflict of interest having a Vaughan councillors son posting and debating here. He thinks he can post his fathers page yet at the same time get rid of all the competition articles. In all fairness, I believe there is one of two choices that I think is fair. 1. To have all members of council have articles plus all candidates running in the municipal election have articles 2. To take down all articles of council and candidates and remove all council names from the cities wiki page. This is how all the cities that compare to Vaughan have their cities articles (three larger than Vaughan and two slightly smaller) I would prefer option #1 but I would be ok with option #2 anything in between I am not ok with and I will continue debating.

<li>We've already established that i was in a conflict of interest posting the article originally. i was a new user and didn't know the rules. That being said, I thought we'd agreed that vaughan councillors don't deserve their own pages but should be amalgamated into one "vaughan council page" plus, with the creation of the "vaughan council election, 2006" article, there is zero need for the individual NN candidates to have their own articles. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 01:51, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is one user (or at least I believe it is one user) that keeps doing cut-and-paste moves for articles that have long edit histories. Almost every page in question can be moved using a regular move (ie it doesn't require overwriting a page). The MO for this user is to register a new user account for every day's worth of editing, and they never have an email address associated with the account, so contacting them is difficult. Their edits are fine, it's just that almost every day they do a cut-and-paste move. The most recent user account they have used is <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackintosh_Blues_22f8.html" title="User:Mackintosh Blues">User:Mackintosh Blues</a> (based on the type of edits done I believe that the accounts <a href="../../../c/o/c/User%7ECockadoodle_32b0.html" title="User:Cockadoodle">User:Cockadoodle</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_vs._Bad_7d92.html" title="User:Good vs. Bad">User:Good vs. Bad</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackbone_5000_3b52.html" title="User:Blackbone 5000">User:Blackbone 5000</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/m/User%7EJumbo_Juice_ce4f.html" title="User:Jumbo Juice">User:Jumbo Juice</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/27/User%7ELi%27l_Bean_0745.html" title="User:Li'l Bean">User:Li'l Bean</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Arc_of_Fame_d673.html" title="User:The Arc of Fame">User:The Arc of Fame</a> and probably a few more are all from the same person). I have left a message about cut-and-paste moves on the talk page of every account that they have used. But they have never responded in any way. Most recently I left a message on <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackintosh_Blues_78de.html" title="User talk:Mackintosh Blues">User talk:Mackintosh Blues</a> and the user edited pages after I left the message, so they must have seen my message (before that I had never been able to leave a message on the account's talk page while they were still editing, and since they would just use a new account for the next editing session they would probably never see my other messages). Could you please direct me on where to go to try to get this user to stop doing cut-and-paste moves?

<dd>No, actually, it's not all that hard. I generally have <i>very</i> little difficulty conducting a civil, reasoned debate with people whose political views are diametrically opposed to mine but who are capable of debating maturely and rationally. For one thing, you don't insult the other person. For two, you don't revert every edit they make without discussing <i>why</i> you object to it on the talk page. And for three, you don't <i>start</i> the discussion from the <i>a priori</i> conclusion that everything they touch is inherently biased. It's really not that difficult to do.</dd>

<p>Bearcat- pm_shef and his sockpuppet, "70.29.239.249", are putting up their personal attacks against a previous opponent of his father's, simon strelch. There is a comment, "this guy is a nobody", then pm_shef agrees and says "he's done nothing notable whatsoever".</p>
<p>Under wikipedia:Wikiquette, it is written: "Principles of Wikipedia etiquette... Argue facts, not personalities."</p>
<p>The fact that Pm_shef won't "Forgive and Forget" his loss and accept the community's consensus around the AfD really means he isn't "Recognizing his own biases and keeping them in check," but pursuing his personal agenda which just so happens to coincide with his father's (and his) interests.</p>
<p>Under Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not, it is written: "Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not: 2. Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: "Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so." [1]</p>
<p>Pm_shef should stop trying to damage, remove or defame the articles of his father's opponents, including Yehuda Shahaf, Simon Strelch and Elliott Frankl. Please assist.</p>

<p>Could I request that you revert some of the recent changes by User:Gold Dragon? I've already reached my three reverts for the 24-hour period.</p>
<p>I'm particularly concerned about this line: "noting that a fiscal self-examination was overdue while spending on new programs was rampant", which seems to be a deliberate misrepresentation of the source material.

<p>I see you mention on your user page that you suffer from depression. I'm in the process of starting up a new wiki, and I wondered if you might be interested. It's based at Wikicities, a project started by <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>. Wikicities hosts many wikis, but the one I'm working on will hopefully be a comprehensive resource for people with depression. If you are interested in contributing, the site is at <a href="http://depression.wikicities.com" class="external free" title="http://depression.wikicities.com" rel="nofollow">http://depression.wikicities.com</a> . It's quite new, so there isn't much there yet, but if you would have a look that would be great.

<p>You could put it in <a href="../../../c/b/s/Category%7ECBS_network_shows_78ff.html" title="Category:CBS network shows">Category:CBS network shows</a> and sort it to come out right next to the main Ghost Whisperer entry.

<p>Or you could just make it a list which does properly belong in the Episode lists category. A list has the advantage that you can put the episodes in chronological order and add comments. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 18:56, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Didn't you create that category? In that case, I think you can ask them to speedy delete it. In any case, I'm not sure why you have a category since the only thing in it is the List of episodes article and a single episode. Were you going to populate it with all the episodes?</p>
<p>Would it make sense to create an Episode by television series category and make it a subset of one of the television categories? Then we could move all the Episodes of ... categories there and not have them in the Episode lists category where they don't make sense. --<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffW_9f12.html" title="User:JeffW">JeffW</a> 20:21, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help so far, but the Admin noticeboard doesn't seem to have generated any solution. Would you be willing to block this user for say 24 hours to try to get their attention, like was suggested on the noticeboard? Their current account is <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERiverflow_7a22.html" title="User:Riverflow">User:Riverflow</a>, and I believe that they also sometimes edit as the IPs (probably when they accidentally forget to login) User:66.75.14.189, User:70.181.236.81, User:207.88.204.11. (Although they look very different, they all appear to be IPs from the San Diego area.) I recently stopped leaving any messages on the person's various talk pages to see if they would keep the same account longer, and it appears that they do. They usually make very few edits after I leave them a message; but if I do not leave a message they keep the same account for 2 or more days. So I'm starting to think that they are actively ignoring any attempts at contacting them. <a href="../../../q/u/t/User%7EQutezuce_4fd6.html" title="User:Qutezuce">Qutezuce</a> 09:14, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me know what was to be done in this case. An added complexity, though, is the ambiguity around properly spelling their name: isn't there some value in keeping a "Husker Du" category in case users search for them that way? I wasn't sure if the issue had been debated with specific application to this band somewhere... I didn't (and still wouldn't) know where to find such a discussion, if it has taken place. So I wanted to leave both categories there, so if I was repeating a past mistake, someone could let me know (hopefully with civility, as you did about this more procedural issue).

<li>I know you'd rather not get dragged into this, but I figure if anyone knows how to handle it, you would. I'm sure you've noticed that <a href="../../../p/o/c/User%7EPoche1_e9ba.html" title="User:Poche1">User:Poche1</a> has been tagged as a Sockpuppet of <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeotardo_6227.html" title="User:Leotardo">User:Leotardo</a> a few hours later, the user account <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkycloud_6eef.html" title="User:Skycloud">User:Skycloud</a> was created, and immediately began editing the same pages that we've been fighting over. I think that all of them are sockpuppets of Eyeonvaughan. Especially since this new Skycloud fellow just created a Vaughan Watch page, a website that I believe Eyeonvaughan runs. Regardless, I think you'll agree that we have an issue (and, hopefully, that I've been doing a fairly okay job staying out of the mess lately). You'll also notice on <a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_Frankl_de98.html" title="Elliott Frankl">Elliott Frankl</a>'s talk page, I've uncovered evidence that a good number of the claims on his article are blatantly false. <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 02:59, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. I noticed you saying at <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> that you had slapped the bot-move template on a category with a capitalization difference. FWIW, NekoDaemon (the bot that does those kind of moves) is down at the moment...so for the moment all categories have to be moved manually. Hopefully Cryptic or FreakofNurture (who are both working on replacements) will have some success soon, or AllyUnion (NekoDaemon's owner) will be able to fix NekoDaemon.</p>

<p>Again: Wikipedia has formatting rules. The existing version that several of us keep reverting back to is consistent with those rules; your version is not. Given that, I'd really like for you to explain why you think that your version is the one that's entitled to stand as the final word. And I'd also like for you to explain how exactly it is that you think the reversions are vandalism but your repeated change isn't. And just for the record: Wikipedia is not Myspace, where you could put anything you want up in any format you wish because the space belongs to you — Wikipedia is an objective, NPOV encyclopedia. The article belongs to Wikipedia, not to Simon, so it has to stay within Wikipedia's inclusion and formatting rules. <b>In fact, under the rules, Simon and people who know him personally actually have no business editing the article at all, because it's not their space to write anything they want about him; it's Wikipedia's space to write something neutral and objective about him.</b> Bearcat 18:28, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bearcat I understand you are an administrator for wiki. and have the authority to delete and suspend articles and users. I have been reading over all the posting related to Vaughan. Although it seems to be only one person on here that is causing the problems (I think you could guess who he is as he’s the only one related to a politician on here)., here’s a suggestion. Delete everything that relates to the City of Vaughan and suspend all users that has been updating and making comments to Vaughan and all politicians articles related to Vaughan. If you think I deserve to be included as I did make edits to an article related to Vaughan then please suspend me as well. I got on to wiki mostly for my sports interests, I was contacted by a user (see my talk page) to expand an article if I had access to the information, which I did and I can assure you every edit I have made on wiki is accurate with the exception of a few unintentional grammar and spelling errors.--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyCanuck_3ddd.html" title="User:JohnnyCanuck">JohnnyCanuck</a> 19:19, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey -- I just wanted to say good for you for standing up for pm_shef... but it really seems to me there's deeper stuff going on here. I was going to suggest to pm_shef that he take a break from Vaughan articles and work on something else to try to get away from the hounding, but it really looks like there's a wide variety of POV-pushing editors on Vaughan-related topics, and pm_shef is the only other editor who actually <i>knows</i> about any of this stuff, so my suggestion would screw everything up! There's certainly been massive violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> against him, even if they don't rise quite to the level of personal attacks.. and I think there's probably wikistalking going on, too. Have there been RfC's on any of these people yet?

<p>The IHHOF board of directors has finally been updated. <a href="http://www.ihhof.com/aboutBoard.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ihhof.com/aboutBoard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ihhof.com/aboutBoard.htm</a> I plan to write articles on all the directors, including a rewrite of Frankl's which the previous article on him was vandalised and deleted based on the false claim from one politically motivated user that he didn't serve on the board. The Frankl article that was put up for deletion should now be restored as the politically motivated claim by one user has now been proven to be false. Most of the deletes were based on the false info. that he didn't serve on the board of an international organization. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyCanuck_3ddd.html" title="User:JohnnyCanuck">JohnnyCanuck</a> 18:51, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Bearcat, I have decided not to rewrite the Frankl article as it may just cause another crazy debate. I guess you could delete all the pages relateing to frankl and I would suggest to redirect the Frankl page to the 2006 election, but I will leave that decision you. I will continue editing sports related articles as thats my area of expertise and stay away from any political articles. That was my intention when I started editing here but I was asked by eyeonvaughan to add info to the Frankl article so I did with good intentions--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyCanuck_3ddd.html" title="User:JohnnyCanuck">JohnnyCanuck</a> 16:02, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bearcat, I had some extra time so I rewrote the Frankl article, here it is User:JohnnyCanuck/Elliott Frankl I provided as many references as possilbe and left out the info that I could not find a reference. If you think it could be posted as it now stands then please post it up, if not that is ok and I guess you could delete everything that is related to this article. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyCanuck_3ddd.html" title="User:JohnnyCanuck">JohnnyCanuck</a> 21:54, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've recreated the above article. You blanked it and created a redirect to KRXQ. The radio above show is on two stations, not just KRXQ, so a redirect there is inappropriate in any case. Feel free to take it to AFD if you want, but I'm fairly confident that I can get a keep vote for it. It is a highly rated radio show in two major markets. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.Smith</a> 14:54, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help here! However could I ask you to actually remove articles from the list once you have added links to them, not just <s>strike them out</s>. There is some debate (see <a href="../../../d/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EDead-end_pages_01d3.html#Consistent_Procedures_for_Removing_Pages" title="Wikipedia talk:Dead-end pages">Wikipedia talk:Dead-end pages#Consistent Procedures for Removing Pages</a>) on what if you don't fix a deadend article but propose it for deletion. However, there is clear consensus that articles that are really no longer deadends should be removed.</p>

<p>My bad. I assumed that because you had fixed a couple of articles that you had also struck them out - bad assumption! If you can delete dead end articles after you fix them that saves a little time for someone else. However actually fixing the articles is the important thing.

<p>Greetings, Concerning the article on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Uguay_2743.html" title="Marie Uguay">Marie Uguay</a>, I reverted it back to "french canadian" because I felt that the new version, where she is labeled as "canadian from the province of Quebec" wasn't precise enough for the topic at hand. I was not aware of any offensiveness of the term I used. I do feel however, that it is absolutely necessary for the understanding of the article and of her relative importance that it be mentionned early that: 1- her first language was french, 2- that she is of quebecois roots (ie. caucasian french, rather than haitian, for example). Note that my version doesn't address the second point. Feel free to modify it again but if possible, please try to phrase it in a way that someone will at least understand that she was french-speaking from the first or second sentence. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeltz_37ca.html" title="User:Beltz">Beltz</a> 07:31, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hey Bearcat, FWIW I agree that Connie Wilkins is nn, a very good candidate for AfD. I also agree that these two have a similar level of (non) notability.

<li>You're obviously a lot closer to the ground (too close?) on these articles than I am, all I see is a couple of nn people. If there was clear evidence that nn right-wing activists articles were being systematically kept in AfD debates because of bias, that would be interesting. That articles are being created about them doesn't say much. Anyway, I would still contend that AfD votes on people should be cast on the individual merits of the topic with regard to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I do understand your reasons for removing these people from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Native_American_writers_b363.html" title="List of Native American writers">List of Native American writers</a>, but I would ask you to consider a counter-argument. Most of these writers are Anishinaabe/Cree etc, tribes whose lands are to be found on either side of the border. They need to be seen in context with one another, not artificially separated by colonial national borders that were imposed against their people's wishes. There's some sense in having lists of writers done by tribe, but that would be to ignore a common history of persecution by the Brits &amp; the French, followed by oppression by US and Canadian authorities, which gives meaning to reading works by Natives of different tribes. In short, as nomenclature and territory are such sites of dispute in First Nations/Native American circles, I'd argue for an inclusive as opposed to exclusive reading, which would have these writers appear on both lists. Otherwise this encyclopedia is simply endorsing the colonial act of possession and naming of the tribal peoples of North America.</p>
<p>I won't revert your edits, but I do ask you to revert them yourself, OR to visit the article talk page (where I've also left the above paragraph) and give your reasons for not doing so.</p>

<p>Hey Bearcat, I've been wondering about his for awhile now. Why did you move a few area code articles (eg - <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_905.html" title="Area code 905">Area code 905</a>) to encompass the overlay codes as well (eg - <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_905_289_e2fa.html" title="Area code 905/289">Area code 905/289</a>)? Wouldn't a redirect be more appropriate, since someone is more likely to look for 289, rather than 905/289? I understand that you don't want to be biased toward one area code over the other, though, but I'm not certain this solution is optimal. (Then again, neither is my solution.) <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 15:35, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's reasonable. I guess my main concern is the actual title of the articles; I prefer titles to not contain odd characters like slashes, unless they are part actually of the name. If I think of a better name, I'll bring it up for discussion. The only one that comes to mind so far is Area codes 905 and 289. I'm not sure if that's any better, though. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 15:16, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bearcat, after reading through the criteria for inclusion in the blacklist, I don't think this site should be added to the list. The requirement is a site that is added to numerous articles, or other spammy behaviour, but not sites that are added to one article, and which can be reverted or blocked by sprotect etc.</p>

<p>With the national finals being taped in Edmonton over the next couple of days, would it be necessary to add a spoiler tag in case someone leaks out the name of the winning school for the 2005-06 season once those tapings are complete, way before those episodes are broadcast in B.C., Alberta, and then nationwide? <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleLeafFan04_ee75.html" title="User:MapleLeafFan04">MapleLeafFan04</a> 17:41, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>UPDATE: I think the national champions of 2006 have been announced. As none of the provincial versions have either finished airing or started airing their local seasons, and because the taping of the nationals wrapped up yesterday (and have yet to air anywhere), I do not want to post a spoiler tag for fear I would accidentally spoil myself for a third straight year. I'd like someone else to do it unless it's already been added. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleLeafFan04_ee75.html" title="User:MapleLeafFan04">MapleLeafFan04</a> 22:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am posing this question to you because you are an administrator and live in Ontario (this deals with a local issue). I came across a new user <a href="../../../h/u/b/User%7EHubert_Derus_a047.html" title="User:Hubert Derus">User:Hubert Derus</a> who has added a few pages. One is on the Beaverton River a small river that flows into Lake Simcoe. Unfortunately the text has been copied verbatim from the MNR website at <a href="http://nhic.mnr.gov.on.ca/areas/areas_report.cfm?areaid=10293" class="external free" title="http://nhic.mnr.gov.on.ca/areas/areas_report.cfm?areaid=10293" rel="nofollow">http://nhic.mnr.gov.on.ca/areas/areas_report.cfm?areaid=10293</a>.</p>
<p>I know there is something wrong with this but I am not sure what Wikipedia policy it violates. Is it copyright? Is it plagiarism? Is it uncited material? What should he be told to fix up the page. I don't want to give him the wrong information. I've already sent him a message about uncivil language from another edit discussion.</p>

<p>Hello. Wow you have done alot of work here. Goodstuff. As you can see for some reason this ATRIAN has been following me from article to article vadalizing them and just beeing an all around pain in the bum. I dont mean to break the rules in anyway and ill be more careful next time. However i would appreciate if this ATRAIN would find himself someone also to follow around and bother. Ive only been a WIKI member for 4 days and already this doosh bag has some kind of beef with me. I DONT APPRECIATE him using my NAME on his post. The topic of the article would have done just fine. But you can see what im talkin about when i say doosh bag. The man thinks hes got the right to go around and pick on people. P.S. ATRIAN. Please STOP useing my NAME in your comments. And stop following me around. Sure ill make mistakes im not a pro writer. But if Atrian likes to hear himself talk so much he should find someone who cares about what hes saying. I hope im not offending you. But like i said ive been a memeber for 3-4 days and this guy is been leaving me nasty comments since the first article i posted. Thanks. I also wonder how Atrian knows that i didnt have promision to use that text.? Wouldnt it be possible that i know the webmaster that wrote it for the goverment page that i copied it from? WHat reasearch has he done into this? The man is a panzy. And he was the first to send me a nasty comment. I belive i have the right to defend my self. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Bearcat, try <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/sec/SrchLogin-e?login=true" class="external text" title="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/sec/SrchLogin-e?login=true" rel="nofollow">this link</a> for the Canada Revenue Agency's database, it works on my computer, otherwise perhaps go through the CRA's main site to access their charity database. It appears that all non-profit universities, public and private, are in the database, but not for-profit ones like <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devry.html" title="Devry">Devry</a>. For example, check "Universisty of British Columbia" in their records. Check the 2005 Registered Charity Information Return. It states that the designation of the entity is "Charitable organization", and that it has assets of $2.5 billion dollars. Additionally the list of Directors in the CRA record matches those published as comprising UBC's board of governors <a href="http://www.bog.ubc.ca/members/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bog.ubc.ca/members/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>The article began originally as a rather self-serving and self promoting advert in which the author boasted to making $10,000 a day via Google ads. Anoter Wikipedia user suggested that the entire Wiki entry be removed, and I agreed, if this continues.</p>
<p>The entry is somewhat self-serving and this is wrong. To reinforce my argument, I attempted to add a chapter on a matter that affects many users - account deletion. Accounts are deleted daily on POF for reasons ranging from simply being from the wrong country, to open proxies, to offensive behaviour ot to being "deemed" a spam risk.</p>
<p>To back up my comment about the widespread problem of LEGITIMATE users being deleted, I cited actual messages from the website in which users complained about the problem. The messages magically disappeared the dame day. The same IP (from British Columbia 207.216.233.184 where the owner of POF coincidentally lives) has routinely wiped out entire sections of that Wiki, when disagreeing with what has been said. The comments are neutral in nature, stating a widespread issue for users. On any given day the message forum on POF is full of complaints from users who were deleted for no apparent cause.</p>
<p>Trying to remain neutral, I don't feel that (a) this article should be entirely positive self-serving material for the author of the site. It reads as an advertisement. (b) The person from 207.216.233.184 should not be deleting other peoples entries even if disagreeing with them.</p>
<p>I'm requesting that perhaps you could keep an eye out for this, as I find it rather troublesome that if anything is mentioned that the author of POF dislikes, he simply deletes it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help, i realised my capitalization was wrong after i had created the article, but i wasn't sure how to change it, also i thought that the label 'LBGT' was possibly too vague in which you could put in anyone who meerly has some attraction to the same sex rather than a preference, also their are other categories that begin with 'Gay..' such as Gay actors, so why is mine any different?</p>

<p>Bearcat,</p>
<p>Could you review the request on Homey's talk page. Someone has blocked him for 24h on what appears to be a questionable interpretation of the 3RR; I'm a participant in the debate, so I don't want to remove the block myself. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 22:35, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>About your unblocking of Homeontherange. Your unblocking summary said "<i>disputed edit is not a clear 3RR violation; two separate issues, neither of which individually exceeded the 3RR rule, were conflated into one.</i>" <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia:Three-revert_rule</a> specifically says (in bold letters in the Detail section):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Note: There is no requirement for the reverts to be related: any four reverts on the same page count.</b>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Meaning your reason for unblocking Homeontherange was based on a flawed understanding of policy. Furthermore, <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> clearly says "If you disagree with a block, begin by discussing it with the blocking admin. Admins should not undo each other's blocks, except in certain limited circumstances." You made no such effort. Again, unblocking outside of policy. I'd like for you to explain your actions in light of your apparent failure to understand exactly what consitutes a 3RR vio per WP:3RR and failure to follow WP:BLOCK. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 01:53, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wouldn't object to an RFC, and I could try to provide a summary (although I haven't been one of the major participants in this discussion).</p>
<p>Btw, my position on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_apartheid.html" title="Israeli apartheid">Israeli apartheid</a> is that the article can serve a useful purpose by covering recent and historical usage of the phrase, without either endorsing or rejecting its viability. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 01:51, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To let you know ... Homeontherange has now acknowledged that he was technically in violation of the 3RR. According to the official policy page, any admin now has the discretion of lifting his ban (regardless of whether or not it was properly or improperly applied in the first place). I would prefer not to do this myself for procedural reasons, as I was a participant in the parent discussion. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 04:35, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand fully. However, according to the 3RR policy, any administrator has the discretion of lifting a block if the person who violated 3RR acknowledges his/her error:</p>
<p><i>(I've been blocked under 3RR! What do I do?)</i> <i>First, check if you actually did make a fourth revert in 24 hours or very close to it.</i></p>
<p><i>*If you didn't, you should email the admin who blocked you (or another admin), politely point this out and ask to be unblocked.</i> <i>*If you did, you should either wait the 24 hours or email the admin who blocked you (or another admin), acknowledge your error, and ask to be unblocked. (They may, of course, choose not to.)</i></p>
<p>Under these circumstances, you would not be reverting or undoing FeloniousMonk's block; you would rather be accepting the legitimacy of the block, and taking separate action to mitigate the penalty. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 04:46, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would be obvious that that would needlessly inflame the situation, especially considering the fact that Homey has been blocked several times before and has gotten out of even more blocks by promising to be better in the future (including on articles where he is later blocked again for the same action). Also in response to your statement that you "shouldn't be blamed for not understanding the 3RR rules". I would agree, but would also say that nobody is exactly blaming you for that, the only thing some people are upset about is the fact that you unblocked Homeontherange, and thus initiated a wheel war regarding a policy you may have misunderstood.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 06:13, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And here's what I've found:</p>
<p>"In July 1957 Philip Kelly resigned as minister of mines. [...] [In March 1958], Kelly publicly confirmed that "one of the main reasons for his resignation was his family connections with the pipeline deals"". (p. 77)</p>
<p>"But in April 1958 the government's case was badly shaken. A Toronto Star reporter had bought a NONG share and exercised his rights to examine the list of stockholders. On the list he found Colonel William Griesinger, the minister of public works, who held stock in defiance of the premier's repeated instructions. With that revelation, Griesinger resigned." (p. 77)</p>
<p>"Also in July, another development added further fuel to the fire when the Toronto reported that Clare Mapledoram, minister of lands and forests, had also received a block of promotional stock, purchased through George Durica, his brother-in-law. So he resigned -- the third minister to go." (pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>Liberal leader John Wintermeyer also owned personal shares in the company. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 22:09, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry to bother you, but I would like a bit of assistance with another user. There has been a dispute on the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_Returns_385b.html" title="Superman Returns">Superman Returns</a> Talk page. A user did not sign a comment that he left. When I informed him to "please sign comments" on that talk page he proceeded to edit my comment. I know that editing other's comments on Talk pages is forbidden. When I left a warning for him on his Talk page he removed it. I placed the warning back and he removed it again, on the grounds that it was a "personal attack", and he felt this way because I have been "blocked" before for vandalism (Please see my talk page to understand that another admin actually abused his privileges to block me from editing a page that he didn't want changed, even if I was in the right). I have warned him not to remove warnings from his Talk page, as per Wiki guidelines but he refuses to listen. If you could please check his page (<a href="../../../c/m/d/User_talk%7ECmdrClow_2bea.html" title="User talk:CmdrClow">User talk:CmdrClow</a>), my page (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">User talk: Bignole</a>), and the Superman Returns talk page to see this whole situation I would appreciate it.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../b/i/l/Image%7EBillblair.jpg_dcde.html" title="Image:Billblair.jpg">Image:Billblair.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

<p>I saw that reference as well. I can't seem to find any other mention of it.

I would assume it is an error. I think the people who get the Order are also documented in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_Gazette_1c32.html" title="Canada Gazette">Canada Gazette</a> so if you find out what year Lorenzon Cadieux received the Order you could double check there. --<a href="../../../y/u/l/User%7EYUL89YYZ_a738.html" title="User:YUL89YYZ">YUL89YYZ</a> 23:21, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A further (serious) sub-request: Could I ask that you let me know if I've gone overboard in reverting GD, or if I'm making too much of a trivial matter?

<p>By the way, I noticed the your blurb on CJCurrie's talk page, and I'll contemplate that constructive criticism. The "step away" is also helpful too, as there are lots of things in wikipedia besides Canadian politics. I guess that is how "dogfighting" (over balance) occurs in articles, even though CJCurrie and I have most of the basic ideas sorted out. CJCurrie and I have never had prolonged conflicts over the NDP or Jack Layton articles.</p>

<p>As it was just created (minutes after he did the CfD), I was able to have it deleted. Then, SPUI got an administrator to put it back. Would you support removal at Redirects for Deletion? If so, I'll gladly nominate it.</p>

<dd>Yeah, I'd support it. SPUI's clearly on some kind of weird campaign to manoeuvre his way <i>around</i> the fact that he can't get consensus for what he thinks is right, and that seems to be entirely normal behaviour for him based on what I've read about his past arbitration disputes. At any rate, I agree that's a completely unnecessary redirect; nobody, but nobody, is <i>ever</i> going to type the phrase "King's Highway (Ontario)" into the search box. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:18, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just got an email from someone to revert what appears to be vandalism from users pm_shef and CJCurrie of the following articles <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Di_Biase_329d.html" title="Michael Di Biase">Michael Di Biase</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaughan_municipal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Vaughan municipal election, 2006">Vaughan municipal election, 2006</a>. I reveiwed all the edits and the many "reverts", I can't justify why pm_shef and CJCurrie removed portions of these aritlces other than the obvious which is just pushing pm_shef's political agenda (keeping in mind who pm_shef's father is). The pages are now semi protected with the incorrect version posted, the vandalism from pm_shef removed content from each article that provied a source. I can still edit them but I really don’t want to get involved with this non-sense. I understand that you are an admin. So could you make the nessasary changes? I think the articles should be reverted and protected. I still think pm_shef should be banned from wikipedia, his edits are nothing more than pushing propaganda.--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyCanuck_3ddd.html" title="User:JohnnyCanuck">JohnnyCanuck</a> 01:31, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's exceptions to that: notably Steppenwolf, which had more Canadians than Americans in it, and is considered by Canadians to be a Canadian band (how else could the words to <i>American Woman</i> make sense, given the times?).

<p>I gather by your deletion of the <i>Canadian writers</i> category that the journalist category must be a sub-cat of the writers category; but Terry's <i>both</i>; also a historian, and in not a small way. Can someone be only one thing as a writer? If so, then he should be a writer, and not listed primarily as a journalist; on the other hand I can ask him for you directly, unless you know him yourself...sifting, bottling and labelling people into this or that and either/or is a frustrating thing when dealing with multi-faceted people. Terry's roots are as a journalist; his soul is that of a poet, his craft that of a natural scientist and culture-historian. Is he only, in Wikispace, a journalist?<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 07:25, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently, I posted some information regarding Bell Globemedia's intention to buy CHUM Limited (with a link to the CBC article) on every article that contains information about all the channels owned or partly-owned by CHUM. I just found out that information has been removed from most of those channel's articles.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that information should still be there (thus a possible need to revert all recent edits to the last edit by me or anyone else who added/removed some other information after my last edits) or if what's there now should remain as it is.</p>
<p>The ball is in your court, as they say, as I'm still figuring out/learning some more new things here. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapleLeafFan04_ee75.html" title="User:MapleLeafFan04">MapleLeafFan04</a> 21:45, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Bearcat,</p>
<p>Since you're one of the most prolific Wikipedians on the topic of the CBC, I wonder if you'd be up for an email interview with me that I can post on the CBC blog?</p>
<p>You wouldn't have to give up your real identity, but I'd love to ask you about your informal role here on Wikipedia, how/why you started editing stuff about CBC on here, etc.</p>
<p>Up for it?</p>

<p>There's a bit of a controversy about inclusion of information regarding a kickback scandal that occured during Devine's administration of the province. Devine himself was never implicated, but the scandal led to the implosion of the PC party. the debate (which may very well have strayed into an edit war) is whether or not inclusion of said information is useful.

<p>I was adding the {catneeded} tag to my articles as I felt that the category I was using was very minor, and the article needed proper categorisation.

<p>A while ago I put this up for speedy deletion because it was copied directly from a website. I warned the user (User:DerekDD) about copyright, they responded by changing one word in the article, I told them that this was not good enough (check the history of his talk page for my comments, he removed them later). The article got speedy deleted. And now the same user has recreated the page with, I'm pretty sure, the exact same content, but I can't find the website he copied it from now. Could you use your magic admin powers to look at the old deleted page, it should have the link to the page he copied from in my speedy nomination. You mind issuing him a stricter warning about copyright as well?

<li>sorry about that. Yeah, my opinion is that there should be a separate article called "Theta Beta Potata". The article that was there was deleted once when I wrote it in May. Then it was deleted after another user wrote it a few days ago. And then it was deleted when I re-wrote the article with sources and updated content yesterday. I think the subject is much more notable than many of the articles that are currently on wikipedia, my favorite example being: Honky punk. Without comparing though, the Theta Beta Potata was a real house which hosted around 300 bands. Also the Potata is unique in that it was established in at least 2 cities (Iowa City and Milwaukee) and maybe more. Anyway, if you get a chance please lend your opinion to the discussion. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion_review</a> (Scroll to August 23rd).

<p>Sorry if you think I screwed up, but naming conventions in the English Wikipedia, as I understand them, are not to be what some Canadians might use, but what an Englsh speaker from anywhere in the world would use. In the case of Montreal Polytechic, it gets 600,000 hits on Google. No Brit, American, Aussie etc. newspaper/tv/magazine or individuals would ever refer to the <i>Université du Québec à Montréal</i> or <i>École Polytechnique</i>. Those Canadians who might because they are used to hearing it in an officially bilingual country are a tiny portion of the global population of English speakers. However, if you disagree with the interpretation I and others have come to for <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>, then probably you should do a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> to clarify it.

<p>You have expressed your opinions and I respect that. However, you have not supported them with a link to actual policy on the subject. You did say that "an RFC and a policy discussion have both already happened." Please give me a link so I can study them. And, regardless, Wikipedia constantly evolves so another look at it might be warranted as I understand has been done often for numerous matters of importance.</p>
<p>You said "The reason I cited the names that are used in Canadian English is because Canadian English speakers are the only ones who need to refer to the institutions on anything even approximating a remotely regular basis". I think you might well find virtually all Wikipedians would disagree with the imposition of such limitations and might even find such concepts as discriminatory. The English Wikipedia exists to make knowledge easily and readily available to all who understand the language -- from everywhere. If they don't understand English they can go to one of the other Wikipedias in another language or even start a new one!</p>
<p>As I already mentioned, some Canadians might use the French terminology because they are used to hearing it in an officially bilingual country but Canadians are a tiny portion of the global population of English speakers. Just to make a point with an example on you reverting me (and others previously) from University of Montreal to <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universit%C3%A9_de_Montr%C3%A9al_2427.html" title="Université de Montréal">Université de Montréal</a>: <b>this English Wikipedia does not use the following on both minor and major institutions</b>:</p>

<dd>I'm afraid I don't see the benefit in demonstrating a point with American institutions, or institutions in nations without English as a second <b>official</b> language. I would suggest better examples would come from A) A country which has two or more official languages, of which English is one. B) A university which was originally, and officially, named in (one of) the official language(s) that happens to not be English. I do not believe any of the above examples fit the bill. In my province, at least, the politically correct thing to do is to refer to the institution by its French name, if it is named in French.

<dd>As per your response, i agree now, that as per wikipedia guidelines a regularly scheduled upgrade release is not a new distribution that merits a separate article, but i just found the logic that coz A and B doesn't have an article of their own, so C of the same series shouldn't also. I would rather believe that if permitted by guidelines, even A and B should get their own. ;-)</dd>

<li>Bearcat, first off, long time no talk - I hope you've been will. Quick question for you, regarding your adding of the LGBT Authors category to Michael Chabon's page. Was this in reference to the content of his books, or to his own sexuality? I ask because he has, on a number of occasions publicly stated that he is in fact heterosexual. So I just wanted to clarify the purpose of this addition. Thanks! - <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 01:11, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I saw your comment that it is "a policy requirement" that we keep categories small. I believe this requirement is obsolete, and I don't think it is anywhere in the current <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_21c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">categorization guidelines</a>. There is a custom of "diffusing" categories into their subcatgories, but there isn't even a clear consensus on that. The problem, as I see it, is that people want the categorization system to do more things than it was designed to do. I've seen useful categories being chopped and diffused into smaller subcategories that I think are much less useful. I'm sure some people will find the small sub-categories to be more useful than the larger ones, but others will miss the fully populated larger categories. For example, I was sad to see <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilm_directors_457f.html" title="Category:Film directors">Category:Film directors</a> broken up into categories by nationality. I've almost given up on the category system as I think it is seriously flawed.</p>
<p>Because of this problems like this, Rick Block and I have put together <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategory_intersection_86ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Category intersection">a proposal to add category intersections</a>. We've written a proposal, along with mock-ups of how it might look, and are requesting people who have been concerned with categorization to come and take a look at it. I hope you can take a look and give us your feed-back. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 05:22, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> doesn't like me. He has insulted me in the past and, recently, he was blocked for posting the following insult in his <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">user page</a>: "My greatest achievements here [...] have been [...] and restoring José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero from the POV of another user who claims to write about saints." (See the entry for August 21 in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" rel="nofollow">block log</a>) My nick, Hagiographer means just that, "to write about saints", so it's clear that comment is a direct attack against me. Furthermore, when I came to the article about Zapatero SqueakBox had already been banned from editing Zapatero's editing articles by the Arbitraton Committee (what can he restore?). And, in fact, I've never contributed or deleted information from any of those articles. I simply reverted some vandalism SqueakBox introduced as part of his harassment campaing against other user who was also banned by the same Arbitration Comittee decision. So, that paragraph is pure slander.</p>
<p>Taking <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> into account, I believe that paragraph should be deleted or, at least, marked like what it is, a personal attack. I did just that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996here" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. However, SqueakBox removed it and <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> protected the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71242385&amp;oldid=71181172" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71242385&amp;oldid=71181172" rel="nofollow">here</a>. SqueakBox has had a lot of problems with other users and, sometimes, Guettarda has taken part in them. For example, in <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> can be found a barnstar given by <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> in which he says that SqueakBox has gone beyond the call of duty in his fight against "strange" people in the article <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a>. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> states clearly that comments must be about content not users so it's clear that Guettarda and SqueakBox have cooperated in, at least, dubious actions against other users. It's also clear Guettarda is biased in favor of SqueakBox. In this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" rel="nofollow">edit</a> in my talk page, he implies that I like looking for conflict, that I'm obsessed with SqueakBox that I've to settle down and so on, all violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and unpleasant remarks.</p>
<p>It mustn't be forgotten that according to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, user pages belong to everybody and I don't believe a wikipedian has any right to transform his user page in a platform to attack other users. So Guettarda's supposed protection of SqueakBox's user page (really of SqueakBox's insults) is very difficult to defend in my opinion.</p>
<p>I'm simply asking fair treatment. I don't believe I have to see how the Wikipedia is populated with insults against me. I believe SqueakBox can contribute useful edits without transforming his user page into a gallery of attacks. So please, either unprotect the page so <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> can be applied, or remove the negative comment or mark it as a personal attack untolerable in the Wikipedia or, at least, explain to me why I have to bear that kind of treatment. SqueakBox has been blocked for that unpleasant remark, What is the use of blocking him and then keeping the insult?

<p>I've been noting that museum cat and its changes...not sure that storyeum qualifies as a museum. If it does, so does Capilano Canyon Suspension Bridge and its add-ons, and so would Fantasy Gardens be if it was still open. Storyeum is a theme park, and <i>not</i> historically correct in its content, no less; it's a tourist attraction with a tightly-written, propagandistic script. Sure, museums can have tightly-written, propagandistic scripts too, but they're open to peer review. That aside, I'm just not sure "museum" is the right way to describe this thing.

<p>Fair enough - though my fear is still that the way it was worded might suggest to the reader that these studies did genuinely show the existence of bisexuality to be rare, and it is merely that some people dispute this; rather I would say that saying bisexuality is only 50/50 is a false claim in the first place, if that makes sense. But I'm happy to try rewording it.</p>
<p>I still feel examples of the studies would be better - also note that the study I presume you are referring to (?) has been discussed quite a lot in Talk with several people against such studies being included (see <a href="../../../b/i/s/Talk%7EBisexuality_443e.html" title="Talk:Bisexuality">Talk:Bisexuality</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/s/Talk%7EBisexuality_Archive_1_b84c.html#Recent_research" title="Talk:Bisexuality/Archive 1">Talk:Bisexuality/Archive_1#Recent research</a>) - not to say that it shouldn't be included of course, just pointing out that this is a bit of a controversial topic.</p>

<dd>Hey there. I've been keeping an eye on this case from the sidelines, as I stumbled in to Kinsella's page a while back and have been keeping track of it all. Wanted to point something out; I'm sure someone involved in this case will have picked up on this, but just in case it sneaks past: the IP used to post the statement allegedly from Bourrie today, 142.78.190.137, also posted several other items of evidence: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rachel_Marsden/Evidence&amp;diff=78309583&amp;oldid=78299718" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rachel_Marsden/Evidence&amp;diff=78309583&amp;oldid=78299718" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rachel_Marsden/Evidence&amp;diff=78310483&amp;oldid=78309583" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rachel_Marsden/Evidence&amp;diff=78310483&amp;oldid=78309583" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rachel_Marsden/Evidence&amp;diff=78311149&amp;oldid=78310483" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rachel_Marsden/Evidence&amp;diff=78311149&amp;oldid=78310483" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, which were then merged in with evidence from 209.217.119.10 - who refers to Bourrie in the third person - at some point along the way.

<p>I was wondering if I could pick your brain for a moment.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecimal10_ef1d.html" title="User:Decimal10">User:Decimal10</a> insists on creating a new section in this article called "Criticism". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=74812610&amp;oldid=74811330" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=74812610&amp;oldid=74811330" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> I have no problem with that, except that the content that Decimal10 moved to the section isn't criticism of the chain, but rather a critique of those who seek to elevate the chain to Canadian icon -- so I pointed out that the paragraph in question appropriately belongs in the section of the article already dealing with the chain's alleged cultural status.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=74924305&amp;oldid=74924166" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=74924305&amp;oldid=74924166" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></p>
<p>Decimal10 reverted my edit, and his edit summary suggests that he didn't understand or care about the point I was making. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=74977632&amp;oldid=74932099" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=74977632&amp;oldid=74932099" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> So, I raised the issue on the discussion page (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETim_Hortons_ce37.html#Weasel_Words" title="Talk:Tim Hortons">here</a>), where I received positive feedback from another editor, but Decimal10 didn't participate in the discussion (even though he continued to edit the article and post other comments on the talk page). Nine days later, figuring I given Decimal10 ample opportunity to respond (and guessing that maybe Decimal10 now understood the distinction I was making), I moved the paragraph in question back to where it had originally been.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Decimal10 has reverted my edit without explanation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=77209475&amp;oldid=77168732" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hortons&amp;diff=77209475&amp;oldid=77168732" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>). Given how volatile Decimal10 can be, I want to be careful here, and I do not wish to become involved in some silly edit war. It would be helpful if you could look at the paragraph in question (if you have time) and add your two cents. I do not mind if you end up disagreeing with me (and agreeing with Decimal10) -- it would be great either way to have some third party feedback.</p>

<p>Hi, I noticed you're breaking up the category per-city (and maybe other school cats?). I have mixed feelings about it, but am ok with it. But, could I ask/suggest that, since you did this, that you define (in the category description), what you're using as your definition of "Calgary": the city limits, the relevant district's boundries, or the CMA. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:35, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just curious as to why you think the longlist should not be acknowledged on the Giller Prize page. It's the first year that this was instituted for this prize, so I suggest that it's worth recognizing. (It's also cross-referenced on the pages of some of the authors who were longlisted.) In addition, the Booker Prize shows both the long- and shortlist, per:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_prize#The_2006_Prize" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_prize#The_2006_Prize" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_prize#The_2006_Prize</a></p>

<p>Hi...could you add <a href="../../../p/r/o/Projet_Orange_e008.html" title="Projet Orange">Projet Orange</a> to the exceptions list? I realize that "projet" is a fairly common misspelling for "project", but in this particular case it's actually the correct spelling of the band's name — while they perform English material now, they started off as a francophone band from <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_City_5f2c.html" title="Quebec City">Quebec City</a> and originally named themselves in French. (The bot made the change on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Wilcox_d7f9.html" title="Simon Wilcox">Simon Wilcox</a>, a musician who's collaborated with the band in the past.

<p>Since you were involved in helping develop a separate Canadian convention, I thought you would like to know that some editors have proposed merging the American and Canadian conventions and dragging Canadian city names once again into their endless debate over the appropriateness of the "City, State" form.

<p>Hate to bother you, but Decimal10 is at it again, engaging in wholesale reverts to the Tim Hortons article (erasing the edits of various editors), and taking a particularly "firm stance" in the whole "doughnut vs. donut" discussion. I have left him a message on his talk page explaining why I believe his behaviour is inappropriate (<a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDecimal10_a86a.html#Your_vandalism_of_Tim_Hortons" title="User talk:Decimal10">User talk:Decimal10#Your vandalism of Tim Hortons</a>), which I imagine he will likely simply erase or ignore.

<dd>Thanks for your quick response. Here's the thing: the article is called <i>Fifth Column</i> rather than <i><a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_column.html" title="Fifth column">Fifth column</a></i> - the latter is an entirely different article. The word <i>fifth column</i> is a generic phrase found in any dictionary. This is why I'm positive why no one except two users had a problem with the article convention. Maybe some people are offended by queercore, who knows. But the fact remains that since the band is named <i>Fifth Column</i> (capitalized) and this form is never used in the generic sense (<a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_column.html" title="Fifth column">fifth column</a>), it's ridiculous for this user to have moved it to <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Column_%28band%29_3061.html" title="Fifth Column (band)">Fifth Column (band)</a>.

<p>Hi, I had the impression that in an AfD, the comments "Keep", "Merge", "Rename", or "Redirect" would all be treated as "Keep" by a closing Admin, since they all indicate a view that the article should <i>not</i> be deleted. After reviewing your statements at the Frot AfD, I wonder if I'm mistaken. My basic position is that the article should be kept, but I'm not opposed to renaming it. If you could clarify this for me I would certainly consider changing my comments if it seems appropriate. I wanted to ask you directly because you're an Admin, and therefore clearly more experienced than I. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me on this one. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 20:45, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You wrote on my user page: "I don't insert my own opinions into articles. Never have, and didn't start with that one. One doesn't generally get to be an administrator on here if one doesn't know how to keep their own views out of their edits." Obviously <i>one</i> becomes busy when <i>one</i> becomes an administrator and that is understandable. And so, <i>one</i> may make errors. But clearly, <i>you</i> <i>Bearcat</i> inserted your opinion into an article (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_%28Jane_Siberry_album%29_ef0d.html" title="Maria (Jane Siberry album)">Maria</a>)in December, 2004 (TWO YEARS!!! - way to go wikipedia!!!) where it remained until I edited it out this evening. As you yourself are aware, <i>one's</i> own opinions do not belong in an article. I am kindly asking you to please refrain from putting anymore of your own opinions in articles. Thank you.<a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 12:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm sorry. Maybe I am mistaken. But, you put into the article the following: "Critics had often labelled Siberry as quirky, but this was the first track in her discography to be widely considered outright flaky." I am having trouble with the WHOLE sentence, and certainly the last few words are outrageous. If it's not your opinion but the opinion of someone else, a critic perhaps, you should have cited it - but you didn't. The reader was left to believe that it is YOUR opinion. Or it's plagiarism. Simple.<a href="../../../d/d/d/User%7EDDD_DDD_0d37.html" title="User:DDD DDD">DDD DDD</a> 13:02, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Bearcat:</p>
<p>I am writing for your assistance with an article I have just created called<i><a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanie4Jackie_8a82.html" title="Joanie4Jackie">Joanie4Jackie</a></i>. The minute I finished typing it, it was nominated for deletion by <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBladeswin_9842.html" title="User:Bladeswin">User:Bladeswin</a>. It is my view that the article is a notable example of a cultural product, a <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zine.html" title="Zine">zine</a>, created by a notable woman director, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranda_July_be0c.html" title="Miranda July">Miranda July</a>, and with contributions by other notable women directors, including <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Rae_Carland_5db4.html" title="Tammy Rae Carland">Tammy Rae Carland</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Hammer_7c52.html" title="Lisa Hammer">Lisa Hammer</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Jacobson_cf38.html" title="Sarah Jacobson">Sarah Jacobson</a> and <a href="../../../g/2E/b/G.B._Jones_1b98.html" title="G.B. Jones">G.B. Jones</a>, all who have their own pages included on Wikipedia. It is also my view that perhaps those unfamiliar with alternative culture or in the case of several of these directors, queer culture, might not understand the importance of such a project. It is my belief that it is certainly as notable as many of the zines profiled on Wikipedia. I would be interested in your opinion, whether that assistance comes in the form of how to improve the article or in the form of voting to subject the page to an open vote, rather than being the subject of a speedy deletion, or any other suggestions you can offer. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.</p>

<p>I have noticed on two seperate occassions you have changed <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio_58.html" title="Studio 58">Studio 58</a>'s category to Culture of Vancouver. As one of the lead participants in the <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVancouver_14fe.html" title="WP:Vancouver">WikiProject Vancouver</a> and as well as the Assistant Production Manager at Studio 58, I request that you stop changing its categories for several reasons. Studio 58 is the theatre arts school part of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langara_College_6069.html" title="Langara College">Langara College</a>, a college of the Association of Canadian Community Colleges. This falls under a government funded educational facility in the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">City of Vancouver</a>. Other educational facilities such as the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Film_School_f8b3.html" title="Vancouver Film School">Vancouver Film School</a> (acting and technical school), <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Community_College_6430.html" title="Vancouver Community College">Vancouver Community College</a> (which also has a significant arts program), and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Fraser_University_b6e7.html" title="Simon Fraser University">Simon Fraser University</a> (includes a large dance school and contemporary theatre arts school) are all listed under the Vancouver category. For all the same reasons it would be in the best interest of the article not to be alienated from its directly equal articles and from our attempts to standardize the methods of organization for all WikiProject Vancouver articles. Thank you. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 09:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The need for a category pertaining to Vancouver Education Vancouver Schools is apparent. However, moving articles from one inapropriate category to another will not solve the problem of organizing articles. While culture is an accurate word to describe the developement of the arts through training, the 'Culture of Vancouver', as per Wikipedia Naming Conventions suggests its a title rather than 'Vancouver culture' is not appropriate for educational schools that have an affliation with the arts. I will be creating a new category to address this issue. <a href="../../../m/k/d/User%7EMkdw_2a30.html" title="User:Mkdw"><span style="font-size: 13px arial; color: #3366FF;">Mkdw</span></a><a href="../../../m/k/d/User_talk%7EMkdw_2d50.html" title="User talk:Mkdw"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></a> 09:23, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I have a list of all schools in Vancouver from our WikiProject. I also have discovered several other categories such as <a href="../../../h/i/g/Category%7EHigh_schools_in_Vancouver_749b.html" title="Category:High schools in Vancouver">Category:High_schools_in_Vancouver</a>.

<p>Hi -- I am largely the author of the Imperial Court System article in its present form. I notice that you rv'd some of the categories I assigned the article. Indeed I was over-zealous and under-discerning in this regard -- thanks for appropriately curbing my enthuiasm (I'm kinda new here). Since you are an administrator, would you please do me the favor of helping to keep an eye on the Crispus Attucks article? It seems there are three different users (or puppets) who are vandalizing the page with increasing frequency.

<p>Hi, I saw that you just did some recategorization of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millo_Torres_803e.html" title="Millo Torres">Millo Torres</a>. While I'm really glad to see someone else cleaning up some of these categories, in this <i>particular</i> case, I think you made a mistake changing (e.g.) Rock singer to American rock singer, because Millo Torres is Puerto Rican. I realize that's a bit of an edge case, since it's an American protectorate, but it is still an independent commonwealth. Anyway, unless you tell me you disagree, I'm probably going to revert that change. But it's not something I feel very strongly about. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 09:09, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You just upgraded my edit of the Daniel Boucher article, and I thank you for doing it. The reason I categorized him as a Canadian musician is that, since the new subcategory lists changed, I don't have access to them. All I get when I click on one is "loading". I notice you are an admin. in Wiki. Do you have any idea when and/or if this will change?</p>
<p>Frustrated.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what defines a city either. I think Saskatchewan has a law on the books, and perhaps Newfoundland, but other than that- I have no clue.

<p>Hello Bearcat. I see your point about <a href="../../../w/y/c/WYCD_b117.html" title="WYCD">WABX</a>'s (Detroit) reassignment to it's successor call letters. The problem is that nobody interested in an article on the Detroit alternative FM station from the 60's will recognize it by this moniker. WABX was terribly important to the cultural development of Detroit. A reference to the Detroit use of this call sign at the end of the article might not be noticed by a user who thinks she is in the wrong place. I am not that experienced of an editor, but could we use disambiguation and/or redirection to deal with this? No disrespect meant to the great City of Evansville.

<p>Pirate Cat Radio has been broadcasting for 10 years, we receive letters from the FCC on a weekly basis. The FCC can not ever raid us be cause we are the first station to ever use Title 47 Section 73.3542 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations in our defense to broadcast. As far as famous people being involved with the station, the list doesnt end. Jell Biafra, Gavin Newsom, Stan Ridgeway, David Bowie, Lee Ving, Angelo Moore, Exien Cervainca, John Doe, Brian Eno... as if it matters. Pirate Cat Radio is the first and only non-licensed radio station to broadcast simultaneously to two major cities at once. Those cities being Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Stations founder Monkey, has run for major of Hollywood and received over 50% of the pre-election vote. Pirate Cat Radio has inspired other station to come on the air. Pirate Cat Radio is the first non-licensed radio station to start a non-license TV station that runs 24/7. What else do you need to know? We deserve a posting in Wikipedia as much as FRSC does, if not more!</p>
<p>Is Wikipedias censorship worse than the FCC?</p>
<p>Forget it, we don't want to be listed in the Wikipedia. We dont want anything to do with a group of fascist that dont know how to make a clear definition between what can and cant be listed.</p>

<p>Why do you go around and arbitrarily delete information others have worked so hard to post? You did this to a page that I worked for hours on.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is, more or less, a general question regarding categorization in Wiki. This question is not directed at you, but to the Wiki community at large - I just came to you for some input. Why the seeming obsession with the size of category lists? My understanding of the use of categories is to provide a researcher with a complete list of all articles which share a common issue. For example, if I wanted a complete list of all English writers included in Wiki, I should be able to call up such a list. As the powers that be seem to want it, I would have to call up each subcategory, and collate the lists myself. If "Joe Blow" is an English writer, and I enter him only in the 'English novelists' category, he does not appear in the 'English writers' category. Please help me to understand why such a limitation exists in Wiki.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<dd>Thank you for making sense out of the category issue for me. It is frustrating, though. My work is in Clinical Psych. The most important work by far is done, of course, when sitting across from a real, live human being. However, long before encountering this person - and during the course of their treatment - a competent clinician will have studied countless case histories of other persons who have experienced similar problems. By identifying and understanding these similarities, the clinician can more confidently make decisions regarding the person’s treatment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When I came upon Wikipedia early this year I was thrilled. Here were countless biographies (case histories if you will) of persons who, among other things, were categorized according to similar traits and life experiences. I could, for instance, click on the Category “Writers who committed suicide” and have hours of work done for me. Now, as the categories become more diluted, this is becoming more and more unavailable.</dd>

Chiefs of staff are political staffers which are explicitly exempt from the civil service. Is there a third category that would fit? If not, I think this sort of person should be listed in the politician category, though McLaughlin actually fits the civil servant category due to his tenure as a deputy minister. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 20:30, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. I renamed <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_radio.html" title="College radio">College radio</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campus_radio.html" title="Campus radio">Campus radio</a> back in march after proposing it at the article's talk page. Not that there was discussion at the time. I still think campus radio is a better choice than student radio. I know that the UK calls it student radio, but I'm not sure that many other countries do. I think campus is more prevalent, although I have not done an exhaustive search.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The advantage of campus radio as a title is that in many instances it is not simply students that are involved. The radio stations are generally associated with the university/college/school and not simply with the student body itself. Many of these stations, especially in Canada, are closer to community stations than student radio. Calling them campus is a neutral term that encompases, students, colleges and other school types.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I did not see any debate on this. As I put some time into proposing renaming and editing the principal article for the category I'm a bit miffed that I didn't get a chance to weigh in on the renaming. I see there is no talk page for the category, where did this discussion take place?

<dd>I think student radio implies <i>learning about radio</i> while campus radio implies <i>radio originating from campus</i>.

<p>Now, I'm not trying to start anything up that is too serious, I just want to bring your attention to a few things:</p>
<p>First of all, the WP:BIO is, quote, "not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious)." This statement not only suggests, but notes that this is merely a guideline and therefore may not apply in all circumstances.</p>
<p>Next, Jack McCue, while being a nice guy and all is much more than just a nice guy. He virtually created St. Joseph's Catholic Secondary School. I was a student of St. Joe's only last year when we hosted former Prime Minister Paul Martin. There are reasons why the PM chose our school: 1) reputation (the school is well known, making his vist an easily publicized event. This reputation is one that Mr. McCue worked hard for most of his career to build. 2) Mr. McCue retired that same year. This was also recognition of the service of a great man (educators are government employees).</p>
<p>Finally, a small side note... one of the ways someone can be included as a "notable person" is by the point: A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following.... Mr. McCue has the support of thousands of people, including current students (the school has an enrollment of approximately 1000 students) former students (the number of alumni are in the approximate range of 2500-3500 students), parents as well as local politicians, lawmakers and policy makers past and present. This certainly qualifies as, at the very least, a cult following.</p>
<p>Tauntobr 02:46, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For his contributions to the community, not just his position as a high school principal, on top of what i mentioned in my last note, yes, Mr. McCue does deserve a position in this list. Tauntobr 02:54, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that you do not understand what this project is about. Wikipedia is a way for people to learn about all different things from all over the world. For someone in Singapore, to use your example, to read about a small Canadian city called Cornwall means that they will learn about that city. Jack McCue is an important part of that city, and therefore people from around the world deserve to read about him, even if it may only be his name in a list of notable people.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Mr. McCue is important in the city of Cornwall, and therefore adds to that city's definition. Therefore people who read about Cornwall should also read about him. Tauntobr 03:05, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not arguing that there are rules, but that is where the argument is mine, my friend. I gave reasons, all in accordance to these rules, why he should be included in this list. You are the one choosing to not acknowlege this. Tauntobr 03:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me make myself clear, on top of WP:BIO <b>not</b> being Wikipedia policy, just a <b>guideline</b>, i pointed out that he was recognized by the <b>Prime Minister of Canada</b> and has, by definition a <b>cult following</b> which is included in the <b>guidelines</b> outlined in WP:BIO. Tauntobr 03:14, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Look at the following links....</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2005/05/c4903.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2005/05/c4903.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Note: I purposefully found a link to an article which does not neccessarily put Mr.McCue in a good light, because on WP:BIO points out that things people have done can be "for better or for worse".</p>
<p>Also, I got these links from Google. I can get more if you like. Tauntobr 03:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>These articles did just that! One is from a government agency, and two are from news agencies. Point being: the man has been recognized... He deserves a spot on the list of notable people from Cornwall! I have provided enough proof to support my argument. If you will not allow it, I will find a neutral third party to mediate the issue. Tauntobr 03:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is ok. I respect your argument and propose some time off of this dispute. If you don't mind, I am going to put this dispute on the Third Party dispute resolution page and hopefully someone will provide some assistance. Also, if you don't mind, please post your argument on the Cornwall talk page. Arguments can be made there, where everybody can see them and contribute to them. If someone does provide an opinion, I will abide by the desicion made therein. I ask that you do the same. Tauntobr 03:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Bearcat. Perhaps you might be able to help me, as I believe you may have in regards to the article Joanie4Jackie, for which I thank you. In this instance, the User:152.91.9.144 has twice now eliminated every single band on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_queercore_bands.html" title="List of queercore bands">List of queercore bands</a> page that does not have a preexisting article. Needless to say, it doesn't offer anyone else a chance to write an article about any of these bands if there are not red links to begin with, but that's not the point. This user insists that Wikipedia must not make exceptions for "some underrepresented subgroup", by which I infer the user is referring to queer musicians. By this logic, there is no point in there being an article about <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queercore.html" title="Queercore">Queercore</a> at all. In the first instance this user advised that external links were acceptable, so I researched such links for a number of bands. User 152.91.9.144, eliminated all of these links as well, claiming they were "MySpace" or "geocities" bands. This is inaccurate; many of the links were to reviews, or to interested websites such as <i>Homo-a-gogo</i> or <i>Queercore Blitz</i>; regardless, I now wonder if there is a policy at Wikipedia regarding links to MySpace or Geocities. Please advise me. And, more generally, should I cease and desist adding bands to the list of queercore bands, because it is, indeed, Wikipedia's policy that queer musicians are "some underrepresented subgroup" that are not worthy of inclusion in this encyclopedia? I will abide by your advice. If it happens to be the case that Wikipedia is amenable to such a list would it be possible for you to intervene in some manner to make it possible to add to this list without fear that everything will be eliminated? I had changed the first line of the article to read "a complete list", thereby indicating that the list would be comprehensive, but that doesn't seem to have affected the actions of 152.91.9.144. Perhaps it would be possible for you to do so. Thank you. Intheshadows 10:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am currently interested in these pages which have the subject of a lot of editing in the last few months.

<p>Greater Sudbury is purely an administrative name used as the official name of the municipality. It is NOT recognized as a community. Nobody calls it Greater Sudbury, everyone calls it Sudbury. They have the Sudbury Wolves, not the Greater Sudbury Wolves. The radio and TV stations there are all licensed to Sudbury. Stations are licensed to communities, NOT municipalities or census divisions.</p>
<p>If you insist on indicating TV and radio transmitters as licensed to the municipality in which they are in, then I have a whole list of corrections for you. Here are a few:</p>
<p>- CFTR (680 News) Grimsby, Ontario - CFHK-FM (103.1 Fresh FM) Central Elgin, Ontario - CFMJ (AM 640) Lincoln, Ontario - CJBX-FM (BX93) Thames Centre, Ontario - CIII-TV (Global) Brant County, Ontario - CKCO-TV (CTV) Wilmot Township, Ontario - CJOH-TV (CTV) Chelsea, Quebec - CKWS-TV (CBC) Frontenac Islands Township, Ontario - CKVU-TV (Citytv) Capital G, British Columbia - CBUT (CBC) West Vancouver, British Columbia</p>
<p>Most of those names are never used. The CRTC doesn't use them, Industry Canada doesn't use them, and Wikipedia can't be using them. It's just confusing and dumb. It's stuff like this that turns people off Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Firstly, your suggestion that I have nothing to do with Sudbury is off the mark. Although I have not spent much time up there, I have enough family in that area and none of them refer to Greater Sudbury. Show me the documentation that shows that a television or radio station is licensed to a municipality, not a community. I have yet to see a document showing a station being licensed to such a place, with the sole exceptions being Quinte West and Gatineau. If you work in the broadcasting industry and can show me documents that prove your point, it would be appreciated. So far I only have Industry Canada and CRTC materials to work with.</p>
<p>My point is that there needs to be a consistent system for showing where a station is licensed to. While you've insisted on using Greater Sudbury in place of Sudbury, and Chatham-Kent in place of Chatham, there are many other places that have not been named that way, and on Wikipedia continue to use the former community names. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><b>Wingham</b> - North Huron (Township of)<br />
<b>Wiarton</b> - South Bruce Peninsula (Town of)<br />
<b>Wheatley</b> - Chatham-Kent &amp; Leamington (the community is split over not only two municipalities, but two counties)<br />
<b>Paris</b> - Brant County (City of)<br />
<b>Whitney</b> - South Algonquin (Township of)<br />
<b>Barry's Bay</b> - Madawaska Valley (Township of)<br />
<b>Killaloe</b> - Killaloe, Hagarty and Richards (Township of)<br />
<b>Little Current</b> - Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands (Town of)<br />
<b>Simcoe</b> - Norfolk County (City of)</p>
<p>Some of the municipal names above aren't even used by the public.</p>
<p>And what happens if a community a station is licensed to is not part of any municipality? There are many "unorganized" regions of Ontario and the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Your system is just way too complicated, and your logic falls apart. If your reason for using the administrative municipal names is to avoid offending a few residents living in the City of Greater Sudbury, then why should any article related to Sudbury be on Wikipedia, if it is official Wikipedia policy to not have articles that are of strictly local interest? If an article was strictly of local interest, then there might be a valid argument, but since the articles in question are of interest to a much broader base of users, the articles must use terms that are familiar to the general public.</p>
<p>I'll give an example from where I live. Young people around here use the word "mag" in casual conversation (and no, it has nothing to do with magazines). People outside of London don't know what the word means. Therefore, no Wikipedia article is going to use "mag".</p>
<p>Let's just use the names that are on the licenses, and move on to something more important on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/j/l/User%7EMjlarochelle_efdd.html" title="User:Mjlarochelle">Mjlarochelle</a> 03:08, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, you wrote the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grow_Up_and_Blow_Away_4600.html" title="Grow Up and Blow Away">Grow Up and Blow Away</a> article, and said that it could be found widely online. I couldn't find it anywhere online, and I'm just dying to get at it. Think you could point me in the right direction?

<p>Wow. I thought the video thing was valid, just my small contribution of matching a video with a person and getting them to be linked. I am not in politics, just an ordinary person (heehee). Anyway, I submitted my question about linking it just yesterday on Ms. DiNovo's talk page. But now, looking at the history of the page, it opened an energetic surge of vandalism and slanderous remarks. I'm sorry for it~ it seems there wasn't as much vandalism before I posted my blurb on the talk page. Guess it was a can of worms... Anyway, I wanted to commend you for keeping things fair and unbiased. I see you added the video link I suggested, and feel I contributed my little bit of free speech. Thank you, and enjoy the new year. <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHindukillermix_3ce8.html" title="User:Hindukillermix">erin k.</a> 04:21, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry, Bearcat, wasn't meaning to double-categorize people; just wanted to be sure that new biographical articles I create (and old, uncategorized ones I might run across) show up in all the appropriate places. I figure, the more ways to find an article, the more user-friendly Wikipedia is. But I appreciate the tip; I'm still learning my way around all the many possible categories for LGBT things and people. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions in future. :-) --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETextorus_fc78.html" title="User:Textorus">Textorus</a> 05:27, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
