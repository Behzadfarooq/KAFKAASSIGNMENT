<p>Beachhead's real name is Wayne R. Sneeden. He was born and raised in <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn%2C_Alabama_ac2d.html" title="Auburn, Alabama">Auburn, Alabama</a>, living in abject <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>; this led to him being bullied and tormented by his classmates and peers throughout his growing years. In hopes of becoming more then what those taunted him believed he could be, Sneeden became an overachiever and ended up the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valedictorian.html" title="Valedictorian">Valedictorian</a> of his high school through hard work, unwavering discipline, and his keen mind.</p>
<p>Seeking the next challenge, he enlisted in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Army_6d69.html" title="US Army">US Army</a>, where he went through Airborne and Ranger school <a href="../../../f/t/2E/Ft._Benning_485c.html" title="Ft. Benning">Ft. Benning</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28U.S._state%29_7f30.html" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>. After he completed training there, he went onto join <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a>'s Covert Ops as an Observer/Advisor. After his training in Central America, he returned to Ft. Benning as a lane instructor.</p>
<p>He was offered a spot in the G.I. Joe team as a Ranger and after he decided on the codename BEACHHEAD, he joined, eager for the challenge being a member of the most elite force in the US <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">Military</a> would bring.</p>
<p>His unwavering patience on and off the battlefield made him a legend -- as did his intolerance of anyone not willing to live up to their full potential, something he makes quite clear to anyone he feels is a slacker and not working up to their potential. The consummate professional, he is determined and ruthless when needed to get the job done. Beachhead is the first off the copter laying down suppressive fire for the others and is the last back on the copter to protect the backs of his comrades.</p>
<p>Sneeden's habits include getting up hours before his teammates and going on a ten-mile run, then undergoing rigorous physical training that make the most gung-ho of his comrades weary -- and all before breakfast.</p>

<p>In the G.I. Joe Sunbow cartoon 5-part mini series "Arise Serpentor, Arise!", Beachhead and Mainframe are trapped in the coffin of <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlad_Tepes_5bee.html" title="Vlad Tepes">Vlad Tepes</a>. Later when they escape, Mainframe tells Beachhead he wants to talk to him about his deodorant, in which Beachhead replies: "I don't use deodorant."</p>
<p>Although this was a seemingly insignificant bit of comedy, it become a running joke of his character, and many fans have adopted this attribute to Beachhead even though it was never mentioned as <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_text.html" title="Flavor text">flavor text</a> on his filecard or mentioned by writer <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Hama_7f2c.html" title="Larry Hama">Larry Hama</a>; whose filecards and comic writings are considered to be canon of the G.I. Joe mythos by Hasbro Toys.</p>
<p>It was, however, mentioned in the G.I. Joe: Battlefiles Sourcebook published in a joint venture by Image Comics and Devil's Due Publishing, as explaining the comment made in the cartoon with a logical explanation for his less then admirable personal hygiene habits as being a tactical preventative measure, since scented deodorant could literally be a dead give away if he were dropped into a close combat war-zone without any prior notice; the fact it was not written by Larry Hama makes its validity into canon a heated debate among fans.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">Fanon</a> suggests his disdain for scented and unscented types of deodorant as stemming from a skin allergy caused by a compound that is common in most brands.</p>

<p>Beachhead's first appearance in the comic was in issue 47, published May 1986 alongside of Wet-Suit. Beachhead's first mission on the Joe team was assisting Hawk during the rescue of Snake-Eyes from Cobra Island. The rescue was successful after an off-shore battle with Cobra attack boats and Cobra Eels. He was part of the first team of Joes to enter Springfield before the invasion of that Cobra-controlled town, whose job was to knock out the enemy's power and communications. Later Beachhead was part of a group advising Sierra Gordo's counter-revolutionaries in the fight against Cobra, where he once again found himself involved in rescuing Snake-Eyes from Cobra's Terror-Drome. He was also one of the many Joes to be involved in the construction of the third Pit headquarters in Utah. Some time later, with a large force of Joes, Beachhead participated in the Cobra Island civil war. He served on the team until it was disbanded in 1994.</p>

<p>His first appearance was in the sneak preview of Special Missions, published in issue 50 of 'A Real American Hero' in August 1986, taking place right after his first appearance in the regular comic series, where he snuck onto a Russian airliner to foil hijackers alongside Flint and Lady Jaye. In Special Missions issue #8, Beachhead and a small team of Joes took part in a near-disastrous mission in the jungles of Southeast Asia, which nearly cost them their lives due to a treacherous CIA agent.</p>

<p>Beachhead became part of the reinstated Joe team in 2002, where he acted as a drill sergeant for new recruits in addition to his usual duties as a Joe. After he rejoined the team, he helped stop Storm Shadow in his attempt to assassinate Hawk. Beachhead was later part of a convoy of vehicles escorting a group of young children who turned out to be clones of the original Serpentor. When the revived Serpentor arrived to claim them with the forces of The Coil to back him, Beachhead and several others were captured, and some of the team's new recruits were killed. Imprisoned on Cobra Island, the Joes eventually escaped and joined the battle against Serpentor's forces as the Joe team invaded the island. He later fought Destro's new recruit, Wraith as the mercenary freed Major Bludd and Scrap-Iron from Blackwater Prison. A short time later, members of the Joe team fought Cobra forces that were drawn into an attack on a train guarded by the Joes, believing that Destro was being held prisoner onboard. At the battle's end, Hawk was shot in the back by Cobra Commander and paralyzed. In Hawk's absence, the Jugglers began to take control of the team to reign it in, if not disband it altogether. Eventually, the team's roster was cut down to only a dozen Joes, and Beachhead was one of many reassigned to other units. After the remaining Joes stopped a plot by Cobra to unleash the weapon known as the Tempest, and defeated a new threat, the Red Shadows, the military again disbanded the team.</p>

<p>Beachhead made his Frontlines appearance alongside Flash, Trip-Wire, Airtight and Chuckles, where they fought against terrorist Tyler Wingfield, the son of Vance Wingfield.</p>
<p>He was also featured in issue #17 as he led a team of new recruits on a very dangerous, very real mission in a war-torn, rioter-filled city, where one of his Greenshirt's was wounded; he apparently orders the wounded man abandoned, bringing hostility and mistrust from the other Greenshirts. It's later revealed that beachhead knew the Greenshirt wasn't going to die, rather be questioned when he lead his team to the police station to rescue the wounded man. While being extracted, Beachhead himself was wounded and despite orders to the contrary, one Greenshirt risked his life to haul the Joe into the helicopter.</p>

<p>There are times when the active members of the Elite team are on assignment or too far away to help in a crisis, which is wear the reserves come into play. In Manhattan there is the threat of a biological agent being stolen from a top secret lab; The closest reserve members are Beachhead, Mercer, Lowlight, Cover Girl, and Tunnel Rat. With Beachhead the acting team leader, they send Tunnel Rat in first since he knows the layout of the building best; with him as their guide, they infiltrate the building. Beachhead sends the wisecracking Mercer to make certain the levels are secure, while Beachhead, Lowlight, and Cover Girl head upstairs to handle the enemy. Wile they are en route, Mercer is attacked by a Cobra agent called Neurotoxin; after a display of combat skill and heroics, they end up in quarantine, where they are met by General Colton whom explained there was no bio-agent, that it was a decoy to lure Neurotoxin out of hiding so he could be captured.</p>

<p>In an alternate continuity, Beachhead is part of a smaller, more tightly focused G.I.Joe team that exists in the modern times, with appearances from a man that resembles President Bush in the role of the President of the United States. In the course of this alternate timeline, he ends up severally wounded in a mission to protect, then retrieve, the united States Constitution from the hands of Cobra; during this mission, he shows just why Lady Jaye and others had nightmares of him. Later, when he and the team are sent to Hawaii for training Beachhead style, he ends up separated from the team and is presumed dead by them but still remains active, using guerrilla warfare tactics to attack and weaken the forces of Cobra; He later Joins forces with Snake-Eyes and they act as support for the rest of the Joe team whom had infiltrated the Cobra recruits, where they are spotted by the traitor Duke.</p>
