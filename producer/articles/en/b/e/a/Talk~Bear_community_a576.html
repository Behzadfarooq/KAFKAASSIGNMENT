<p>A few comments: 1) This needs to be NPOVized somewhat. 2) Typically, we don't put "the" in article titles unless there's some good reason to do so. I would prefer to see this at <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_community.html" title="Bear community">Bear community</a> or some such.</p>

<i>The bear community was created...</i> &lt;- seems to imply a group of people sat down and said "hey! let's do the show right here in the barn" (or whatever... you get the idea). Don't communities in general come about gradually, rather than "created"? -- <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarquin_cdb6.html" title="User:Tarquin">Tarquin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The term "created" does not imply it happened instantaniously. Example: "He created a masterpiece in his painting "The Dancing Pinapple Head Lady," which took nearly twenty years to complete."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I question the definitions given for "muscle bear" and "muscle bear cub." If a man is lean, the bears of my acquaintance don't refer to him as a bear or bear cub, "muscle" or otherwise. If they deign to speak of him at all, they may call him an otter. Whenever I hear the term "muscle bear" or "muscle cub" (not "muscle bear cub"), the person being described is muscular but stocky.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two terms I'm used to that do not appear: <b>wolf</b>, similar in meaning to <i>otter</i> (which I'd never heard) but connoting sexual aggressiveness, and <b>furry</b>, a generic adjective for a bears, cubs or wolves. <i>Furry</i> might be British, but I've heard it often in the States (and Google yields abundant hits). Comments? I'm reluctant to just add them without some input. <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnsinkable_392a.html" title="User:Unsinkable">Unsinkable</a> 01:09, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that these terms should be added, with one caveat. As I understand it, both the bear community and <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> use the word "furry," but with different meanings. I believe that any listing of "furry" should make that clear. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Whom_df83.html" title="User:Doctor Whom">Doctor Whom</a> 28 June 2005 14:40 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Perhaps this (I'd rather get some consensus prior to posting on the page):</p>
<ul>
<li>Wolf (under <i>otter</i> in the list): same general physical traits as <i>otter</i>, but connoting sexual aggressiveness.</li>
<li>Furry (at the end of the list): general adjective for bears, cubs, wolves and otters. For other uses, see the disambiguation page <i><a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry.html" title="Furry">Furry</a></i>.</li>

<dd>You seem to have some confusion as to what "POV" means here at wikipedia. Almost ANYTHING could be determined to be someone's point of view. I could say that Madonna is a singer; you may feel that her primary function has been as an actrress, and thus we both have a point of view, but to state in her article that she is a singer and actress would be factual an appropriate to include. Additionally no one would ask for sources about these statements because they are considered common knowledge. However, common knowledge only extends as far as the minds of those who have an active interest in knowing about any given subject.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That being said, everything that I've stated in the above section that you keep removing is common knowledge fact to those in the bear community, and anyone denying them would be delusional. For instance, the statement about the depictions of an ideal bear could easily be verified by looking at the cover models of the past 100 issues of "American Bear" magazine. The phrasing of my entry is particularly important in establishing it's NPOV status: "it has been derided BY SOME," for instance...it leaves it very clear that this is the observation of SOME, but not of ALL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will do my best to find sources that reference these statements, but continued deletion of them on your part without providing a reason beyond your assertion that they are POV, <b>WHICH IS INCORRECT</b>, will mean that we may have to escalate to a third party opinion.

<dd>Just so you know, though I identify as a bear I am not mindless about it. I am well aware of the many issues the bear community has, having experienced some of them first-hand, and I am more than willing to discuss how criticisms of the bear community can be included in this article. I do think, however, that the language used was POV and unnecessarily inflammatory especially considering that no sources were provided. Placing "some people say" in front of inflammatory language is not enough to make a POV statment NPOV.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your sources, the first source you quote is fair enough, but I don't think the second one is appropriate. I don't think personal journal posts and comments are sufficiently reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>I think if we can get some reliable verifiable sources and use more neutral language, we can put these sentences back into the article.

If you had a direct source, you could say something like "Alonzo Testypants said in The Advocate 'The bear community shows tendencies of racism and sexism'". All that said, while I can agree with the sentiments of observed racism that may tend to be a local thing and not the bear community in general. I know that women aren't *welcomed* at the bear bar I go to, but they aren't actively excluded that I have seen. In an environment where a bunch of gay men are looking to talk to or hook up with other gay men, women (gay or not) are going to end up on the periphery. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 14:10, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been a bear most of my life and I have been to many bear events. I have not once seen anything that even closely resembles racism (as there are many mixed couples present), Sexism (as I know of many women that frequent these events) or elitism (as the bear community is more on the acceptance on one's own image over that of the stereotype).</p>
<p>It should be noted that as the gay community progresses and ages, the long held stereotypes are no longer valid. To say that we do not welcome those that are effeminate, is to say that we don't accept ourselves. Much an oxymoron.</p>
<p>While it is true that most bears tend to be attracted to those of a similar stature, there are quite a number that are looking for quite the opposite. And, still, there are some "bears" that are hetrosexual, chosing to celebrate all that is being a male.</p>
<p>A bear, it should be noted, is more the attitude of acceptance our own flaws as being part of who we are, rather than trying to live up to an image. 69.162.110.52 17:16, 21 May 2006 (UTC) Jerrbear</p>
<p>The Bear "community" is very accepting of Bisexual and Transgendered people, and this is very surprising since Bisexuals and Trans people get ignored, or told that they don't exist by the mainstream GLBT/gay "community".</p>

<p>Can someone provide some sources for some of the more ridiculous animal words, i.e. wombat, manatee, fluffy, koala bear? And also for the alternate definition of "panda bear?" These are not words I have ever heard used in this context. -- by thickslab, originally unsigned.</p>
<p>I disagree with the culling of the description list to 'keep it short and simple'. Nor was it admirable to remove terms that are relevant to geographically specific areas, such as 'wombats' and 'koala bears'. Aside from the recent rise in muscle bear exclusivity, I had thought the bear culture welcomed diverse opinions. And to pre-emptively respond to the criticism that opinion has no place on wikipedia, it is collective opinion and action that eventually morph into the solid fact demanded from any encyclopaedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of these phrases were redundant - "muscle bear" and "muscle cub" and "pipe bear" have obvious meanings and clutter up the list. Others such as koala bear and wombat seem to be made up or not widely used and I couldn't find references to them in a google search. I posted the above comment and never heard an objection, so I went ahead and trimmed the list of some redundant and silly definitions. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThickslab_c7ef.html" title="User:Thickslab">thickslab</a> 14:28, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>On the topic of bears in history, I admit that it seems a little spurious, but to refer to it as ridiculous is to overstep the bounds of language. It is important to recognise that while some personalities in history were not called 'bears' (or ursus) in their day, the basis of hirsute, masculine men engaging in homosexual activity is a pertinent point of reference for community origins. -- anonymous comment by IP</p>

<p>"The bear community originated in San Francisco in the 1970s as an outgrowth of the leather and "girth and mirth" communities. It was created by men who felt that mainstream gay culture was unwelcoming to men who did not fit a particular bodily norm (hairless, and young)."</p>
<p>Complete bullshit. Obviously bearish gay men exist all over the world before the 1970. The only thing the US did was coming up with the community idea, making it famous and commercialising it.</p>
<p>As stated somewhere below I would also change the "was created" sentence. Guest Account 08:52, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is the popular account of how it was created, and I agree that it's probably more of a fantasy than truth. Unfortunately I don't know of any references that tell a different story.

</ul>
<p>I remember the first Bear event took place at the Pilsner Bar in San Francisco in 1988? 1989? It was reported in the B.A.R., I think. It was actually more of a tongue-in-cheek thing, kind of a spoof of drag shows and leather events. The Pilsner back then had a more blue collar, out of the mainstream crowd--certainly not what would be considered Bearish today. That's the first time I heard the word Bear used to describe gay men. --Paddbear 19:57, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
