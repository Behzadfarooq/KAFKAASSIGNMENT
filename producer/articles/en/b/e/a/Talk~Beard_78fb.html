<dd>The beard is visually disgusting. It is not aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I would much appreciate a more appealing beard picture.

<dd>I certainly won't exchange the photo for a "more appealing" one, but everyone here at Wikipedia is of course invited to do so without further ado. As the photographer, I was wondering about the technical aspects of the photo rather than the object itself.</dd>
<dd>But I must add here, <a href="../../../a/c/o/User%7EAcornlord_0597.html" title="User:Acornlord">Acornlord</a>, that I find your attitude rather strange. They say that <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a> is in the eye of the beholder, and the corresponding text definitely says that bearded men are frequently considered less refined, cranky, etc. I don't know how old you are, but I sincerely hope <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ageism.html" title="Ageism">ageism</a> won't get you anywhere. Also, although I don't really consider this a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a>, anyone could argue they find all kinds of images disgusting and repulsive and demand their removal (see, for example, the photo illustrating the <a href="../../../p/s/o/Psoriasis.html" title="Psoriasis">psoriasis</a> article).</dd>
<dd>Looking forward to seeing a "more attractive" picture here soon. All the best, <a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">&lt;KF&gt;</a> 09:55, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's just my opinion. Where possible, attractive pictures should replace ugly pictures.

<dd>This is a fine example of a Garibaldi beard, well on its way to becoming a Full beard, as evidenced by the strands beginning to hang downward.

<p>Why does there have to be a picture of the One Thousand Beards book? It looks like an advertisement. Also, there is another book by Helen Bunkin called Beards, Beards, Beards that has received very high reviews and is to be the first of two, but it is not listed.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Talk%7EBeard_78fb.html" title="Edit section: Women and Facial Hair">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Women and Facial Hair</span></h2>
<p>I don't believe that this is the place to talk about women and facial hair. My reasoning follows.</p>
<p>A mention of women and facial hair is made on <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial_hair.html" title="Facial hair">Facial hair</a> and links directing interested readers direct them to the appropriate page, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bearded_woman.html" title="Bearded woman">Bearded woman</a>. Also, I have added appropriate links under 'See also' on <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard.html" title="Beard">Beard</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustache.html" title="Moustache">Moustache</a>. Before I created that page and moved the relevant information that had previously been here, the link 'Bearded woman' automatically redirected to <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hirsutism.html" title="Hirsutism">Hirsutism</a>. This is not fair, as what is commonly believed to be a beard on a woman is not a beard at all, but simply dark body hair. This new page allows us to discuss the subject sensitively and scientifically, before sending the reader off on a journey into disease and disorder.</p>
<p>The famed bearded women of the circus sideshows were usually fakes. In a few rare cases, it is a case of <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hirsutism.html" title="Hirsutism">Hirsutism</a> or an even rarer genetic disorder, for which a page does not yet exist (but links on <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bearded_woman.html" title="Bearded woman">Bearded woman</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hirsutism.html" title="Hirsutism">Hirsutism</a> do, should anyone care to research the topic). This is not an attempt at segregation. Here we are not talking of female authors, where it makes little sense to segregate them and their works, but of curiosities and medical disorders specific to women. There are men with breasts, too (gynecomastia), but we would surely not talk about them on a page devoted to mothers and infant feeding, or to buxom blondes on the silver screen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to have a natural male feature discussed in the same breath as hormonal imbalances and sideshow freaks is a gross disrespect to manhood. This furthers the distaste for things male and manly that has crept into modern society. It is often the case today that one does not refer to men as men, but as people. To be a man has become something androgynous and sexless, as if it were something freakish to be diluted, hidden and ashamed of. These pages, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard.html" title="Beard">Beard</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustache.html" title="Moustache">Moustache</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatee.html" title="Goatee">Goatee</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideburns.html" title="Sideburns">Sideburns</a> etc ought to be done in honour of men and manhood. It is a subject of male pride.</p>

<p>I think the picture is excellent. Who ever this man is I would be proud to meet. Of course I have quite a full beard my self. Family photo found at <a href="http://www.livethewordministries.info/modules.php?name=whoweare" class="external free" title="http://www.livethewordministries.info/modules.php?name=whoweare" rel="nofollow">http://www.livethewordministries.info/modules.php?name=whoweare</a> taken back in June. As anyone who has a full beard knows you certainly get a range of looks from poeple when they first see you. From happy to afraid and all points in between. The man that is speaking so negatively should put his own mug up if he thinks that one is sooo bad. &#160;:)<br />
I was very happy to find another site (this site) with information on beards.

<p>What is a section related to christianity doing in an article about beards?</p>
<p>Yeah, the article only talks about beards in christianity and no other religion. That's pretty partial. Either remove that section or things about beards in other religions should also be written.</p>
<p>Well, then make it balanced by adding something yourself. Add whatever other religions viewpoint on beards that you find appropriate. Someone already has stepped up to the plate from the Christian perspective - what's your contribution going to be?</p>

<dd>That would seem about right. The English soldiers would have come into contact with many different cultures, especialy people like the Hungarians who're known for their beards. But you can't forget about the signifigant influence that service on the Indian sub-continent would have had on British soldiers and 19thC fashion in general.

<ul>
<li>I changed the article to reflect the fact that many Jews refrain from trimming their beards on the grounds of halacha, and not in order to make a cultural statement or following the kabbalah. I agree with your second point, and hence left the beginning of the article as-is.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I rephrased the wording from ‘attributes holiness to those who wear the beard’ to ‘attributes holiness to the beard’, as the Zohar says that the hairs of the beard themselves correspond to the ‘Yud Gimmel Tikunei Dikna’, a level of G-liness. It also avoids Jews people seeing bearded Jews as being hypocritical.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I removed the reference to Chabad-Lubavitch because the practice of having an untrimmed beard is common to almost all Chassidishe Groups, based on the Teshuva of the Minchas Elazar which is mentioned on koshershaver.info</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>(Yair-Aaron 14:18, 16 June 2006 (UTC))
<dl>
<dd>Regarding your changes:
<ul>
<li>The article already mentions the fact that some poskim hold that shaving is completely assur, at the end of the first paragraph. More than that would be both belaboring the point and giving undue credence to the stringent psak.</li>
<li>I haven't seen the Zohar inside, so I'll take your word for it.</li>
<li>You may be right that it applies to all Chasidim, but it is well known that Chabad puts a very heavy emphasis on the issur - most likely because of the Tzemach Tzedek that you quoted. As you probably know, he is primarily a Chabad posek.</li>

<dd>Indeed I do - its the difference of being able to print out the photograph at 4x5 inches versus about an inch by an inch. Maybe the beard isn't as high quality (but "short trimmed beard" is also already represented) but its quite neutral to say that the photograph itself is higher quality as if you care to (and I can't see why someone can, but it is fairly remarkable to me) you can actually see each strand of hair from my beard in that photograph; now that is high quality.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 11:28, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok lets try to figure out what beard picture belongs at the top of this page. An anonymous editor has decided that my picture is too ugly for wikipedia. All the other contenders I've seen are not suitable for print (not enough pixels). Is wikipedia here to define beauty or to provide open-content that others may use? I believe the focus of wikipedia is the later, rather than the former. Rather than get in an edit war I've decided to open the forum for discussion since it seems there is a problem with consensus.

<dd>First, let me note that I don't find you, simply your beard, aesthetically unpleasing. However, that really has nothing to do with my point and I apologize for noting so in my reverts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now on to my point: I've looked into the history of this page and you have switched this picture back many times after it has been removed by other users. It is arguable whether or not we even need a picture right at the top of the page as many other examples of beards are given further down the page. Yet as can be seen in earlier discussion, whenever there's been a suggestion of removal you argue that individual is attacking your personal appearence. So my question is this: Why do you think it is so important that your face be on the top of what is likely a somewhat high traffic article?&#160;:This is a clear attempt at self promotion and therefore through both this and your continuous reverts a violation of wikipedia policy (see sections on "what wikipedia is not" and "3 revert rule") I have removed the image so we can have a neutral discusion. I am not against reposting it after our discussion has concluded, but to insist on its use while it is being disputed is shameless. I look forward to your response. 68.11.46.146 20:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are wrong on many accounts. First, you are confusing other people's comments with mine. Second, I've reverted because in all instances the picture has been replaced with one that is lower quality; I define quality as the number of pixels in the image or the image clarity. Do you have any examples of a beard that can printed at least 4 inches wide with out any degradation of quality? Third, the comments you are speaking of are for another and completely unrelated picture. Fourth, I don't care about your definition of shameless; I care about the quality of wikipedia. I'm going to revert again, and as you so aptly point out, another revert from you will violate the 3 revert rule. Fifth, there is no need to get an admin involved here, one is already present: me. I'm not going to comment on your definition of beauty because it is pointless. You really have no arguments against the picture aside from you don't like it. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriddle_3664.html" title="User:Triddle">Triddle</a> 21:00, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your bully tactics will get you nowhere. As an admin is it your reponsibility to act in wikipedia's best interest. Behind your thinly veiled argument of image quality lies nothing but shameless self promotion. If you care so much then find a quality picture of a famous beard, many of history's greatest figures have sported them. I agree, beauty has nothing to do with it and in particular individual's varying perceptions of it. However, in spite of what you may think, your beard is not a good representative of the entire history of facial hair.</p>
<p>Honestly, it would be a shame to lose all the respect you've gained through many good images you have uploaded in such a ridiculous arguement. However, if you decide to abuse your power and continue with this nonsense, then congrats on a life of constantly monitoring this page to make sure your image remains. 68.11.46.146 21:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What ever. A snippet from my user page, which is much older than my picture: <i>I believe that Wikipedia has potential to wind up in print in the future so I'm trying to make as many photographs as possible ready to be printed in high quality. To me this means it should be 300 dots per inch and around 4 inches (1200 pixels) minimum either measurement or at least big enough that if printed it would be easy to make out the features. You can see this philosophy in the photographs I've taken and the images I've uploaded.</i> I've replaced lots of photographs on wikipedia with ones I've taken myself.

<dd>Ok, I've been a bystander of this edit war and I have a few things I would like to say. I mean this in the nicest way possible and I have a lot of respect for you, Triddle, but I don't think that is a good photograph of you. Your other photographs are very good and I admire them, but this particular one can definitely afford some improvements. It's not a matter of beauty at all, but photographs are worth a thousand words, and if you can't stand the ridicule, then you shouldn't be pushing your photograph so much. Maybe if you improved the subject in the photograph it wouldn't receive as much ridicule and removing. Some things I would improve in the current photograph are: The baseball cap. It's not clean, and it wouldn't be so distracting if you didn't have it on. Secondly, your glasses look foggy, and they would be better cleaned, or taken off. Thirdly, you shouldn't have taken the photograph inside - using cameras inside invites artificial lighting which makes skin shiny. Speaking of camera techniques, that angle is not the most flattering you can pick. I would suggest holding the camera up more, and not a foot away from you. You remarked at one point, halfway down this page, that you can see each strand of hair in your beard. Is that really important to see each strand? Maybe I'm just thinking of the Gestalt theory, where the whole is greater than the sum of parts, but something farther away would be nicer if the "information" of the article is the beard and not each strand of beard.</dd>

<dd>I hope I'm allowed to speak my mind on wikipedia, and I might or might not have put words into the mouths of many - but again, I do not think that it is a good photograph of you. When Wikipedia is "printed" like you predict, and 50 years down the line, some 7-year-old boy finds a copy of this so-called printed version and flips to the beard section because he is interested in beards - would you want him to be frightened? At this rate I think children would be scared of the picture if you kept it as it is whether you like it or not, due to small telltale signs of standard human grooming and photography ability. Humans are fickle, and every human has the potential for attractiveness if they work at it. I'm not saying you're ugly at all here, I'm just saying the main points of the photograph could liken you to a homeless person.</dd>

<dd>Take this all as you will, and hopefully not personally. After all, this is just something on the internet, and the elevation of this situation has been ridiculous. Whether or not it gets printed, that will still be a photograph that needs improvement and, I quote for emphasis, doesn't deserve to be on the top of such a high quality article. As a fellow beard wearer, I encourage you to take my points into consideration. Thank you for your eyes. Dynendal 06:06, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well holy molly I had no idea I scared children! Anyway, the 3 revert rule exists for a reason. I'm out of reverts - if anyone else had ever stepped up to the plate on any of the previous attempts (or even this one) they could of out-reverted me. That means to me there has been no consensus for removing the photograph.

<p>The beard grows when the man could become in need for it, namely at puberty, for oral sex reasons.</p>
<p>Then, he could use his tongue on her. That way she does not get pregnant, a four million old contraception method. This kind of sex was used far more than the putitin form over the next million of years, so he grew a huge beard over the time. With a beard the man has a protection from rubbing off weakened, wet skin during long lasting plays. At some recent time, however, he lost track of why he had become the beard, and since then sex at all seems difficoult for mankind to cope with.</p>
<p>There are two reasons to seek sexual activity, and there are two corresponding ways to go through it.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. To produce children. Do: putitin.</li>
<li>2. To have a good time but no children afterwards: Do not put it in. Use fingers and tongue. The latter made the existence of our beard to a fact.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Hillarious. The beard is simply an obvious sign of a sexually mature male. That's as far as it goes. Just like cheek pads on a mature male oranutang, The domed head of a mature male moutain gorrilla, a lion's mane, a deer's antlers, etc. A beard is also a remmenant of the full coat of hair which once clothed all human beings, from scalp to the toes. -Definitely NOT something we grew to accommadate a secondary sexual practice. <a href="../../../o/z/o/User%7EOzoneocean_1673.html" title="User:Ozoneocean">OzoneO</a> 13:39, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The voice defines the male. The beard is protection. You 'hilarious' and 'LOL' knowers: How come that the <b>expectation</b> of sex is much higher than we can fulfill? Tell me: where do these deep inner expectations really come from? We are born with a high expectation, and we are all disappointed. I tell you: This is because the expectations are correct, the official practice of intercourse wrong (for enjoyment). Try this out: For one year: stop the putitin. Men: concentrate mentally on not coming, she plays you with hands. Or whatever. Stop the stupid putitin. If you do come: next time it's easier. In one year we'll talk again. Ya? KS</p>

<p>A couple of points to discuss 1) Why are eastern religions listed seperately to the others? 2) Whilst I myself have a beard, it is nothing to do with my faith as a Zen Buddhist. Zen Buddhists are really no more inclined to grow a beard than anyone else, whilst a few famous zen practitioners may have had beards, plenty more have been completely clean-shaven. There is really nothing specific about beards in Zen.</p>
<p>I would suggest firstly combining the "eastern religions" section with the other list of beards in religion, and also seriously consider removing any reference to beards to in Zen or Daoism <a href="../../../u/s/e/User.html" title="User">lostsocks</a></p>

<p>I contend that this is a better image than the existing one, since it is an image of a more typical beard and, even if the existing one is retained, it is an image of a trimmed beard while the current photo is of an untrimmed beard, and is thus useful to illustrate different types of beards. Two users have continuously reverted it, although both have provided no response to my rationales for including it and instead have accused me of vanity posting because the guy in the photo is a law school friend of mine -- i responded to the vanity accusation by pointing out that user-created images of physical features will often be photos of acquaintances and therefore a reflexive reversion based on supposed vanity posting is irrational. Perhaps here we can have a discussion of this image that is actually based upon its usefulness to the article and that is not based upon personal attacks against me?

Consensus is. Also,you are dead wrong about AFDs -- AFDs are most definitely not majority votes, as clearly stated by wikipedia policy at: see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>, which clearly states that "The purpose of the discussion is to achieve <b>consensus</b> upon a course of action.

To the extent that voting occurs (see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polls_are_evil" class="extiw" title="meta:Polls_are_evil">meta:Polls are evil</a>), the votes are merely a means to gauge the degree of consensus reached so far. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority_voting.html" title="Majority voting">majority voting</a> is not the determining factor in whether a nomination succeeds or not." So, my friend, even if a discussion regarding whether an image is appropriate for a specific article is analogous to an AFD debate, this analogy quite clearly supports my argument: that a 2 to 1 "vote" is not dispositive and I am not violating wikipedia policy by challenging these users (so long as I do not violate the three revert rule, which I have not done).

Also, I have agreed not to seek this image's inclusion anywhere but here, so obviously I am willign to compromise, a good indicator of good faith. Jaredlenowguy 23:12, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Plastering an image on several pages where it is not merited and then agreeing to take it down is not "good faith" when it did not belong there to begin with. In this editor's own words per my talk page, "the individual responsible for it is literally sitting a room away from me right now and we are discussing this issue through an open door" - which makes this a vanity photograph. Again, this editor through his own admission is too close to the image subject to render him a "neutral point of view" --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 23:24, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>How is this not good faith when, as stated above, the guy in the imaage clearly has the features that the articles are about -- a beard, a moustache, and sideburns? Although I must admit that I think this is a pretty nice picture and would like to see it on wikipedia, this does not mean that I am not acting in good faith by posting it where it is self-evidently appropriate (because, again, the photo's subject has a beard, a moustache and sideburns!). As for the continuing vanity accusations, you should look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> which makes clear that even if there is a conflict of interest with regard to article content, the criterion for inclusion remains notability (that is, there is no rule stating that all content with which there is potentially some conflict of interest can be deleted simply because this conflict exists). I argue in good faith that an image of a guy with a fairly ordinary beard is notable to the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard.html" title="Beard">beard</a> article, regardless of my relationship to the person. This argument is supported by the fact that an image of an otherwise unexcpetional person with an out of the ordinary beard has long been on this article. Also, though there is nothing directly on point, and since you have established an analogy to deletion debates, you should see the language in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> stating "<b>Avoid using the word "vanity" in a deletion discussion</b> — such an accusation may be defamatory and is easily <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">discouraging</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a> that the contributor genuinely was trying to help us by increasing our coverage, not being "vain"."

<dd>And I said that the person responsible for the vandalism is one room away from me. I am against vandalism and was irritated that this person vandzlized the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bearded_lady.html" title="Bearded lady">bearded lady</a> page. I am personally responsible for taking this photo and I stand by it as a useful contribution to the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard.html" title="Beard">beard</a> article. Frankly, I also think it adds something to the <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideburns.html" title="Sideburns">sideburns</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustache.html" title="Moustache">moustache</a> articles, but I agreed to remove it from those articles as a conciliatory gesture and in the spirit of consensus-building. Being willing to compromise in the manner in which I have been willing to do so by removing the image from those other articles is the epitome of good faith and exemplifies the spirit of collegiality that makes for a better wikipedia.

<dd>You probably know this already, because I sense that you are behind some of this mischief, but [REMOVE NAME] seems to be some kind of running Wikipedia-based joke. [[[REMOVE NAME]]] is a page that was deleted and recreated to protect further creation, because it redirected to <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douche.html" title="Douche">douche</a>. [[[REMOVE NAME]]] is a page that I just nominated for speedy deletion, because it nonsensically redirected to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt_Law_Review_39fc.html" title="Vanderbilt Law Review">Vanderbilt Law Review</a>. This is all very dubious and worth avoiding altogether, despite all of User:Jaredlenowguy's plaints. By the way, User:Jaredlenowguy is strangely similar to User:Ilovejared, who - on January 9th, in the midst of Jaredlenowguy's edits - created the vandalism redirect. I'm sure you'll claim nothing to do with it, but it looks pretty damning. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 01:07, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, some silliness has occured regarding Jared. It is over. However, I cannot see what this has to do with whether it is appropriate to include this photo on this page. Why can't we just focus on the matter at hand? Can't a user decide to turn over a new leaf and edit constructively? Again, I have cited extensive policy here and you are still responding with arguments that do not have to do specifically with whether this image of a beard is better than the existing image, which is my rationale for including it here.

<p>5. Two editors have expressed they do not wish to see this beard photograph used on the page, and the editor responsible for putting it up has made several reverts on each page, including the ones where it is not illustrative of the article subject, to keep up his friend's photograph.<br /></p>

<dd>Inclusion in wikipedia is not a matter of majority votes. Instead it is a matter of consensus. Up until now, neither of these users has responded to my arguments and even now that one has, this user also seems more interested in the image's creator than in whether this image makes the article better. Jaredlenowguy 23:12, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Consensus" when it comes to an image is whether to put it or, or take it off. There is no re-wording and half-putting it up. Thus, a majority vote, similar to how "Articles for Deletion" are kept or taken down, comes down to a majority. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 23:24, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I responded to this point above -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> clearly has it wrong here with regard to the role of a majority vote on wikipedia. Consensus does mean reaching a decision as to whether the image will appear on the page or not ... an image clearly cannot be "reworded" or "half put up" -- I acknowledge this. However, consensus nowhere on wikipedia means majority vote. And I have cired to policy repeatedly and provided good faith rationales for this image's inclusion. The people opposing me have just called me names and have refused to debate the merits of the image. Thus, a consensus for removal has hardly been reached.

<p>6. This issue has come up on this page before, since many young males who grow a full beard think <i>their beard</i> is <i>the</i> beard that most represents what a beard should be. It comes across as youthful chest-thumping to me, as opposed to an effort to education and illustrate. Again, I don't believe this user's actions as outlined above merit good faith.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The issue should be whether an image makes the page better. This has been the focus of past discussions. Let's not focus on who posted the image or theories about chest thumping. The fact is, several users have expressed reservations about the existing image. I have offered one alternative. I don't appreciate being attacked for simply offering this alternative. Jaredlenowguy 23:12, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I personally don't feel it makes the article better, and I don't find it an attractive photograph. the image quality is too dark, as well. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidShankBone_a3a2.html" title="User:DavidShankBone">DavidShankBone</a> 23:24, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Finally, an argument based on the image itself rather than an attack upon me (an attack, as you can see below, by a user who has a history of being blocked for making personal attacks). Nice start. Jaredlenowguy 20:07, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
