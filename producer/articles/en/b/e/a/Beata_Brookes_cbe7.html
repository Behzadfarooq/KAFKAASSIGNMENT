<p>Brookes was educated at Lowther College in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abergele.html" title="Abergele">Abergele</a> and went on to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wales%2C_Bangor_a505.html" title="University of Wales, Bangor">University of Wales, Bangor</a>. She obtained a scholarship from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_State_cf5a.html" title="United States Department of State">State Department</a> to study politics in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. She began to work as company secretary and director of a North Wales firm.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beata_Brookes_cbe7.html" title="Edit section: Political activity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political activity</span></h2>
<p>Her early interest in politics took her into the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a> and she was elected to the executive of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. She was also elected as a Conservative to <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhyl.html" title="Rhyl">Rhyl</a> <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_District_Council_22ba.html" title="Urban District Council">Urban District Council</a>, and in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1955_142e.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1955">1955 general election</a> she fought <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widnes_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_b4a4.html" title="Widnes (UK Parliament constituency)">Widnes</a> which was a marginal Labour-held seat. She lost by only 1,449 votes.</p>
<p>She later worked for <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denbighshire.html" title="Denbighshire">Denbighshire</a> County Council as a social worker, and as a farmer. In 1961 she was Conservative candidate in the Warrington by-election, a safe Labour seat. At the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1964_dac5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1964">1964 general election</a> she fought in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_Exchange_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_53c9.html" title="Manchester Exchange (UK Parliament constituency)">Manchester Exchange</a>. She was appointed by the Conservative government to the Welsh Hospital Board in 1963, where she remained for eleven years. Although she had married Anthony Arnold, in May 1963 they were divorced and she announced that she wished to remain known as Miss Beata Brookes.</p>

<p>From 1973 Brookes was a member of <a href="../../../c/l/w/Clwyd.html" title="Clwyd">Clwyd</a> Area Health Authority, where she served on the Family Practitioner Committee, and was also co-opted onto Clwyd County Council Social Services Committee. She was a member of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine and had several voluntary sector posts in North Wales relating to the disabled and mentally handicapped.</p>

<p>At the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Parliament_election%2C_1979_%28United_Kingdom%29_424a.html" title="European Parliament election, 1979 (United Kingdom)">1979 European Parliament election</a>, Brookes was elected as Conservative MEP for North Wales. She was a strong supporter of British membership of the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Communities</a> and in 1981 at the Conservative Party conference moved a motion condemning the then Labour policy of leaving it; she argued that such a policy would leave Britain weak, friendless, isolated and bankrupt. She pointed to statistics about the economy and trade with Europe to claim that one job in three depended on Britain staying in.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beata_Brookes_cbe7.html" title="Edit section: Selection dispute">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Selection dispute</span></h2>
<p>Brookes made a determined effort to be selected for the boundary changed constituency of <a href="../../../c/l/w/Clwyd_North_West_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_18f6.html" title="Clwyd North West (UK Parliament constituency)">Clwyd North West</a> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1983_c3e4.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1983">1983 general election</a>, over the claims of the sitting MPs for <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Flintshire_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_7561.html" title="West Flintshire (UK Parliament constituency)">West Flintshire</a> (Sir <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Meyer_5206.html" title="Anthony Meyer">Anthony Meyer</a>) and <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denbigh_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_9649.html" title="Denbigh (UK Parliament constituency)">Denbigh</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/Geraint_Morgan_f0fd.html" title="Geraint Morgan">Geraint Morgan</a>). The selection contest attracted national attention and Conservative Central Office decided to stay out of the dispute. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">6 March</a>, Brookes won the selection vote in the Clwyd North West Conservative Executive, with Meyer describing the meeting as having been fixed and Morgan saying that speaking at the meeting was "like speaking to a nobbled jury".</p>
<p>Conservative Party chairman <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecil_Parkinson_3488.html" title="Cecil Parkinson">Cecil Parkinson</a> then intervened, arising out of a newspaper report that Brookes claimed Central Office put her forward for the nomination (Meyer was a leading "wet" who was not popular with the Conservative leadership). When the Executive of Clwyd North West Conservative Association placed only Brookes' name before the general membership for adoption, Meyer won a High Court judgment that his name should also be offered. When the full membership met on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_9.html" title="May 9">9 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, Meyer was narrowly adopted.</p>

<p>Brookes remained in the European Parliament. She protested in December 1983 over a <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> interview with the Welsh republican John Jenkins, who had been jailed for a bombing campaign at the time of the investiture of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>. In the European Parliament she was a member of the Education and Agricultural Committees. She was defeated by the Labour Party candidate at the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Parliament_election%2C_1989_%28United_Kingdom%29_863a.html" title="European Parliament election, 1989 (United Kingdom)">1989 European Parliament elections</a>.</p>
<p>She remained involved in Welsh Conservative politics and in 1993 was chair of the Welsh Conservative Party, and proclaimed her support for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Major_5fd6.html" title="John Major">John Major</a> at a time when he was under fire from within the party. She was appointed Chair of the Welsh Consumer Council, but her re-appointment in 1994 went ahead despite criticism from the National Consumer Council that despite her ability, a non-political choice would be more appropriate. <sup id="_ref-Consumer_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Consumer" title="">[3]</a></sup> She was awarded the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a> in 1996.</p>

She had in 2000 obtained permission to hold sales on 28 Sundays in a year, and also offered the land for use for fireworks displays and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Eisteddfod_of_Wales_b16a.html" title="National Eisteddfod of Wales">National Eisteddfod of Wales</a>. <sup id="_ref-Car_boot_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Car_boot" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
