<p>I have removed the anal bead see also. It has the barest of ties to this topic. People seraching fo it will look under sex related topics, and since this is purely about arts and crafts, it has no place on this page. rahter than reverting any more, please use this page to discuss. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 15:21, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although right now this article is only about arts and crafts, the article title is not "arts and crafts beads" or something similar. Rather, this article deals with the more general concept of beads, and thus it is perfectly reasonabel to expand it to mention other types of beads, as I have done. This is a completely legitimate type of bead. Remember, wikipedia is not censored for minors. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 15:24, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Really this is the craft article, as set out in the first paragraph. Any other use belongs on a disambig page, which I have made, that includes the other things referred to as beads that were formerlly at the top of the page.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Talk%7EBead_4b7d.html" title="Edit section: Page move proposal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Page move proposal</span></h2>
<p>I propose that we move this page to decorative beads or something along those lines. "Bead" alone is a much broader term content-wise than just arts &amp; crafts and decorative beads. The main article for "bead" should thus reflect this diversity. An alternative solution would be to move back from the decorative beads only stance that some users have maintained on this page in favor of a more inclusive stance that would permit content regarding other types of beads. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 22:48, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When most people type bead, this is what they want. Therefore the main information should be at this title. Since a perfectly fine disambig page exisits already, a move is completely unnecessary, as anyone who is looking for other meanings can easily find them there.<a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 19:21, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Support Move</b> I support this move. I do not agree that people necessarily think of arts &amp; crafts when they think of beads. There is a perdsuasive argument for a more general page, stated above. Hopefully whether this page is moved will be decided by consensus rather than by one administrator with a clear bias regarding the matter. Thanks. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 22:23, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Object to move</b> - I agree with pschemp that the decorative beads described in this article are the most common idea of "beads." The disambig page linked clearly from the top of the article leads easily to other kinds of beads. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> 23:55, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Typically in other consensus discussions (AfD, RfA, Prod) the discussion period seems to be five days. I personally prefer to have "anal bead" be its own article, referenced from the disambig page, and leave this article here, as-is, with relevant updates to the article as needed. Consensus has to be reached, not teleported to.&#160;:D <b><i><font color="#FF00FF">~Kylu (<a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKylu_6ad3.html" title="User:Kylu">u</a>|<a href="../../../k/y/l/User_talk%7EKylu_3741.html" title="User talk:Kylu">t</a>)</font></i></b> 23:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also object to the move. I think it is plainly clear when someone types '<i>bead</i> by itself that they do not mean anal bead. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapetite526_7dbe.html" title="User:Mapetite526">Mapetite526</a> 17:25, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the header and links you recently removed were actually quite appropriate in this article. While the links may have been to 'commercial sites' I think there's a couple of important points you might not be aware of:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) The links were to sites very closely related to this article.</dd>
<dd>2) Those sites provide useful and detailed information to anyone with an interest in seed beads.</dd>
<dd>3) While the sites in question are commercial in nature, they are not retail sites and they do not sell to the public. There is certainly no 'profit motive' in linking to those sites.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope that you would consider replacing them. I do think that they are important and useful links. Thanks for taking time to consider this. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> 22:17, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, ok. I went back to take a closer look at the sites, and I see your point. I think I was being a little overly vigilant from seeing the amount of linkspam that gets added to this page.

<p>Scott, I understand your concerns about linkspam and I really appreciate you revisting the issue. I was sure you were acting in good faith and didn't want to revert anything myself. I was actually prepared to get flamed for asking (I've seen it happen), so it was a pleasant surprise that you were so reasonable (and speedy) in responding. I love it when editors work together to make a good article better&#160;:) Thanks for everything and keep up the good work! --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> 23:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm glad we could work it out so easily. In retrospect, those links have been on the page for awhile, and I should have requested consensus before removing them. It was sloppiness on my part, but this will serve as a reminder for me next time.

<p>Being new-ish to Wikipedia, I have a concern/question about this article but I am unsure how to proceed. Many of the examples/categories for types of beads have their own articles and links (Chevron beads, Cloisonné beads, Dichroic beads, etc.), but (for instance), "seed beads" does not. However, there is a LOT of information about seed beads contained in this article. Is is OK to just copy and paste the seed bead info from this page to create a "seed bead" article?

<dl>
<dd>I don't think its neccessary. This article is not long enough that sections need to be spun out. Lots of the others that have articles had them before this main one was created, or have some historical significance. Right now people come to this article to find out information about beads, and I bet at least 50% of the time they want to know about seed beads. Its logical to leave that information here. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 04:50, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. I also wondered if the article concentrated too much on seed beads. I am a bead jewelry artist and if I am looking at a bead article, I want information about all different kinds of beads for jewelry making, not just seed beads. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapetite526_7dbe.html" title="User:Mapetite526">Mapetite526</a> 14:08, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The length of the article is not big enough to break out seed beads. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 14:23, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I am a little confused. I don't think the article is too long, but if seed beads are so popular/common (I don't disagree with that assertion), shouldn't they have their own article? Also, if items such as chevron beads or dichroic beads are not-so-popular, why do they have their own articles? Should the other bead articles be deleted/redirected/merged, then? Typing "seed beads" into the search box redirects you to this page, and it just seems an inconsistant and kind of clunky way for the information to be presented. I am having a bit of difficulty understanding Wikipedia policy/guidelines in this particular situation, so I would appreciate some clarification (either here or on my talk page, whichever is most appropriate). Thanks for your patience! <a href="../../../m/u/t/User%7EMutableye_ab7c.html" title="User:Mutableye">Mutableye</a> 01:20, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The point is to keep the relevent information in one easily accessible place. Some of the others have articles, but they were created before all the bead stuff was reorganized. We don't delete what could become an article someday, but as you can see most of them are just stubs, however, the point of wikipedia is not to get rid of information unless it isn't true. we don't as a policy, kill innocent stubs. You as a bead jewelry artist are not an average user who just wants to type bead and get all the information. Average joe doesn't even know what a seed bead is, so our policy is keep main information at the main article. If you want an example of an article that is too long, go see <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">Pornography</a>. Until this article becomes unweildy, there is no reason to remove useful information. Let me repeat, the other articles exist because they were created before this one. Seed beads are a main type of bead. Every catalog has a huge seed bead section and as they are one of the most common types the information should remain here. The point is not to confuse average joe and redirects are common and appropriate usage. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 01:30, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know why these changes were reverted. I had changed "seeds of the Bead tree" to "seeds of various trees" because beads are often made from various seeds, not just the seeds of the "Bead tree." I had also changed "Beads range in size from under a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millimeter.html" title="Millimeter">millimeter</a> to over a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centimeter.html" title="Centimeter">centimeter</a> in diameter" to "Beads come in many different sizes" because I think the previous sentence is limiting.

<dd>Well instead of removing the units from the size descriptions it would have been more useful to expand it including the units so people get an idea of the true range. You replaced a specific sentence with a completely vauge one. The goal is a better description, not one that could be describing a whale. Also, you removed a wikilink to a certain kind of bead that is applicable. It is ok to add informaiton, but removing specifics and things that are linked is not helpful. Try to expand information rather than delete. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 14:22, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hopefully my current changes are better. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapetite526_7dbe.html" title="User:Mapetite526">Mapetite526</a> 14:40, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi &amp; apologies - I read your comment re short additions only after I had uploaded text and 3 images. Is it possible to move the whole Chevron bead section, i.e. add to existing Chevron bead article? I shall leave in your capable hands. Thanks. EvelynS 13:16, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes it would be best to move that info to the chevron bead article. Summaries only should remain here. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 17:17, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
