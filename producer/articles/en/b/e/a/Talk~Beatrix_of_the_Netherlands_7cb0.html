<p>Can anyone list all the Qeens titles (maybe in <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titles_of_Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands_5d42.html" title="Titles of Beatrix of the Netherlands">Titles of Beatrix of the Netherlands</a>)? And maybe a discussion on the usage of these titles. I've seen on a guilder note that all the titles were shortened to "H.M. Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard, koningin der Nederlanden, prinses van Oranje-Nassau, prinses van Lippe-Biesterfeld etc.". Is this the usual thing to do or is it just "H.M. Beatrix" or something?</p>

<p>Officialy, Beatrix has not adopted the title of Grand-Duchess of Mecklenburg Schwerin. Being in Germany, Salic Law usualy prevails, and women cannot assume such titles. It is likely that Juliana's use of the title was, in fact, only a courtesy title as her father was the sovereign duke (Such events are customary, and are not usually passed on to the decendants).</p>
<p>Also, I suspect it was a tricky issue, as at the time of Juliana's abdication, Mecklenburg was part of the communist DDR, and diplomaticaly, was easier not to pass on the title (although I am only speculating).</p>
<p>Personaly though (despite it not meaning anything to anyone else), I recognise the title as Beatrix's (but I also regard Her as the <i>true</i> Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and Queen of the <i>United</i> Netherlands).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 's-Gravenhage (<a href="../../../27/s/-/User_talk%7E%27s-Gravenhage_dfe2.html" title="User talk:'s-Gravenhage">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_%27s-Gravenhage_e319.html" title="Special:Contributions/'s-Gravenhage">contribs</a>) 21:25, 8 February 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>HM The Queen Beatrix does not use the title of Duchess of Mecklenburg. It must be made clear that in any case she cannot use the title of Grand-Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin because her grandfather, from whom the title comes (HRH Henry, Prince of the Netherlands, Duke of Mecklenburg), was a duke and not a grand-duke. His father was a grand-duke but since Henry was a younger son he did not inherit the grand-ducal title. Furthermore, all titles of HM The Queen Beatrix (except for all those of marchioness and of lower rank)are based on Royal Decrees. The female line of succession in the Netherlands has, in history, given rise to some difficulties with titles. From the moment that it was decided that Her Royal Higness the late Juliana, Queen of the Netherlands would bear the titles of Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau and Duchess of Mecklenburg, the trend was set. Namely: the royal title of Prince(ss) of the Netherlands and of Orange-Nassau would, at all times, remain intact for the members of the Royal House. In subsequent generations (i.e. Juliana and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld &amp; Beatrix and Jhr. Claus von Amsberg it was made clear by the Royal Decrees about titular matters that although the Dutch royal titles would remain intact, the acquired titles through the male husbands (Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands &amp; Jhr. Claus von Amsberg) would only be passed on to their children in their old form (i.e. only inheritable through the male lineage). Accordingly, HM The Queen Beatrix has no right whatsoever to the title of her grandfather Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg because she could not inherit it through her mother. Interestingly, the current Crown Prince: HRH the Prince of Orange, and his brothers have inherited their father's title of Jonkheer van Amsberg and they have, being male, children who inherited it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.46.70.240 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.46.70.240_9b9c.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.46.70.240">contribs</a>) 14:06, 4 June 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>If she were to adopt the title, it would come between Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld and Marchioness of Veere and Flushing. Normally, it would be the second title after Queen of the Netherlands, but Orange, Nassau and Lippe-Biesterfeld are considered sovereign principalities (even though all three are in republics).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 's-Gravenhage (<a href="../../../27/s/-/User_talk%7E%27s-Gravenhage_dfe2.html" title="User talk:'s-Gravenhage">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_%27s-Gravenhage_e319.html" title="Special:Contributions/'s-Gravenhage">contribs</a>) 13:07, 9 February 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>I was just wondering this same thing.
