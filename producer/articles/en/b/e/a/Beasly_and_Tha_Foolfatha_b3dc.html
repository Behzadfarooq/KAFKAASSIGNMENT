	    <p>Beasly and The (Tha) Foolfatha were popular DJs with KBGA <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missoula.html" title="Missoula">Missoula</a>, 89.9FM the college radio station located in Missoula, Montana. <a href="http://www.kbga.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kbga.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=kbga" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spinitron.com/public/index.php?station=kbga" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. During their time at KBGA they were the station's only pure <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rap.html" title="Rap">rap</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop.html" title="Hip-hop">hip-hop</a> DJs. For roughly 4 of the 5 years spent at KBGA, Tha Foolfatha was KBGA's hip-hop music director.</p>
<p>Both Beasly and Tha Foolfatha started at KBGA in 1998 and started off with a show that ran from 2AM - 6AM every Sunday morning. The name of that show was "4 hours with the fools." Soon after they took over the main hip-hop show that started Saturday nights at 11:00PM and went 3 hours until 2:00 AM Sunday Morning.</p>
<p>Beasly and Tha Foolfatha were popular figures around Missoula and had many jobs where they were the featured DJs such as: two high school graduation events, many nightclubs and bars throughout downtown Missoula such as Feruqis <a href="http://www.openlist.com/restaurants-view-feruqis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.openlist.com/restaurants-view-feruqis.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>along with parties, weddings and "just for the hell of it." They also attended <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>'s 2001 KUBE 93 FM "Summer Jam" <a href="http://summerjam.kube93.com/sjpast.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://summerjam.kube93.com/sjpast.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>Their show was known for its raw opinions, edgy and distasteful discussion, and fictional characters. Some of the more widely used characters were:</p>
<p>- DJ Karl - A raspy voiced DJ who claimed to be the 2nd worst DJ in the world. He pretended to have skills in scratching records but truthfully did not. He also claimed to have many sexual relations with celebrity women but could never verify the story. DJ Karl would also constantly make jokes or statements with some sort of secret reference, in one instance he surprised Tha Foolfatha with an impromptu segment in which he responded to Mr. Foolfatha's reaction to, "You know, when DJ Karl sneaks in, he slips in the backdoor." Never shy to do a remix, DJ Karl even flipped the K around backwards in his own name.</p>
<p>- Richard - "The happy hippy". A Trustafarian who would tour the world in his bio-helicopter to fight uncommon environmental injustices, such as whales inhaling sand, banks using fax machines, and Seattle looking too much like Tokyo. Richard would almost always ask The Foolfatha, "How's your girlfriend?" to which Foolfatha would answer, "I don't have a girlfriend Richard." While The Foolfatha expressed his hate towards Richard on air, many die-hard fans of the show have suggested that The Foolfatha actually is expressing his repressed frustrations of a "post 9/11 world" through his interactions with Richard.</p>
<p>- Durri'k Wzouski - Durri'k was a deep-voiced football player for the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana_Grizzlies_919a.html" title="Montana Grizzlies">Montana Grizzlies</a> <a href="http://www.montanagrizzlies.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.montanagrizzlies.com" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> who claimed to be the 4th string water boy &amp; athletic support technician. While he always hoped for a chance to start he never got the opportunity, although he was never short on having a lot of "white girl" girlfriends. In one instance Durri'k actually convinced a girl to meet him after the show, this girl did not actually realize that he was a fictional character. A few days later it was discovered that the girl actually waited for an hour for him to show up where they discussed meeting.</p>
<p>- Coach - Meant to imitate The University of Montana Grizzlies head coach <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Glenn_d386.html" title="Joe Glenn">Joe Glenn</a> <a href="http://wyomingathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/glenn_joe00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://wyomingathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/glenn_joe00.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> who coached the Griz from 2000 - 2002. Coach would get confused in many of his interviews and usually blame his ramblings on huffing gasoline.</p>
<p>- White Thunder - A white rapper claiming to be from Beaver Creek who could rap Cookie monster's song, "C is for Cookie."</p>
<p>- White Chocolate - The "boy band" who made a special appearance on the show live to perform their hit song "Underage" with White Thunder.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beasly_and_Tha_Foolfatha_b3dc.html" title="Edit section: Common Topics and Jokes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Common Topics and Jokes</span></h3>
<p>Beasly and Tha Foolfatha had many jokes and themes that carried through many of their shows.</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../p/u/f/Puffy.html" title="Puffy">Puffy</a> - Puffy or <a href="../../../p/_/d/P_Diddy_ee92.html" title="P Diddy">P Diddy</a> was a constant target on their show. Both of the guys would joke about how much Puffy sucked or how crappy his music was. However, they would play some of Puffy's music by request.</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../t/u/p/Tupac.html" title="Tupac">Tupac</a> - While Beasly and Tha Foolfatha did not have anything bad to say about Tupac himself they refused to play his song <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changes.html" title="Changes">Changes</a>. Whenever the request would come in they would usually hang up on the caller or "rip" the request on air, citing that the song was the biggest piece of garbage they'd heard in 5 years.</p>
<p>- Shoutouts - At the end of every show both Beasly and Tha Foolfatha would give shoutouts. Foolfatha would routinely give shouts to the "Original 5" (Superman, Marvin, Vukile, Beasly &amp; himself), his family, <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Phi_Epsilon_ca66.html" title="Sigma Phi Epsilon">Sigma Phi Epsilon</a>, a bunch of area codes, and a gaggle of girls. While Beasly would shout out to his "5 loves" - God, Courtney, Family, Sig Ep and The Foolfatha. He would also give a shout to his dog Pepper (deceased) and his cat Buckwild (a.k.a. Lucy).</p>
<p>- The Grizzlies - Being U of M students, both hosts constantly talked about Grizzly athletics, mainly Football. Beasly would usually make outrageous claims such as, "I hang out with the Grizzlies." Which would be quickly debunked by Tha Foolfatha.</p>
<p>- Soosan - An alternate spelling of Susan, a nickname given to a girlfriend that Foolfatha dated for a while, kind of. Soosan became a punching bag of jokes and jabs about her challenges with being monogamous and being completely insane. She was known to say, "You hate me," when she was not getting her way and that phrase was carried over to many of the shows jokes. If listeners were to carefully pay attention to some of the shows they would be able to piece together much about "Soosan" such as what type of car she drove, which player on the football team she was seeing momentarily, what her real first name is, and what she looked like. In a <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallup.html" title="Gallup">Gallup</a>/<a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> poll 56% of adult males surveyed between ages 14 and 85 had slept with Soosan and a whopping 72% believed that she was a <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slut.html" title="Slut">slut</a>.</p>
<p>- Both Djs had their own style that worked well when together. On occasion just Mr. Foolfatha or Beasly would do the show alone, which would usually result in Tha Foolfatha talking too much about useless crap or Beasly sounding even dumber than usual and screwing up a lot of things.</p>
<p><a name="Being_Rude_To_Callers" id="Being_Rude_To_Callers"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beasly_and_Tha_Foolfatha_b3dc.html" title="Edit section: Being Rude To Callers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Being Rude To Callers</span></h3>
<p>One of the trademarks of their show was being rude to callers, refusing requests and pissing people off. While many would think this would have caused a decrease in listeners it actually built the "star power" of the show. Almost all of these calls were recorded, edited and then played on the radio. Some of the more infamous incidents were:</p>
<p>- A hippy called into the show requesting something that didn't fit the format, Beasly flew right into his "hippy voice" and proceeded to tell the caller that his dog was missing, informing the man that she was a German Shepard named Nibbles. The caller said he'd get the word out to which Beasly responded, "Yeah...I'm trying to fatten her up." After a long pause the caller asked, "Are you gonna eat her?" (This was based upon the urban legend that hippies eat their dogs).</p>
<p>- A girl called in and proceeded to have an on-air discussion with the hosts about her clothing. The conversation was played again a little later. This time her boyfriend heard the conversation,called the studio, and threatened physical violence against the hosts. His threats were met with taunting. An hour later in the studio the 2nd phone line rang from the other college radio station informing Beasly and Foolfatha that a bunch of guys with baseball bats and tire irons were headed their way. The police were quickly called and when the guys showed up to KBGA's building some of them were arrested on the spot when they were found to have warrants out for their arrest. The police thanked the DJs for calling but asked them to refrain from further taunts to prevent incidents like that again.</p>
<p>- Callers would sometimes be greeted with the call letters of different stations or informed that the show they were calling did not play hip-hop music.</p>
<p>- A caller once requested a techno song to which the hosts mixed a combination song of <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_Eye_Joe_08cf.html" title="Cotton Eye Joe">Cotton Eye Joe</a> and Raise a Little Hell with a variety of sound effects.</p>
<p>- Beasly would constantly respond to callers requests with a simple and blunt, "No!"</p>
<p>- Frequent callers included guys in the local jail known as Spotted Elk and Slick Rick and high school kids known as Bow Wow and Meer One. They also had many groupies who usually turned out to be high school girls.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>For their final show Beasly and Tha Foolfatha decided to go "<a href="../../../g/g/_/GG_Allin_ce18.html" title="GG Allin">GG Allin</a>" on their fans and did not show up for their final radio show.</p>
