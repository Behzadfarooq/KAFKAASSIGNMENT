<p>I intend to edit this page such that it makes the point that as a result of this movies nomination the oscar for Best Picture, the acadamy awards insituted a new catagory- best animated picture- to reduced the embarassment caused when an animation was viewed as better then many "real" films.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any objections to this?? --Chrismullan</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. It's a common rumor to say that the Academy (note spelling) was "embarrassed" by <i>Beauty and the Beast'</i>s nomination and introduced the Best Animated Picture award because of it, but I don't believe it's substantiated, and I don't think it's NPOV. <a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjd_013d.html" title="User:Ajd">AJD</a> 05:25, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As well, the new category - Animated Feature Film - was not added until 2001. To claim "Beauty and the Beast" was the direct reason as to why the new category was created would require more evidence/sources. Although I'm running on secondary information, wasn't "Beauty and the Beast" one of the leading contenders for Best Picture? It seems unlikely that the Academy would be embarrassed by such a film. Xunny</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article now says this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is the only animated movie every to be nominated for Best Picture, and will remain so with the introduction of the award for Best Animated Feature.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is that true? In particular, does the introduction of Best Animated Feature mean that animated features are <b>no longer eligible</b> for Best Picture? If it doesn't, I'll remove the second clause from that sentence. <a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjd_013d.html" title="User:Ajd">AJD</a> 16:40, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uhmmm, isn't this only a few scenes that were sketched, because mostly they didn't have come to fully animate them yet? There probably exist sketches of basically the complete movie in Disney archives, but I guess that a lot of it isn't too different from the original movie (I guess there is a lot of rigorous planning behind it, so they wouldn't waste a lot of money on animated scenes later to be cut) but I don't know how much of these sketches would be particularly interesting to the general audience. 85.226.122.222 08:24, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the character of <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gaston_%28Beauty_and_the_Beast%29_218c.html" title="Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)">Gaston</a> truly a sexist character? --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngie_Y._d0dc.html" title="User:Angie Y.">User:Angie Y.</a></p>
<p>Yes. He regarded Belle as nothing more than a good genetic baby-making machine. She would pass of his and her physical perfection to their offspring. He had absolutely no regard for her obvious intelligence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Definitely, he even goes so far to say that it's "not right" for a woman to read, because if she does she'll start "thinking" and "getting ideas". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracieLizzie_a424.html" title="User:GracieLizzie">GracieLizzie</a> 14:44, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should there be some discussion of the apparent timeline issues of this movie? For example, the change of seasons would seem to imply the passage of months, but Belle's interactions with the Beast seem to take place over the course of only a couple of days.</p>
<p>There is also some question of the Beast's age. The prologue states that the enchanted rose would bloom until his 21st year, and the dialogue at the beginning of "Human Again" states that his birthday is fast approaching. But in "Be Our Guest" Lumiere sings that for "ten years we've been rusting." So he was 11 when he received the curse?</p>
<dl>
<dd>That does seem to be a rather large continutiy error, especially considering the picture in the West Wing and the flash back in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Beauty_and_the_Beast%7E_The_Enchanted_Christmas_2b25.html" title="Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas">Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas</a> were he doesn't appear much younger than he does when he turns back at the end.

<dd>It says that the rose would bloom until his 21st birthday, and then wither. Obviously it has been withering since the Beast's 21st birthday. Note that when he becomes human again he looks substantially older than 21. The obvious explanation is that the curse was placed on him in his mid-to late teens, and he is now in his mid-20s. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartacusprime_ef4b.html" title="User:Spartacusprime">Spartacusprime</a> 17:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is the stuff about Kingdom Hearts in trivia here? I like the game, but it doesn't need to go into that much detail or even to mention it at all.

<dl>
<dd>No, "all the Disney films" don't. It's more important on the Kingdom Hearts page...the game isn't associated with the movie for most casual viewers.

<p>I think its important to note that, although its suggested in the article that Gaston killed Bambi's mother, technically it would be impossible:</p>
<ul>
<li>The orignal novel by Salten takes place around 1920, while B&amp;B is set in the late 1700s.</li>
<li>The movie version of Bambi is set in the forests of America. B&amp;B takes place in France.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that Disney re-used the stock footage of the deer drinking doesn't suggest a tie either, as they used this short sequence in other films, including Sword in the Stone and The Jungle Book. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethEnd_094f.html" title="User:BethEnd">BethEnd</a> 03:49, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Maleficent and Ursula and Jafar get a page, why not Gaston? I like all of the above, not as much as him though. I think a discussion on what he represents in French society could be quite interesting. Although I know little on, if any, role in Disney's House Of Mouse (never seen it), he at LEAST deserves a page. I'll start the ball rolling if nobody else disagrees. Come on, Abis Mal has one of his own, and who remembers who he is???</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that Abis Mal doesn't really deserve to have his own whole page, but if you want to make one for Gaston, go ahead. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethEnd_094f.html" title="User:BethEnd">BethEnd</a> 17:59, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I made one, but Apostrophe and Bulletproof keep redirecting it. You two could help me make them stop doing so, because Bulletproof is threatening to report me and Apostrophe for violating the 3 redirect rule. <a href="../../../j/i/e/User%7EJienum_ea0e.html" title="User:Jienum">Jienum</a></dd>

<dd>You can try all you want, but the users Apostrophe and buuletproof hate Gaston too much. If you make a Gaston page, they will turn it back into a redirect. If we are to make a Gaston wikipage, we should put the matter to a vote. <a href="../../../j/i/e/User%7EJienum_ea0e.html" title="User:Jienum">Jienum</a></dd>

<p>I noticed there is some new information in the trivia section. That's great, but just remember to site your sources.</p>
<p>Phillipe and Maurice sounds like Philipp Morris. Hidden advertising of tobacco? In a movie oriented at young audience?</p>
<p>- I can not find the full text of 'Mrs Beast' mentioned in the trivia entery: "Mrs Beast is a poem by Carol Ann Duffy in the collection 'The World's Wife' " Is it in anyway relevent to Disney's 'Beauty And The Beast'? if not the entry should be removed as irrelevent, and put on the Wiki for the origional story not the Disney movie.

<p>In the French live action version "La Belle et La Bete," there are arms everywhere holding candelabras and moving them around, etc. Is this where the Disney people got the idea for Lumiere? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.80.204.242_4911.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.80.204.242">71.80.204.242</a> (talk) 03:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Wasn't the ballroom sequence originally all animated, no CGI for the backgrounds? And then it was later that they decided to redo the backgrounds in CG? I have bad memory -- could someone shed some light on this?</p>
