	    <p><b>Detective Beau Felton</b> is a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional</a> <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homicide.html" title="Homicide">homicide</a> <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective.html" title="Detective">detective</a> on the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">drama</a> series <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Homicide%7E_Life_on_the_Street_4b34.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></i> portrayed by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Baldwin_11f7.html" title="Daniel Baldwin">Daniel Baldwin</a> for seasons 1-3.</p>
<p>Beau was a hardheaded tough guy from the Billytown area of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore.html" title="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>. Upon entering the Homicide unit, he was partnered with Detective <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Howard_af1a.html" title="Kay Howard">Kay Howard</a>. The two of them were friends, though they often stated there was no sexual tension between them at all. Beau cared for Kay a lot, but always thought of her as "just another detective."</p>
<p>Beau was married to Beth Felton, though by the beginning of series their marriage was on the rocks. They had two small children, a boy and a girl, whom Beau was very close to. Beth, who was emotionally unstable to begin with, eventually leaves Beau in the third season and prevents him from seeing the children as much as she can. About this time, Beau began an affair with Lieutenant <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megan_Russert_9592.html" title="Megan Russert">Megan Russert</a>, although she soon broke it off.</p>
<p>During a raid in the third season episode "The City That Bleeds", Felton was shot, along with Detective Howard and Detective Bolander. While Bolander had been shot in the head and Kay in the chest, the bullets that struck Beau grazed the neck and hit his leg, missing all major organs and arteries. Beau was the first to recover, though he carried a lot of the guilt over Kay being hit. He was the first to go back on duty, but his recovery coupled with Beth leaving him drove him to start drinking heavily. His police work suffered for it, and even Kay was disgusted with him.</p>
<p>Between the 3rd and 4th seasons, Felton is said to have gone to some kind of police/firefighters convention in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>--a convention that became quite rowdy and caused an uproar. Felton (and Bolander) were both suspended from duty. This marked the last appearance of both characters: Bolander retired after his suspension and Beau quit the force.</p>
<p>Or at least it was <i>thought</i> that he quit. At the end of season five, Beau is found dead in his house, a shotgun blast having destroyed most of his skull. Everyone initially expects a suicide, but the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">M.E.</a> soon reveals that he had been shot in the back of the head with a pistol first, then shot in the face with the shotgun in an attempt to make it look like a suicide.</p>
<p>It was then revealed Felton had actually gone to work <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undercover.html" title="Undercover">undercover</a> for <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_affairs_%28law_enforcement%29.html" title="Internal affairs (law enforcement)">Internal Affairs (IAD)</a>, under the direction of Detective Gharty. Felton was helping the IAD and the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> work on a massive auto theft ring--but there was a leak somewhere, and Felton was found out. He was personally murdered by the auto kingpin, who managed to evade capture. Beth Felton wanted nothing to do with Beau's funeral, so Kay and Megan had to make the arrangements. A memorial for Beau was established in the police headquarters.</p>
<p>The last "appearance" of Beau was in Homicide: The Movie, where he and Detective Crosetti are seen in a kind of afterlife playing cards in the squad room.</p>
