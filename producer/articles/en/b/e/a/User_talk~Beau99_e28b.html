<p>Hello, fellow highway geek! &#160;:^) I did an article about good old Oatman not long ago, but "Arizona State Highway 95" came up as a red link. I know it's not a particularly long or interesting stretch, but it is the main route into Bullhead City/Laughlin from the Arizona side. Can do...? - Lucky 6.9 00:43, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You want me to do it, correct? Well, I don't know if I can. I only did the highways that I've been on multiple times. I've only been on AZ 95 one time, and it was only for a few minutes. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeau99_dc30.html" title="User:Beau99">Beau99</a> 05:06, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are you really going to do an article on every one of all those albums?

<p>I'll be adding more to them. A lot of artists who have articles on here have seperate articles for each of their albums, so I don't think it's a waste of space. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeau99_dc30.html" title="User:Beau99">Beau99</a> 22:23, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beau99, it's cool to see another Cree fan on Wikipedia. I actually originated her page here. However, you have added some information that is completely incorrect. I happen to be a Cree MEGA-fan, and I have a collection of over 75 of her CD's including singles, promos, etc... There is no release called "The Cree Summer EP." What you have listed is a promotional only CD single issued to radio DJ's and reviewers to promote the full length "Street Faerie" album (which you also misspelled.) This item was not issued in a "limited edition" because that would refer to a legitimate commercial release issued in small quantity. As it is a promotional CD, it would ordinarily be issued in small quantity to begin with because it's not meant for wide distribution. I am nominating the entry for deletion. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 15:48, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html#Free_the_Rambot_Articles_project" title="User:Rambot">started a drive</a> to get users to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">multi-license</a> all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> Attribution-Share Alike (<i>CC-by-sa</i>) v1.0 and v2.0 <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">Licenses</a> or into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> if they prefer.

<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>.

<p>With 10 opposed, and 0 in support, I suggest you withdraw your nomination and re-apply later. With this much opposition early on, other users will feel intimidated about voting in support.

<p>Hi. I've noticed that you're making use of political or religious <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">userboxes</a> on your user page. They can be a nifty way to share about one's personal preferences, but I realized, after a while, that they often detract from the real purpose of Wikipedia, that is, writing an encyclopedia. I'm inviting you to consider these words from <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, the site operator:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc. userboxes and asking others to do the same. This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project. They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time. Will you help me?</dd>

<p>We started a proposal <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely.</p>
<p>Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> with your suggestions on the policy. We have two subpages: Arguments and Sections. You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know you are interested in christianity, and I recently started a new wiki over at wikicities which is on the subject of christianity. <a href="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" class="external text" title="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">Christian Knowledge Base</a> is the site.</p>
<p>The goal is to have a knowledgebase on christianity from a distinctly "C(hristian)POV" rather than the NPOV. It is not meant to be a mere Christian Encyclopedia, but to foster a real sense of community. I'd like to include things like current events, news, stories, and anything that would add to both an understanding of Christianity, but also its enjoyment. I'm looking for help to build a resource that could really enrich the lives of Christians.</p>
<p>I know you are busy but I am actively seeking new sysops/admins to help me build this site up, and I would be positively thrilled if you could contribute in any capacity whatsoever. <a href="../../../n/s/a/User%7ENsandwich_4afa.html" title="User:Nsandwich">nsandwich</a> 05:50, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I personally don't care how the song titles are presented in Wikipedia, I just question something. You direct people to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSTARD_2edf.html" title="WP:MUSTARD">WP:MUSTARD</a> for these cases, but rule one states that exceptions may be made, which include song titles in all caps or all lowercase. At least, that's how I read it. Nothing personal, I just wanted clarification. -<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeau99_dc30.html" title="User:Beau99">ãƒ•ã‚§ãƒ‹ãƒƒã‚¯ã‚¹</a>|<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> 04:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSTARD_2edf.html" title="WP:MUSTARD">WP:MUSTARD</a> indeed states the possibility of such exceptions (not in a "rule one" but in the section "Titles and section headings"), a larger number of Wikipedia guidelines (from which WP:MUSTARD has only been derived from after all) suggest the use of standard English formatting, even if official sources suggest otherwise (see <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-TM_00f8.html" title="WP:MOS-TM">WP:MOS-TM</a> and <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html#Album_titles_and_band_names" title="WP:NC">WP:NC#Album_titles_and_band_names</a>). In addition to that, there are virtually no all-uppercase track lists on Wikipedia related to more popular/known artists, even though they are not that uncommon in album packaging. So in the larger context, there remains little to support the formatting eccentricies seen in previous incarnations of the Dir en grey related articles. I might also add that all move-requests related to my de-capitalization efforts have been honored by our fellow Wikipedians.</dd>
<dd>Thanks nonetheless for pointing out this inconsistency in WP:MUSTARD, I will suggest to fix that right away. One last thing, should you contact me through my talk page in the future, please just sign your message with your English nickname.

<p>Look... whether you like it or not, there is absolutely no way <b>anyone</b> can deny the massive amounts of errors on Dir en grey's official English discography page. You should probably take a look for yourself <a href="http://www.direngrey.co.jp/english/e-discography/album.html" class="external text" title="http://www.direngrey.co.jp/english/e-discography/album.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> before you edit anything more. There are various romanization errors that I personally can't trust as "official". While it's nice to follow some sort of standard, I (and a few others who don't edit Wikipedia) feel you're going way too far, and a fellow editor is now avoiding all DeG-related articles for the same reason. -Beau99 01:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So you, along with a few other people do not trust these official romanizations? Well, that's to bad, since the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JP_8906.html" title="WP:MOS-JP">WP:MOS-JP</a> suggest to give them preference nonetheless and I just apply them, like I subject band names to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-TM_00f8.html" title="WP:MOS-TM">WP:MOS-TM</a> and song and album titles to <a href="../../../a/l/b/WP%7EALBUMS_d210.html" title="WP:ALBUMS">WP:ALBUMS</a>. To you these derivations from the respective "correct" forms might be grave and irritating, while I'm just ironing out cumbersome exceptions in pursuit of a coherent and easy to manage style. Because they are just that, style issues and we already spend way to much time on Wikipedia engaging in repetitive fights over these petty details, instead of concentrating on actual content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How many Wikipedia articles on Japanese rock bands do you know, which actually contain information that is backed up by sources? It's not in my habit to brag, but beside the ones I have worked on, the list will probably be very short. And for the most part, unverified information is ultimately useless information, which of course does not occur to people who mistake Wikipedia with a free fansite hosting service. They devotedly defend all those little capitalization eccentricities without considering that Japanese has no concept of its own for upper and lowercase letters and tirelessly decorate an English language encyclopedia with loads of kanji that are not even displayed correctly in 80% of today's web browsers. If you and your nameless friends would like to stand for that, fine by me. I'm not here to win any popularity contests. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 02:15, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, look buddy. You're going to post two paras on this guy's talk page bitching about how too much time is being spent on style, via a post that spends it's entire time complaining about style issues???

<dd>I would also like to add that this fight IS petty. However, the meticulous picking through rough guidelines and rules is what is petty. I believe that Wikipedia is about sharing information, not looking pretty like some Encyclopedia-Brittanica clone. I think that adding the capitalizations that the band uses is an IMPORTANT stylistic issue, and even though Japanese has no capitalization rules, the band does on occasion use English styled capitalization. I'm not going to continue argument over your obsession with making everything look the same, from now on, I'll remain the fellow editor who "is now avoiding all DeG-related articles" for the time being. I'll continue to contirbute in my own fashion if important information arrives, but you will have to edit it to fit into your mold. --<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotjake13_0efa.html" title="User:Notjake13">Jake</a> 04:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
