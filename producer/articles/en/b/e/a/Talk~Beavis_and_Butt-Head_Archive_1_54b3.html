<p>I added that Beavis has a “Closeted Pyromania“. I used the word “closeted” because it was not allowed to show fully because of the censors. Someone took my edit changed it to make it look like it was their own and then they deleted the rest of my edits. I had a edit about Beavis being fire crazy, and how the censors would not allow that so he had to say things like Fryer Fryer not fire fire. I also has a edit on Butt-head’s gums. I have the DVD Beavis and Butt-head the mike judge collection and I saw their thanksgiving special. In it Butt-head showed he was unaware of his gums always showing. Beavis even made a crack about how Butt-head looks like a horse.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Beavis's Background?</span></h2>
<p>It should be mentioned somewhere in the article that Beavis is either Mexican, or of Mexican background. This was mentioned in at least one episode and in the movie as well I believe. Davez621 11:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This was an ongoing joke mentioned in several episodes. Beavis has blond hair and is white trash--a bastard orphan. But he could be Mexican. Mike Judge based their Highland High School on his own high school in New Mexico, and on one B&amp;B promotional special, MTV stated Highland High was in Arlington, suburb of Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>In THE GREAT CORNHOLIO, a poetry professor says to Butthead about Beavis: "Your friend is unusual. Is he Mexican? Or Russian?" Butthead jokes, "Yeah, he's rushin!" (on caffeine).... For picking up chicks using a Dating Service, Beavis used an alias, Geraldo (after Geraldo Rivera), and he attracted a chick because she "loves Spanish men."... Beavis says "I wanna become a Republican so I can shoot guns!" Butthead warns him that republicans have no nuts and never score. Beavis replies: "Oh well then I'll just keep being a Mexican!" Beavis as Mexican was a running gag. Beavis and Butthead are bastard orphans who never met their fathers (until the desert scene in the B&amp;B film--their fathers were traveling roadies for Motley Crue!)</p>
<p>--At the end of the 'Dating Service' episode, the chick Beavis attracted earlier on kept calling and asking for "Geraldo." Butthead, unaware of Beavis's alias, kept answering the phone and replying "For the last time, there are no Mexicans here!" Hence, Beavis is not really a Mexican. I'm amazed that some people took that literally.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Beavis and Butt-head Do Music Videos</span></h2>
<p>I once saw an airing of a special called "Beavis and Butt-head Do Music Videos", which is a compilation of some of the music video segments.</p>
<p>--There were actually two "Beavis and Butt-head Do Music Videos" specials. They watched so many videos that one special alone wouldn't have included them all. In fact, there were still some videoes that were not aired as part of those two programs. Both of those programs aired in 1997.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Move content to "Beavis and Butt-Head"?</span></h2>
<p>I believe the "H" in "Butt-Head" is supposed to be capitalized. (See, for example,<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105950/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105950/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.) If that is right, then the content of the page should be moved accordingly (and both "Beavis and Butthead" and "Beavis and Butt-head" should redirect to "Beavis and Butt-Head"). B &amp; B were real sticklers for proper capitalization, y'know. <a href="../../../d/b/t/User%7EDbtfz_4176.html" title="User:Dbtfz"><font color="maroon">dbtfz</font></a><a href="../../../d/b/t/User_talk%7EDbtfz_3ffd.html" title="User talk:Dbtfz"><sup><font color="slategray">talk</font></sup></a> 20:29, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>on every B&amp;B piece of merchandise in the 90s, 'Butt-head' is either capitalized fully or, when lower case letters are used, the 'h' is small. If you go to the forementioned MTV site, you can see that they themselves (today's MTV staff) areen't quite sure: they capitalize it in some instances, and have a small 'h' in others. Although IMDB does have a large 'h', many other credible sites list a small 'h' (as does Amazon.com for every B&amp;B piece of merch other than 'Do America'). I guess this will continue to be an on-going debate...(A Sniper)</p>
<p><br />
Upon further research I have found both the lower-case "h" and capitalized "H" on some offical websites and merchandise (<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-Head_Do_America_1b54.html" title="Beavis and Butt-Head Do America">Beavis and Butt-Head Do America</a> uses both on the packaging. "Butt-Head" is used for the chapter lists on the insert, and "Butt-head" used on the back of the DVD case). Butt-Head did once say Butt was his first name, and Head his last but was he just joking around? Also in a hyphenated name, typically both names are capitalized. Until Mike Judge officially confirms the correct capitalization, I consider this case still open. - Ssschulte 1 June 2006<br />
<br />
I agree with you Ssschulte that there is obviously no correct answer on the capitalization issue - sorry I jumped the gun... (A Sniper) <a name="Whose_House.3F" id="Whose_House.3F"></a></p>

<p>Just a thought, perhaps the blue farmer's a reference to the famous Blue Fugates, a family of 19th C hillbillies who were so inbred they were actually blue. Look 'em up, it's worth mentioning.

<p>How about a bit on how B&amp;B helped and ruined the career of many bands. It was claimed that the show helped the career of <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Zombie_d9da.html" title="White Zombie">White Zombie</a> and Corrosion of Corformity. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winger.html" title="Winger">Winger</a> however blames the show for ruining their career. I don't think I would be interested in rock music if it wasn't for the show, particularly <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_%28band%29.html" title="Ministry (band)">Ministry</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Inch_Nails_f615.html" title="Nine Inch Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillirennen_c3f6.html" title="User:Willirennen">Willirennen</a> 19.34 27 March 2006 (BST)</p>

<dd>It has been said that the band <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_Lovers_a383.html" title="Army of Lovers">Army of Lovers</a> credit B&amp;B for their fame. However about Winger, I noticed that in the episode, Butt-o-ween, there is a scene in which Beavis wears a Winger shirt and sings "She's only 17" and gets slapped by Butt-head. I think this scene was edited out of the later recordings. Does it have anything to do with <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winger.html" title="Winger">Winger</a>'s complaints? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">Anonymous</a> October 2006</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some stuff...</span></h2>
<p>I don't think MTV fired Mike Judge; on the "Beavis and Butt-Head are Dead" commercial, he was talking about the series' end and I think he said he wanted to end it, most likely so he could spend his time on King of the Hill and the released later on Office Space. Also, I think Butt-Head's response to Lemmy being in the Ramones' "Substitute" video is slightly off on this page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you're right about the Lemmy thing so I fixed it. Same with the Weird Al reference. - <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_d67c.html" title="User:Anonymous">Anonymous</a></dd>

<p>Who voiced Todd anyway? IMDb does not list Todd's voice actor. It would seem that whoever voiced Todd was uncredited. Can anyone clarify this?</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe it was Rottilio Michieli. At IMDb, he's listed as 'additional voices' in the TV show. However, he is credited as voicing Todd in the video game.</li>

<ul>
<li>OK just did some more research and found out the very first episode was supposedly based in Texas, but considering it was not a series at that point, and it was made apparant in the movie it was in California, I believe that is concrete enough. --<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJOK3R_dbe7.html" title="User:JOK3R">JOK3R</a> 18:11, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>--Where is the evidence in the movie that Highland is in California? The man who thought Beavis and Butthead were hitmen had Texas vehicle plates. In the TV show, a Texas license plate was seen in the episode where they go to a fortune teller.</p>
