	    <p><b>Bea Smith</b> was a fictional character in women's prison-based <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_%28TV_series%29_c0c1.html" title="Prisoner (TV series)">Prisoner</a>. She was played by <a href="../../../v/a/l/Val_Lehman_f5c2.html" title="Val Lehman">Val Lehman</a>.</p>
<p>Beatrice Alice Smith (or Bea for short) was a prisoner in the series. When the series began she was the "top dog" (unofficial inmate boss). The character remained in the series from episode 1 until episode 400, from February 1979 until September 1983.</p>
<p>At the start of the series Bea had served a long sentence having murdered her co-worker, a woman she ran a hairdressing salon with, who had been having an affair with Bea's husband. Paroled in episode 2, Bea returned home and killed her husband.</p>
<p>He had neglected their daughter Debbie during Bea's incarceration. After Debbie's 1977 death by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> overdose, Bea held her husband (and, secretly, herself) responsible, and his murder was an act of revenge. After the second murder, Bea was returned to Wentworth where she resumed her role of "top dog" and defeated Franky Doyle who had hoped to take over the role with Bea's release and challenged her for the position when Bea returned.</p>
<p>Perhaps connected to Debbie's fate was Bea's hatred of drug users and dealers. As was common amongst the prisoners, Bea also despised anyone who had harmed children. Bea was openly hostile to those she disapproved of. On early and famous incident was against convicted (but later proven to be innocent) child kidnapper Lynn Warner: Bea trapped Lynn's hand in the steam press. Later she clashed several times with petulant drug dealer <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Gilmour_1100.html" title="Sharon Gilmour">Sharon Gilmour</a>.</p>
<p>Bea's reign in Wentworth took a change after Sharon Gilmour came. Sharon's lover Judy Bryant intentionally had herself arrested so she could be in prison with Sharon. Seeing the enmity between Bea and Sharon, Bea stood up to defend her girlfriend, proving herself a worthy adversary to Bea. Eventually Judy and Bea began to co-operate with one another, eventually becoming close friends.</p>
<p>Bea was a key figure in many of the show's storylines. She escaped from prison a number of times. After car accident returning from a brief stint in Barnhurst prison she suffered amnesia, and forgot the period during which she committed any crimes of had been in prison. Her memory returned when she instictively attacked prison bully Margo Gaffney. In 1981, diagnosed with kidney disease, Bea had an extended stay in hospital, and new prisoners Sandy Edwards and Dr Kate Peterson largely take charge of the cell block. Initially presenting herself as a sensible and co-operative woman, Dr Kate Peterson initially diagnosed Bea's kidney disease but was ultimately revealed to be a psychotic traitor. Kate murdered Sandy and was transferred to a mental asylum in time for Bea to return to her top dog role in 1982.</p>
<p>In May 1982 corrupt officer <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Ferguson_e96c.html" title="Joan Ferguson">Joan Ferguson</a> arrived at Wentworth and quickly became Bea's nemesis. In November that year Bea hatched a plot to rid the prisoners of Ferguson - by killing her. Bea had Chrissie Latham light a diversionary fire in the library but Margo Gaffney decides a much larger fire is needed. Unfortunately Margo's fire gets out of control and prisoners Mouse Trapp and Barbara Fields are killed in the blaze. Bea and Joan are both trapped inside the burning building - a security gate separated them, and Bea had Ferguson's keys. Despairing at her fate of remaining in prison the rest of her life, a badly injured Bea decided that she is willing to sacrifice herself to ensure Ferguson also dies. However when Paddy Lawson arrived on the scene Bea was forced to unlock the gate to let Paddy through, also allowing Ferguson's escape.</p>
<p>After another confrontation with Ferguson in episode 400 Ferguson engineers Bea's transfer to another prison. In episode 536 it was reported that she has died trying to stop a riot at Barnhurst prison during a huge fire.</p>
