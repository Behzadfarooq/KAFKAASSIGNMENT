<p>Hi, Bearcat. Just got your message about PMs' spouses. I agree. If there is such a thing as the First Lady, one would think it was the Governor General or the wife of a male Governor General. On the other hand, as the head of state the queen would seem to have some claim to the position. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrontonian_6c76.html" title="User:Trontonian">Trontonian</a> 02:49, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a> was Her Majesty's Official Opposition. Any racist statement by one of its members is significant and far from a minor matter. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 03:15, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unless you're prepared to add every controversial statement ever made by a Canadian politician to the appropriate party page, this particular incident doesn't belong on <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_e567.html" title="Bloc Québécois">Bloc Québécois</a>. It's no more worthy of note than many other similar incidents that are <i>not</i> listed on their party's page, such as the numerous <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a> statements against gays, "Tequila Sheila", "Sambo", anti-francophone statements, etc. It's all or none. The Suzanne Tremblay incident is not special. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:18, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's sometimes a matter of opinion, however I think you would agree that any such issue would have encyclopedic merit based on its national media coverage which in the Suzanne Tremblay racist statement issue, was not only substantial, but sustained. Publicity wise, it ranks second only to Paizeau's racism for which he resigned. And, by all means include any racist (or extreme right wing economic policies (please)) into the Canadian Alliance article. The collective thinking, or intolerate views of party members, is extremely relevant in writing an encyclopedic article. After all, a political party is created because its beliefs are different, therefore Wikipedia's job is to inform readers about what specific things make them different. Note, in the Bloc Quebecois case, that the leader only "distanced" himself from Ms. Tremblay, he did not condem her or discipline her. And, it is racism throughout the separatist movement, that scares English Quebeckers --- and Wall Street. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelique_11c5.html" title="User:Angelique">Angelique</a> 13:08, 10 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Did it ever occur to you that the sustained media coverage of all stupid or controversial remarks made by Quebec politicians and nationalists in the past 200 years may have something to do with the political battle engaged against them in the name of Canadian unity at all cost?</dd>

<p>I realize your question of Everyking may be rhetorical and/or to get him to go on record, as you may have noticed this, but Everyking has voted to 'Keep' EVERY 9/11 victim listed on VfD since I've been here. Personally, I am not unsympathetic to his views, but since there seems to be a clear consensus, I generally vote Memorial/Delete. My main concern is that numerous articles have these names wiki-linked, just begging for articles. I feel we need to make more effort to redir these to the sep11 site.

<p>Hi, Bearcat--I ran across your comments about Indian reserves while moving the Canadian content from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_reservation.html" title="Indian reservation">Indian reservation</a> to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_reserve.html" title="Indian reserve">Indian reserve</a>, so I thought I'd let you know you can now link to that article instead of <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reserve.html" title="Reserve">Reserve</a> if you add any more articles about reserves. <i>Indian reserve</i> is not the term I would normally use, but it is the official term so I used that for the article and left <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Nations_reserve_baad.html" title="First Nations reserve">First Nations reserve</a> as a redirect. I also have quibbled here and there about usage (APTN has a show about Canadian reserves called <i>The Reservation</i>, so the term's been used at least once in Canada), but I'm sure you can cope with that. I have also tried to change the links in all articles that should link to the Canadian article, but may have missed some. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETronTonian_85fc.html" title="User:TronTonian">TronTonian</a> 21:43, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You deleted some text which I added to balance an imbalanced statement. That paragraph does not consist of a quotation alone. It's is also commentary, and I added balancing, truthful text.

<p>Per your comment on my talk page, I have removed this sentence: Coulter often attacks rich Democrats, such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> for being hypocrites who are totally out of touch with the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> they claim to represent.

<p>I appreciate your categorization of the material though I am curious as to your removal of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the information I removed (labels, record label product codes, individual songs on compilations or soundtracks) isn't necessary or relevant to an encyclopedia article. You'll find very few band articles on Wikipedia that include that type of info, and if any do, they shouldn't. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 16:01, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Curious; though I understand your statement and don't particularly disagree, as an archivist, I find myself frustrated many times when researching, that obscure and arcane knowledge is not always available. As a completist, I tried to provide all the bare, non-volatile information regarding the subject that I have found. I would debate that the Wikipedia would be a viable forum to expand upon traditionally accepted forms of information presentation. It should include as much obscure and arcane data, within storage constraints, as possible before such knowledge becomes lost (topic generic), and should be as heavily cross-linked as is interpretable. It already does contain many of these aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with listing record labels and product codes, as I see it, is that albums are very often released on different labels in different countries, and sometimes even rereleased on different labels in the <i>same</i> country. And occasionally the product code for an album <i>changes</i> even when it's still on the <i>same</i> label. The textbook example would be <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_McLachlan_44d4.html" title="Sarah McLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a> -- she's on <a href="../../../n/e/t/Nettwerk.html" title="Nettwerk">Nettwerk</a> in Canada and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arista_Records_b435.html" title="Arista Records">Arista Records</a> in the US, <i>and</i> there's a now-unavailable deleted version of her first album, with a different product code than the version that's currently available in stores. There'd really just be no point in including the original product code, since as things currently stand nobody can <i>do</i> anything with that information. IMO, the real test for data inclusion is how <i>useful</i> it is, and personally I just don't see product codes as helpful info -- if the album is available for purchase, people can search for and buy it by band name and album title <i>anyway</i>, and if it isn't available, the product code isn't going to change that. YMMV, of course. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 17:06, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a collector, that would be exactly the sort of information I would want when examining flea market booths, record convention vendors, used stores, etc. How else would I know that <a href="../../../d/e/f/Def_Leppard_7b45.html" title="Def Leppard">Def Leppard</a>'s second album, "<a href="../../../h/i/g/High_N%27_Dry_a1d8.html" title="High N' Dry">High N'Dry</a>" had two releases? The second version was released when the single "Bringin' on the Heartbreak" was remixed with keyboards added and was gaining popularity with an <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> video; I think there was also some minor cover art alteration. As a purist, I prefer the original release and the above info is not in the wiki article. In a more relevant example, there was a pre-release pressing limited to 500 numbered copies of <a href="../../../b/y/_/By_Divine_Right_0e35.html" title="By Divine Right">By Divine Right</a>'s "Good Morning Beautiful" that contained 16 songs. When Linus Entertainment/<a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Brothers_0eef.html" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> (Canada) released the album, there were only 12 songs and in a different tracking order with a different sound mixing. As a collector, I may want that rare first album of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_McLachlan_44d4.html" title="Sarah McLachlan">Sarah</a>, or first pressing of "<a href="../../../h/i/g/High_N%27_Dry_a1d8.html" title="High N' Dry">High N'Dry</a>".... Though I will assent that the scope of the wiki is grander than just being an online Goldmine Magazine and maybe this kind of stuff is best relegated to someone's personal fan page which has the volatility of ISP lifespan or even that of the fan.... Maybe a separate section for Compilations?</p>

<p>LOL they do indeed. Yeah i thought i might have a play and see whether i could put a few ppl in the lesbian category. Actually it started with some dickhead who put a vanity article on about himself, and i though how funny, when he comes back to update it, he'll have a nice little categorisation down the bottom: 'categories: gay, lesbian or bisexual people.' It made me laugh so i thought id weave a web of deceit, linking various people together with strange lesbian connections&#160;;-) Catchas</p>
<p>Oh and btw, just in case you're still looking for evidence (which i doubt you are) i herby admit that what i said was complete garbage, and none of the peoples pages who i vandalised had any connection to being gay (as far as i know).

<p>A) Quebec is presently inside Canada. TV shows produced in Quebec are therefore also produced inside Canada. B) Some English language TV series are produced in Montreal. They ought to be listed as Quebec TV series somehow.</p>
<p>The overlapping of Quebec's and Canada's cultural spheres really is giving me headaches sometimes...&#160;:-)</p>

<p>Bearcat: Is it standard protocol for the Canadian parliamentary pages to use em-dashes? I *thought* I saw Earl Andrew reverting a few em-dashes to "double-hyphens" a few weeks ago, and assumed that the latter was the "standard" (or, at least, that both were acceptable). <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:30, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure an official confirmation would, strictly speaking, be necessary -- as I believe that most (if not all) of the "double-hyphen" riding names are redirected to the em-dash titles already (of the ridings for which pages have been written, that is).</p>
<p>All the same, I suppose being clear on the standard methodology wouldn't hurt ... <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:38, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I am new here. Recently I observed that there was very little information on this site about the Lost Village of Mille Roches. I submitted an article that I wrote but it was removed. I am curious as to why it was removed - I am thinking maybe because I was not a member at the time that I submitted it. But after reading about becoming a member and all the stuff that I would have to learn just to make people more informed about Mille Roches, I don't know if I WANT to post it now! I guess I didn't realize that posting on this site involved learning an entirely different language! Isn't there any way to post information without having to insert a link to EVERY SINGLE WORD????? It seems very confusing, frustrating, and time-consuming to me. If you could help I would really appreciate it. Thanks. --<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.248.145.184.html" title="User:68.248.145.184">68.248.145.184</a> 02:32, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>I originally reverted it because I thought it was a copyright violation. If you wrote it yourself, I apologize. But to answer your other questions, articles posted here <i>do</i> have to be linked to other articles; it's the nature of the project. The only potential way around doing it yourself is to post the article and then have <i>other</i> people "wikify" it, but that isn't going to make you very popular if you make a habit of it. Also, because this is an encyclopedia, there are certain conventions around writing style and presentation of information that need to be followed. An article here cannot read like an essay on the topic; it has to look and sound more or less like something one might find in the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encarta.html" title="Encarta">Encarta</a>. And you also can't insert personal copyright notices -- to contribute here, you have to be willing to abide by a copyright model called <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, which means that while you're posting your own writing (not copy-and-pasting text from other sites), you don't own the copyright, other people have the right to alter your text, and you're surrendering control over how other people use or redistribute it once it's posted. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:57, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

If you only prefer using the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 100.

<p>Well, a stub message to me means either <i>I've added all I can to this article but it needs more</i> or <i>I'm done with this article now but I <b>may</b> get back to it later</i>. It is always the last thing I add to an article because if you are contributing, what possible reason could you have for stubbing in the middle of your additions?</p>

<p>Clearly. One of the reasons I was a bit upset is that I'm not sure albums even <i>deserve</i> seperate articles, which is why I tend to put them in with the band. By adding a stub tag, you're confirming that the article is pretty damn small, and may not deserve to be broken out. Oh well.

<p>Hello, Bearcat...</p>
<p>Just wondering why you deleted large chunks out of the Wiki for Espanola this morning. Although the formatting was a bit loose in terms of neutral prose, there was nothing in the areas you deleted that was A) untrue, or B) cannot be backed up with references. Nor was any of the information copied verbatum from any source. The segments in question - the first being the alternate theory of the town name ("Espaniel"); the second was bit of history surrounding the Espanola Hotel, and a third was a paragraph dealing with "Frenchtown". Although I agree that these points are somewhat esoteric, I saw no reason to discard them. Please reconsider that edit, and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>-SJ.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Heh. Walden. I've driven through there soooo many times! The town that doesn't end. But I digress...</p>
<p>On closer inspection, I agree with your edits, and will leave them alone. Maybe I should start a Wiki on the Espanola Hotel itself... now <i>there's</i> an obscure area of knowledge! <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpanishJoe_415e.html" title="User:SpanishJoe">spanishjoe</a> 20:07, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bearcat, thanks for your comments at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Talk%7EReform_Party_of_Canada_a965.html" title="Talk:Reform Party of Canada">Talk:Reform Party of Canada</a>. The last thing I want to end up doing is having to defend those wackos, but I am trying to resolve the propbelm of dealing with the "Reform Party wasn't conservative" Brigade that pops up every couple of months to mess up the article. I had a long dispute with this guy a few months ago who is one of the 'organizers' of a new "Reform Party of Ontario", which appears to be nothing more than a web discussion forum. He was adamant that the proper descriptor for the RPC was "democrat-populist" and came back time and again to change the article. Eventually he went away when I pointed out that "democrat" isn't an adjective, and that all parties would consider themselves to be "democratic". But now there's someone else. I don't think it's the same person because this one seems to be even less literate.</p>
<p>But back to the issue of populism in the RPC. There is some argument for using that in that the RPC did promote Senate reform, referenda and recall votes. They also claimed that their MPs would follow the wishes of their contituents. Their rhetoric, at least, was about giving the people more control over decisions.</p>
<p>Now I fell all dirty, and not in a good way. If I make the change I've proposed in order to try to stop the edit war, will you give me a hard time about it? (And again, I mean not in a good way.) Is there some way of adjusting the proposed change that would keep both you and the above-mentioned Brigade happy?

<dd>More radio fun! <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Team_5222.html" title="The Team">The Team</a> stations in Kingston and Peterborough arguably didn't revert to oldies because they became Standards stations, a different creature. CJCH Halifax reverted to oldies-with-a-bit-of-talk, and I could swear CFRW Winnipeg had been Standards before The Team (fighting KY58 being presumably a lost cause) but is oldies now (KY58 now being FM AC outlet Clear FM.) But I can't yet confirm this.</dd>

<p>Since you also contributed good and valid information to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Canadian_decb.html" title="French Canadian">French Canadian</a> article, I wanted to bring your attention to my recent entry in the talk page of the said article.

<p>For the reasons cited earlier, the series produced in English and French should be together. In addition, some English series may be produced in Quebec while some French may be produced outside of Quebec. Either way, "TV shows of Canada" hasn't reached 32K so it's easier to put everything in Canada in that article. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 02:38, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
