<dd>Heh, you ever heard of ProComp - the legal lobbying body that was set up by most of Microsofts commercial competitors to attempt to crush the company in court? Yep, it works both ways, and there's certainly more negative effort directed toward MS than outward from it, that's for sure.</dd>

<dd>Just out of interest, was there any particular reason for you providing me with this information? If you are referring to my deletion of SP2 FUD on the Internet Explorer page, remember there are two sides to an edit-war. I believe I have been civil throughout. Despite Alistair referring to me personally as a "cheerleader" and suchlike I have never made a deliberate personal attack myself --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 18:38, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was referring not to any single event, so much as to a general trend of behavior. I have no interest in taking sides or accusing anyone of being a "cheerleader" or anything of that nature. I would simply prefer that all actions be taken to avoid unnecessary prolonged conflict, but rather to constructively create better articles. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMIT_Trekkie_1e9d.html" title="User:MIT Trekkie">MIT Trekkie</a> 18:44, Dec 24, 2004 (UTC) P.S.

<p>Just to clear things up.</p>
<p>My "friend with the laptop" is Paul Thurott, a guy in the states who has been writing about Microsoft for ages. For a few professional magazines and now for a bunch of websites. He has a few books published about Microsoft products. He is in no way my friend, I actually really dislike the guy's opinions quite a lot, because he is so blinded by his love for Microsoft. What you were supposed to get from the quote, was that this guy who some of the time pretty much seems to want to marry Bill Gates and have his kids, was admitting that a machine of his with SP2 RC1 got infected with spyware and more specifically that he had to wipe the drive and re-install everything from scratch. Which I believe actually shows how lame he is, but never mind...</p>
<p>"my experience" is my job. I personally use Macs. I used Microsoft operating systems from DOS 2.something to Windows XP. Then Mac OS X came out and I switched. The machines I was talking about were my clients machines, not mine. I run Windows XP on one machine that I only ever use to play games (perhaps once a month) or to test something out for a client (perhaps two or three times a month). I haven't had any problems running Windows XP at all.</p>
<p>I totally agree SP2 is a great step forward for Microsoft. I have not disputed that anywhere. The idea I have been disputing is that, contrary to some of your edits, SP2 hasn't solved all the security problems in Windows.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well I have never said that SP2 is perfect, or that SP2 resolves all issues now and forever. I simply think that we should recognise the significance of SP2 and the fact it is far-reaching and comprehensive, and not to be sneered at. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 21:54, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You said in a recent edit comment: <i>The last time you reverted my info, you said it was because XPI were more like Browser Helper Objects than XPI.

<dd>Bully for you! I only added the BHO reference because you mentioned it in this context when revoking my original addition. The original Wikipedia entry on BHO's (before you edited it) made no reference to BHO's being specific to IE. In fact extensions are almost identical to BHO's - I hardly think I was being subversive by making that equivalence. As ususal, you use a slip like that to attempt to discredit me. People will rapidly tire of the both of us if you continue to be so aggressive with your comments and edits. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 22:23, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your only proving how little you know about the subject. The original entry on BHOs was either wrong or just being too vague. BHOs are IE only. Please go read up on BHOs elsewhere (which you obviously couldn't be arsed to do before or we wouldn't be having this discussion) if you think my edits to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browser_Helper_Object_648b.html" title="Browser Helper Object">Browser Helper Object</a> are wrong. And your right, Firefox extensions (or XPIs) are almost identical to BHOs. The thing you seem to be missing is that BHOs and ActiveX controls are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

<p>Plain and simple, does IE display a warning when a BHO is installed? Plain and simple answer, NO. That is one of the reasons that Microsoft added the Add-On Manager with SP2 and purchased GIANT's AntiSpyware software. As I'm sure you are aware, AntiSpyware DOES display a warning when a BHO attempts to install on someone's machine.</p>
<p>The specific vector you mention is only one or MANY ways for a BHO to get installed on someone's machine. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 21:55, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Internet Explorer does not warn you before installing a new BHO. It (at least IE on XP SP2) may warn you about certain vectors, for example the pop-ups that install BHOs or ActiveX controls that install BHO, but in both cases it is not warning you about the BHO installation, it is warning you about the pop-up and ActiveX control. And that leaves aside all the other possible vectors. Right now IIRC Internet Explorer will quite happily and quite quietly install any BHO you asking it without question. And a lot of the time without you even being aware that anything happened.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the detailed response. You have clarified what I originally supposed. Although BHO's can be silently installed, they cannot be silently installed from the web - they require other downloaded/acquired software as a "vector" (as you put it). In which case the comparison with XPI's ("unlike the situation with BHOs in Internet Explorer, the user is prompted before an XPI installer is executed") is moot, right? If you're going to take into account the actions of software already downloaded / acquired by the user themselves, then it hardly seems to suggest a security hole in the browser. Whilst I understand IE opens a rich API to BHO's, I'm sure it would be equally easy for a third-party app to manipulate the chrome / XUL files behind Firefox and therefore have the same effect as BHO spyware does on IE. Do you agree? --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 03:02, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not really no. You keep talking as if direct download from the Internet is the only way that people are likely to get a BHO installed. People get spyware from a great number of sources, not just downloads from dodgy web pages. And I'm not sure I'm being clear about BHO installation, it doesn't depend on third-party software.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have a BHO installer sitting on your desktop and you double-click on it, Windows will automatically install it. Since BHOs are basically just DLL files, you don't even require an instance of Internet Explorer to be running for this to work and it can all happen quietly in the background with zero feedback. Aside from perhaps hearing your hard drive spring to life, there may be no indication that anything happened.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have an XPI sitting on your desktop and you double-click on it, Windows won't have a clue what to do with it and will pop up the "Windows cannot open this file" "Windows needs to know what program created it" prompt. Then if you go to the trouble of telling it to open the XPI with Firefox, an instance of Firefox opens up and the usual Software Installation dialog opens with "Malicious software can damage your computer or violate your privacy" and "You should only install software from sources that you trust" in bold.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do you see the difference? Simply, both browser developers provide a method to extend their browser. Microsoft make it incredibly simple to extend your browser, even making it possible to do it without even realising anything has happened. Mozilla make it relatively easy, although they put enough of a roadblock in the way that, at the very least, you are clear what you are doing and you are aware that something has happened. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 07:14, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But really, both Firefox and IE allow malware to potentially be downloaded from the web. Both display a warning beforehand. With full access to the filesystem, surely it would be equally easy for malware to affect both IE and Firefox from the inside. After all, an XPI installer just copies some files into the extensions directory within the user's profile. The only difference is that IE now has a mechanism to detect such activity, and Firefox doesn't.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If, on the other hand, BHO's can install themselves silently from a webpage without user intervention, then that would clearly be cause for alarm, and would be a significant hole in IE worth mentioning in this context. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 15:18, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Go and download some program that includes a BHO. Yahoo Messenger used to include one, not sure if it does now. Morpheus used to include one, not sure if it does now. I'm sure you are capable if you really try, of finding one.</li>
<li>Run the installer. Watch in stupefied amazement as Windows quite happily installs a BHO in IE without a single bloody warning.</li>
<li>Realise the difference between XPIs (WHICH ALWAYS WARN YOU) and BHOs (WHICH NEVER NEVER NEVER ABSOLUTELY F'ING NEVER WARN YOU).</li>

<dd>Firstly, calm down. Secondly you have just reiterated my point. 3rd party software must be installed first. And what happens when you download (potentially malicious) 3rd-party software in IE? You get a warning. What happens when you download a (potentially malicious) XPI installer in Firefox? You get a warning. See? If dumbasses download malicious software in the shape of a P2P client / toolbar / 1000 new smilies or whatever, they deserve every bit of spyware they get. My point is that you shouldn't try to suggest that BHO's can be silently and directly installed from the web - this is simply not the case.

<p>Chris you need to actually sit down, take a deep breath and think about what you are doing. Do you actually understand the subject that you are talking about. Why are you so focussed on BHOs that are installed automatically through web pages? There are hundreds of different ways that BHOs can be installed. All the problems that people have with BHOs aren't all because of ActiveX installation. Is the reason you are so focussed on ActiveX installation because that is the only vector that Microsoft have seen fit to block? Are you so desperate to defend them that you focus on that one fix, to the exclusion of every other just as viable, just as dangerous source of BHOs? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlistairMcMillan_232b.html" title="User:AlistairMcMillan">AlistairMcMillan</a> 18:23, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, by design, IE does <b>not</b> allow BHO's to silently install themselves from webpages. You talk as if the BHO feature is inherently insecure. From what I've seen this is simply not the case. You talk about vectors that are completely unrelated to the BHO functionality built into IE. Vectors like P2P downloads, email attachments etc. Malicious software coming through such vectors could easily perform much more destructive operations on a user's PC than receive a few API calls from a web browser.</dd>
<dd>Noone criticises any other browser for exposing their API, do they?</dd>

<p>You can ignore this if you want, but...</p>
<p>Don't know if you'll remember but I mentioned before that I spend all day fixing/building/whatever Windows machines for people. A good percentage of this time is finding out why people can no longer access websites ("Mah In'er-net is broken!"), why their machines are grinding away when they haven't even started doing anything, why they are getting pop up adverts constantly the minute they start their machines... I've seen machines that had literally thousands of copies of viruses or worms on their hard drives...</p>
<p>Anyway my point. You keep saying things that make it seem like you think the current security brouhaha surrounding Microsoft is just drummed up by Firefox or OSS advocates. All of the people whose computers I fix... none of them have even heard of Firefox or OSS. Many of them couldn't even tell you what a web browser is, far less which one they use every day.

<dd>Fair point. I have also seen machines infested with spyware. It's usually because the users deliberately downloaded every stupid "1000 free smilies" or "top search toolbar" that blinked invitingly at them. It's not necessarily through any security flaw in IE. With non-technical users this indiscriminate downloading is a real problem. A problem that always get associated with Microsoft / Windows / IE, because MS have been successful in bringing the Internet to the masses. Why does Firefox not suffer from this problem? Because the vast majority of Firefox users are technically sound, and aware of spyware/malware etc. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 15:59, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you have gripes with my edits then feel free to discuss them on the Talk page before reverting them. I'm sick of the double standards around here. You're damned right I knew it would be taken out of the IE article. And it SHOULD be taken out of the Firefox article for the SAME reasons. I thought it would be nice for an OSS fan to provide the rationale, that's all. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 01:58, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am discussing them on your talk page. You didn't need to add that bit to IE to prove your point, but no, you did. You made the change first. If you're sick of the "double standards" here, don't use edits to the articles to prove your point. It hurts the content of this site. You don't think other users have felt the same way with edits to articles? Of course they do. But most of them don't let the quality articles suffer just to make their points. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 02:04, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Reasonable discussion with zealots like Minghong rarely yields anything on this site. OSS fans seem to have so much spare time and emotional attachment to their mascot software. NPOVing these articles requires novel ways of proving the hypocrisy of a POV argument.

<dd>Oh, the realisation that the administration of a supposedly neutral encyclopaedia has an agenda. It's sad. You're really into Firefox - so much so that you made it your username. And you blocked someone who was trying to trying to maintain an NPOV flavour in the Firefox article. I think things are becoming clear.</dd>
<dd>And by the way, there was no prejudice in my comments about your age - I was merely commenting on your very obvious, and somewhat dubious similarities with lan13. A little paranoid, are we? --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 21:41, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not paranoid at all... what should I be paranoid about? Yes, I like Mozilla Firefox, but not so much so that I become biased when editing articles. Yes me and Ian13 are both 15. Yes and Ian13 are both from the UK. Yes me and Ian13 both prefer Firefox. But that is proving what? There are probably thousands of people in the UK who also fit those criteria. I blocked you because you violated the three revert rule, no other reason. You may be interested to see my comment left at <a href="../../../m/o/z/Talk%7EMozilla_Firefox_96a2.html" title="Talk:Mozilla Firefox">Talk:Mozilla Firefox</a>... It was left a while ago, stating that I am no longer going to be reverting the change as it is up to the editors if the link is shown or not. From now on I'm going to look for further violations of the three revert rule only. Finally it may be of interest to you that in actual fact, I told Ian13 not to revert the page for a third time, after SarekOfVulcan changed the text again.

<dd>You continue to hide behind the rulebook. Let's get to the fact of the matter. An edit war has two sides. You blocked the side you personally disagreed with. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 22:46, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An edit war may have more than 2 sides. In this case it did. Those who wanted the link as an external link, those who wanted it included in the main article and those who didn't want it there. Also, those who were neutral and those who followed a general consensus which is what I did. Do you think if I really cared about the link now that I woudn't have reverted it back, because I still have one more edit left before I violate the 3RR? I did not, therefore, block the side I personally disagreed with. <b>You</b> and <b>only you</b> violated a Wikipedia policy so <b>you</b> and <b>only you</b> got blocked. If I had gone to <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_3_9d40.html" title="WP:AN/3">WP:AN/3</a> which is for reporting violations of the three revert rule instead of blocking you myself, then you would have got exactly the same response from them... a 24 hour block. Additionally, take someone on "my side" i.e. an editor reverting the same changes like me. For this example take Ian13. If he had broken the 3RR as well, then I would have blocked him as well. It does not matter whose side I'm "on", it comes down to me acting by policy and that is what I did. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:black;">Fir</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:green;">e</span></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:red;">Fox</span></a> 22:53, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, explain this to me. If all you wanted to do was "go with the concensus" why did you edit at all? Why not just let the general consensus do the editing? When you make an edit, you take a stance. If you trust the consensus, then you don't need to get involved. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 23:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I'll try to answer this as simply as possible. I'm sure during your time at Wikipedia you've come across <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">articles for deletion</a>. More often than not, there is a general concensus to keep the article after about three days of the article being up for deletion. If everyone just sat there, and waited for the <b>keep</b> votes to keep flooding in, the debate will never be closed. If I saw on an article for deletion page, that after 2 days there were 2 delete votes and 15 support votes, then I'm going to follow the concensus, close the debate and keep the article, no matter what I feel about the article. I'm not going to sit there and wait for someone else to close the article, because if everyone did that nothing would ever get done. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:black;">Fir</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:green;">e</span></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:red;">Fox</span></a> 11:09, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your example seems completely irrelevant. Of course if it's 15 vs 2 for deletion, then as an administrator you ought to delete it. However, what I am referring to are your <b>edits</b> of the Firefox article, reverting a link. You said you don't want to take a stance, but in jumping in and performing an edit you <b>are</b> taking a stance. This is not a case of "speeding up" any kind of process - you are actively aiding one side of a debate based on your own personal opinion. Anyway, we're not getting anywhere with this discussion. Your behaviour has diminished my confidence in the neutrality of Wikipedia administration and I plan to let others know about this. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeachy_0761.html" title="User:Beachy">Beachy</a> 13:45, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's absolutely fine by me, you go ahead and let others know about it. What you've said just then makes it sound like you think Administrators don't have the right to have an opinion. It makes it sound like you think Administrators aren't allowed to have a point of view. It makes it sound like you think Administrators aren't allowed to express their personal opinion. Of course they are, they're all just like normal editors who have successfully applied for adminship. You go ahead and complain about me, I don't see anything I've done wrong. I have not used my admin powers to get my own way, I have not abused them. I blocked you for violation of the three revert rule, which, looking back maybe I should have got another admin to do for me. But, I have not abused my admin tools, I have not broken any policy, but am prepared to reply to continue to explain my actions to whoever it may concern if you decide to "let others know about this".
