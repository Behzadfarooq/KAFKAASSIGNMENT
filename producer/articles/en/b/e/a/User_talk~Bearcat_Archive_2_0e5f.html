<p>Oddly, the dab page calls them "two Canadian television series presented in one format in the United States," while the only real difference by which they might be listed as two series was that they were on CBS, then syndication, in the States (and it possibly switched telecasters elsewhere at this point, of course.)</p>
<p><i>TV North: Everything You Wanted to Know About Canadian Television</i> (a nifty $2 find at a Coles recently) lists it as one series, first broadcast April 23, 1994 at 9p with the movie, first regular broadcast Saturday September 22 at 9p, last broadcast 1998.</p>
<p>I guess they <i>could very well</i> have been nominally separate series for purposes, say, of union scale - the "first," as a bigger-budget US network production, paying better, the second less so. Even if this were true, I don't think this is good reason to split the series into two articles. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 08:08, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I appreciate what you're doing by adding people to subcategories within the overall GLBT schema, but I don't understand why you're removing the "GLBT people" (or whatever the precise name for that category is) list in the process. It doesn't have to be an either/or thing. I think there's great value in having one generic GLBT category that people can peruse without having to go into a subcategory list. Once you eliminate that category, we won't be able to put the full list back together again. I don't understand why people can't be in both categories simultaneously, i.e., Gay writers and GLBT people. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 11:33, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with Moncrief. GLBT people could be retained. Additional, is there a consistent naming convention you're using? You added Andrew Tobias to the category "Gay writers" but another category you used was "LGBT rights activists" (which becomes confusing in its own right because LGBT rights activisits need not be LGBT - see Judy Garland in that cateory). <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger">Autiger</a> 00:17, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd also agree. Having an overall category for GLBT people is a valuable research tool. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathunder_61f8.html" title="User:Jonathunder">Jonathunder</a> 03:36, 2005 Jan 23 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Appreciate the explanation. I had wondered if 'Lesbian writers' was a category too. I was just concerned about the consistency of naming for someone trying to find similar categories. Also, one could reasonable have 'Gay musicians' and 'Lesbian musicians' because "womyn's music" seems to be a fairly distinct genre. GLBT naming is just a difficult subject area, period. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutiger_c802.html" title="User:Autiger">Autiger</a> 07:32, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I noticed your work with Samaritan on the Neoconservatism (Canada) article and I wanted to ask you a question about the difference between Neoliberalism and Neoconservatism in Canada. I've posed this question to Samaritan as well but he hasn't responded yet.</p>
<p>With what parameters do you seperate Neoconservative policies from Neoliberal policies in Canada? I ask because the two systems seem to share most economic beliefs such as increased free trade and reduced government spending. If Neoconservatism differs because of values including a much more self-interested, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Realist.html" title="Realist">realist</a> approach to <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_relations.html" title="International relations">international relations</a> and a tendency towards <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_conservatism.html" title="Social conservatism">social conservatism</a>, would for example the governments of Chrétien and Martin be better mentioned in a seperate paragraph or article about Neoliberalism in Canada? This would assist in contrasting them with the policies of for example Harper and Klein.

<p>Maybe they're using a British source that uses "series" for what North Americans call "season", and reading in the North American definition? Besides the clever but probably too obscure union explanation, that's the best I can figure.

<p>First, thank you for fixing the mayor/reeve entries. I wasn't initially aware that there was any particular Wikipedia policy re: the capitalization of these terms. I've started using lower-case letters for both in recent weeks, and could very easily make further changes along these lines myself.</p>
<p>I wonder, however, if some your other alterations might be inappropriate.</p>
<p>I notice that you switched "Minister of Correctional Services" to "minister of correctional services", for instance. A google-search for the term indicates several instances of the ministerial title being spelled with upper-case letters, as opposed to only a few with lower-case letters.</p>
<p>A search for "became Premier" indicates that both lower and upper-case spellings are in common usage, when the term is used in this manner.</p>
<p>Is there a specific policy (or code of literary etiquette) you could point me to that would require lower-case spellings in these latter instances? <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:39, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening, Bearcat. I do understand your argument for consistency. Unfortunately, I don't think the rest of the community is as convinced as you are that consistency is an absolute requirement for Wikipedia. Personally, I am very comfortable making these decisions on a case-by-case basis and with reversing those decisions as the situation changes. In this example, I would be ready to reconsider the "merge" decision when I saw that enough encyclopedic material had been added that a break-out article now made the most sense.</p>
<p>If that admittedly loosey-goosey approach continues to bother you, perhaps you might want to use this as an example and pose the question at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_Pump_1a2c.html" title="Wikipedia:Village Pump">Village Pump</a> asking how much consistency we should strive for.</p>
<p>The other way to gain consistency is to begin merging them yourself. Unlike deletions, merges do not destroy history and therefore do not generally need to be discussed at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> (though the controversial mergers are usually discussed beforehand on the relevant Talk pages). Good luck.</p>
<p>By the way, thank you for helping to keep the discussions civil on the VfD page. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:40, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>For what it's worth, Hansard appears to use the "capitalization on all occasions" approach for ministerial titles. As far as expressions like "asked the P/premier" go, I've encountered both usages in professional/legitimate contexts. In fact, here's a clip from today's Globe &amp; Mail:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>And she questioned the orchestrated press event at police headquarters, in which the Premier --wireless microphone in hand -- and Chief Fantino walked down a set of stairs to the applause of several dozen officers.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'll use discretion in the future, though I suspect that both usages should be considered acceptable for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:01, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the increased usage of "capitalization on all occasions" is indicative of a gradual shift in "acceptable usage" on this front. (It might be interesting to examine some of the 19C documents that I have access to, seeing if capitalization was commonly used in this period.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any event, this isn't something for which I'm inclined to invest *too* much emotional capital ... <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:50, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your question:</p>
<ul>
<li>The intent of the notice is not for the person placing it to make the changes. Were that the case, then there would be no need for such a notice. Putting the onus to repair on the person who discovers it is burdensome and will only allow NPOV and other improper input to remain and possibly be misused by an innocent researcher. The NPOV and other such notices are extremely important and exist so that visitors to Wikipedia who come across and recognize either NPOV, biased, misinformed, deliberately misleading and other such undesirable articles, won't leave thinking Wikipedia has no credibility. The NPOV notice serves several important purposes: <b>a)</b> a warning to viewers not to rely on this article's content at this time; <b>b)</b> it tells people Wikipedia is fully aware of the problem in the article and will be fixing it; <b>c)</b> that Wikipedia in fact does have the mechanisms in place to deal with NPOV, etc.; <b>d)</b> it tells those who have been or intend to create deliberate NPOV, biased, etc. articles that they are wasting their time and it will be caught and rectified; and <b>e)</b> it tells good contributors who care about Wikipedia that the article needs work. A close friend of Jill is an editor at a major Toronto newspaper, and when Jill said we were enjoying Wikipedia the editor dismmissed Wikipedia out of hand, citing certain articles, including several on Quebec subjects. Those who created the NPOV template obviously wanted to overcome this perception and criticism. For Wikipedia to have credibility, such notices are absolutely essential and I am sure those here at Wikipedia who created the templates may well have had other good reasons far beyond our ability to comprehend. <a href="../../../j/i/l/User%7EJillandJack_8cdc.html" title="User:JillandJack">JillandJack</a> 05:16, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>1) But the "Be Bold" rule applies just as much as the POV tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Afraid I don't understand this remark.</p>
<ul>
<li>2)I can easily see a distinction between "POV that a user should tag" (ie. "recognizes the bias issue, but doesn't know enough about the subject to fix it personally") and "POV that a user should just go ahead and fix themselves" (ie. "knows the subject".) There's no special onus on anybody to do anything, except that which applies to us all. Bearcat 05:22, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why <b>should</b> any person be obliged to fix POV? As I said, with that type of onus, people won't bother. The result then is that articles sit unmarked and are open to the kind of criticism for lack of credibility that has already been harshly levelled at Wikipedia by Brittanica and others. We have no interest in all this Quebec political stuff but a great deal of it is not just NPOV, but a complete embarrassment that in many cases is offensive. Thanks for your concern.

<p>As to your comment on the Quebec politicians category, it is simply a matter of following whatever established policy exists at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/i/l/User%7EJillandJack_8cdc.html" title="User:JillandJack">JillandJack</a> 05:23, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>User Bearcat said: Wikipedia doesn't have a policy against subcategories for particular provinces or states.</p>
<p>Yes, it does for the most part except for a few odds and ends like the New York city ones. When it comes to the provinces/states, writers, sportspersons, etc. are all by "American" and the State is limited to "People fpom" - which makes sense because there are, in our opinion for what little its worth, too many categories already. Somehow, someone here set up Quebec as though it were a country which of course it is not. I note that one of that ilk went around deleting "Canada" from <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Richard_8908.html" title="Maurice Richard">Maurice Richard</a> and others as place of birth. This is nothing more than racism and an insult to Wikipedia and to all honourable people with legitimate different political views.

<p>Hi Bearcat, thanks for your question regarding the inclusion of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Civil_Liberties_Association_e07a.html" title="Canadian Civil Liberties Association">CCLA</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Taxpayers_Federation_5df1.html" title="Canadian Taxpayers Federation">CTF</a> in <a href="../../../g/o/v/Category%7EGovernment_watchdog_groups_in_Canada_dc8b.html" title="Category:Government watchdog groups in Canada">Category:Government watchdog groups in Canada</a>. I originally created those two articles without listing them in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolitical_advocacy_groups_in_Canada_87af.html" title="Category:Political advocacy groups in Canada">Category:Political advocacy groups in Canada</a>, because I felt that would imply partisanship on behalf of the two organizations.</p>
<p>Because the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_b228.html" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> was included in the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Category%7EGovernment_watchdog_groups_in_the_U.S._350b.html" title="Category:Government watchdog groups in the U.S.">Category:Government watchdog groups in the U.S.</a>, I felt that there was enough of a precedent to warrant the creation of such a Category for Canada, and that the Canadian Civil Liberties Association would therefore belong there. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation was a slightly harder decision, but to my limited knowledge they are generally non-partisan and are most often addressed in the media as a government watchdog organization, so I included them there too.</p>
<p>I agree that the distinction between Government watchdog group and Political advocacy group needs to be clearer. Please take a look at the description given on the Category for Government watchdog groups in the U.S., I'd be interested in your comments on it. If it is acceptable and clear then we can copy it over to the Canadian category with some minor edits.

<p>Only developers can review IPs and other technical evidence. And only arbitrators can formally ask developers for assistance here, not ordinary admins. Probably developers only have the time to investigate such requests on a very occasional basis, and not routinely.

<p>Hi Bearcat,</p>
<p>Don't forget to tag images with the license they are currently under. It is important to tag images you have uploaded because those that don't contain copyright information may be deleted. You can view the list of tags avaliable at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a>.

<p>Hi: Thanks for sharpening the categories for A. L. Rowse. I notice that you changed his name to "Rowse, Alfred" for all the categories.

<p>Hi there! Glad to have your opinion on the Torontian streets. I believe we shouldn't set precedent for a large amount of street articles per city (I mean, anyone can add a dozen stubs on streets in his home town, clearly that's not very helpful). I would like your opinion on this proposal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any street that is only notable because of a landmark (or building or whatever), should be merged with that landmark.</li>
<li>Any street that is really really famous (think <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway.html" title="Broadway">Broadway</a> level) should get its own article</li>
<li>Other major streets should be merged into a List of important streets in Toronto or some similar title; I believe all information on a major street could be summarized in five or six lines, so a list of them would allow for easier organization and lookup-ability.</li>
<li>Anything that's not a major street should be deleted.</li>
<li>Any picture of streets that's non-specific (i.e. just some streetlamps and cars) should also be deleted.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hello from France&#160;!

I show you the place&#160;: <a href="http://cine.voila.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=337.html" class="external free" title="http://cine.voila.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=337.html" rel="nofollow">http://cine.voila.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=337.html</a><br />
I hope you can read french&#160;!<br />
As I have seen you are quite the only one who wrote about <i>More Tears</i> and as you are better than me in english, I leave you the information for updating. Here is the page of the french text for the orginal film&#160;: <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huit_et_demi" class="external free" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huit_et_demi" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huit_et_demi</a><br />

<p>A Google search on them turns up several sites which claim they are siblings, but I couldn't find any one that looked reputable (indeed many of them seemed to be redistributed copies of the Wikipedia articles).

<p>Would you kindly stop replacing the LGBT cat with this "sexual orientiation and identity" cat - that is removing T-people from the articles? Because, as you <i>should</i> know, transgender is neither a sexual orientation nor a sexual identity, and that means you are removing a whole group of people from the articles, which is extremely rude. Even more rude is the fact that at least nowhere where I found it you even bothered to debate those widespread changes you are trying to push through. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 10:58, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's hurting you? Getting caught with thoughtlessness? Bad luck, think first next time. You removed cat:LGBT several times and replaced it with the trans-exclusive "sexual orientation and identity", so what do you expect? And you are "singlehandedly" responsible for the inclusion of T in cats? Sure, except you nobody would have been able to think about it. Shall I fall on my knees now and thank you? Probably not. I strongly recomment you a) think about what you are doing next time, and b) annouce it if there is a chance of it being controversial, even if policy does not demand it in your view - you know, there are things beyond policy. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 17:27, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure if I agree with taking her out of the First Nations category. Although she is Metis she is often also associated with the aboriginal community as well, to the extent that she won an aboriginal music award awhile back, and one of her best known songs, "Halfbreed Blues" has her trying to reconcile both sides of her heritage. Can we not list her in both, or is that considered a no-no?

<p>Hi Bearcat. This is my first entry in about two weeks, as I was on my thrid detox for that long. It didnt work as well, actually, my blood pressure ran up to 166 and right now Im recovering from THAT as well. This week Im going to my family doctor to discuss that matter.</p>
<p>That said, the reason that I put Melissa McEntyre among Canadian people is , that she is Canadian, so shes a Canadian people, and also, when you look at Puerto Rican people or Mexican people for example, individuals are in those categories' pages. But there is no protocol rule as to that so I guess my better judgement would be to leave Melissa McIntyre the way it is now and evade a revert war furthermore.</p>
<p>That said, Im always drawn by gothic wearing girls, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairuza_Balk_8126.html" title="Fairuza Balk">Fairuza Balk</a> is my platonic love! So even through I know that Melissa plays a character in the show, I still kinda get attracted by her even through I know its just a character. Thank God Fairuza is the real deal. She has been into <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wiccan.html" title="Wiccan">wiccan</a> before she filmed <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Craft_%28movie%29_bb72.html" title="The Craft (movie)">The Craft</a>.

<p>Hi, thought I would let you that I removed a sentence you had added about the office of premier being created in 1867. I know where you are coming from, but I think it best to leave this out. What was created in 1867 was a federation with four provinces, each province with <b>a legislature and a lieutenant governor</b>. There is no mention of the office of premier in the BNA Act because <b>the legislature and lieutenant governor</b> operate in accordance with the conventions of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_system.html" title="Westminster system">Westminster system</a>. I presume that it was up to the Ontario legislature to pass an Executive Council Act but I would have to go back to the Ontario statutes of 1867-68 to determine that. It would be appropriate to mention in the article when and if such an act was passed by the legislature, but even in the absence of such an act, the mere fact of having a legislature meant under the Westminster system that an executive council could be formed by the lieutenant governor and he could name a president, and this president could call himself whatever he wished. I strongly disagree that the office of premier replaced that of the PM of the Province of Canada (a unitary state responsible for Canada East and West, not just modern Ontario, and with responsibilties for ALL matters, not just provincial matters later assigned to provinces such as Ontario, Quebec, NS, NB). Better to think of Canada and Ontario as new creations with new responsibilities. Prior to 1867 I tend to refer to modern Canada as the British North American colonies or British North America, as this is broad enough to include Newfoundland, PEI, and BC.--<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentS_9f88.html" title="User:BrentS">BrentS</a> 4 July 2005 01:28 (UTC)</p>

<p>I chuckled at your edit summary about the description of the location of Georgian Bay. It does seem waaaaay to far southeast of SSM. However, if you check your map, you will see that the North Channel of G'Bay extends almost to Sault Ste Marie. Being correct doesn't make it the best description, however. "South of Sudbury" isn't great either, but it may be the best we can do when confronted with the realities of the sparse population in that part of N. Ontario. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunray_969d.html" title="User:Sunray">Sunray</a> 22:22, July 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In a way it is somewhat academic, since Georgian Bay is a bay of Lake Huron. Nevertheless, the North Channel is commonly referred to as "the North Channel of Georgian Bay" as a Google search of those terms (in quotes) will reveal. Here's some evidence:</p>

<p>Hi Bearcat - What are your thoughts on the capitalization/non-capitalization of "Aboriginal"? When I use the term I've been capitalizing it as per suggested guidelines released by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada<sup><a href="http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/pr/pub/wf/trmrslt_e.asp?term=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/pr/pub/wf/trmrslt_e.asp?term=1" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup>. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurieeto_060a.html" title="User:Kurieeto">Kurieeto</a> 16:37, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Bearcat - The local library has copies of the "Canadian Oxford Dictionary, Official Dictionary of the Canadian Press" (427.971 CAN 2004), and "The Globe and Mail Style Book" (808.06607 MCF 2003). I tried to get a copy of the "CP stylebook&#160;: a guide for writers and editors" (808. 06607 CP 1995), but it's a circulating book and has been checked out by someone else.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the Canadian Oxford Dictionary the entry of "Aboriginal" is capitalized, unlike "francophone", as you pointed out. This source does indicate that the term should not be capitalized when used as an adjective. So I guess an example would be: "<a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_Peoples_Television_Network_26f8.html" title="Aboriginal Peoples Television Network">APTN</a> is an <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada_caad.html" title="Aboriginal peoples in Canada">aboriginal</a> television network" vs. "<a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_Peoples_Television_Network_26f8.html" title="Aboriginal Peoples Television Network">APTN</a> is a television network that broadcasts programs produced by and for <a href="../../../a/b/o/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada_caad.html" title="Aboriginal peoples in Canada">Aboriginal</a> people in Canada". My understanding of the capitalization instructions would mean that your edit of <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooking_With_the_Wolfman_4f6c.html" title="Cooking With the Wolfman">Cooking With the Wolfman</a> is correct, as it currently reads, "Cooking With the Wolfman is a cooking series first produced for the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, an aboriginal television network in Canada."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe_and_Mail_1d03.html" title="Globe and Mail">Globe and Mail</a>'s style guide does not have a specific entry for "Aboriginal". They do have one for "native people" though. The "native people" entry begins by saying, "Native people is the generally accepted term in Canada embracing the four categories of aboriginal or semi-aboriginal peoples: Inuit, Indians, non-status Indians, and Métis." The book goes on to use the term "native people" where we on Wikipedia are currently using "Aboriginal".</dd>

<p>I understand that the rule concerning categorizing pages that you brought up exists and abide by it 99% of the time. However, rules are meant to be interpreted, are they not. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Breton_Island_4798.html" title="Cape Breton Island">Cape Breton Island</a> is indeed an island in Nova Scotia and therefore needs to be categorized as such. It is however very much also a cultural entity of huge importance to Nova Scotia and should appear on the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Category%7ENova_Scotia_e7bd.html" title="Category:Nova Scotia">Category:Nova Scotia</a> page and not simply "buried" under <a href="../../../i/s/l/Category%7EIslands_of_Nova_Scotia_5cc8.html" title="Category:Islands of Nova Scotia">Category:Islands of Nova Scotia</a> subcategorized under <a href="../../../g/e/o/Category%7EGeography_of_Nova_Scotia_25b5.html" title="Category:Geography of Nova Scotia">Category:Geography of Nova Scotia</a>. The whole point of categorizing is to provide ready referencing, is it not? The rule should and does apply in an important linear fashion from narrow to wide in nearly all cases (as a strict rule of thumb). The difficulty arises in the few cases where the page describes something that is not merely one kind of entity, doesn t it.

<p>I see your point, and I'm not saying we should do them for every application for a TV station, radio station, specialty service, etc. because that would most certainly be overkill. But I think there would be a place in explaining the different applications, and their various (dis)advantages, for something of this magnitude where there could be room for controversy (as with <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Satellite_Radio_ef28.html" title="Canadian Satellite Radio">Canadian Satellite Radio</a>, for instance).</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, we redirect the unsuccessful ones afterwards to the licensed one (or some separate history-of-Canadian-pay-TV page) and explain what happened to all of them.</p>

<p>Hi Bearcat.

It would be a miscategorisation to place Mr Tergonning for example into <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_television_presenters_5044.html" title="Category:Australian television presenters">Category:Australian television presenters</a> category as I don't think he's ever appeared on television to present anything as such to date, but is a major behind-the-scenes worker. This is my reasoning for the creation of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_television_personalities_b4b2.html" title="Category:Australian television personalities">Category:Australian television personalities</a>.

<p>Hi Bearcat. I noticed that the <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">CfD</a> discussion on this category resulted in a decision of "No consensus(keep)". This seems unfortunate, because I think there was a consensus that "AIDS victims" is not a good name. So I'm thinking that it should be submitted as a rename. I think there could be two categories Category:People living with AIDS and Category:People who have died from AIDS. I'd like to hear your views, and your choices for names.

<p>For the past 20+ years that AIDS has been on the public radar, the PWA community has been quite explicitly clear that they object to being labelled as "victims".

<dd>If you argument was that the name would be considered offensive to a small subset of aids sufferers (is sufferers okay? er...

<dd>It's not a "small subset of AIDS sufferers" who take issue with "victims"; it's the overwhelming <i>majority</i> of them.

<p>Let's just say I'm a little obsessive about some things. As a former world champion Mr. Metric, I hold to all things SI, and SI holds that year-month-day is the approved form. It's unfortunate that Wikipedia has not yet entered the 20th century in that regard. I'm of the feeling that, just as with British/North American spellings, things should be left the way you found them when you came to the article, and should be changed only to ensure conformity within the article. Now <i>I'm</i> utterly mystified as to why you changed only one, and left its neighbor sitting there, an odd duck out! <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 00:56, 2005 September 1 (UTC)</p>

<p>One other note: if you compare the contribution histories of Fat pig73 and the anon 24.203.7.52, they merge nicely (except a bit at Aug 13).

<p>I was all ready to VfD Joshua Hellyer, but: there's a ghost of a chance the show he co-hosted, probably on community cable?, might have been notable with reference to a local community or a subculture. +Sabrevision +TV, +cable or +Rogers googles nothing relevant.

<p>I've been working on a bid to bring Wikimania 2006 to Toronto. I have contacted <a href="http://www.kmdi.utoronto.ca/" class="external text" title="http://www.kmdi.utoronto.ca/" rel="nofollow">KMDI</a>, an institute at the University of Toronto. They are very interested in partnering with us, and can get us a full range of U of T facilities for free. With this offer I think there is a very good chance of bringing Wikimania 2006 to Toronto. The only thing we currently lack are people willing to help out. I'm willing to do much of the work, but for the time being I am in Ottawa and having some people on the ground in Toronto will be necessary. We also need a number of people willing to assist at the actual event, likely the first weekend of August 2006. If you are interested in helping out sign up at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania_2006/Toronto" class="extiw" title="meta:Wikimania_2006/Toronto">Wikimania 2006/Toronto</a>. Preliminary bids from various cities need to be made by Sept. 30, 2005, at which point a committee will choose which city gets to host the event. The number of people willing to help will certainly be an important consideration. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:20, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete both</li>
<li>Restore <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a> to before the dab</li>

<li>Delete <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Douglas_e098.html" title="Jack Douglas">Jack Douglas</a> again</li>
<li>Restore only the edits after the copypaste move</li>
</ol>
<p>and almost did it, but chickened out. Have I misunderstood the example at the bottom of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_fix_cut_and_paste_moves_8038.html" title="Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves">Wikipedia:How to fix cut and paste moves</a> (which would seem to match this case exactly), or does that document need updating? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 18:50, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I see that what you did certainly seems to repair the history. Do I misunderstand the "troublesome case" on that page? If I replace A with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Douglas_4724.html" title="John Douglas">John Douglas</a> and B with John Douglas (record producer) I think it's exactly what they describe: but you are clearly correct in what you have done, so I must be missing a link somewhere? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 19:14, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding being primed for a fight: I've been aware for a while that this is going to make me a few enemies...I'd truly like to see a WikiAtlas project (or something similar), because it's clear that people want to write about roads — I just don't think WP is the place for it. Nobody has gone to the trouble of attempting to find consensus about what constitutes a WP-worthy road article (despite <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Roads_and_streets_dd05.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Roads and streets">this</a>), so I thought I'd give it a try. I notice some of the comments left on the current VfDs are showing signs of irritation, but so be it.</dd>
<dd>My goal is to set consensus for roads in Canada (and I hope others will pick up on it for roads in other parts of the world), and to eventually re-write that policy document with actual consensus derived from AfDs, since discussion resolved nothing. It'll upset a few people, but I think this is worthwhile, and (I think) I'm prepared for the backlash. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 16:41, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not meant to be a "my name is better than yours" argument but just an explanation as to why I used Sudbury Airport and not Greater Sudbury Airport. I really only have one source of information and that's the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_Flight_Supplement_94d2.html" title="Canada Flight Supplement">Canada Flight Supplement</a> (CFS).

My subpages are in the categories because of a template that we are creating for the Baseball Wikiproject and the categories are written into the template automatically. This is only temporary until we get the bugs out. Our goal is about 10-14 days. I hope this is not going to be a problem(?). Let me know if I really need to remove those ASAP.

<p>Oh, to answer your skill-testing question: I usually do a quick text scan before reading, and I noticed the <i>see also</i> section, linking to articles already wikified in the prior text.

<p>Have a look at some of the sub-categories listed in this cat. I can understand some of them, say <i>Hamiltonians</i>, but <i>Richmond Hillers</i> and <i>Oakvillians</i> seem very wrong to me, and they don't follow the current conventions. They were all created by one user. Something else to add to our to-do list... <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 15:24, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been poring over the <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28categories%29_ac1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)</a> (and the related talk pages). I find it messy. There doesn't appear to be a cohesive or consistent strategy for category naming, after all. In some cases, its <i>X in place</i> or <i>X of place</i>; in others, its <i>Place-ian X</i> et al. I suspect this will cause a lot of confusion for readers. When I wrote the above comment, I had assumed there was a trend towards reaching this consistent state, but it looks like I was wrong and the above categories are quite legitimate as the consensus stands <i>right now</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 00:37, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, let's see:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...the issue with categories like Oakvillians and Richmond Hillers is that I really don't think either city is significant enough to deserve its own "People from..." category.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree, but I do think there should be a category devoted to the cities or towns themselves. A Richmond Hill category, for example, could be populated with the Dunlap observatory, Yonge Street, Oak Ridges Moraine etc., as well as prominent individuals from, or residing in, the town.</p>
<p>As far as our friend is concerned (re:Minister of Finance (Ontario)), I just can't keep up - I already spend so much time doing various grunt work (especially re-stubbing and categorizing geographical articles). I checked the contributions from that IP, and I see plenty of edits to articles about Canadian buildings and politicians. Some were decent, but others fit the earlier trend (over-populated <i>See also</i> sections etc); and then there's the one you posted on my talk page...sigh</p>
<p>I thought about suggesting on the notice board that we keep an eye on him/her, for all related accounts and IPs, but that seems too Orwellian - I won't do it. A mentoring-type arrangement would be suitable, but the user ignores all contact. I know you've spent a lot of time cleaning up after him, despite your own categorization (and other) work, so we should find a way to get the user to make those positive contributions while refraining from the more questionable ones. The question is, how? It seems unproductive to keep cleaning up after him. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix">Mindmatrix</a> 17:53, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that you have removed my comment about Sing Tao's editorial's stance. But my comment is factually correct. For some controversial news that the <i>Star</i> would not report at all, <i>Sing Tao</i> would go ahead and report them. At least the new coverage is more neutral, so the editorial stance must also be more neutral since the editors decide what to appear in the paper.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 07:10, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, I’ll rephrase it to avoid the word “extreme”. (Not that I agree with the assertion that the <i>Star</i> is not “left”, though. It’s at least lefter than <i>Sing Tao</i>.)—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 07:28, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your edit comment: <i>:Category:Queer theory is already a subcategory of all three other categories; Wikipedia expressly has a policy against redundant categorization. this hardly needs explaining.</i></p>
<p>It's an odd sense of "already" to mean "I can later change categories to retroactively make sense of my uncommented article edit to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queer_theory.html" title="Queer theory">Queer theory</a>." But OK, aside from the slightly obnoxious edit comment and sequence, I guess the way categories are arranged now is doable. (it actually seems a little off to have a n identically named category act as a "proxy" for the article itself; there might be other examples of this, but it doesn't really fit the meaning of categorization... but that's minor, and I'll live with it). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 14:58, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bearcat, thanks for resubmitting, I'm kinda new to the wikipedia world... Ya, I won't post on the vfd page, you make a good point. In terms of who it was, I have a feeling it isn't Cooper. He really hasn't been that antagonistic at all. There are however a number of people, including one person who ran against Alan in the by-election who have been very militant against Alan and Susan, to the point that the RCMP is involved. There is also of course the gentlemen from the Race Relations Committee (see the article posted by the anon user at the top of the vfd page) who I wouldn't put beyond them either. It's probably the same person who floods the "electionprediction" web page.

<p>pm_shef and bearcat, first I am not Josh Cooper and was not involved in his campaign infact I am a member of the liberal party and was involved in Mario Racco's campaign and Elinor Caplan's campaign. Even though I am a liberal I support non-biased opinions which both of you have displayed that your opinions are very biased. I am infavour of deleting Josh Cooper's article now as he is no longer a federal candidate. just between us there in no way that Alan Shefman's article is notable enough to stay posted. I could list literaly hundreds of Vaughan people that are more notable than Alan Shefman. Eyeonvaughan 5 November 2005</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for supporting me on the eccentric category. I would really appreciate your comment or vote at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html#Category:Jewish_American_actors" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion#Category:Jewish_American_actors</a>. There is a real problem with this category and similar ones as mixing ethnicity-nationality-profession in categories is in my opinion extremely bad for the category structure. The main reason for this is many people are being added to these xxx American categories for having one grandparent of that ethnicity, therefore they can be in four xxx American categories. If we allow the ethnicity-nationality-profession mix in categories, for example, for someone who has grandparents of four different ethnicities and two professions i.e. actor and director, they could end up in four xxx American actor categories and four xxx American director categories which in my opinion would make Wikipedia look ridiculous.

<p>Hi, thanks for your response. I think an argument could be made that jewish people have been influential in the theatre and film, but was it because they were jewish? Definitely part of African American culture came from the suffering their forebears experienced in the slave trade and segregation etc. So could we argue that the suffering and discrimination that Jewish people have experienced has caused them and their descendents to have perhaps have a gift for humour, and creativeness?

<p>Hi Bearcat, I see you are a fellow Canadian! Anyway, thanks for your comment, but I think you will agree with me that once an article is listed on AfD, it moves beyond the control of any group. I repeat my comment on the AfD: insofar as it helps to create consensus (which I think you will agree does not yet exist), who cares the provenance. And I am certain that you are not suggesting that by voting to delete I and other editors are somehow related to or supporting an offensive group like GNAA. On s'exprime, on laisse voir! C'est si simple. Cheers, <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 12:10, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I am not denying that they are meddling in the votes, but that their presence does not invalidate the value or usefulness of a consensus-determining set of votes on blogs generally. I am unclear what you are advocating: because GNAA members are voting other editors should abstain from the vote? <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 12:28, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bearcat: Once nominations are up on AfD, they are open to the community as a whole to vote on them. I doubt GNAA has enough clout to sway consensus against the community generally. As a result, I reiterate the provenance of the nomination is irrelevant since what matters is the outcome of the voting which, as can be clearly seen on the Canadian blog voting, is a matter of considerable interest. GNAA participation is, therefore, a canard in this case since the question of whether blogs generally merit entries is a debate worth having, regardless of the motivations of the nominators. IS GNAA offensive? Yes. Does that matter? Not really. Arguments for keeping the articles should be based on their individual merits. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 12:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just don't agree with your assessment. Notable articles do not get deleted through caprice. Hell by my (granted stringent, minoritarian) view for what should be kept, an amazing amount of unnotable stuff is prevented from being culled. As it is, plenty of the delete votes (see this AfD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Harry%27s_Place" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Harry%27s_Place" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> for example) are from users with diverse edit histories, etc.... I respect the fact that you disagree with my delete votes, but I reject the implication that somehow these are not valid AfDs. If GNAA were simply blanking pages they don't like - that would be one thing. But this is not vandalism, this is putting up pages for community opinion. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 13:23, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, talk about a situation that makes nobody happy. Unfortunately, it's also a kind of unresolvable situation: to just take the result that applies to one to apply to both doesn't really make me happy. At first, I was thinking that we might just wait a week and relist <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> but that errs towards deletion, which nobody likes (although I'm having a hard time thinking of a better way). Maybe wait a week, list <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> on AfD and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> on VfU? Maybe just stick our heads in the sand and pretend it all never happened? It's a tricky spot. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 19:28, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Bearcat, It is a stupid decision. I have been giving some thought and we have four options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do nothing.</li>
<li>Wait for a while and put <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Bloggers_eb23.html" title="Progressive Bloggers">Progressive Bloggers</a> on AfD again.</li>
<li>Wait for a while and start a new <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> article.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If we go to DRV, we need to make a good case. The points we should make are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bias by inclusion, like you pointed out. Noting that both you and I are from the left of the political spectrum (my knee-dipper credentials are here: <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon_general_election%2C_1996.html" title="Yukon general election, 1996">Yukon general election, 1996</a>&#160;:-) ) and not involved in blogging should add credibility to the request.</li>
<li>The decision to delete did not reflect the lack of consensus 19 keeps vs 20 delete. A number of trolls, sockpuppets and new users were identified, but not all of them so we should identify them all in the request and do a proper count of "legitimate" users.</li>
<li>We could also reiterate the idea that it is a notable blog, but we would need to provide even more evidence to convince Lord Bob and other legitimate editors. But I don't personally feel like digging up evidence of notability of a bunch of Tories.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we do what Lord Bob suggests, we might end up in the same situation with the respective articles reversed, so we do one or the other. I would probably vote delete on another AfD if <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogging_Tories_edf8.html" title="Blogging Tories">Blogging Tories</a> were not undeleted. I would probably prefer no. 4. Anyway, these are my two cents' worth. <a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigizanasi_db83.html" title="User:Luigizanasi">Luigizanasi</a> 04:53, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, having Blogging Tories undeleted and Progressive Bloggers deleted would be a <i>serious</i> pain in the rear. I think that going to VfU...er...DRV... and trying to get this undeleted on the ground of consistency is probably the best way out of this, unfortunately. This is just an amazingly irritating situation to be in. For the record, I <i>still</i> don't think that Blogging Tories is notable, but I'd probably vote to undelete just to have things straight (of course, if they both come up for AfD again in the future, I reserve the right to get out the deletestick!). <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 05:51, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you mean. I was moving the double names to the start of the article as per the discussion elsewhere. I just realised that the CFS says "Muni" and nothing else. As far as the CFS goes it could be the Municipality of Toronto. A lot of the naming problems stem from the fact that the companies/municipalities running the airports don't let NavCan know about the changes. I assume you've seen the discussion over Pearson Airport. However, there are probably still multiple errors in the CFS. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 08:02, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with Canadian politics, but I'm wondering if you could look over the discussion on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGregory_Lauder-Frost_7f23.html" title="Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost">Talk:Gregory Lauder-Frost</a>.</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that a small number of people have been attempting to use Wikipedia for narrow partisan ends, writing glowing articles on figures from Britain's far-right. This is potentially a matter of some importance for Wikipedia's credibility.</p>

<p>RE: Dean Blundell</p>
<p>It's a very popular morning show in Toronto. It isn't nonsense and the article is accurate with sources. You being convinced hasn't got anything to do with it. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh I agree but it is also broadcast worldwide via online, CFNY has about 10% of their listeners that are not from the GTA and is something like the 3rd most station listened to worldwide (not sure on latest ranking but at one time it was number one). Plus if you have articles for local television programs like Breakfast Telivision, why not the Dean Blundell Show.</p>

<p><i>Re your recent suffixing (sufficing?) of -FMs and -TVs:</i> I agree with it (and probably would have done so eventually myself) but there is one trivial matter. Most (but not all) CBC TV stations <i>do not</i> use the -TV suffix. (But all FMs <i>do</i> have -FM.) I don't know if you have any database software available but the Industry Canada database files <a href="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/insp_dgse-ps_dggs.nsf/en/gg00026e.html" class="external text" title="http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/insp_dgse-ps_dggs.nsf/en/gg00026e.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and most CRTC decisions pertaining to the stations, i.e. <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/eng/Decisions/2000/DB2000-1.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/eng/Decisions/2000/DB2000-1.HTM" rel="nofollow">here</a> (except for CBNT which appears to be incorrectly suffixed in that decision), indicate the correct call signs.</p>
<p>I'm likely as clueless as you are as to why; I've been trying to find out myself and can only assume that the CBC is able to make up its own rules for CB* call signs (hence other quirks like five-letter call signs).

<dd>Re your comments: I realize a WikiProject is not policy but it seemed to indicate that, in this case, the official name was preferred (i.e. Use <a href="../../../w/y/b/WYBE_ff60.html" title="WYBE">WYBE</a> and use <a href="../../../w/n/e/WNEP-TV_8b18.html" title="WNEP-TV">WNEP-TV</a>, even if both are TV stations with unduplicated calls). After a <a href="../../../t/h/o/Talk%7EThomson_Corporation_4a66.html" title="Talk:Thomson Corporation">prior debacle</a> I came to the conclusion that the consensus was to use the shortest assumed-unique name possible, i.e. CFTO not CFTO-TV, IBM not International Business..., etc. So I disagree but I'm sufficiently confused at the moment that I'll leave them as-is for now.

<p>I noticed your edits on the OHL team alumni categories, and you said that it isn't the way to do it to put subcategories of other teams on that page. Where I'm coming from that these teams are the other forms that that individual team has taken. I cannot provide a link to the old teams on the category pages because most of them do not have a link. So for example, if someone is looking at the Guelph Storm category page, they used to be the Toronto Marlboros, how else I am supposed to let the viewer know that? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroat_Canuck_c04a.html" title="User:Croat Canuck">Croat Canuck</a> 22:33, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there...just a couple of comments about some recent categorization you've done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikipedia actually has a pretty explicit rule against filing articles in categories and subcategories of the first category at the same time; what this means is that if an article is already filed in <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_media_4334.html" title="Category:LGBT media">Category:LGBT media</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETransgender_and_transsexual_people_956b.html" title="Category:Transgender and transsexual people">Category:Transgender and transsexual people</a>, then it <i>can't</i> also be filed in the general <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a>.</li>
<li>Pipetext after the category name is actually a <i>filing</i> scheme; you should only use a pipe followed by a space when you're applying the category to the absolute topmost defines-what-the-category-is article. So for <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_c60a.html" title="Category:LGBT">Category:LGBT</a>, the only article that should have [[:Category:LGBT| ]] on it is <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> itself. Everything else should have either the category name with no pipetext at all if the appropriate filing letter is the first letter of the article title, or pipetext that defines how the article should be sorted alphabetically (e.g. [[:Category:Transgender and transsexual people|Araujo, Gwen]] or [[:Category:LGBT media|Body Politic, The]]) if the appropriate filing letter <i>isn't</i> the first letter of the article title.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps a bit... <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:14, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>What kind of ocracy would she think was best?</p>

<dd>Well, for one thing, she was rather anti-authoritarian, so I think the most honest answer to that question would be <i>no "ocracy" (whatever the hell that is) whatsoever</i>. But I do think it interesting how to certain people, a woman who has issues with men is suddenly a symptom of a dangerous social phenomenon, whereas a man who hates women is just a man who hates women. Funny, that.</dd>

I put one on the article, and another user removed it. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdenn_c058.html" title="User:Ardenn">Ardenn</a> 23:16, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a little bit of extra information about TVOntario, but it isn't much.</p>
<p>For a time, a special service was launched and carried at least in various parts of the country. It was called Galaxie (and it's not the same Galaxie that provides all-music channels on digital cable and satellite). From what I was able to read from various sources, it was launched in 1979 and it broadcast various programs that normally aired on TVO at the time, such as "Polka Dot Door" and "Today's Special" just to name a few. The broadcasting hours were usually in the morning and afternoon of the day.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of links to TV listings from the St. John's area from August 1984...</p>
<p>August 4, 1984: <a href="http://www.radio-info.com/mods/board.php?Post=545721&amp;Board=tv-classic" class="external free" title="http://www.radio-info.com/mods/board.php?Post=545721&amp;Board=tv-classic" rel="nofollow">http://www.radio-info.com/mods/board.php?Post=545721&amp;Board=tv-classic</a></p>
<p>August 8, 1984: <a href="http://www.radio-info.com/mods/board.php?Post=545610&amp;Board=tv-classic" class="external free" title="http://www.radio-info.com/mods/board.php?Post=545610&amp;Board=tv-classic" rel="nofollow">http://www.radio-info.com/mods/board.php?Post=545610&amp;Board=tv-classic</a></p>
<p>I don't know exactly when it ended, but it might have been around the period when YTV began broadcasting (or sometime before then).</p>
<p>Oh, and I forgot to add: Galaxie was a coalition between TVO and Rogers Cable.</p>
<p>And there are a few links that you can view with some mentions of TVO and Galaxie...</p>
