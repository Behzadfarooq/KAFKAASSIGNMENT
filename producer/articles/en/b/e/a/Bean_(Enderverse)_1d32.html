<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Bean_%28Enderverse%29_1d32.html" title="Edit section: Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Ender's Game</i> and <i>Ender's Shadow</i></span></h2>
<p>Bean was born in <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> as the result of an illegal experiment in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_engineering.html" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a> conducted by a scientist named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Ender%27s_Game_series_12bf.html#Volescu" title="List of minor characters in the Ender's Game series">Volescu</a>. In the experiment, Volescu turned "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton%27s_Key_bad3.html" title="Anton's Key">Anton's Key</a>," which allows for nearly unlimited intelligence, but in turn prevents his physical growth from stopping. Bean's parents, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Grecians</a> Julian and Elena Delphiki, had conceived one child (<a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolai_Delphiki_95a0.html" title="Nikolai Delphiki">Nikolai Delphiki</a>), through <a href="../../../i/n/-/In-vitro_fertilization.html" title="In-vitro fertilization">in-vitro fertilization</a>. The other embryos were stolen by Julian Sr.'s half brother Volescu, who turned Anton's Key in some or all of the 23 stolen embryos. When Bean was only about a year old, the government found out and Volescu "discarded" all of the babies except Bean, who escaped by crawling into a <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet.html" title="Toilet">toilet</a> tank and hiding there for days before being rescued by a <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janitor.html" title="Janitor">janitor</a>. After a short time living with the janitor, Bean wandered out onto the streets of Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Around the age of four, Bean joins <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Ender%27s_Game_series_12bf.html#Poke" title="List of minor characters in the Ender's Game series">Poke</a>'s Crew. This crew is a group of homeless children living on the streets of Rotterdam. Bean demonstrates his intelligence and worth to Poke, who in turn feeds him and thus saves his life. His meal is a few peanuts, and he acquires his lifelong nickname by Poke saying that 'he wasn't worth a bean'. Bean devises a plan to get more food for the crew by recruiting a bully to get them into the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soup_kitchen.html" title="Soup kitchen">soup kitchen</a>. Poke chooses <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achilles_de_Flandres_02e2.html" title="Achilles de Flandres">Achilles</a>,(pronounced Ah-sh-eel) who is the one of the lowest individuals in the bully hierarchy due to his clubfoot. Bean does not think Achilles is a good choice, and actually advises Poke to kill Achilles. She shows Achilles the same mercy she showed Bean, however, and spares Achilles' life. Achilles became the crew's "papa" and carries out the plan successfully, allowing all of the orphans to get food. When Achilles begins contemplating killing Bean, however, Poke intervenes, and meets with Achilles at night to make a deal with him (although Achilles, of course, has a different view of the events and of Bean). Bean witnesses this and follows them for a while, but he sees the two kissing. Thinking that he was wrong, he starts to walk home. When he realizes his mistake he turns back to try to save her. When he gets there, Achilles is gone, but he sees Poke's body floating in the river. This causes Bean incredible guilt, and losing those to whom he owes a lot becomes a theme that runs throughout the book and its sequels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bean and Achilles are noticed by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Ender%27s_Game_series_12bf.html#Sister_Carlotta" title="List of minor characters in the Ender's Game series">Sister Carlotta</a>, a nun who recruits children for the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Fleet_8bd2.html" title="International Fleet">International Fleet</a>'s (IF) <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_School_8109.html" title="Battle School">Battle School</a>. Sister Carlotta discovers that Bean was actually the mastermind behind the plan to create civilization among the street urchins, and also that Bean and Achilles cannot both be sent to Battle School lest one should kill the other. She gets Bean into Battle School and hides Achilles in a school on Earth in hopes that the IF will not find him and decide to send him to Battle School. Although Bean's test scores and intelligence far exceed those of any other Battle School student—including <a href="../../../e/n/d/Ender_Wiggin_d18f.html" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender Wiggin</a>'s—Bean is both the smallest and youngest child in the school. He keeps to himself, but shows an intense interest in Ender, the school's most successful and well-known student, because everyone is comparing Bean to Ender. He does his best to hide his obsession with Wiggin, however. The first friend Bean makes in the school is another boy in his launch group, Nikolai Delphiki.</p>
<p>The first person Bean meets outside of his own launch group is <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petra_Arkanian_55d7.html" title="Petra Arkanian">Petra Arkanian</a>, a friend of Ender Wiggin. During his stay at Battle School, Bean explores the school and eavesdrops on teachers by crawling through the ventilation system. After a few months, Colonel Graff recruits Bean to create an army from scratch for Ender; this becomes Dragon Army. Ender is rather mean to Bean at first, but a partnership emerges between the two geniuses. While Bean has greater intelligence (Ender is the only student to approach Bean's intellectual level), Ender has the ability to lead and to inspire personal loyalty among his fellow students. After the initial small fights, Ender uses Bean's intellect by assigning him an "<a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hoc.html" title="Ad hoc">ad hoc</a>" <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toon_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Toon (disambiguation)">toon</a> to come up with crazy stunts, flashy strategies that might come in handy in the battleroom as the teachers keep changing the rules to be biased against Ender's army. After Ender kills <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Battle_School_students_86b2.html#Bonzo_Madrid" title="List of Battle School students">Bonzo</a>, Ender effectively quits the game and relies on Bean to plan and execute his final Battle School battle, which is against two armies at once. Dragon Army wins when Bean's toon goes through the enemy's gate early in the battle, although with very few of the enemy frozen and very few of Dragon Army <i>not</i> frozen. After the battle, the teachers make a rule that all enemy soldiers must be frozen or disabled before an army can go for their gate.</p>
<p>Later that day, Ender (along with many of the other commanders) is graduated, and Dragon army is dissolved. Bean is put in command of Rabbit Army. There is a brand new student put in Rabbit Army, Achilles. Bean knows that Achilles will eventually try to kill him, so Bean comes up with a plan to get him sent back to Earth. He tells Achilles that the reason Ender was so good was that he spied on the teachers and other armies with him and knew all of their plans. With the help of a small group of other soldiers, Bean has Achilles trapped in the air intake system, hanging by some deadline. They record Achilles' confession of the series of murders he committed. Achilles is immediately sent back to Earth, and eventually to a mental hospital. After a short time, Bean has his first battle. He loses all of his five battles, as he is more interested in training his soldiers and learning from the other commanders than winning.</p>
<p>Bean is picked for Ender's "jeesh" (a term coined by Card meaning a group) and sent to Tactical School to train for the Third Invasion. Bean is the second choice for commander in case Ender could not do it. In Tactical School, Bean and the rest of the jeesh study the ships that are being used for the invasion. They are older models, since the ships that will be used were launched soon after the Second Invasion. The group is soon sent to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command_School_6a11.html" title="Command School">Command School</a>, to train with simulators of the final battles. During this time, Bean is used as the commander. The other children resent him at first for it, but later find great respect. When Bean's simulator breaks down, the technician tells Bean that they did not bother programming in a time lag. Bean then realizes that the lack of a light speed lag in the simulations is intentional, meaning that the IF has the technology to send communications faster than the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_of_light.html" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>. He realizes that at any time, the games that they are playing can become real battles in the Third Invasion without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Ender later arrives, and Bean plays the pivotal role of watching the flow of the battle and essentially being a second pair of eyes and ears for Ender. As the battles wear on and Ender tires, Bean begins to take a bigger role, translating unclear instructions. Bean is given the opportunity to take control of Ender's position as commander at any time. Some of the jeesh, such as Crazy Tom, also run their battle plans through Bean. In the final battle, neither Ender nor Bean can see any way to win; Bean remarks, "The enemy's gate is down," an instruction Ender had given to his army back in Battle School. This sparks an idea in Ender's mind, and he gives orders for a suicide run in order to launch their ultimate weapon, nicknamed "Dr. Device" or "Little Doctor", against the planet. More and more of the ships are shot down, and, because of the atmosphere, they are breaking apart. Bean tells his last ship to set off the Little Doctor inside his ship, and the planet is destroyed.</p>
<p>After the battle, Colonel Graff asks Bean why he didn't take control from Ender. Bean responds by saying simply that he couldn't think of anything and he just hoped that Ender could.</p>
<p>Once the jeesh wipes out the Buggers, there is an attempted <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russian</a> takeover. A few days later, the children, except for Ender, return to Earth. Bean is introduced to his biological parents, whom Sister Carlotta had found, and learns that Colonel Graff had been telling the truth after all when he'd said that Nikolai was Bean's brother and that Bean's would be given the name Julian Delphiki.</p>

<p>Bean's tranquil life with the Delphikis is short-lived. While the family is on vacation, Achilles, who, since the events of <i>Ender's Shadow</i>, has used his considerable intellect to gain influence and power in Russia and other empire-minded countries, tries to kill them outright. Bean and the Delphikis separate; Bean goes into hiding with Sister Carlotta, and the Delphiki family disappears with the help of Graff. Bean later learns that Achilles has captured all of Ender's jeesh except for Bean (whom he tried to kill) and Ender (who is gone). Bean later allies himself with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Wiggin_aaf3.html" title="Peter Wiggin">Peter Wiggin</a> to combat this threat. Bean is most concerned for Petra's welfare, and finds a coded message that leads to the release of all of Ender's jeesh except for her.</p>
<p>Bean moves to Thailand, where he helps train a strike force under <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Battle_School_students_86b2.html#Suriyawong" title="List of Battle School students">Suriyawong</a> (a member of Ender's Dragon Army). Another assassination attempt on him (and Suriyawong) leads Bean to request Sister Carlotta's presence. Achilles, however, blows up the plane in which she is traveling. Near the end of the novel, Bean engineers a rescue mission in which he successfully, and without casualties on either side, rescues Petra from Achilles. A following scene at Sister Carlotta's <a href="../../../c/e/n/Cenotaph.html" title="Cenotaph">cenotaph</a> foreshadows Bean and Petra's future romance. Finally, Peter Wiggin, newly-elected <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegemony.html#Hegemony_in_fiction" title="Hegemony">Hegemon</a>, bestows the office of <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategos.html#Fictional_uses" title="Strategos">Strategos</a> on Bean. Peter relocates the main Hegemony offices to <a href="../../../r/i/b/Ribeir%C3%A3o_Preto_ae70.html" title="Ribeirão Preto">Ribeirão Preto</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, where Bean and his family are reunited.</p>

<p>Bean leaves Peter the Hegemon's employ due to Peter's liberation of Achilles, and goes into hiding with Petra Arkanian to avoid Achilles and the threat that he presents. Bean does not want to get married because he does not want to pass his genetic defect on to his posterity, but Petra convinces him to marry her by taking him to talk to Anton, the man who discovered Anton's key. They go to see <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volescu.html" title="Volescu">Volescu</a>, who can supposedly perform tests to identify <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryo.html" title="Embryo">embryos</a> with Anton's key turned and those without it. Bean and Petra have nine embryos created via in-vitro fertilization, and Volescu pretends to identify and destroy three embryos with Anton's key. One embryo is implanted in Petra. As Petra and Bean leave the hospital in separate taxis, Bean is subject to an assassination attempt from Achilles, but is rescued by men presumably sent by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ender%27s_jeesh_be57.html#Alai" title="List of Ender's jeesh">Alai</a>, the new <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a> of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> world. Bean learns from these men that Volescu was working for Achilles all along, and has stolen the remaining embryos. Bean and Petra go into hiding with Alai, working to find their lost embryos, as well as helping Alai with his plans to liberate <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> from <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> control. Achilles, who has not lost his desire to kill Bean, lures Bean back to the Hegemony compound, which he has taken over, with the prospect of obtaining the missing embryos. Bean goes and confirms his suspicion that Achilles does not have the embryos, suspecting that the embryos have already been implanted in other women. He shoots Achilles and is later reunited with his wife, Petra.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Bean_%28Enderverse%29_1d32.html" title="Edit section: Shadow of the Giant">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Shadow of the Giant</i></span></h2>
<p>In this novel, Bean is around sixteen years old (the age is unknown because Volescu destroyed all of his records). Anton's Key has caused his body to undergo rapidly accelerated growth; he is becoming a giant, and is nicknamed the <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">African</a> Giant by the <a href="../../../r/w/a/Rwanda.html" title="Rwanda">Rwandans</a>, due to his noticeably African features. Bean's time on Earth is very limited; there is simply not enough time to find a cure in the time left to him.</p>
<p>As commander, Bean plays a pivotal role in helping Peter unite the world under the Hegemony. Peter creates the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_People_of_Earth_ba32.html" title="Free People of Earth">Free People of Earth</a> (FPE) organization. To join, the people of countries must vote to ratify the FPE <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitution</a> as their own. Once part of the FPE, a country is protected by FPE military forces. Rwanda is one of the earliest countries to agree to join FPE. However, Felix Starman, the head of Rwanda, requests that Giant Julian lead the Rwandan army. Aside from Bean being the greatest military mind in human history, having a commander with some African heritage and features would play to the patriotic side of the Rwandan soldiers. Bean turns the Rwandan army into an irresistible force. The effectiveness of his leadership initially frightens many countries into holding <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plebiscite.html" title="Plebiscite">plebiscites</a> to discuss joining FPE rather than getting defeated by an army Bean commands.</p>
<p>From the advice of the Minister of Colonization <a href="../../../h/y/r/Hyrum_Graff_8867.html" title="Hyrum Graff">Graff</a>, Bean follows in <a href="../../../e/n/d/Ender.html" title="Ender">Ender</a>'s footsteps to live at relativistic light-speed along with three of his children who share his disorder, in the hope that a cure can be found for the condition, while Petra and Bean's five 'normal' children remain on Earth. It is revealed that a ninth child of Bean's, who also has Anton's Key, was birthed by and is under the care of a woman named Randi, who plans to take the child with her to a colony world and raise him as Achilles' heir. By the end of the novel decades later, there is no cure, and it is unknown how Bean lives the remainder of his life, nor is the fate of Bean's ninth child revealed.</p>
