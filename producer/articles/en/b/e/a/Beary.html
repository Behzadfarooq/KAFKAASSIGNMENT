<p>The <b>Beary (also known as Byari)</b> (<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a>: ಬ್ಯಾರಿ) is a small, vibrant <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> community concentrated mostly in coastal South Kanara (<a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakshina_Kannada_1f33.html" title="Dakshina Kannada">Dakshina Kannada</a>) district of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> state in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, having its own unique traditions, and distinct cultural identity.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beary.html" title="Edit section: Etymology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word 'Beary' is said to be derived from the <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulu.html" title="Tulu">Tulu</a> word 'Byara' which means business. Thus Beary stands for businessman. Moreover, this community had adopted business as prime occupation for livelihood. <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beedi.html" title="Beedi">Beedi</a> industry, fishing industry, cattle, grocery and teashops were some the fields Beary men occupied with. Since the major portion of this community people were involved in business activities, the local <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulu.html" title="Tulu">Tulu</a> speaking majority called them as Beary or Byari<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Another popular theory is that the word Beary comes from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> word Bahar (Arabic: بحر). Bahar means ocean and Bahri (Arabic: بحري) means sailor or seaman. It is said that Beary community had trade relations with Arab businessmen traveling to coastal <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a>, especially the coastline of Malabar.</p>
<p>Third theory says that the word Beary is derived from the root word Malabar. The great Islamic <a href="../../../d/a/27/Da%27ee.html" title="Da'ee">Da'ee</a>, Malik bin Dinar had arrived in the coast of Malabar during 6th century A.D.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beary.html" title="Edit section: Geographic distribution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Geographic distribution</span></h2>
<p>The Bearys constitute around 80 per cent of the Dakshina Kannada Muslims, others are scattered in the neighboring districts of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chikmagalur.html" title="Chikmagalur">Chikmagalur</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shimoga.html" title="Shimoga">Shimoga</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hassan.html" title="Hassan">Hassan</a> and <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttara_Kannada_ca5b.html" title="Uttara Kannada">Uttara Kannada</a>. <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goa.html" title="Goa">Goa</a> also have a considerable Beary population.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beary.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Beary community has a history of at least 1,200 years with an ethnic identity and its own dialect called Beary Baase or Nakknikk.</p>
<p>Bearys refer to the area south of Mangalore as Mykal or Mykala which is in fact their culture capital. According to historian B A Salettur, Mykal was an area in the southern part of Mangalore. It got its name through the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadri_Manjunath_Temple_1f97.html" title="Kadri Manjunath Temple">Kadri Manjunath Temple</a>, which earlier was a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> temple. The Buddhist goddess Tara Bhagavathi was also known as <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayadevi.html" title="Mayadevi">Mayadevi</a>. In course of time it came to be called <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikala.html" title="Mikala">Mikala</a>, which later became Mykal.</p>
<p>The origin of the Beary community is still not much known; history reveals that there were many rich traders, from the Coastal belt dealing with the traders of the Middle East countries through the Arabian Sea. Following the advent of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> in the early stage, it is said Arab Muslim traders attracted the people to Islam by their well behavior in their contact, honesty in trade, discipline in dealings and peaceful religious and pious life within the doctrines of Islam, and also by performing <a href="../../../d/a/27/Da%27wah.html" title="Da'wah">Da'wah</a>.</p>
<p>First Muslim missionaries to Mangalore can be traced to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malik_Bin_Deenar_6552.html" title="Malik Bin Deenar">Malik Bin Deenar</a>, an Arab trader said to be the kith and kin of <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> (companions of Prophet <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> (<a href="../../../p/b/u/PBUH_9bce.html" title="PBUH">PBUH</a>)). He is said to have visited <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malabar.html" title="Malabar">Malabar</a> and landed near <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manjeshwar.html" title="Manjeshwar">Manjeshwar</a> in Malabar. He constructed the first <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosque</a> in Manjeshwar, the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malik_Dinar_Mosque_baa7.html" title="Malik Dinar Mosque">Malik Dinar Mosque</a> (where his shrine is still present). Also the Masjid Zeenath Baksh (Jumma Masjid), Bunder, Mangalore is said to have been established in Mangalore by Malik Bin Deenar in 644 A.D. and the first <a href="../../../q/a/d/Qadhi.html" title="Qadhi">Qadhi</a> (Qazi) appointed was Hazarath Moosa Bin Malik, son of Malik Bin Abdullah. This Mosque was inaugurated on Friday the 22nd of the month of Jumadil Avval (fifth month of Islamic Calander) in 22 of <a href="../../../h/i/j/Hijri.html" title="Hijri">Hijri</a> (644A.D.).</p>
<p>There are several documents available which prove that at least 90 years prior to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_bin_Qasim_417d.html" title="Muhammad bin Qasim">Muhammad bin Qasim</a>`s invasion of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_India_acc8.html" title="North India">North India</a>, Arab Muslim businessmen were thriving in the south. This proves Islam was prevalent in South India much before Muslim invaders came to North India. These facts are available in a research document Mykal, written by Ahmed Noori, who conducted a research on the Beary community way back in 1960.</p>
<p>Noori disputes the claim that the first Muslims came to India along with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alauddin_Khilji_da58.html" title="Alauddin Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a> between 1296-1316 AD and points out that according to renowned historian, H.M. Elliot, (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_of_India_as_told_by_its_own_Historians_e066.html" title="The History of India as told by its own Historians">The History of India as told by its own Historians</a>, Part I) the first ship bearing Muslim travelers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 AD. According to H.G. Rawlinson, the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century AD. Barthlomew also has similar things to say about the early Muslim settlers in India. J. Sturrock in his South Kanara and Madras Districts Manuals, says that Parsi and Arab businessmen settled in different places of the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malabar_coast.html" title="Malabar coast">Malabar coast</a> during the 7th century. Ahmed Noori has quoted these and other sources to validate his argument that the Muslim settlers came to India much before the invaders came to North India.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beary.html" title="Edit section: Participation in the freedom struggle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Participation in the freedom struggle</span></h2>
<p>The Bearys of the coast actively participated in the Indian freedom struggle against Portugal and British colonialism. There were a number of Beary men in the army of <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chowta.html" title="Chowta">Chowta</a> dynasty queen, Rani <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbakka.html" title="Abbakka">Abbakka</a> (Kannada: ರಾಣಿ ಅಬ್ಬಕ್ಕ) of <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moodabidri.html" title="Moodabidri">Moodabidri</a>. The Bearys had also joined the army of Nawab Hyder Ali and <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipu_Sultan_c2f4.html" title="Tipu Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> of <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysore.html" title="Mysore">Mysore</a>. Historians and researchers have enlisted famous Beary personalities who participated in the freedom struggle of India. Many such freedom fighters were imprisoned by British and few died during imprisonment.</p>
<p>One of the descendants of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malik_Bin_Deenar_6552.html" title="Malik Bin Deenar">Malik Bin Deenar</a>, Zainuddin Makhdum II had compiled a book <i>Tuhfah al Mujahideen</i> in Arabic language motivating the Muslims of coastal Malabar to fight the enemies. The Bearys seem to have largely motivated by such work and actively participated in the freedom struggle against Portugal and British rule.</p>

<p>The Bearys of the coast have produced rich literary work using both Beary dialect and Kannada language. The literature comprises Beary poetry, research articles on Bearys, historical analysis of Dakshina Kannada Muslims, essays, stories and other fields of literature. "English-Kannada-Beary" dictionary is also available in the market produced by Dr. A. Wahhab Doddamane. A number of notable Beary literary persons have contributed to enrich the Beary literature. Dr. Susheela P. Upadhyaya, an eminent scholar has made a comprehenive study in finding the roots of beary literature. Dr. A. Wahhab Doddamane has produced a book viz. The Muslims of Dakshina Kannada, which is a useful documentary work.</p>
<p>The Bearys have also produced a number of magazines and periodicals from Mangalore and other cities of the district. Some periodicals have became very popular and a few of them have become a part of Beary history.</p>

<p>The Beary folk songs were rendered during marriage parties and at the time of births and other auspicious occasions. Songs bore resemblance to Moplah Patts (<a href="../../../m/a/p/Mappila_Songs_c651.html" title="Mappila Songs">Mappila Songs</a>). Unfortunately modern day Bearys are illiterate of the folk songs sang by their ancestors. Several Beary folk games have also vanished.</p>
<p>One of the famous folk songs sung by beary women during marriage occasions is "appa chudu chudu patima". Elderly ladies of the neighborhood gather around the bride on the day of mangila (wedding day) to sing those melodious songs. First few lines are:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beary.html" title="Edit section: Culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
<p>The Bearys have a distinct culture difference from other Muslim communities. The marriage customs of the Bearys seem to be a mix of the Tulu and Moplah customs along with some distinct customs of their own. Bearys do not follow the matrilineal tradition, unlike the Moplahs. Curiously, the Bearys until recently followed a custom known as the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotra.html" title="Gotra">Gotra</a> or illam, which resembles the <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunt.html" title="Bunt">Bunt</a> bali custom. Though Islam is basically patriarchal, illam, influenced by the Tulu culture, has matriarchal tendencies. Marriage between people belonging to the same illam (comparable to the gotra) was not encouraged. People identified with an illam were known as talakkar. And people of low castes who converted to Islam were identified as tala illatavaru.</p>
<p>The marriage of the Bearys is considered to be a pointer to their prosperity. Marriage celebration is normally spread over 3 days starting with Moilanji (<a href="../../../h/e/n/Henna.html" title="Henna">henna</a> tattooing) at the brides house a day before the marriage (close relatives and friends are invited) and an Islamic style <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikah.html" title="Nikah">Nikah</a> known as <i>Kayeen</i> is performed at the groom’s place on the day of the marriage. A garland exchange between Bride and groom is also part of Beary marriage which is an adoption from Tulu culture. The <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowry.html" title="Dowry">dowry</a> system is still quite prevalent among most Bearys.</p>
<p>Modern marriages of most of the families are arranged in community halls with large number of invitees including relatives and community members.</p>

<p>Although this community is backward in modern education, still has successfully achieved 100% literacy rate in the area. All the Beary children are sent to Madrasah (Arabic: مدرسة) which is managed and run by the community that imparts religious education. All such Madrasahs are affiliated to <i>Samastha Board</i> which conducts well organized public examination for 5th, 7th and 10 grade students. Visiting inspectors called <i>Mufattish</i> are appointed to inspect the quality of education in Madrasahs. For administrative purposes divisions have been made as range, area, taluq and district. The teachers are qualified in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a> and religious education are known as <i>Mu’allim</i> and students as <i>Muta’allim</i>. The Madrasas do use a centralized syllabus prepared by the <i>Samstha Board</i> and media of instruction is now shifted to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> from traditional <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> based <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam.html" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> called Arabi-Malayalam – a special language that uses Arabic script and Malayalam phonetics. <i>Mundu</i>, <i>Chatte</i> and <i>Toppi</i> is the preferred uniform for boys in Madrasas. Girls do wear a long gown with a head-dress known as <i>yalasara</i>.</p>
<p>Apart from <i>Samstha Board</i> many other education institutions have also sufaced. <i>Salafi</i> group has established their own Madrasahs through out <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakshina_Kannada_1f33.html" title="Dakshina Kannada">Dakshina Kannada</a>. <i>Salafis</i> also have started separate religious schools exclusively for girls in Ullal. <i>Jamat-e-Islami</i> is now running an exclusive college for girls in <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deralakatte.html" title="Deralakatte">Deralakatte</a> province. There are several other schools managed by Bearys which is aimed at providing both modern and religious education to the children.</p>

<p>The Beary attire is different from that of other south Indian community. Men wear a traditional white muslin turban and a Rani-mark belt (wide, green in colour) at the waist, with long full sleeve white shirts (known as <i>Chatte</i>) and bleached <a href="../../../m/u/n/Mundu.html" title="Mundu">mundu</a>. Today due to a cultural shift young Bearys have adopted shirt-trouser pattern.</p>
<p>Beary women are traditionally claded in three pieces of clothes, viz, <i>tuni</i>, <i>kuppaya</i> and <i>yalasara</i>. While going out the Beary women took a long rectangle blanket, known as <i>valli</i>, a sort of veil to cover entire body. If two women wants to go out together they would use a <i>joduvalli</i> (double veil). Today, different varieties of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burqa.html" title="Burqa">burqa</a> or <a href="../../../a/b/a/Abaya.html" title="Abaya">Abaya</a> have replaced the traditional <i>valli</i>.</p>

<p>The beary women has excessive love for ornaments and uses it on every possible occasion such as <i>Mangila</i>, <i>Sunnat Mangila</i>, <i>Appate Mangila</i>, <i>Birnd</i>, <i>Moilanji</i> and other social gatherings. There were different types of ornaments used by beary community in past which is at the verge of vanishing today due to the cultural invasion and urbanization. These ornaments are made out of mainly gold and sliver and used for the ornamentation of head, ears, neck, waist, wrist, fingers and feet. Beary research scholars are of the opinion that Beary ornaments were largely influenced by Jain ornament patterns. The ornament storage box used by Bearys was made out of brass and other metals was also used by Jain community and was called <i>Kharjana</i> by both Bearys and Jains <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beary.html" title="Edit section: Cuisine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cuisine</span></h2>
<p>Beary cuisine is highly influenced by the South Indian Cuisine. Just like Mangalorean cuisine it uses a lot of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coconut.html" title="Coconut">coconut</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curry_leaves.html" title="Curry leaves">curry leaves</a>, ginger, chilli and spices like pepper and cardamom. Beary cuisine boasts of a special kind of <a href="../../../b/i/r/Biryani.html" title="Biryani">biryani</a>, which is very different from the other types made elsewhere. Rice preparations, both fresh and dry fish, meat and eggs enjoy top place in baery daily menu.</p>
<p>A few traditional dishes very popular amongst all the Mangalorean communities have unique names in Beary dialect. <i>Pindi, pinde-basale, kunhi-pinde, bisali-appa, tondare-appa, guli-appa, syame, muttere-appa, pattir, poo-pole, pulche-pole, vodu-pole, uppu-molavu, kanhi, methe-kanhi, nei-kanhi, chekkere-appa</i> etc. are to name a few.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beary.html" title="Edit section: Economic situation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Economic situation</span></h2>
<p>The Bearys, who once enjoyed a high social status, slowly lost their position during the British and Portuguese rule. Their opposition to the English resulted in them being denied English education, which in course of time turned them into a socially backward community.</p>
<p>Today, hardly 5% of the community is engaged in trading and business, thanks to the modern education community offlate have been seeing professionally qualified members. Some Bearys are involved in the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beedi.html" title="Beedi">beedi</a> industry and fishery, and a majority are farm laborers. A few Bearys have progressed even further in the past few years and have achieved tremendous development in the field of Education, Business &amp; Politics. Bearys today own many Educational Institutions. Professional Colleges in Mangalore are mostly owned or partnered by Bearys. Bearys have also achieved high positions in Karnataka Politics and few have also attained positions in the Central Government. In spite of these achievements, majority of the people of the community are still economically backward. The recent job opportunities in Persian gulf countries have improved the standard of living to some extent. However, Bearys in rural areas are still extremely backward socially, economically and educationally.</p>
<p>Since Islam prohibits interest based financial dealings, Beary community is not seem to have taken benefits from interest based or conventional banking system. In the modern days they have embarked on establishing a small scale interest free banking systen namely Interest Free Loan and Welfare Soceity in Manngalore.</p>
