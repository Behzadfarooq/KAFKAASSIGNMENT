(On some merchandising items these were changed to shirts saying "Skull", and "Death Rock" due to trademark and licensing legalities.) Both Beavis and Butt-head constantly snicker with their own distinctive laughs. Their full names are never mentioned on the show.</p>

The designated "leader" of the duo, he derives pleasure from being regularly abusive to Beavis.

He drives a primer patched green <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Duster_7da4.html" title="Plymouth Duster">Plymouth Duster</a>, often onto lawns, through garbage cans and over Beavis and Butt-head's bikes.

<p>The series has a number of recurring elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>They cause havoc at their place of employment, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_World_a5b4.html" title="Burger World">Burger World</a>. Beavis and Butt-head spend little time working, and when they try to work, they are often too incompetent to even take a customer's order. Their antics at work include frying things other than food (such as <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthworm.html" title="Earthworm">earthworms</a>, dead <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouse.html" title="Mouse">mice</a>, the store's <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">electronic</a> devices, and their own fingers); attempting to cause "accidents" to collect <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worker%27s_compensation.html" title="Worker's compensation">worker's compensation</a>; <a href="../../../h/e/c/Heckling.html" title="Heckling">heckling</a> customers via the <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drive-through.html" title="Drive-through">drive-thru</a> speaker; and hurling food at the store's <a href="../../../c/e/i/Ceiling_fan.html" title="Ceiling fan">ceiling fans</a>. The boys have also unintentionally had brief stints as <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary.html" title="Secretary">secretaries</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telemarketing.html" title="Telemarketing">telemarketers</a>.</li>
<li>They cause trouble at school. They are usually pitted against their teachers and other school officials. Principal McVicker is visibly agitated by the duo's antics. At the end of the final episode, Beavis and Butt-head's antics exasperate McVicker to the point where he suffers a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. It is unknown if he died or not.</li>
<li>One of their most prominent goals in life is to "score" (have <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sex</a>) with chicks. Throughout the series neither of them meets with any success. They occasionally spend Friday nights at the local Maxi-Mart, attempting to <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flirting.html" title="Flirting">flirt</a> with any female they encounter, until the manager runs them off. They have come close on a few occasions, though they are too stupid to take advantage of the situation. They often completely misinterpret the signals or advances of women, and seem unable to distinguish between a woman who genuinely expresses interest and those who find them irritating.</li>
<li>Beavis transforms into his <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alter_ego.html" title="Alter ego">alter ego</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornholio.html" title="Cornholio">Great Cornholio</a>. His transformation is indicated by pulling the back of his T-shirt over the top of his head, holding both arms up, pacing back and forth, and proclaiming largely nonsensical utterances in an exaggerated Spanish-sounding accent, such as "I am the Great Cornholio!", "I need TP for my bunghole!" and, "Are you threatening me?" This transformation is caused by Beavis's rapid consumption of a large amount of <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a>, or other stimulants. In one episode, the duo wanders into a <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemianism.html" title="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> coffee house, where an open-mic poetry slam is in session. Beavis takes a turn at the mic after ingesting a large amount of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cappuccino.html" title="Cappuccino">cappuccino</a>, and the audience hails his antics as performance art. In another episode he transforms into Cornholio while at Burger World, as an <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service_7331.html" title="Immigration and Naturalization Service">INS</a> official visits for a surprise inspection, searching for illegal aliens. Beavis' pseudo-Hispanic ramblings prompt the INS officer into thinking he is from Mexico, and Beavis is deported. Beavis also assumes the Cornholio persona for the climactic scenes of <i>Beavis and Butt-head Do America</i>.</li>
<li>They cause trouble for neighbor <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Anderson_%28Beavis_and_Butt-head%29_49ef.html" title="Mr. Anderson (Beavis and Butt-head)">Tom Anderson</a>. They have sold most of his possessions, destroyed his house, and even gotten him arrested by the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_Alcohol%2C_Tobacco%2C_Firearms_and_Explosives_e46a.html" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives">ATF</a>. Because his poor vision results in him being unable to consistently recognize them, he continues to hire the two for odd jobs.</li>
<li>They occasionally point out crude words in a sentence (intended or not), crude suggestions of more volatile expressions, or everyday words that have been given <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_entendre.html" title="Double entendre">sexual meaning</a>. For example, in <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-head_Do_America_9f28.html" title="Beavis and Butt-head Do America">Beavis and Butt-head Do America</a></i>, Mr. Van Driessen says the sentence "We don't need TV to entertain us", from which the boys deduced the word "anus". Or in Speech Therapy, Ms. Jenkins (the speech therapist) procured an image of a larynx (to which Butt-head noticed was similar to the <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">Female Reproductive Organ</a>), or the test sentences she recited; "Speaking slowly as such, can say just <i>as much</i>" ("ass-munch"), or Half-haste helps, <i>but whole</i>-haste hinders" ("Butt-hole"). Butt-head is usually the one who points these out.</li>
<li>In earlier episodes, they would sometimes try to find ways to obtain <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallucinogenic.html" title="Hallucinogenic">hallucinogenic</a> or mind-altering substances or engage in an activity that would simulate the effect. An example of this can be seen in the episode "<i>Sick</i>" where they attempt to obtain the leading prescription <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cough_syrup.html" title="Cough syrup">cough syrup</a> with the excuse of healing their ailment after seeing an advertisement that says it is nearly 70% alcohol. A rather dangerous example was in the episode "Stewart's House," in which they filled up his kitchen with natural gas and lit a match, thinking that it would make all the oxygen disappear and make them light-headed, but only resulted in an explosion. Other instances of this can be seen when they lick a <a href="../../../b/u/f/Bufotoxin.html" title="Bufotoxin">toad</a> ("No Laughing"), sniff <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint_thinner.html" title="Paint thinner">paint thinner</a> ("Home Improvement"), drink <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphine.html" title="Morphine">morphine</a> ("Bedpans &amp; Broomsticks") or getting inside a <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washing_machine.html" title="Washing machine">washing machine</a> during a cycle ("Washing the Dog"), all in an effort to get "<a href="../../../i/n/t/Intoxication.html" title="Intoxication">wasted</a>". This gag was dropped in later episodes, most likely to avoid controversy.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-head_99e4.html" title="Edit section: Locations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Locations</span></h3>
<p>There are several prime locations featured in the series. All these locations are located within the fictional town of Highland.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Living room</b>: Located at Butt-head's house, much of the action, and all of the video segments, take place or begin here, with the two sitting on the couch, watching TV.</li>
<li><b>Highland High School</b>: Based on a real Highland High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_World_a5b4.html" title="Burger World">Burger World</a></b>: The <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast-food_restaurant.html" title="Fast-food restaurant">fast-food restaurant</a> where Beavis and Butt-head assume grill and drive-through/front register duties. It is regularly damaged or completely demolished by the duo. Aside from the manager, Beavis and Butt-head are the only employees shown on the series. Burger World is an obvious satirical combination of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burger_King_5522.html" title="Burger King">Burger King</a> and <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald%27s_700d.html" title="McDonald's">McDonald's</a>, as its outdoor sign is an inverted "golden arches" which forms a "W", and the indoor logos are a "B" and a "W" sandwiched between two buns.</li>
<li><b>Tom Anderson's house</b>: Anderson's house, a typical middle-class suburban home, is continually <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalized</a> and wrecked by Beavis and Butt-head.</li>
<li><b>Maxi-Mart</b>: A <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convenience_store.html" title="Convenience store">convenience store</a>. In contradiction to the continuity of the series, it has been shown as being called <i>Qwik-Mart</i> in a few episodes.</li>
<li><b>Open field</b>: A grassy field, back dropped by a large <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_tower.html" title="Water tower">water tower</a>, where Beavis and Butt-head carry out destructive experiments, set things on <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>, or tip a <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow.html" title="Cow">cow</a>.</li>
<li><b>Mall</b>: A preferred loitering spot for the duo. It was seen as being called Turbo Mall 2000 and Highland Mall, and it also seemed to grow larger as the series progressed. It has been shown to contain a <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet.html" title="Pet">pet</a> store, a <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingerie.html" title="Lingerie">lingerie</a> store, a <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piercing.html" title="Piercing">piercing</a> parlor, and an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> recruiters' office.</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart%27s_House_8268.html" title="Stewart's House">Stewart's House</a></b>: Beavis and Butt-head occasionally visit Stewart's house. Their visits often entail damaging something in the house.</li>

<li>The MTV Thanksgiving Special "Beavis and Butt-head Do Thanksgiving" aired on November 27, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. The bit featured <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Loder_2946.html" title="Kurt Loder">Kurt Loder</a> as the show's host, half-reluctantly and half-resigned, trying to teach the two characters the meaning of Thanksgiving as they report live from the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macy%27s_Thanksgiving_Day_Parade_98cc.html" title="Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where they take more interest in people's butts and porn-shops than anything else.

<p><i>For a full list of musical artists on</i> Beavis and Butt-head<i>, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_musicians_appearing_on_Beavis_and_Butt-Head_3fd8.html" title="List of musicians appearing on Beavis and Butt-Head">List of musicians appearing on Beavis and Butt-Head</a>.</i></p>
<p>One of the most well-known aspects of the series was the inclusion of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_video.html" title="Music video">music videos</a>, which occurred between animated segments. The duo would watch and make humorous observations (about the band, a song's lyrics, and/or a video's visuals), or simply engage in nonsensical dialogue.</p>
<p>At times, the criticism reflected their young age and ignorance of music history. Upon seeing a video by <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sabbath_9b9c.html" title="Black Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, they decided that the band's vocalist couldn't be Ozzy Osbourne, because "Ozzy's an old fart!" (the video was recorded in the early 1970s, but the pair thinks it is new). Butt-head mistook their raw sound for <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge_music.html" title="Grunge music">grunge</a> and inquired if they were from <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>; Beavis replied "No, they're American", even though Seattle is located in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and Black Sabbath was from <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. Similarly, the pair described <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Simon_8aab.html" title="Paul Simon">Paul Simon</a> as "that old dude from Africa who used to be in the Beatles." However, at other times they seemed almost respectful and willing to learn about music. A <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> video was dismissed with the remark, "This sounds like <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk music</a>." "Yeah", came the reply, "but it gets cool later."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-head_99e4.html" title="Edit section: Negative critiques">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Negative critiques</span></h3>
<p>They showed a particular disdain for many generic 1980s <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_metal.html" title="Hair metal">hair bands</a> (with the exception of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Guns_N%27_Roses_f283.html" title="Guns N' Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, <a href="../../../m/%C3%B6/t/M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe_9fb0.html" title="Mötley Crüe">Mötley Crüe</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Halen_c7de.html" title="Van Halen">Van Halen</a> and to a lesser extent, <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>). Upon seeing a video by <a href="../../../d/e/f/Def_Leppard_7b45.html" title="Def Leppard">Def Leppard</a>, Butt-head remarks that "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_Tap_1486.html" title="Spinal Tap">Spinal Tap</a> really sucks lately". Their epitome of "wuss bands" was <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winger.html" title="Winger">Winger</a>, of which Stewart was a big fan. They had no tolerance for <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_wave_music.html" title="New wave music">new wave</a> or <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">electronic music</a> (except for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_music.html" title="Industrial music">industrial music</a>). They also hated most <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a> such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibal_Corpse_89da.html" title="Cannibal Corpse">Cannibal Corpse</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_%28band%29.html" title="Death (band)">Death</a>, the former of which Butt-head mocked their singing style.</p>
<p>Beavis and Butt-head had especially severe reactions when confronted with videos they found particularly awful. As soon as Butt-head realized he was watching a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Bolton_0102.html" title="Michael Bolton">Michael Bolton</a> video, he announced that he had <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fecal_incontinence.html" title="Fecal incontinence">soiled</a> his pants, while Beavis actually <a href="../../../v/o/m/Vomit.html" title="Vomit">vomited</a>. Sometimes, while giving a harsh review of a music video, they would deal harshly with another musician or band, or threaten to end their lives... as rumor has it, even if the video wasn't theirs to begin with; <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_of_Base_aad6.html" title="Ace of Base">Ace of Base</a> suffered this fate while the boys were watching a video from another Swedish band (<a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_Renck_bf73.html" title="Johan Renck">Stakka Bo's</a> <i>Here We Go</i>). The ultimate put-down was to simply look at each other and then switch the channel without saying a word. Only <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanilla_Ice_63a1.html" title="Vanilla Ice">Vanilla Ice</a>'s "Ice Ice Baby" and a video by <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milli_Vanilli_cfd9.html" title="Milli Vanilli">Milli Vanilli</a> earned this reaction.</p>
<p>The famous pianist <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yanni.html" title="Yanni">Yanni</a> also earned a very harsh critique from the boys, so much so that during their viewing of the video for "<i>Reflections of Passion</i>" , Butt-head jokingly told Beavis that Yanni was his dad, causing an alarmed Beavis to let out a terrified scream while a generic horror movie jingle played in the background.</p>
<p>Even bands they liked weren't spared. They were disappointed by an <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> video, despite being fans of the group, and Beavis initially didn't recognize <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a> when "One" came on because of the slow first part. <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Priest_a37d.html" title="Judas Priest">Judas Priest</a>'s video for "Breaking The Law" also drew a negative reaction from the two ("I like Priest and everything, but this sucks!"), despite the fact that they sang the song itself numerous times throughout the series.</p>

<p>Beavis and Butt-head rarely expressed complete enjoyment about any video; but a few bands did draw more favorable attention from the two than others. <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>'s <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Cobain_5fa1.html" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> is said to have been ecstatic at having the video for "Smells Like Teen Spirit" praised by Beavis and Butt-head, and deemed it a great compliment. <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Zombie_%28band%29_439b.html" title="White Zombie (band)">White Zombie</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_O_Negative_7d60.html" title="Type O Negative">Type O Negative</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_in_Chains_161d.html" title="Alice in Chains">Alice in Chains</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/y/Onyx_%28band%29.html" title="Onyx (band)">Onyx</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Maiden_6b08.html" title="Iron Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violent_Femmes_966e.html" title="Violent Femmes">Violent Femmes</a>, the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beastie_Boys_c626.html" title="Beastie Boys">Beastie Boys</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coolio.html" title="Coolio">Coolio</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicidal_Tendencies_805b.html" title="Suicidal Tendencies">Suicidal Tendencies</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primus_%28band%29.html" title="Primus (band)">Primus</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slayer.html" title="Slayer">Slayer</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantera.html" title="Pantera">Pantera</a> and <a href="../../../i/g/g/Iggy_Pop_f985.html" title="Iggy Pop">Iggy Pop</a> were also among the groups for whom Beavis and Butt-head expressed appreciation, and the two groups that earned their fondest reviews were <a href="../../../g/w/a/GWAR_9568.html" title="GWAR">GWAR</a> and the <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butthole_Surfers_244e.html" title="Butthole Surfers">Butthole Surfers</a>. Beavis voiced his estimation that every video should be like a GWAR video. Butt-head once complimented <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Reed_999a.html" title="Lou Reed">Lou Reed</a> after watching the video for "No Money Down" (dubbed "the coolest of all videos" by the boys) by stating that Lou belonged in GWAR. The video which the duo declared to be officially the 'best ever' was <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_%28band%29.html" title="Ministry (band)">Ministry's</a> 'Just One Fix'.</p>
<p>Both Beavis and Butt-head seemed excited in the Smashing Pumpkins's video "Today" when they saw the people "making out", when band painted the ice cream truck, and when the band started throwing things at Billy Corgan, the lead singer. They have also praised the videos by Radiohead that have appeared on the show; "<a href="../../../c/r/e/Creep_%28song%29.html" title="Creep (song)">Creep</a>" got a positive review because of its heavy guitar riffs, while they claimed that they liked to mellow out to "<a href="../../../f/a/k/Fake_Plastic_Trees_8105.html" title="Fake Plastic Trees">Fake Plastic Trees</a>". One of the strangest and most unexpected positive reviews they ever gave was for <a href="../../../j/i/v/Jive_Talkin%27_f45e.html" title="Jive Talkin'">Jive Talkin'</a> by the <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee_Gees_290f.html" title="Bee Gees">Bee Gees</a>, which they mistook for the Black Crowes. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ramones_d4f9.html" title="The Ramones">The Ramones</a> got no words, but were given positive criticism when Beavis and Butt-head simply headbanged for the video's entirety. <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorhead.html" title="Motorhead">Motorhead</a> is also a band that they seem to love, but they only seem to compliment Lemmy Kilmister. In fact, on a Ramones video where Lemmy makes an appearance, Beavis asks what Lemmy was doing there and Butthead responded by saying "He's Lemmy. He can go into any damn video he wants."</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-head_99e4.html" title="Edit section: Other antics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other antics</span></h3>
<p>The duo would occasionally engage in physical humor during the videos. These antics ranged from simple comic violence, such as slapping, punching, and kicking one another, to the duo's memorable dances, which ranged from a few simple arm motions, to Butt-head jumping back and forth across the room, or Beavis humping the couch (a dance move which he calls the "Monkey Boy"), to a card game, and head swaying to the beat of slower songs. A particularly memorable moment of their famous dance sessions can be seen during the viewing of the video for <i>Step Down</i> by the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a> group <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sick_of_it_All_68c4.html" title="Sick of it All">Sick of it All</a>, where the names of Beavis and Butt-head's dance moves are named on the screen (including "The Dillhole" and "The Fart-Knocker Double-Inverted Nad Twist") in a blatant parody of the video itself.</p>
<p>Occasionally, they would hear mediocre songs and sing more famous songs, simply because they sounded similar. One instance is when they heard <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Byrne_bccc.html" title="David Byrne">David Byrne</a>'s "Angels" and compared it to both "<a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinball_Wizard_1ffe.html" title="Pinball Wizard">Pinball Wizard</a>" and "<a href="../../../o/n/c/Once_in_a_Lifetime_%28Talking_Heads_song%29_b6ea.html" title="Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)">Once in a Lifetime</a>".</p>
<p>Sometimes they would engage in conversation, ignoring the video, or at the very least, not discuss whether they liked it or not. An example of this is when they saw the video for <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Day_5412.html" title="Green Day">Green Day</a>'s "<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basket_Case_%28song%29_95f5.html" title="Basket Case (song)">Basket Case</a>" and started talking about the film <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo%27s_Nest_%28film%29_3833.html" title="One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a></i>, and did not say whether they liked it or not.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beavis_and_Butt-head_99e4.html" title="Edit section: Controversial content">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversial content</span></h2>
<p>Over its run, <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reactions from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society. It became the focus of criticism from social conservatives, such as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Medved_3726.html" title="Michael Medved">Michael Medved</a>, who depicted it as "the epitome of mindless and amoral entertainment", while others, such as <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Letterman_d46f.html" title="David Letterman">David Letterman</a>, and the conservative magazine <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a></i>, defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the imaginations of many young television viewers in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and abroad and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture.</p>
<p>The duo lent popularity to slang terms including "assmunch", "woodrow", "stiffy", "<a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_paper.html" title="Toilet paper">asswipe</a>", "<a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunghole_%28slang%29.html" title="Bunghole (slang)">bunghole</a>", "<a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_paper.html" title="Toilet paper">buttwipe</a>", "butt dumpling", "butt burglar", "dumbass", "fartknocker", "<a href="../../../t/a/i/Taint_%28slang%29.html" title="Taint (slang)">choad</a>", "dillhole", "buttknocker", "dillweed", "<a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">schlong</a>", and other assorted insults.</p>
<p>Early episodes gave them a juvenile <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyromania.html" title="Pyromania">obsession with fire</a> and dangerous behavior (summed up with Beavis' chant of "Fire! Fire!"). The show was blamed for child deaths as the result of fire and dangerous stunts, particularly one in <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> in 1993 in which a five year old boy set fire to his mother's mobile home killing his two year old sister. The homeowners blamed the show (despite not having a cable TV subscription) which sparked the ire of media watchdog groups. As a result, the references were excised from further broadcastings, being replaced to some extent with simply silly stunts, bad pick-up lines, etc. References to fire were cut from earlier episodes in reruns. Other episodes MTV opted to not rerun (Examples include "<a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart%27s_House_8268.html" title="Stewart's House">Stewart's House</a>" and "Way Down Mexico Way").</p>
<p>One could interpret some future jokes within the show as jabs about the controversy, despite the fact that their pyromania had already been an established character trait. One prominent potential jab is the episode "Lightning Strikes" where Beavis and Butt-head watch a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Broadcasting_System_d34e.html" title="Public Broadcasting System">PBS</a> special on <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Franklin_3062.html" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>'s legendary electricity experiment during a thunderstorm, and try to capture electricity with their own kite. Needless to say, both are injured; while in the hospital, a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> advocate approaches them, and after noticing they were watching something educational mutters to herself "No, that can't be it", and tries to use their plight to blame <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Stern_a7e1.html" title="Howard Stern">Howard Stern</a> and Rock videos. Beavis later flicks his dinner against her image on the TV.</p>
<p>In February 1994, watchdog group "<a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality_in_Media_b67d.html" title="Morality in Media">Morality in Media</a>" blamed the death of an 8-year-old girl struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey_City%2C_New_Jersey_1b56.html" title="Jersey City, New Jersey">Jersey City, New Jersey</a> highway near the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland_Tunnel_3a45.html" title="Holland Tunnel">Holland Tunnel</a> on an episode in which Beavis and Butt-head loaded a bowling ball with explosives and dropped it from a rooftop. The 18-year-old man arrested for the crime did not have access to cable. The show was eventually cleared of blame.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The original disclaimer in the first and second seasons shown before each episode was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Beavis and Butt-head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely</i> [sic] <i>made up by this Texas guy who we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-Head are dumb, crude, ugly, thoughtless, sexist, self-destructive fools. But for some reason the little wiener heads make us laugh.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare, and are traded on homemade tapes made from the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the recent <i>Mike Judge Collection</i> DVD set, Judge says he is unsure if some of the earlier episodes still exist in their uncensored form.</p>
<p>MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00 P.M., and changing the original disclaimer to a new one, reminding viewers that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Beavis and Butt-head are not role models. They're not even human, they're cartoons. Some of the things they do could cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested... possibly deported. To put it another way, don't try this at home.</i></dd>

<p>This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega_Genesis_7e9e.html" title="Sega Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Nintendo_60e0.html" title="Super Nintendo">Super Nintendo</a> game.</p>

They were famously lambasted by <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> senator <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Hollings_d658.html" title="Fritz Hollings">Fritz Hollings</a> as "Buffcoat and Beaver", which would subsequently become a running gag on the show of adults mispronouncing their names (i.e., Rush Limbaugh's parody "Gus Baker" in the episode "Right On"). Critics, though split upon the cultural merits of the cartoon, often compared the dialogue to that of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Beckett_de21.html" title="Samuel Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>. Social commentary was a recurrent theme throughout the series.</p>
<p>Beavis and Butt-head have been compared to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_savant.html" title="Autistic savant">idiot savants</a>, because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge and is considered by many to be the show's highlight. With regard to criticisms of the two as "idiots", Judge has responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny. However, Daria, who academically excelled, then proceeded to star in her own critically acclaimed series though the show was marketed towards a different audience with a decidedly different sense of humor. Judge said in an interview he didn't even know it was produced until he saw it on TV.</p>

<p>In 1997, a spin-off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer, <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Daria.html" title="Daria">Daria</a></i>, was created. Mike Judge was not credited as a producer of this series and said he was not involved with it at all, except to give permission for the use of the character. The Daria character had been created for <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> by <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Eichler_d135.html" title="Glenn Eichler">Glenn Eichler</a>, who became a producer for <i>Daria</i>. In the first episode of <i>Daria</i>, Daria and her family move from Beavis and Butt-head's hometown of Highland to Lawndale. None of the other characters from <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> ever appear on <i>Daria</i>.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_the_Hill_b7f2.html" title="King of the Hill">King of the Hill</a></i> was created by Mike Judge and at least owes its start to the success of <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i>. Lending credence to its status as a spin-off, the main character, Hank Hill, sounds just like, looks and acts rather similar to Mr. Anderson. Indeed, the show was preceded by rumors, before <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> stopped airing, that Judge was going to do a spin-off show about Mr. Anderson.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The first official <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_video.html" title="Home video">home video</a> releases of <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> were two <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> tapes entitled <i>There Goes The Neighborhood</i> and <i>Work Sucks!</i>, distributed by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> Music Video and MTV Home Video in 1994. Each tape contained approximately eight episodes, each selected from the first four seasons. Although most of the episodes were presented complete (but without music video segments), a handful of episodes from Seasons 2 and 3 were edited for content similar to their broadcast runs. Nine more VHS compilations were released from 1995 to 1999 for a total of 11, containing episodes from every season of the show except the first.</p>
<p>The Contents of the <i>Work Sucks!</i> and <i>There Goes The Neighborhood</i> VHS compilations were combined into a single <a href="../../../l/a/s/LaserDisc_9873.html" title="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> compilation entitled <i>Beavis and Butt-head: The Essential Collection</i>, which was also released by Sony Music Video in 1994. This was the sole release of <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> in the LaserDisc format.</p>
<p>All VHS collections of episodes are out of print. They were compiled into two sets of three multi-episode <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time-Life_a920.html" title="Time-Life">Time-Life</a> DVD releases called <i>The Best of Beavis and Butt-head</i>, which are also no longer available. A set of three DVDs from Time-Life containing the same content as 6 of the VHS editions was released in December 2002. The remaining 5 VHS programs were also released on DVD soon afterwards but were not equally advertised (if at all) and are subsequently rarer.</p>
<p>Several more VHS compilations were also released exclusively in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, between 1997 and 2002, in addition to PAL versions of the eleven American tapes. Some UK-only compilations include a three-part series entitled <i>History of Beavis</i> which contained the all of the Season 1 episodes, as well as a "Too Dumb For TV" compilation dedicated to some of the banned episodes such as "Stewart's House" and "Way Down Mexico Way". A fourth volume of <i>History of Beavis</i> was scheduled, but pulled from release at the last minute. Unlike the American tapes, some of the UK-only tapes contained music videos.</p>
<p>A two-disc DVD set titled <i>The History of Beavis and Butt-head</i> was scheduled for release in September 2002 containing the program content of four of the UK-exclusive VHS tapes. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owns approval rights for video releases of the series. Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set started selling on <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a> at very high prices, sometimes over $300 USD. According to Judge, the <i>History</i> set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and was prepared without his knowledge or consent. <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23060" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23060" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

The DVD set includes approximately 40 episodes and 11 music video segments from the original shows. All prior VHS and DVD releases have lacked these segments except for the VHS release of <i>Beavis and Butt-head Do Christmas</i>, and the last disc of the second Time-Life set.</p>
<p>23 of the 40 episodes included on the <i>Mike Judge Collection</i> were advertised to have been director's cuts containing "previously censored material". However, the majority of the "Director's Cut" episodes are actually missing footage from their original broadcast versions, although two episodes ("Home Improvement" and "Lawn and Garden") did indeed have excised footage reinstated. The reason for these edits is unknown, although Mike Judge stated in a <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Chronicle_fc13.html" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a> article on the release that he corrected certain animation mistakes on the DVD that he found to be troublesome<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The following (known to date) edits were all made in Vol. 1 in order to correct "animation mistakes" according to Mike Judge:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-900-BEAVIS: The lines "She said something", "I think I just inoculated" and "Hey, maybe we'll hear some butt wind" have been removed.</li>
<li>Madame Blavatsky: Beavis and Butt-head's fighting scene at the end is cut short, also Madam Blavatsky's line, when she says "The end of the world" has been edited.</li>
<li>Late Night With Butt-head: First minute and a half of this episode has been removed, instead it starts with Beavis and Butt-head pitching the idea for their talk show. Letterman's cameo voice appearance has been removed. Also, Beavis and Butt-head celebrating with an air guitar chant after successfully pitching their show has been removed.</li>
<li>Right On: A scene where Beavis and Butt-head are doing their air guitar chant, after they found out they will be on the Gus Baker show has been removed. Also, at the very end, the part where Butt-head tells Beavis that it wouldn't hurt to wipe once in while has been removed.</li>
<li>Date Bait: Scene where Beavis &amp; Butt-head are on the couch with a cold and Butt-head doing the "Handbanging-Sneeze" (also showing the Metal sign) has been removed.</li>
<li>Figure Drawing: Teachers comment about teaching a class on Aroma Therapy is removed. Three or four lines have also then been cut after Beavis and Butt-head rearrange the letters on the sign. Several other dialogue cuts were made throughout.</li>
<li>Teen Talk: Scene where Beavis and Butt-head do their air guitar chant, after Lolita and Tanqueray ask if they want to make out behind the risers has been removed.</li>
<li>Held Back: In the scene where Beavis and Butt-head are in 3rd grade and won't fit in the chairs, the lines "This desk is giving me a stiffie" and "I don't even have room for a stiffie" have been removed.</li>
<li>Safe House: A scene with Beavis, Butt-head and Todd watching a funny "World of Bikini Sports" segment has been removed, when the bikini girl tells the sports anchor to take his hands off her ass.</li>
<li>Tainted Meat: Middle section of news broadcast talking about "a fierce new parasite" has been removed.</li>
<li>Manners Suck: The ending were Beavis and Butt-head are in the stalls politly pooping is removed.</li>
<li>Dream On: The ever popular Beavis and Butt-head's Brady Bunch theme song where the duo sings and makes up their own Brady Bunch theme song lyrics.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Mike Judge Collection, Volume 2</i> was released on June 13, 2006. This compilation features 40 additional episodes, 13 music videos, and a <i><a href="../../../b/r/o/Brokeback_Mountain_37a1.html" title="Brokeback Mountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></i> parody featuring Beavis and Butt-head, which uses a similar score and format as Brokeback's movie trailer. The parody functions as a commercial for the DVD release of <i>Mike Judge Collection, Volume 3</i>. Also included are segments from the <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i> "Butt Bowl" specials, traditionally aired during halftime of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>; parodies of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Klein_0a34.html" title="Calvin Klein">Calvin Klein</a> advertisements are also featured. In Volume 2, edits on previous VHS/DVD releases of the episode "Bungholio - Lord of the Harvest" (then called "Butt-o-Ween") have not been reinstated. The edit deleted a scene where the boys are trying out Halloween costumes in their bathroom and Beavis shows up wearing a Winger T-shirt saying "Look...I'm a Wuss".</p>
<p><i>The Mike Judge Collection, Volume 3</i> was released on August 1, 2006. Another 40 episodes are featured, as well as 15 music video segments. Bonus features include the original, uncut "Frog Baseball" episode, and many (if not all) of the Christmas-related clips. Despite the criticism received over severe episode censorship in Vol. 1, edits were again made on at least one episode, i.e. a scene where Beavis &amp; Butt-head cut their teacher's chair in half was removed in "Woodshop".</p>
