The Beatitudes do not describe many separate individuals, but rather the characteristics of those who are deemed blessed by God. Kodjak believes that this opening of the sermon was meant to shock the audience, as a deliberate inversion of standard values, but that today this shock value has been lost owing to the commonness of the text.</p>

<p>Each of the blessed individuals is generally not considered blessed according to worldly standards, but with a heavenly perspective—they are, truly blessed. The word traditionally translated into English as "blessed" or "happy," as in the Greek original μακαριος (makarios); a more literal translation into contemporary English would be "possessing an inward contentedness and joy that is not affected by the physical circumstances". Each of the Beatitudes presents a situation in which the person described would not be described by the world as "blessed", yet Jesus declares that they truly are blessed, and they are blessed with a blessing that outlasts any type of blessing this world has to offer.</p>
<p>These verses are quoted early in the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Liturgy_b5ff.html" title="Divine Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a> of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chrysostom_f259.html" title="John Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, which continues to be the liturgy most often used in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>. Similar sayings are also recorded in a few of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, and are found in Jewish sources that predate the Christian era. Four of the beatitudes are found also in Luke's <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Plain_b484.html" title="Sermon on the Plain">Sermon on the Plain</a>, which many scholars feel is the same event as the Sermon on the Mount. In <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textual_criticism.html" title="Textual criticism">textual criticism</a> these beatitudes are seen as originating in the <a href="../../../q/_/d/Q_document.html" title="Q document">Q document</a>, and the large Sermon they appear within simply being an invention of Matthew and Luke to provide an excuse for quoting them. Luke's Sermon has four <i>woes</i> in addition to the four beatitudes, and Matthew uses the woes elsewhere for use against the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, so some scholars, such as Gundry, see Matthew as having wanted to keep the eightfold structure and consequently having to create four additional sayings.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatitudes.html" title="Edit section: Content">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Content</span></h2>
<p>While opinions vary as to exactly how many distinct statements the Beatitudes should be divided into, normally ranging from eight to ten, most scholars consider there to be only eight. These eight of Matthew follow a simple pattern of naming a group of people and the reward they would receive for being part of that group.</p>
<p>The beatitudes present in both Matthew and Luke are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The poor (Matthew has <i>"poor in spirit"</i>). The text says that theirs <i>is the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_heaven.html" title="Kingdom of heaven">kingdom of heaven</a></i>.</li>
<li>Mourners (Luke has <i>"those who are weeping"</i>). The text says that they will <i>be comforted</i> (Luke has <i>"will laugh"</i>).</li>
<li>The hungry (Matthew has <i>"hunger and thirst after righteousness"</i>). The text says that they will <i>be filled</i> (Luke has <i>"be satisfied"</i>).</li>
<li>Those persecuted for seeking righteousness (rather than <i>righteousness</i>, Luke has <i>"followers of the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_Man_4654.html" title="Son of Man">Son of Man</a>"</i>). The text says that theirs <i>is the kingdom of heaven</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beatitudes only present in Matthew are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meekness.html" title="Meekness">meek</a>. The text says that they will <i>"inherit the earth"</i>.</li>
<li>The merciful. The text says that they will <i>"obtain mercy"</i>.</li>
<li>The pure of heart. The text says that they will <i>"see God"</i>.</li>
<li>The peacemakers. The text says that they will be called <i>"the children of God"</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last of these eight is followed by what appears to be commentaries on it, with Matthew's, according to France, integrating elements from <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaiah.html" title="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 51:7. Amongst textual critics, this is seen as an attempt by Matthew and Luke to re-interpret quotations from Q that do not quite fit with their theology if read literally. That the commentary discusses the persecution of Christians, who clearly would not be able to consider Jesus' crucifixion until after it had actually happened, is regarded by most scholars as indicating the timeframe for when Matthew and Luke were written, although more fundamentalist Christians believe that this commentary is an example of prophecy. Matthew refers to only verbal attacks, while Luke also refers to <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">excommunication</a>, which scholars feel indicates the differences in situation between the writers.</p>
<p>A number of scholars, most significantly, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Hippo_c35d.html" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, have been convinced that there should actually be seven Beatitudes, since <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven.html" title="Seven">seven</a> has historically been considered the holy number. The beatitude about the contrite heart is generally believed to have originated in Psalm 24 (as a manifestation of verses 3–5), with which it is remarkably similar, and so some believe that this was the beatitude that was later added to the other seven. Augustine himself felt that it was the eighth—about persecution of the righteous—which was the addition, since it partly parallels the first. Most modern scholars do not consider that there were originally seven, but instead propose that there were originally four: those shared with Luke.</p>
<p>The Beatitudes<br />
1. Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br />
2. Blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted.<br />
3. Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the land.<br />
4. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.<br />
5. Blessed are they merciful, for they will be shown mercy.<br />
6. Blessed are the pure of heart for they will see God.<br />
7. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.<br />
8. Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br />
There is a 9th beatitude in the gospel of Mark. It reads: "Blessed are you when they insult you and utter every kind of slander against you because of me. Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is great in heaven...."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatitudes.html" title="Edit section: Parallels and differences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Parallels and differences</span></h2>
<p>Like several scholars, Schweizer feels that a large part of Matthew's variance from Luke is down to Matthew not approving of <a href="../../../a/s/c/Asceticism.html" title="Asceticism">asceticism</a> as a way into heaven in and of itself. Hence Matthew changes what Luke has as ordinary physical degradations into spiritual ones—by changing <i>poor</i> into <i>poor in spirit</i>, and <i>hungry</i> into <i>hunger . . . after righteousness</i>. Nevertheless, Matthew's <i>poor in spirit</i> also occurs in the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, apparently being seen by the <a href="../../../q/u/m/Qumran.html" title="Qumran">Qumran</a> community as something important, and those seeking harmony between Matthew and Luke consider that poverty is not only a physical event but a spiritual one as well, and so "poor in spirit" is interpreted by them in this sense rather than it meaning <i>courage</i>, <i>religious awareness</i>, or <i>the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Ghost_f962.html" title="Holy Ghost">Holy Ghost</a></i>. Those seeking harmony between the two sets also interpret <i>mourner</i> as <i>the oppressed</i> rather than as a <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mourner.html" title="Mourner">mourner</a>. The other variations are usually regarded as an attempt to make the beatitudes in question more closely parallel the Old Testament, with, for example, <i>hungry</i> becoming <i>hunger and thirst</i> to parallel Isaiah 49:10.</p>
<p>Some of the beatitudes can be found in parts of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>; for example, the beatitude concerning the poor is also found, with Luke's wording, in Psalm 37 (v. 11). Hill speculates that the beatitude about the <i>pure in heart</i> could actually be a mistranslation of Isaiah 61:1, and thus should have read <i>only the contrite will see God</i>. Since the beatitude which precedes it, concerning mourners, ever so slightly parallels Isaiah 61:2, and in a number of early manuscripts of Matthew these two beatitudes appear in reverse order, Schweizer feels the current order was implemented to better reflect Isaiah 61:1–2. In addition to such direct parallels, there are similar themes; for example, the idea of a divinely significant figure ending a fast is commonly used as a metaphor, for example, appearing in Isaiah 55, Jeremiah 31, and Psalm 107. While not a mainstream view, Betz feels that the beatitude concerning the <i>poor</i> can be traced back to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>' notion of enkrateia, explaining that the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosopher.html" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> was one who had no interest in wealth—an idea adopted by the influential <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynic.html" title="Cynic">Cynics</a>, who rejected wealth and saw poverty as the only route to freedom.</p>
<p><a name="Interpretations" id="Interpretations"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatitudes.html" title="Edit section: Interpretations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interpretations</span></h2>
<p>The literal meaning of many of the beatitudes is not always regarded as acceptable by various groups, who instead prefer to reinterpret the passages to conform with their own theology. <i>Meek</i> literally means <i>reserved</i>, i.e. keeping oneself to oneself, and so a large number of groups instead feel that the beatitude regarding the <i>meek</i> should be understood as a rephrasing of the one concerning the poor, with both <i>poor</i> and <i>meek</i> being understood to mean <i>humble</i> or <i>powerless</i>. With the same two beatitudes, in order to make them rephrasings of each other, it is necessary to interpret <i>earth</i> not as referring to the physical planet, but instead an allusion to some esoteric <i>holy land</i>. Particularly in early Christianity, some have sought to view the reference to <i>mourners</i> as referring to <i>mourning one's sinfulness</i>, but this does not fit with the theology that was around at the time in which Matthew was written, whereby sin was regarded as something that should be hated not mourned.</p>
<p>Although the beatitude concerning the meek has been much praised, even by some non-Christians such as <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, some individuals have negative views of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_d%27Holbach_8c24.html" title="Baron d'Holbach">Baron d'Holbach</a> felt that it reflected the interests of Christians when they were a small and powerless sect, abandoning it whenever they gained power.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietzsche_159c.html" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> saw the verse as embodying the <i>slave morality</i> of Christianity.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Joyce_98cc.html" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake">William Blake</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Dreiser_2cf4.html" title="Theodore Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a> condemned it for advocating a <i>life without striving</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to non-<a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifists</a>, the word <i>peacemakers</i> does not imply pacifism, instead applying to people who cause peace where once there was conflict. As such, this beatitude formed the heart of Augustine's argument in favour of a <a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_war.html" title="Just war">just war</a>, arguing that a war that brought about greater peace was justified. The first century was in the middle of the <a href="../../../p/a/x/Pax_Romana_8c5c.html" title="Pax Romana">Pax Romana</a> and actual wars were rare, so according to Clark, this verse may have been referring to those who merely calm disputes within the community. Although traditionally the passage is regarded as stating that such <i>peacemakers</i> will be <i>children of God</i>, <i>Sons of God</i> is more accurate—<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> and other early Protestant translators viewed the term <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_God_bcd3.html" title="Son of God">Son of God</a></i> as an actual genealogical relationship, rather than simply a description of someone as being generally spiritual, and hence felt it could only be applied to Jesus.</p>
<p>Some Christians have typically seen the commentary following the beatitudes as somewhat disconcerting in its <a href="../../../s/o/t/Soteriology.html" title="Soteriology">soteriology</a>, since it emphasises how good deeds can result in eternal rewards, and barely mentions any need for faith. Some, such as Hill, attempt to resolve this by reinterpreting divine reward as <i>good repute</i>. An interesting feature of the commentary as far as scholars are concerned is the manner in which it compares the audience to <i>prophets</i>, pointing to similarities between Jesus and the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>, who called each other <i>prophets</i>, though, as suggested by Schweizer, this may simply be a reference to Jeremiah 31:34 and Isaiah 54:13, which prophecy that one day all will be equal to the prophets.</p>
<p>Many people mistake the significance of the beatitude concerning hunger, as while now hunger is viewed as a symptom of poverty, at the time in which the Gospels are set, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fasting.html" title="Fasting">fasting</a> was commonly regarded as a sign of righteousness. The later reference to people being <i>persecuted</i> for their <i>righteousness</i> is actually used in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_tense.html" title="Perfect tense">perfect tense</a>, indicating that some of the people Jesus was addressing were seen as already having been persecuted. This beatitude explicitly referring to persecution has often been cited as an argument for toleration and acceptance, with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Locke_68b4.html" title="John Locke">Locke</a> prominently citing it in his <i><a href="../../../a/_/l/A_Letter_Concerning_Toleration_69a1.html" title="A Letter Concerning Toleration">A Letter Concerning Toleration</a></i>, but <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">inquisitors</a> refuted this argument, since they regarded the term <i>righteousness</i> not to be able to anyone who was an enemy of the church.</p>
<p>One interpretation of narrative theologians is that the Beatitudes provide a corrective against an upside-down view of the power structures of the world that has been all but universally taken for granted. That is, the powers and principalities of this world - primarily referencing, but not meant to be exclusive to political, military and economic forces - appear to be the inheritors of power and dominion. In the Beatitudes, however, Jesus explains that the reality of things as seen from God's perspective is that the powerless who are the inheritors the future. It is the meek, the poor, those who suffer loss, those on the bottom of the social ladder, who will rule in the rightside-up kingdom of God. Jesus is attempting to jog his listeners' assumptions regarding security and hope, showing them that the kingdom of God is for those who hope in God and not in the power structures offered by the world. Though not specifically referenced and explained with much less poetry, these same themes are strongly espoused by the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Paul_097e.html" title="Apostle Paul">Apostle Paul</a> in his letters to the Colossians and to the Ephesians. As for a more modern example, such an interpretation of the Beatitudes can be found in "Resident Aliens", by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Hauerwas_552f.html" title="Stanley Hauerwas">Stanley Hauerwas</a> &amp; <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Willimon_30dc.html" title="William Willimon">William Willimon</a>. In their book Jesus is explained to be showing his audience that "In God's kingdom, the poor are royalty, the sick are blessed." "The Beatitudes are not a strategy for achieving a better society ... they are an indication ... of life in the kingdom of God ... to produce a shock within our imaginations ... to see life ... in a radical new way." Similary, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_H._Yoder_87db.html" title="John H. Yoder">John H. Yoder</a>, in his "Politics of Jesus" refers to Matthew 5 as part of a "call on the disciples of Jesus to renounce participation in the interplay of egoisms". This entire work attempts to show that such politics of Jesus is the entire basis behind <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_pacifism.html" title="Christian pacifism">Christian pacifism</a> - that the Jesus who has already conquered evil now calls us to follow him through the same heavenly humility.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatitudes.html" title="Edit section: First Beatitude">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Beatitude</span></h2>
<p>The First Beatitude appears in two versions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit (πτωχοι τω πνεύματι): for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] Blessed be ye poor (οι πτωχοί): for yours is the kingdom of God. (Luke 6:20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distance between Luke's <i>the poor</i> and Matthew's <i>the poor in spirit</i> seemed important to many critics. However, this difference is not at all overwhelming. Luke uses the Greek word πτωχος,ή,όν (ptohos), like Matthew. This Greek word has a history in the Septuagint, occuring in verses that are significant for our subject. We can find it, for example, in <i>Isaiah 29:19</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meek (Hebrew <i>anawim</i>, Greek <i>πτωχοί</i>) also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, it translates the famous Hebrew word <b>anaw</b> (humble) which describes a quality much cherished by Yahweh. According to the Bible, God has a notorious and constant care for the poor. In fact, the poor are under His own special protection and their cries are heard in heaven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This poor man (Hebrew <i>anî</i>, Greek <i>‘ο πτωχος</i>) cried and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. (Ps.34:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, when Jesus blessed the poor and announced them to be owners of the kingdom of heaven, nobody argued. The First Beatitude, as expressed by Luke, raises no controversies.</p>
<p>We could see, in <i>Psalm 34:6</i> already quoted (Ps.34:7 in Hebrew Bible and 33:7 in the Septuagint) that the Greek word <b>ptohos</b> translated another Hebrew word, <b>anî</b> (poor, afflicted). The Hebrew terms <b>anî</b> and <b>anaw</b> are related, but not identical, because the first one describes a poor person, while the second - a humble one. However, in the Septuagint, the Greek <b>ptohos</b> translated either of them. That means that the Greek word aggregates both meanings and refers to a poor person <i>who is also humble</i>. The situation is not unique: for example, a similar one occurs in the case of the Greek word πενης,ητος (penes) which also means <i>poor, needy person</i> and which can translate the Hebrew words <i>anaw</i> and <i>ebyon</i> (a synonym of <i>anî</i>). But we can understand now why the distance between Luke's <b>the poor</b> and Matthew's <b>the poor in spirit</b> vanishes. The Greek word <b>ptohos</b> refers to the poor who are humble in spirit - these are blessed by God. The poor who are arrogant, deceitful and full of envy have no access to the kingdom of heaven. The poor must be poor in spirit, too. However, the <i>poor in spirit</i> has a meaning of its own: <b>simple-minded</b>. We can add this meaning to the Beatitude, because simple-minded believers have a faith which grows strong faster than the sophisticated ones'. Once they believe, they never question their convictions. Note that while the blessing of poor raised no controversies, the blessing of simple-minded seems to offend many scholars and theologians.</p>

<li>A scene in the well-known play <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godspell.html" title="Godspell">Godspell</a> consists of the cast members running up to Jesus, each with a line beginning one of the beatitudes (eg. "Blessed are the poor in spirit!"), which Jesus finishes ("for their's is the kingdom of heaven"). After the last beatitude, the character of John/Judas ends the scene with a dark prediction: "Blessed are you! When men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely." The cast is stunned into an awkward silence by this line, and Jesus then attempts to cheer them up in the next scene and song.<br /></li>
