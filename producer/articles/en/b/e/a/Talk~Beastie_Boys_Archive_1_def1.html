<p>Obviously someone with a poor sense of humor has made some absurd changes and additions all over this article. To add insult to injury this person's style is rather repetitive and unprofessional. It should be cleaned up.</p>
<hr />
<p>BB also have an instrumental album 'The In Sound From Way Out' which probably should go on the discography. -<a href="../../../m/h/j/User%7EMhjb_609c.html" title="User:Mhjb">mhjb</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Hmm.. I'm wondering how accurate this page is. Check Your Head and Ill Communication both say "Grand Royal" on their records. They're listed as "Capitol Records" here. Which is the truth?</p>
<p>Also, I've never heard of the "Don't Mosh" CD. Does it really exist? Could someone who knows the answers to these questions correct the article? --<a href="../../../r/l/w/User%7ERlwelch_54cb.html" title="User:Rlwelch">rlwelch</a></p>
<p>They produced the albums under Grand Royal but were manufactured and distributed by Capitol, if you check the album inserts. Popular bands on indie labels tend to do this if their albums are big sellers because smaller labels can't handle the volume. Beasties smaller releases like 'Aglio' could be released on GR, since demand is not as high (bands like Bad Religion whose members started and still manage Epitaph, signed with Atlantic to release their stuff). 'Don't Mosh' was an unreleased interactive CD-ROM from '94. Beastiemania.com is a good comprehensive source for all things beastie.</p>

<p>Who is the female vocalist in the song "Sabotage"? Is that a clip taken from somewhere else and if so, from where?

<p>there are no female voices... just Adam Horovitz -- some unsigned remark.</p>

<p>In answer to your question, the female voice featured on 'Shadrach' is one of the members of 'sly and the family stone'. The sample was taken from the sly song 'Loose Booty'.

<p>As others have pointed out, the discography for this article was grossly incorrect, so I've polished it up a bit with the help of several reference sites. I've also taken out some of the chaff from the article, deleted dead pictures, and fixed grammatical and spelling errors. I hope this meets with everybody's approval. If you have any further suggestions for how this article can be improved upon, let me know and I'll see what I can do. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammar_nazi_ad14.html" title="User:Grammar nazi">Grammar nazi</a> 02:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Southern?</span></h2>
<p>The discography lists "Southern" as the label that released <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooky_Puss_2688.html" title="Cooky Puss">Cooky Puss</a>, but the EPs' article says it's Ratcage Records (and so does the vinyl copy of the EP that I own). The same applies for the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollywog_Stew_9e3d.html" title="Pollywog Stew">Pollywog Stew</a> entry. Beastiemania.net's <a href="http://beastiemania.com/discog/" class="external text" title="http://beastiemania.com/discog/" rel="nofollow">discography</a> page agrees with me. I'm changing these entries accordingly.</p>
<p>Additionally, can someone explain why the section for the 1988-1992 era is titled "The Sounds of Science"? This is especially confusing, as it links to the article about the compilation. I don't think this is an appropriate name, since the other time periods are given titles of albums that were released during that time. I vote to change this, though I'm not sure to what. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilDespres_2923.html" title="User:NeilDespres">NeilDespres</a> 08:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As all the other sections are named after the album of that era I suggest naming it Paul's Boutique and moving Check Your Head into it's own section or at least calling it Paul's Boutique and Check Your Head, better yet remove all of the links to albums in their headings as they're mentioned inside anyway. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyjrg_3fb9.html" title="User:Jimmyjrg">Jimmyjrg</a> 08:44, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed the "Sounds of Science" section to Pauls Boutique/Check your Head and linked to the album names. Tell me if you think it should be something else. Also, what's with the list of singles not being completed? <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilDespres_2923.html" title="User:NeilDespres">NeilDespres</a> 02:13, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah I like it, I added a space on either side of the bracket though to make it more obvious each album title has a different link. In regards to the singles, do you mean the Hit singles section?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm talking about the table that currently includes the chart position for Hey Ladies, right below the hit singles table. Does someone want to merge those? <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilDespres_2923.html" title="User:NeilDespres">NeilDespres</a> 02:33, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1 -First off what is "Beastie Boys Anthology: Beastitude", supposedly released on Capitol Records in '99? Is it meant to be the DVD? It sounds like a bootleg to me.</dd>
<dd>2 -Also the Love American Style EP needs it's own page so it can be added to the EPs and compilations section down the bottom of all the pages.</dd>
<dd>3 -The page for Aglio e Olio needs an image, as does Some Old Bullshit, Cooky Puss and Pollywog Stew.</dd>

<dd>Thank you for finally discussing your content changes. However, I must agree with Fuzzie.

<dd>Please stop removing the link. It's getting annoying. Everyone who has chimed in on this sees no problem with the link being on the article except for you. Your own dislike for a small, out of the way comment on an external, informational, and helpful website has no bearing on whether or not the link should be included in this article.
