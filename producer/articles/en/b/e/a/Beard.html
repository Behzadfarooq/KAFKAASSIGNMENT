A man with a full beard</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <b>beard</b> is the <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair.html" title="Hair">hair</a> that grows on a man's chin, cheeks, neck, and the area above the upper lip (the opposite is a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clean-shaven.html" title="Clean-shaven">clean-shaven</a> face). When differentiating between upper and lower facial hair, a beard specifically refers to the facial hair on the lower part of a man's chin (excluding the <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustache.html" title="Moustache">moustache</a>, which refers to hair above the upper lip and around it). The study of beards is called pogonology.</p>
<p>In the course of history, men with <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial_hair.html" title="Facial hair">facial hair</a> have been ascribed various attributes such as wisdom, sexual virility, or high status, but also a lack of cleanliness and refinement, or an eccentric disposition.</p>

<p>The highest ranking <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptians</a> grew hair on their chins which was often dyed or hennaed (reddish brown) and sometimes plaited with interwoven gold thread. A metal, false beard or postiche, which was a sign of sovereignty, was worn by queens as well as kings. This was held in place by a ribbon tied over the head and attached to a gold chin strap, a fashion existing from about 3000 B.C. To 1580 B.C.</p>
<p>Mesopotamian civilizations (Chaldean, Babylonian, Assyrian, Median and ancient Persian) devoted great care to oiling and dressing their beards, using tongs and curling irons to create elaborate ringlets and tiered patterns.</p>
<p>Grecian beards were frequently curled with tongs to create hanging curls. Beards predominated among the Greeks until 323 B.C., at which time the youthful <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> ordered his soldiers to be clean shaven, fearing that their beards would serve as handles for their enemies to grab and to hold the Greek soldier as he was killed. When Alexander the Great was going to fight against the Persians, one of his officers brought him word that all was ready for battle, and demanded if he required anything further. On which Alexander replied, "nothing but that the Macedonians cut off their beards, for there is not a better handle to take a man by than the beard." This shows Alexander intended close fighting.</p>
<p>In ancient India and Israel, the beard was allowed to grow long, a symbol of dignity and of wisdom (cf. <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadhu.html" title="Sadhu">sadhu</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazarite.html" title="Nazarite">nazarite</a> respectively). The nations in the east generally treated their beards with great care and veneration, and the punishment for licentiousness and adultery was to have the beard of the offending parties publicly cut off. They had such a sacred regard for the preservation of their beards that a man might pledge it for the payment of a debt.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a> were fond of long beards. In <a href="../../../o/l/e/Olearius.html" title="Olearius">Olearius</a>' <i>Travels</i>, a King of Persia commands his steward's head to be cut off, and on its being brought to him, remarks, "what a pity it was, that a man possessing such fine mustachios, should have been executed," but he adds, "Ah! it was your own fault."</p>
<p>Shaving seems to have not been known to the Romans during their early history (under the Kings of Rome and the early Republic). Pliny tells us that P. Ticinius was the first who brought a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barber.html" title="Barber">barber</a> to Rome, which was in the 454th year from the founding of the the city (that is, around 299 B.C.). <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scipio_Africanus_1ced.html" title="Scipio Africanus">Scipio Africanus</a> was apparently the first among the Romans who shaved his beard. However, after that shaving seems to have caught on very quickly, and soon almost all Roman men were clean-shaven - being clean-shaven became a sign of being <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> as opposed to being <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_people.html" title="Greek people">Greek</a>, as the Greeks often grew beards. Beards remained rare among the Romans throughout the Late Republic and the early Principate, until the second century A.D., when the Emperor <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadrian.html" title="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, according to Dion, was the first of all the Caesars to grow a beard. This was a period in Rome of widespread imitation of Greek culture, and the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philhellene.html" title="Philhellene">philhellene</a> Emperor Hadrian and many other men grew beards in imitation of the Greek fashion. From that time on beards were once again common in Rome.</p>
<p>It was a custom among the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> to consecrate the first growth of a young man's beard (i.e., the cuttings after the first time he shaved) to some god; thus <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nero.html" title="Nero">Nero</a> at the Gynick games, which he exhibited in the Septa, cut off the first growth of his beard, which he placed in a golden box, adorned with pearls, and then consecrated it in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitoline_Hill_60fe.html" title="Capitoline Hill">Capitol</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupiter_%28god%29.html" title="Jupiter (god)">Jupiter</a>.</p>
<p>For the Romans a bearded man was a proverbial expression for a man of virtue and simplicity. Roman servants or slaves were not allowed to pull their hair, or shave their beards.</p>
<p>During grief and mourning a Roman would let his hair and beard grow (<a href="../../../l/i/v/Livy.html" title="Livy">Livy</a>), while the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Greece_6a55.html" title="History of Greece">Greeks</a> on the contrary used to cut off their hair and shave their beards on such occasions (<a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneca_the_Younger_9b04.html" title="Seneca the Younger">Seneca</a>)</p>
<p>This custom may have led to a tradition in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> of widows concealing their hair for a stated period after the death of their husbands.</p>
<p>There have been instances of a widow closely cutting off her hair, but these observances are becoming less and less frequent.</p>
<p>Among the Catti, a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_people.html" title="Germanic people">Germanic</a> tribe (perhaps the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatten.html" title="Chatten">Chatten</a>), a young man was not allowed to shave or cut his hair till he had slain an enemy (Tacitus). The <a href="../../../l/o/m/Lombards.html" title="Lombards">Lombards</a> or Longobards, derived their Fame from the great length of their beards. When Otho the Great used to speak anything serious, he swore by his beard, which covered his breast.</p>

<p>In the 15th century, the beard was worn long. Clergymen in 16th century England were usually clean shaven to indicate their celibacy. When a priest became convinced of the doctrines of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> he would often signal this by allowing his beard to grow, showing that he rejected the tradition of the church and perhaps also its stance on clerical celibacy. The longer the beard, the more striking the statement. Sixteenth century beards were therefore suffered to grow to an amazing length (see the portraits of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Gardiner_e472.html" title="Bishop Gardiner">Bishop Gardiner</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Cranmer_521e.html" title="Thomas Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>). Some beards of this time were; The Spanish Spade Beard, The English Square Cut Beard, The forked Beard and the Stiletto Beard.</p>
<p>Strangely, this trend was especially marked during <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Queen Mary's</a> reign, a time of reaction against Protestant reform (<a href="../../../r/e/g/Reginald_Cardinal_Pole_1698.html" title="Reginald Cardinal Pole">Cardinal Pole</a>'s beard is a good example). At this time the beard was very often made use of as a tooth-pick case. <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_de_Bourdeille%2C_seigneur_de_Brant%C3%B4me_c436.html" title="Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme">Brantôme</a> tells us that <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gaspard_de_Coligny_4fde.html" title="Gaspard de Coligny">Admiral Coligny</a> wore his tooth-pick in his beard. <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_I_d23c.html" title="Queen Elizabeth I">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, succeeding Mary, is said to have disliked beards and therefore established a tax on them.</p>
<p>In urban circles of Western Europe and the Americas, beards were out of fashion after the early <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a>; to such an extent that, in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1698.html" title="1698">1698</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_I_of_Russia_4d2f.html" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter the Great</a> of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> levied a tax on beards in order to bring Russian society more in line with contemporary Western Europe.</p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_Century_7857.html" title="18th Century">18th Century</a> beards were unknown among most parts of Western society, especially the nobility and upper classes.</p>
<p>Beards returned strongly to fashion after the Napoleonic Era. Throughout the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a> facial hair (beards, along with long <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sideburns.html" title="Sideburns">sideburns</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustaches.html" title="Moustaches">moustaches</a>) was more common than not. Many male European monarchs were bearded (e.g. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_III_of_Russia_47fa.html" title="Alexander III of Russia">Alexander III</a> of Russia, <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_III_ec6b.html" title="Napoleon III">Napoleon III</a> of France, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_III%2C_German_Emperor_9646.html" title="Frederick III, German Emperor">Frederick III</a> of Germany), as were many of the leading statesmen and cultural figures (e.g. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli_2257.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dickens_e77a.html" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Verdi_b105.html" title="Giuseppe Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, to name just a few). The stereotypical Victorian male figure in the popular mind remains a stern figure clothed in black whose gravitas is added to by a heavy beard (or long sideburns). However, in the early twentienth century beards fell almost completely out of fashion once more; they became largely the preserve of elderly, old-fashioned eccentrics.</p>
<p>Beards, together with long hair, were reintroduced to mainstream society in Western <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> by the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a> movement of the mid 1960s. By the end of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>, the closely clipped <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verdi.html" title="Verdi">Verdi</a> beard, often with a matching integrated moustache, was relatively common, as was a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stubble.html" title="Stubble">stubble</a> beard (especially on younger men).

<p>In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, beards were rare in the United States, as elsewhere in the Western world. But as elsewhere, they had become prevalent by the mid-nineteenth century. Up to and following the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, many famous heroes and <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_officer.html" title="General officer">General officers</a> had significant beards. A sign of the shift was to be observed in occupants of the Presidency: before Lincoln, no President had a beard; after Lincoln until McKinley, every President (except <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>) had either a beard or a moustache. The beard's loss of popularity since its nineteenth century heyday is shown by the fact that after this brief "golden age", no President has worn a full beard since <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Harrison_e6b2.html" title="Benjamin Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, and no President has worn any facial hair at all since <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Taft_b16b.html" title="William H. Taft">William H. Taft</a>.</p>
<p>Following <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, beards fell out of vogue. There are several theories as to why the military began shaving beards.</p>
<ol>
<li>When <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> broke out in the 1910s, the use of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_weapon.html" title="Chemical weapon">chemical weapons</a> necessitated that soldiers shave their beards so that <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gas_masks.html" title="Gas masks">gas masks</a> could seal over their faces.</li>
<li>The enlistment of military recruits for <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> in 1914 precipitated a major migration of men from rural to urban locales. This was the largest such migration that had ever occurred in the United States up to that time. The rural lives of some of these bearded men included the "Saturday Night bath" as a reality rather than as a humourism. The sudden concentration of recruits in crowded army induction centers brought with it disease, including head lice. Remedial action was taken by immediately shaving the faces and cutting the hair of all inductees upon their arrival.</li>

During this time period the Film Industry was coming into its own and "going to the movies" became a popular pastime. Due to the recent <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice.html" title="Armistice">Armistice</a> many of the films had themes related to World War I. These popular films featured actors who portrayed soldiers with their clean shaven faces and "<a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew_cut.html" title="Crew cut">crew cuts</a>".

<p>From the 1920s to the early 1960s, beards were virtually nonexistent in mainstream America. The few men who wore beards during this period were either old, Central Europeans, in academia, or part of the counterculture, such as the "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatnik.html" title="Beatnik">beatniks</a>". Even today there is some degree of prejudice against beards and against men who wear beards, although it is much less serious than it once was; beards are normally much more accepted in the Western world than they once were.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, beards exploded in popularity. In the mid-late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, beards were worn by <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippies</a> and businessmen alike. Popular rock, soul and <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk musicians</a> like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_White_714e.html" title="Barry White">Barry White</a> and the male members of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter%2C_Paul%2C_and_Mary_5895.html" title="Peter, Paul, and Mary">Peter, Paul, and Mary</a> wore full beards. The trend of seemingly ubiquitous beards in American culture subsided in the mid 1980s.</p>
<p>From the 1990s onward, the fashion in beards has generally trended toward either a <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatee.html" title="Goatee">goatee</a>, <a href="#Beard_styles" title="">Van Dyck</a>, or a closely cropped full beard undercut on the throat. It is not unusual to see corporate executives in modern America with a full beard.

<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> states in <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 19:27 that "Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard." <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmudic</a> <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbis</a> understood this to mean that a man may not shave his beard with a <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razor.html" title="Razor">razor</a> with a single blade, since the cutting action of the blade against the skin "mars" the beard. Because <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scissors.html" title="Scissors">scissors</a> have two blades, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">halakha</a> (rabbinic law) permits their use to trim the beard, as the cutting action comes from contact of the two blades and not the blade against the skin. For this reason, most <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posek.html" title="Posek">poskim</a> (Jewish legal decisors) rule that <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Jews</a> may use electric razors to remain cleanshaven, as such shavers cut by trapping the hair between the blades and the metal grating, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">halakhically</a> a scissor-like action. Some prominent contemporary poskim maintain that electric shavers constitute a razor-like action, and consequently prohibit their use.</p>
<p>Many Orthodox Jews prefer to grow beards despite the allowance for electric shavers, for a variety of social and cultural reasons. Since the electric razor is a relatively modern innovation, virtually all Orthodox Jews grew beards before its advent. As a result, many <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi</a> Orthodox Jews today grow beards as a social statement in keeping with the tradition of their ancestors.</p>

As a result, most <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidic Jews</a> choose to grow their beard, as they traditionally follow <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalistic</a> practices more closely than Jews of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithuanian_Jews_cc4e.html" title="Lithuanian Jews">Lithuanian</a> background do. Many Hasidic Jews, especially those aligned with the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a> sect, take this practice further than most others and do not trim their beards at all, giving them a distinct and often identifiable appearance.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard.html" title="Edit section: Islam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Islam</span></h3>
<p>Many <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> believe that it is mandatory by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">Islamic law</a> to grow the beard because in <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih_Bukhari</a>, Volume 7, Book 72, Hadith # 780: The Prophet said, "Do the opposite of what the pagans do. Keep the beards and cut the moustaches short."</p>
<p>The intent of this hadith is, however, a point of ongoing discussion and interpretation, and the fundamental interpretation is not currently the only accepted one among Muslims. This hadith, placed in historical context, is seen by some as an order at that time and in that place to distinguish one's self from the surrounding non-Muslims, largely for security and cultural reasons, for that situation. It is presently not uncommon for practicing Muslims in Islamic and Western countries to not grow their beards.</p>
<p>In addition, following the Prophet's actions is very important as well since he was proclaimed as a walking Quran and Muslims try their utmost to follow the teachings of the Quran. Since the Prophet kept a beard, many Muslim men keep beards to follow his actions and the teachings of the religion. Depending on their sect, they have differing opinions on how the Prophet Muhammad wore his.</p>
<p>As with hadith, however, following the Prophet's actions is also a point where fundamentalist vs. contextual interpretations come into play. Therefore, many Muslims do shave, since it is generally considered to be virtuous, but not mandatory, to grow a beard.</p>
<p>According to the majority opinions in the four major <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhab.html" title="Madhab">schools of jurisprudence</a>, a beard is mandatory for all men, unless they have a medical reason not to grow one. The exception is the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shafi%60i.html" title="Shafi`i">Shafi`i</a> <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhab.html" title="Madhab">Madhab</a>, which includes two valid opinions, one stating that a beard is required and one stating that a beard is Sunnah Mu'akadah (An emphasized example set by the Prophet, but not required). Minority opinions exist in all four schools that the beard is optional, but virtuous.</p>
