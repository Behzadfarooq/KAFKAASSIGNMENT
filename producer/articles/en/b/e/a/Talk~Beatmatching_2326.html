<p>This article seems a bit too much like a how-to guide, but I cant see how to re-write it so that its more like what an article should be without cutting a large chunk out of it. Any suggestions? StealthFox 22:13, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>A lot of information on here is not correct.</p>
<p>A PA system is not required for beatmatching, and selecting proper records has nothing to do with the process itself. Beatmatching is simply matching the speeds of two records, and that's all this page should really say, along with the step-by-step process. Even though it is wise to select two records of similar speeds, it's not necessary, nor is it a part of the process.</p>

<dd>Also, the page seems to use a different definition of beatmatching than the one I'm aware of. For me, <i>beatmatching</i> is purely matching the tempo of the "new" record with that of the "old" one (called <i>Matching tempos</i> in the article). This involves finding the start of the new track, starting the record, adjusting pitch control and pushing the record until the beats match. Anything else is <i>mixing</i>. I would propose splitting the article into <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatmatching.html" title="Beatmatching">beatmatching</a> and mixing (DJ), but this style of mixing isn't the only one possible. Any better name? <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootless_7fdd.html" title="User:Rootless">Rootless</a> 02:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not aware of the term "beatmixing" being used by anyone in common parlance. "Beatmatching" is often used to mean mixing, it is true, but I agree there is value in keeping them distinct, since there are many ways to mix two songs together (perhaps ultimately we can have many of them described). My preference would be to rename beatmixxing to "Mixing (DJ)" or the like and to more properly describe tempo matching as beatmatching here. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommodore_Sloat_2836.html" title="User:Commodore Sloat">csloat</a> 03:54, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On one hand, I don't think this historical term is really used these days, everybody just says "mixing" (I haven't heard "beatmatching" being used to mean mixing). On the other hand, an unambiguous word is needed; I sometimes find myself saying things like "techno-style mixing" and "beatmatched mixing" to describe it. I think I'm with you regarding the renaming, but we should probably mention <i>beatmixing</i> as a historical term. Want to propose the move?</dd>

<p>Woohoo, my first ever wikipedia edit! The "Step by step" was horrendous; i've edited it so it is at least a little more accurate and relevant.. As per discussion above, i've removed any reference to mixing, and kept it to the steps required to "beatmatch".. I've also made it clear that this is only one method - there are many others out there (pitch chasing, on the fly, etc.) but i feel i have outlined the most basic and popular method.. I have certainly never heard of a DJ beatmatching two tunes, then taking a <a href="../../../m/e/a/Mean.html" title="Mean">mean</a> of the difference in tempo and attempting to bring both turntables to that speed, as instructed in the previous "how to"! dirtybobby 16:54, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, some progress here. However, I think it should be more like a description of the technique rather than a detailed howto (which can, and probably should, be linked to under External Links). I tried to do it this way in <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatmixing.html" title="Beatmixing">beatmixing</a>, but decided to throw in some useful hints as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the method -- I never restart the record during beatmatching, but just before mixing (i.e., start the record, beatmatch (pulling/pushing when needed), restart the record, close bass (or somt'n), bring fader up). <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootless_7fdd.html" title="User:Rootless">Rootless</a> 18:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose this depends on the genre of music, as well as one's own personal style of mixing.. A lot of modern drum n bass, for instance, only has 32 bar intros, and so can require restarting the record to maintain a percussive section during the beatmatching stage.. I also tried to write it from a beginner's perspective - I'm sure many of us can beatmatch and lock a tempo within a few bars, but I imagine if you can do this already you won't be reading this anyway! dirtybobby 12:18, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, it may depend on the genere. I'm with minimal techno, which mostly has constant beat throughout the track. In any case, you don't have to lock the tempo within few bars -- just push/pull the record along with adjusting the pitch so the beats coincide, and every time you do it the record should drift less. Not that it matters. Meanwhile I added a link to a <a href="http://music.hyperreal.org/dj/AVH/" class="external text" title="http://music.hyperreal.org/dj/AVH/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>. There's also a way to beatmatch without touching the record (using pitch control only (try it one day, it's nice)), I should probably describe it or find a link. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootless_7fdd.html" title="User:Rootless">Rootless</a> 19:32, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"you don't have to lock the tempo within few bars -- just push/pull the record along with adjusting the pitch so the beats coincide"</i> - the problem (for beginners) as i say is that drum n bass, for example, typically only has 16 or 32-bar intros - so if you haven't got the beat matched within these 32 bars the tune breaks down and you haven't got any beats left to match! with tunes running at 180bpm, 32 bars works out to less than a minute, which is why beginners very often have to restart the tune a couple of times to use the percussive intro to get their tempos locked.. i realise this isn't a problem found with most 4-to-the-floor genres, though, so i have edited the section to say that this step isn't necessary in all cases&#160;:o)</dd>

<dd><i>"There's also a way to beatmatch without touching the record (using pitch control only)"</i> - this is called "pitch chasing," which i mention in my original post, above&#160;:o) i very often use this method, especially when i'm mixing acapellas in as it distorts the vocal less and allows you to tighten the mix on the fly! dirtybobby 09:25, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
