<p>I was a bit reluctant to remove this list, as somebody obviously spent quite a long time writing it yesterday, yet it doesn't seem very encyclopedic to me - it just sounds like somebody's favourite scenes. Some of the details are already in the plot summary, for example, although a few of these could be integrated in there where the details are thinner. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 08:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaves even his tongue and his nose with an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_razor.html" title="Electric razor">electric razor</a></li>
<li>Realizes he is late and then guzzles down his breakfast, eating raw <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_sugar.html" title="Table sugar">table sugar</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> ground, and drinking directly out of the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teapot.html" title="Teapot">teapot</a> and milk bottle</li>
<li>Falls asleep while on duty at the art gallery and slowly drops to the ground in lazy <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrobatic.html" title="Acrobatic">acrobatic</a> postures</li>
<li>Blows his nose violenty and childishly and part of the tissue remains in the nostril</li>
<li>Makes funny faces while getting his passport photo taken</li>
<li>Teases passengers in economy class about his first class ticket</li>
<li>Is silly towards another man in first class and takes a picture of him</li>
<li>Bursts a filled vomit bag over the head of the sleeping man in front of him, showering him in vomit</li>
<li>Pretends to have a gun near two security guards. They think he actually has one, and when they ask him to put it on the floor, he makes a gun shape with his hand and moves that to the floor</li>
<li>Greets and behaves strangely in front of David and his family</li>
<li>Throws a M&amp;M in the air and catches it in his mouth</li>
<li>Wiggles his ears and then snorting like a pig</li>
<li>Places his underwear in the microwave for warmth</li>
<li>Accidentally makes it look as though he has peed himself by playing with a tap in a restroom. To dry it and save himself embarressment, he hops up and down in front of the hand dryer, and when a man comes out from a cubicle, it looks to him as though he is having <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercourse.html" title="Intercourse">intercourse</a>. Mr. Bean realizing the presence of the man then unscrews a lightbulb and plays with it, but then burns himself and drops and smashes it. His pants are dry, but in the rush to cool his burnt hands, he wets his pants with the tap <i>again</i></li>
<li>For the next few minutes, he does everything he can to hide his wetted pants. He holds a brouchere over his crotch, hides behind David and a pot plant, and stands straight up against a fan in the corner to dry them again</li>
<li>At David's home places a limited edition glass figurine atop of a stereo, and then, mistaking the stereo remote for the TV remote, presses a button which opens the CD lid and sends the figurine flying up and smashing into a family photograph, destroying both figurine and photo.</li>
<li>Falls asleep on an exhilarating motion simulator ride, and then afterwards tampers with the ride controls, so that on the next ride it goes at top speed, and he finds it much more fun but other riders find it terrifying and some get flung right out of their seats</li>
<li>At a police station, Not realizing the mirror in front of him is a two way mirror, he does various silly faces and actions unbeknowst that David and some police are watching him</li>
<li>Serves raw onion as appetizers to two guests of David at dinner</li>
<li>Attempts to cook a <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">thanksgiving</a> turkey in 20 minutes by stuffing it into a microwave. It subsequently explodes and splatters both him and the kitchen in melted turkey remains</li>
<li>Thinks that <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_DaVinci_8cab.html" title="Leonardo DaVinci">Leonardo DaVinci</a> is a <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> player</li>
<li>Goes in the shower while David is in it</li>
<li>Sneezes on Whistler's Mother and wipes it off with an inky tissue, getting blue ink over the face. He brings it to a mantainance room by putting a cloth over it and pretending it is a wheely-table by holding it out horizontally in front of him and making squeeking noises to imitate wheels, and then in the mantainance room, removes the blue ink with paint stripper. The entire face starts melting, however, and Mr. Bean wipes it all off. He then draws a ridiculous cartoon face over it to try and replace it, and then rushes the painting back to it's room and tries to keep David out by barricading the door with a pot plant. David gets in, and when he sees what has happened to Whistler's Mother, he has a fit.</li>
<li>Changes the channel on a TV at a bar by blowing a peanut out of his nose</li>
<li>Places decorative drink umbrellas in his nose, hair and ears</li>
<li>Sings various silly songs while drunk and going down the street with David</li>
<li>Although it is succesful, his whole plot to replace Whistler's Mother with a poster and the laxatives in the guard's coffee, ETC... is rather harebrained and silly</li>
<li>Gives a bumbling but moving speech the next day on the painting, both contemplating that it is good the painting is BIG, and calls the mother an old, cranky, but nevertheless loved crone</li>
<li>Drops an M&amp;M in a patient in a hospital's wound, and searches around for it, both finding a bullet and putting it back in, and then finding the M&amp;M, washes it of blood and eats it. He is then required to perform the operation, and removes the bullet again.</li>
<li>Plays with a defibrillator, listening to their pulses like with a seashell, and then puts the two electrodes together, sending him flying and landing on the patient in the room, waking her out of a coma.</li>
<li>Does a rude finger at two elders while driving down the street with David</li>
<li>Buys presents for David and his family: Eggs for the wife, laxatives for David, a barbie doll for the teenage daughter, and a miniature Mr. Bean suit for the son. Mr. Bean then dresses in the sons outfit (against his liking)</li>
<li>At home at last once again, makes his teddy bear fall asleep by hypnotizing it with a finger-snap trance</li>
<li>Hangs the ruined Whistler's Mother in his bedroom</li>
</ul>

<dd>It's a good and comprehensive list - I've been reading all the plot summaries for the episodes of the TV series and now this, and it's all amusingly coming back to me. Still, I wouldn't be able to remember any significant omissions... his "families are important" part of the speech about the painting I do remember despite it not being mentioned here or in the plot summary, although that isn't a particularly comic part of the film...--<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a> r e s e a r c h 20:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
