<p>I was watching a show last night on Animal Planet that said a gland in the mouth of all species of bear (except pandas) is used to differentiate between edible and poisonous plants. By smelling their mother's mouth after she's eaten, bear cubs will then taste around to find the same species of plant that she ate. Pandas lack this gland as they only eat bamboo and have no need for it. I can't recall the exact name, but I think it was the Keller's gland--named for the researcher who discovered it. Someone may want to edit that in, since it's an important and unique aspect of bear evolution. --Mr. Anonymous. 26 November, 2006.</p>

<p>I'm curious about their tactics for hunting prey since they're so big. Theyre very fascinating and so resembling to humans, I just dont understand how they catch prey, considering theyre solohunters, LARGE and inagile compared to humans. Also what kind of food do they bring to their stash for hibernating? How do they deal with meat going bad? -mbrw 80.164.151.218 02:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Inagile? You clearly know litle about bears! They don't stash... They wake up in the middle of sleep to forage occasionally. They hunt small mammals by digging them out of their burrows, salmon by ambushing near waterfalls and deer by whacking them on the back, breaking the vertebrae. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDora_Nichov_c011.html" title="User:Dora Nichov">Dora Nichov</a> 12:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I don't think that the bear was ever an official emblem of Russia, that nation's affinity with the animal has a history going back for decades, if not hundreds of years. For example, the NATO reporting name for the Tu95 bomber (the Soviet Union's counterpart to the B-52) is "Bear" and, unusually, the Soviets liked it and informally adopted the name themselves. It is certainly fair to say that bears to Russia are like bald eagles to the US. -- <a href="../../../h/u/x/User%7EHux_eafc.html" title="User:Hux">Hux</a> 19:19, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nostrodomus used bears to signify predictions that involved Russia way, way back in the whatever century he was alive. The cartoonist was probably just popularizing a pre-existing symbol. --Mr. Anonymous. 26 November, 2006. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.172.119.210 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.172.119.210_0bcf.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.172.119.210">contribs</a>) 16:28, November 26, 2006.</small>
<dl>
<dd>Or Nostradamus made predictions that involved bears which people later interpreted as being about Russia because people now associate Russia with bears. It's commonly thought that he just made a point of being so vague that, after the fact, people could find ways that given 'prophecies' referred to given events. Don't forget that Nostradamus wrote countless quatrains, only a small fraction of which have ever been claimed to have applied to an actual event.

<p>I doubt that's a kodiak brown bear. Kodiaks have a large hump on their back, above the forelegs, while this bear has the hump near the back, similar to the black bear. Also the bear looks small, while Kodiaks are the largest bear in the world. Can someone verify if that's Kodiak?</p>

<p>In the omnivore article here on Wikipedia it lists bear as omnivorious, and not carnivorious. I think it is omnivore, mainly. some bears are carnivore, but thats just a few bears that don't eat plants and such. the main source of food for the koala is the eucaluptus(plant), and for the panda it's bamboo(a tree) so shouldn't anyone with more scientific weight than my "almost cualified guessing" correct that. (sorry for any typos) - Tae-erom</p>
<dl>
<dd>Confusing, isn't it? Nonetheless, the bear family Ursidae is within the order <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnivora.html" title="Carnivora">Carnivora</a>. If you read the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnivora.html" title="Carnivora">Carnivora</a> entry, it addresses the issue (though I think Giant Pandas should be called omnivores, as they have been known to eat insects, fish, and eggs).
<dl>
<dd>"While the Giant Panda is an herbivore, nearly all others eat meat as their primary diet item: some (like the cat family) almost exclusively, others (like the bears and foxes) are more omnivorous. Members of Carnivora have a characteristic skull shape, and their dentition includes prominent canines and carnassials."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnivore.html" title="Carnivore">Carnivore</a> entry also addresses your point.
<dl>
<dd>"Some animals are considered carnivores even if their diets contain a very small amount of meat. Those animals that subsist on a diet consisting only of meat are refered to as obligate carnivores.</dd>
<dd>"The word also refers to the mammals of the Order Carnivora, many (but not all) of which fit the first definition. Bears are an example of members of Carnivora that are not true carnivores. Carnivores that eat primarily (or only) insects are called insectivores."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There is also a list of carnivores there, of which only the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polar_Bear_e77a.html" title="Polar Bear">Polar Bear</a> is a part.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, you may be interested to know that the <a href="../../../k/o/a/Koala.html" title="Koala">koala</a> is not a bear at all, and the attachment of <i>bear</i> to its name is erroneous - a misconception based on its appearance and aided by popular culture.

<p>I'm not the expert here but somebody needs to look at this section. From what I've gathered what to do depends on the species of bear and the occasion. What I've seen is that it usually is a good idea to try to play dead after being charged by a grizzly but that may not be a good idea if you're dealing with a black bear. It's also worth knowing that climbing a tree (if you have time) may save you from a Grizzly but black bears are perfect climbers in which case you're sunk. There's a hell of a lot to be said about what to do when confronted by a bear (or confronting one if you're stupid enough) but I'm going to leave that to someone preferably who has working experience with the animal. 84.160.249.14 04:22, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it might be appriopriate to mention that the skeletal structure of a bear is very similar to a human being.</p>
<p>This is just a fact that I picked up one day when I was reading National Geographics.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Some info I have found on the subject: "The skeletal features, together wit the muscles attached to them, give the bears dexterity in using their limbs-more or less in the manner of human beings (fig. II)."</p>
<p>From California Grizzly, by Storer and Lloyd Trevis.</p>
<p>However, this only deals with Brown Bears (Ursus arctos), so things may very between the other Bear species, as, Brown Bears for example display a greater dexterity in their paws then Black Bears, for example, as demonstrated by:</p>
<p>"Mills (1919&#160;: 253), writing of the animal in the Rockies, said: "The grizzly is exceptionally expert and agile with his paws. With either the fore paw he can strike like a sledge-hammer or lift a heavy weight. He boxes or strikes with lightning-like rapidity. Most grizzlies are right-handed . . . If a small object is to be touched or moved, he will daintily use but one claw. The black bear would use the entire paw.""</p>
<p>[Source for this is once again California Grizzly; however, their source, as written, for this is Mills (1919&#160;: 253)].</p>
<p>And it should also be tooken into notice that Bears do, however, possess more massive, and heavier, bones then Humans.</p>
<p>And, on a final note, something that is actually largely unrelated to the skeletal structure of Bears, I found a source for something that needs citation that was written in the main page/article of "Bears": "Bears are far stronger than other carnivores, and their limbs are more flexible and agile." - <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572258/Bear.html" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572258/Bear.html" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572258/Bear.html</a></p>

Additionally, bears as "killing machines" is not without merit considering the evolutionary path in which they have taken.

This has had a major impact on populations of bears around the world. Thousands of bears are farmed for their bile in China, Vietnam, and Korea. They are kept in appalling conditions and usually have bile drained from their gallbladders using catheters inserted into their abdomen or with <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypodermic.html" title="Hypodermic">hypodermic</a> needles. There is no evidence to suggest that farming bears has reduced pressures on wild bear populations. Indeed the farming of bears in China has led to a huge increase in consumption of bear bile since the 1980s with many people prepared to pay very high prices for the 'superior' bile of a wild bear.</li>

<p>I do not understand why there is so much antagonism to documenting this particular aspect of human/bear relations. There is a long tradition of Roma people training bears, and by extension, mimicking bears as this boy is doing.

Perhaps it would be more appropriate to first write up a paragraph on this in the article, but that aside I do not see any good excuse to delete what is a culturally significant image. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 02:42, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would challenge both of those assertions.</p>
<p>The site was set up in November 2006, and has been running very reliably since then. I have tested the site thoroughly and given it adequate time to prove its reliability and usefulness, before announcing it to other sites such as Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As for "plenty of better resources already included", as far as I can determine, all of the other information included in the Bears page on Wikipedia is static information, or links to other sites which only include static information; or information which is updated only infrequently at best. If there is another site in the world which provides links to worldwide news about bears which is always up-to-date and continuously updated, please point me to the site!</p>

I would have to agree with the editor who removed the link; the link is self-promotional and does not really help the article as a comprehensive resource. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 23:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I would ask: where do you go to read news about bears? I you try using the search engines, you will likely get far more articles about sports teams, stock traders, and burly homosexual men than you will about real bears. It takes a lot of sifting through a lot of different sources to find news stories about bears. The purpose of this site is to spare anyone who is looking for news on bears from having to make that effort.</p>
<p>If the number of articles seems few, it is in part due to the fact that there aren't all that many stories about bears in the news. I have also put considerable effort into filtering out most of the duplicates. (The same story is often posted on multiple news sites.)</p>
<p>I have changed the display interval on the site so that it now shows articles going back to December. (It previously was set to only go back two weeks.) Does it look better now?</p>

<p>There's a contradiction with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Black_Bear_aef4.html" title="American Black Bear">American Black Bear</a> regarding what to do in the event of a bear attack. This article suggests playing dead or peek-a-boo with the bear. That one suggests fighting it. I don't think it's useful to have a section on the subject in this article, because the best response is dependent on the species.--<a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENonpareility_99db.html" title="User:Nonpareility">Nonpareility</a> 17:42, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
