<p>I think we should avoid "vital stats" lists in WP articles on fictional characters, as their info is usually unverifiable, vague, a subject of significant debate, and/or simply not interesting writing. I've removed the info from this article, especially as it also duplicates some of the info in the existing text. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Rawdon_b11f.html" title="User:Michael Rawdon">mhr</a> 03:52, 9 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmm, do we really want to boldface the real names of superheroes on WP? That seems a bit distracting to me. -<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Rawdon_b11f.html" title="User:Michael Rawdon">mhr</a> 01:45, 11 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed this from the main article because I agree that it really doesn't belong here. Since large numbers of these "vital stats" sections have been added to various articles, I'm using <a href="../../../s/t/r/Talk%7EStrength_level_%28comics%29_b250.html" title="Talk:Strength level (comics)">Talk:Strength level (comics)</a> to discuss this in general. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:58, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note: Hank McCoy once appeared almost completely human, with the exception of unusually large hands and feet. However, due to his attempts to scientifically remove the effects of his genetic mutation completely from his body he accidentally accellerated his mutation transforming him into an ape-like figure, which he retaind for a period of many years. However, after recently recieving a severe wound from the villain Vargas, Hank's body underwent another mutation in which he mutated in to a larger feline form. Many of Hank's original superhuman abilities, most notably his strength, stamina, and healing ability, are at much greater levels in his current form.</li>

<p>The references have been put in order of use in the article. Most of the information is from the <i>Official Marvel Comics Site</i>. <i>The Xavier Files</i> reveals that he possesses a "<b>superhuman</b> intellect", which means he was born with a vast intellect, as it suggests that it is a power. However, this is not confirmed in other sources, and if it is a power he would lose his brilliant mind while in the Savage Land. In <i>The Uncanny X-Men #308</i>, <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclops_%28comics%29.html" title="Cyclops (comics)">Cyclops</a> says that Beast has a doctorate in biophysics. <i>X-Men: The Ultimate Guide</i> states that he is on par with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor_X_9919.html" title="Professor X">Xavier</a> in genius. <i>Science of the X-Men</i> explains genetic atavism and neoteny as related to Beast's mutation. <i>X-Men: Reign of Apocalypse Hero Handbook</i> was an official website (now removed) that showed Beast's role in the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legacy_Virus_77ea.html" title="Legacy Virus">Legacy Virus</a> and his reading of Proust. The <i>Wolverine's Revenge</i> website states that Beast is a Renaissance Man, and <i>The Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game</i> lists many of Dr. McCoy's specialties. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.253.120.206.html" title="User:24.253.120.206">24.253.120.206</a> 16:48, 15 Jan 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im pretty sure that in the original marvel continuity Beasts parents accept and love him, i seem to remember a Post Onslaught visit with Franklin Richards and Atrie and Leech</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dead right. Ultimate Beast was apparently rejected by his parents (until he became famous, when they sold out to the media. So he horrified them with his black girlfriend), but mainstream Beast still has a good relationship with his parents (so good, in fact, that Dark Beast was unable to bring himself to kill them).</dd>

<p>Wouldn't an image of him in his original form (furless) be useful on here since it's the way he existed for his for 16 years as a character? The "Cover to Astonishing X-Men #4" comes close, but it shows a black and white, upside down, distorted-looking image.

<li>I agree, there needs to be a pre blue beast, at least so we can compare with how he looks to kelsey grammer, as I think the two are pretty similar.

<li>I love the idea of using that picture. Most people don't understand that Beast was blue only after a while of being an X-man. And, most people don't understand that those two versions are the same person.Derek Chase 04:04, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>In the <i>Danger</i> storyline written by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joss_Whedon_368c.html" title="Joss Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>, the Beast clearly lets his "animal" side take over while fighting (and overcoming) Danger in Genosha. Earlier on, during <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Morrison_1462.html" title="Grant Morrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <i>E is for Extinction</i> story arc he also stated that trying to fight Cassandra Nova with his brains when she first revealed herself (and made <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beak_%28comics%29.html" title="Beak (comics)">Beak</a> beat him into a coma) was a mistake, and then let loose a deep animal growl with Wolverine by his side. He's also been seen holding his own against Wolverine in terms of savagery when they fought over his temptation to cure himself from his mutation with Dr. Rao's medecine in the <i>Gifted</i> storyline (also by Whedon).</p>
<p>That's an unusual behaviour for a character whose genius-level IQ had always been preeminent, and it seems likely that his feline form has been affecting his self-perception and allowed him to rely on his increased animal instinct and heightened senses when needed, while retaining his usual genius and humour in most cases. These facts make him the other "animal-minded" Astonishing X-Man, alongside <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine_%28comics%29.html" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine</a>. --<a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmic_Camel_Clash_ec24.html" title="User:Cosmic Camel Clash">Cosmic Camel Clash</a> 00:21, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
