<p>Okay.... we have to settle this once and for all. There are obviously reasons to believe that either of these two are Optimus' second-in-command but we can't keep going back and forth like this. Regardless of Rhinox being the more trusted advisor to Optimus, the show itself has made fairly clear Rattrap's the second-in-command. In "Chain of Command" Optimus put Rattrap in charge. In "Aftermath" and "The Coming of the Fuzors" Rattrap was also in charge even saying to himself at one point "Optimus, how did you do it?" Rhinox, despite not taking any crap from Dinobot who was using this opportunity to appoint himself leader, never truly took command.</p>
<p>But at any rate, regardless of the fact that I think it's pretty clear Rattrap was the true second-in-command, the fact that this is such a point of contention proves there's no right or wrong, and thus Wikipedia shouldn't be referring to either of them as the definitive second-in-command. Maybe there's some way to make it clear that <i>both</i> are lieutenants in different areas? Optimus tends to look to Rhinox for advice and seems to trust him with his more private thoughts, but when he's not there Optimus seems to expect Rattrap to be in control. --148.61.207.67 02:40, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "official" things I could point to are 1. 10th Anniversary Rhinox's tech spec says he's second in command. 2. In the final episode Optimus Primal radios Rhinox and tells him to start operation eternity, which Rattrap hasn't even heard of, and Rhinox orders them all around. 3. Going by the tech specs, after Optimus Primal's rank of 10, Cheetor and Dinobot had ranks of 6s and Rattrap had 5s, but with the revised numbers from the 10th Anniversary toys Rhinox was upgraded to rank 8, making him the second highest ranking Maximal online in the revised story. The Timelines Rhinox toy ALSO had an 8 rank. user:mathewignash</dd>

<dd>The show doesn't explicitly call either of them the second in command, I think that's all there is to it. I don't thnk anything with the toys are canon in the series. After all, the show doesn't include like... three/fourths of the Beast Wars toy characters. Plus, Rattrap clearly isn't Cheetor's inferior rankwise in the show. There are reasons to suspect the second-in-command is Rattrap and there are reasons to suspect the second-in-command is Rhinox. I consider Rattrap second-in-command but I'm not of the opinion that Wikipedia should reflect as such because it's been up for debate for a long time. Hell, Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward's official Beast Wars story bible refers to Rattrap as second-in-command and I'm <i>still</i> reluctant to support the idea that we refer to Rattrap as second-in-command 'cause it wasn't said in show and all the reasons that support Rhinox as well. Wikipedia is supposed to only give facts and the facts show that no one's ever been called Optimus' second-in-command on Beast Wars. --148.61.207.67 06:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rattrap is put in command during the episode “Chain of Command” but during the “Coming of Fuzors ‘Part 1-2” Rhinox is definitely in command, talking down to Dinobot and giving Rattrap and Cheetor orders. I think putting Rattrap in command during “Chain of Command” was done for humor and because the characters were not fully established yet. Rattrap also clearly says at the end that he does not wish to have any kind of command position. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Matrix_Prime_8105.html" title="User:The Matrix Prime">The Matrix Prime</a> 18:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rhinox says he wants no command position either in "Dark Designs." While it's very nice that you think Rattrap being put in charge was done for humor, that's an opinion, not a fact, and thus is irrelevant. Besides at the end of the episode they established that Rattrap did a good job as commander in Optimus' absence, Dinobot apologizing for not having followed his commands initially. Regardless, Rhinox is not second-in-command. I'm reverting the recent edit where someone is saying otherwise because they're wrong. Rhinox is not in command in "Coming of the Fuzors", he's off "chasing comets with his mind" playing no role in any of the proceedings except getting Optimus back. Rattrap is the only one doing any commanding, issuing all the orders. In "Aftermath", Rhinox does issue a "command" when he's just heard of what happened to Optimus and yes Rattrap did follow it. However, it was also just something that made sense and Rattrap's certainly not a stickler for everyone showing him his due respect. However, yes, "Aftermath" is an episode that implies Rhinox is second-in-command while "Chain of Command" and "Coming of the Fuzors" both imply Rattrap is. There's discrepencies and obviously not enough fact to make a factual claim on Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Mathewignash, Rattrap was never called second-in-command in <i>Chain of Command</i>, he was given the role of acting commander. While, yes, that does imply Rattrap is second-in-command, it doesn't mean it's stated. However, an argument for Rattrap being specifically labled as second-in-command in this article certainly carries a lot more weight than one for Rhinox. Even the shows creators referred to Rattrap as such in the show's bible. However, since not everyone agrees on that, as I said, I'm not necessarily in favor of that change being made. But to call Rhinox second-in-command based on show's evidence is an out-and-out lie. --148.61.207.67 18:58, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As someone already said, the official bio and tech says Rhinox is in second in command. In "Aftermath" and "The Coming of the Fuzor" Rhinox is definitely in command during the Predacon attack on the Maximal Base. Later Rhinox decides (not on Rattrap’s orders but on his own command authority) to retrieve Optimus’ spark. Rattrap does not appear to be in charge even after, Dinobot and Cheetor and Rattrap are shown working together, not taking orders from any one of them. Both "Aftermath" and "The Coming of the Fuzors" heavily imply Rhinox as second in command.</p>
<p>This goes on throughout the second season and gets even stronger in third season where even Blackarachnia implied that Optimus and Rhinox were the leader in both "Proving Grounds and "Crossing the Rubicon" and also in the Predacon attack of <i>The Ark</i> during "Cutting Edge" Rhinox is clearly in charge over Rattrap. Finally in "The Nemesis" while Optimus is fight Megatron in Decepticon ship Rhinox is leading the Maximal evacuation and even pilots the Autobot shuttle after the Dinobot Clone sends the Maximals the information.</p>
<p>Even in "Maximal No More" Dinobot is given his first command and who is taking his orders alone with Silverbolt? That’s right, Rattrap! Hardly what the second in command of the Maximals would be expected to do.</p>
<p>Stepping out of <i>Beast Wars</i>, in <i>Beast Machines</i> Cheetor is made second in command without any fuss from Rattrap. The Maximals clearly remember Optimus being their "fearless leader" yet not one of them turns to Rattrap expecting him to issue an order whether Optimus is around or not. Cheetor even comments on how Optimus would have trusted Rhinox but not them in a later episode. When Cheetor assumes command Rattrap does not even make an attempt to pull rank.</p>
<p>Fact is the only time Rattrap in shown in charge is in "Chain of Command" and that it. The both <i>Beast Wars</i> and <i>Beast Machines</i> clearly the writers did not consider him to be next in rank after Optimus and hoped fans would ignore "Chain of Command". Besides, the articles aren’t limited to the TV Show, we have comics and voice shows and everything listed in there, surely the official Hasbro bios pull some weight here, especially in light that the "10th Anniversary" toys were both repainted and rewritten to be CLOSER to the show.</p>
<p>I’m sorry you think it is an out-and-out lie but your opinion there is irrelevant and untrue. Rhinox is second in command, his official bio and tech says so, deal with it. The article can be writen to say he was never expressly labeled as second in command but it never said he was - just that was the equivalent of his position and function.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Matrix_Prime_8105.html" title="User:The Matrix Prime">The Matrix Prime</a> 01:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What happened in Beast Machines is irrelevant, because much characterization was wrong there, (although Rattrap's diminished position within the group can easilly be explained with his initial inability to transform, his comparative lack of power and his treachery in "The Weak Component.") Anyway, a lot of this stuff is your opinion. "In such and such it appears as if Rhinox is command." "In that episode, it doesn't seem like Rattrap is in a position of command." etc. etc. It doesn't matter how things look to you. The show never called Rhinox second-in-command, end of story. While I disagree with your interpretation of a lot of the examples you cited (for example I think "Coming of the Fuzors" clearly suggests Rattrap, not Rhinox is in charge, while "Aftermath" suggests the opposite) none of that matters. What the show says, not what certain people have inferred, is what matters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You brought up the toy calling Rhinox second-in-command. Okay, and the official show bible written by Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward calls Rattrap second-in-command. While I would be more likely to go with the one written by Forward and DiTillio rather than one written by some guy at Hasbro, I think they both sort of cancel each other out. Again, while I think the show implies that Rattrap is second-in-command, I perfectly understand your thinking it's Rhinox. If this was a debate about whether second-in-command was Rattrap or... Cheetor or Tigatron or something, I'd think you were foolish, but definitely not in this scenario. There is much to suggest that Rhinox *is* second-in-command, but that's all it is... things that suggest it. It's not unquestionable fact. To be placed on Wikipedia, I believe it has to be unquestionable fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One last thing, I think it's probably more likely that the chain of command within the group is fluid. You're right, Dinobot did lead the mission in "Maximal No More" because it was in Predacon ground and he knew it best. The Maximals of Beast Wars don't really seem to be sticklers for chains of command like the Predacons are. That's why I think the more logical scenario is that Rattrap and Rhinox both sort of function as subcommanders to Optimus, and the various other Maximals are all of relatively similar (but fluctuating) rank underneath them.--148.61.207.67 18:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Since we’ve said a lot about this, does anyone else besides myself and Numbers have anything to add? To either Rhinox or Rattrap.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Matrix_Prime_8105.html" title="User:The Matrix Prime">The Matrix Prime</a> 23:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow. Much of that is blatantly untrue. Unless you're able to point out how Rhinox appeared to be second-in-command in, say, "Go With the Flow" with his single line of "Oh no." The fact is only a handful of episodes could possibly be construed as offering us any information whatsoever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What was so humorous about Rattrap being commander in "Chain of Command"? Nothing about it was played for punchlines. Dinobot solemnly and earnestly admitted he was dishonored by not following Rattrap's commands and Optimus, in all seriousness, told Rattrap he did a good job commanding in his absence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The episodes of "Coming of the Fuzors" (one of the few episodes that do shed any light on this), implies Rattrap, not Rhinox, is second-in-command. In a brief moment of peace before the battle, Rattrap wonders to himself "Optimus, how did you do it?" Clearly indicating that Rattrap is the current Maximal commander.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't have the specific link to Rattrap's show bible article handy, but I can tell you it's found on seibertron.com</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, say it with me now, ALL OF THIS IS IRRELEVANT. This isn't a debate on who we think seems the most like second-in-command, this is a debate about who the show flat-out says to be second-in-command. Which is no one. All we have to go on are our hunches and two conflicting reports from official, but non-show, sources that refer to both Rattrap and Rhinox as second-in-command. Referring to either as second-in-command is thus not fully accurate and can not be depicted on Wikipedia. The most we can reasonably say about Maximal rank is perhaps that Rattrap and Rhinox are both lieutenants or subcommanders to Optimus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you didn't credit your last post on the discussion page which you are required to do. --148.61.207.67 23:16, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for that entirely irrelevant commentary there, but the actual debate is whether or not Rhinox should be listed as second in command. Clearly you’ve said all you have to say on the subject, Numbers, now you’re just endlessly repeating yourself. So now I’m asking if any one else would like to add something, not you, someone else. The fact is that there is evidence in the show and Rhinox bio says he is second in command, it is reasonable to put that in his article, with a note saying that in “Chain of Command” and in <i>Beast Wars</i> show bible (after confirmation) that Rattrap was portrayed that way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First: The qoute: "Optimus, how did you do it?" is a referance how Optimus dealt with Cheetor, not command. Second Rhinox is ALREADY OFFLINE at that point, which means he cannot be giving orders, which leaves the three Maximals on their own. Thank you for the Seibertron information, I'll try to look it up and see what I find.</dd>

<dd>As for that being what Rattrap meant, to put it quite bluntly... says you. I don't agree and the show certainly didn't make it clear. Of course the show also didn't make it absolutely clear that my interpretation is right, either, and thus I'm not expecting Rattrap to be listed as second-in-command either. The vast majority of your "evidence" is your interpretations of various actions or comments that could just as likely not be what you think they are. Your opinions are not facts.</dd>

<dd>I don't understand why you have such trouble comprehending that all that matters is what is flat-out stated or made unquestionably clear as Wikipedia is a place for fact and not opinions. Wikipedia only works if the only think it states are facts and it hinges on the hope that people will put their personal opinions and viewpoints on things aside, and realize certain things are facts and certain things are not. If you want to start your own opinion-based website wherein you write a long essay explaining why you think Rhinox is second-in-command, go nuts. The fact of the matter is, the show certainly didn't make it inarguably clear that almost anything you're saying and suggesting be put in this article is true. Until this sinks in, it doesn't seem likely (at this point) that I will stop adding to this, regardless of your preference. --148.61.207.67 05:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

His choice to swap US to Canada is based on the production company being located in Canada, though it may be best to display it as US/Canada given its distribution and relationship to various American companies. Also, I put in information about the Emmy awarded for the show, as I did not see it displayed. Despite being a vague, small award, it's a significant achievment. - Orion Minor</p>
<p>Reply: Only if American Shows put "/[Insert Asian Country where art was done]" in their country list. Personally I think listing only Canada is accurate. --Aldrius 22:23, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fans came up with the name Dark Side for the ship is based on one line in the show where Terrorsaur says "Welcome to the dark side!" when he greets Cheetor to the ship. It was later used in the video game and in the DVD insert as the name of the Predacon ship, which makes it more official. user:Mathewignash</dd>

<p>Are these BotCon comics that involve several characters coming back to life included in Beast Wars canon? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Hart_0932.html" title="User:Jon Hart">Jon Hart</a> 01:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know this is a very late response, but yes, they most certainly are. The BotCon comics are official Hasbro fiction, and as such, are considered to be in-canon. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Love_22fe.html" title="User:Chris Love">Chris Love</a> 00:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No, they cannot be considered canon in the usually sense. Canon is the TV shows, the comic books, no matter who they're published by are not canon but Expanded Universe. It's not as bad as a ripoff/parallel universe" thing but still not the same as being in the TV shows. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Matrix_Prime_8105.html" title="User:The Matrix Prime">The Matrix Prime</a> 03:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Uh, no? You sound like some guy who really liked Aqua Teen Hunger Force that I used to know. Said comics are (or at the least *were*) considered full-on canon in the main TF universe. They may not be *now* because 3H, the producers of the old Botcon convention and comics, no longer have the liscense, and IDW is producing new BW material, their status of canon is in question. But it's certainetly *not* because They're Comix, Nut Shoes. And yes that is an intentional shot at your misspelling of Shows. Onslaught Six 11:41, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What is cannon when discussing Transformers? It's certainly not as strict as Star Wars (for example). I have never heard any Hasbro/Takara representative say that the TV shows have presedence over comics or vice-versa.

<p>I don't really care if you like Aqua Teen Hunger Force or not, its not relevent to this article as you should well know. But this article is about the TV show "Beast Wars". Comic books about the show can be mentioned here but Botcom comics and the like really ought to have their own page. As far as this article in concerned "canon" can be considered as to what appeared in the TV shows themselves. For the rest I agree with Crockalley: the readers can decided for themselves.

<dd>Please site sources that state the TV show is more canon that the comics. Where are you getting this anti-comic book sentiment? The comics mentioned in the article are embedded in the Beast Wars timeline, and thus relevant. If you'll recall, not only was the first G1 comic released before the first episode of the G1 cartoon, but a great many comics were written by the same man who wrote the tech specs for the toys. AND, some concepts in the Beast Wars cartoon came from the G1 comic. Why would you sideline comics now, when in the past they have proven to be in integral part of Transformers lore? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockalley_07e4.html" title="User:Crockalley">Crockalley</a> 14:46, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anonymous contributor placed in a section called "season 3 controversy." The piece is mostly opinion, and lacks facts, simply stating that "many feel" a certain way and that an even causes "controversy." It should either be expanded upon, with counter points and explanations of why certain decisions were made, or removed. There was controversy around season 3, but it is not being explained in that section.--<a href="../../../o/r/i/User%7EOrion_Minor_1b72.html" title="User:Orion Minor">Orion Minor</a> 21:12, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is in need of cleaning up. Herea are a few things I think should be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pilot and Further Adventures sections should be combined to a Storyline section.</li>
<li>All character information should be added to the characters' seperate articles.</li>
<li>The Transmetal section should be shortened and link to the main Transmetal section.</li>
<li>Sequel should be re-titled Beast Machines and link to the main Beast Machines article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to discuss my reccomendations. I will help clean up. However, I will be unable to do much in regards to the Storyline as I do not recall much of the series and don't have enough free time to make all changes myself. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceDrake523_e684.html" title="User:IceDrake523">IceDrake523</a> 20:30, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you on the cleanup, and can offer information on the storyline and/or character info. Regarding the article itself, I propose the following changes, some to enhance on what you have suggested:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pilot section is too long and needs editing. A summary as opposed to a guide.</li>
<li>The Further Adventures section would be more accessable if it were separated into Seasons 1, 2, and 3. Transmetals would therefore fall into season 2 and Transmetal IIs into season 3.</li>
<li>Summarise the Beast Machines section and leave a link to the main article.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can proceed right away with the changes, but would rather this be a joint cleanup effort. (<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllriffnoraff_c6d3.html" title="User:Allriffnoraff">Allriffnoraff</a> 22:37, 16 May 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>In my opinion, he only handicap of this cartoon could be the lack of Air Hammer (the hammerhead shark/eagle Maximal Fuzor). He could have form a sarcastic "comic duo" with Rattrap, or could have been Silverbolt's comic counterpart. Egr, 6/7/2006</p>

<dd>Oh, please. If we're going to argue about what toyline characters 'really' should've been included in the artoon, we could be here for a stellar cycle. Skyshadow? Magnaboss? Tripredacus on Earth? Tigerhawk being around for more than three eps? The Ark actually taking off as planned and battling the Nemesis in the finale, plus Dirge, Ramjet and Thrust appearing? The list of stuff that 'would' make the cartoon a lot better is endless... Onslaught Six 00:52, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is my theory: Beast Wars was originally going to be connected to G1 Cartoon but it's obvious to me that it's not. Here are some of my ideas (note: part of this theory also includes Beast Machines) Oh-pls respond: 1.if the autobots and decepticons had existed for millions of years how did the maximals and predacons come to be 2.when megatron 2 took over cybertron in beast machines wouldn't there be survivors on earth (after all humans and autobots worked together in G1 cartoon 3. how did the predacons gain a foot hold on cybertron (the decepticons were never able to permanently return to cyberton has seen in G1 Cartoon) 4. when exactly did the 2nd golden age of cybertron end, after all it seemed it would last for ever other key issues include the time in the future that beast machines happens in (why the EDC was not involved or why many of the aliens in the G1 Cartoon do not appear any more). I almost fogot: 5. Cybertron was always described to be an artificial planet created by the quintessons, since when was it organic 6. where is unicrons head (it's never seen in the background of cybertron) Again-pls respond</p>
<p><br />
The official line is that BW and BM exist in a universe that merges elements of both the G1 cartoon and the Marvel comics, even though it seems to draw more on the cartoon (a history thing on one of the recent DVDs mentions the Liege Maximo). But you bring you some good points.</p>
<p>Possible answers.</p>
<p>1. Its established that the defeated Decepticons and the Autobots, downsizing into new more fuel-efficient bodies, became the Predacons and Maximals. Maybe the faction name change happened then. Furman's <i>Alignment</i> goes with this line.</p>
<p>2. Possibly Cybertron had withdrawn contact from earth by this tme for reasons unknown (possibly if the Cons were defeated then they wouldn't see any need to endanger the humans any further). Certainly humans are never mentoned in BM.</p>
<p>3. Theres a big gap between the end of G1 and BW. Possibly events transpired that we didnt see, such as the Cons returning. Even the Japanese <i>Headmasters</i> show could be taken as how Galvatron, Scorponok et all were defeated. Alternately it could be that the Maximals allowed em back on in the wake of their defeat.</p>
<p>4. Probably when Megs returned with the virus.</p>
<p>5. As Mat pointed out elsewhere, theres shown to be flowers growing on Cybertron in the very first ep of BM. How is unclear, but there is precedent.</p>
<p>6. No idea. Wasn't it blown out of orbit in the episode with Starscream's ghost? In any case Rattrap does mention it once in BM, comparing it to Megatron's floating head fortress.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all (my) speculation and something we really shouldnt do. Hope that helps.<a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESMegatron_23bf.html" title="User:SMegatron">SMegatron</a> 12:49, 1 September 2006 (UTC) ThankS from MR UNSEEN</p>

I spent some time yesterday on this article, it took a frazackin' long time, and the editor after me (today) even noted their spell-checker gagged on it. I'm thinking the character section could be moved to a separate article, and very brief identifications of the characters left in its place. Beyond that I dunno.

<p>In Primal's bio is states that, "In all of Primal's forms, he was able to fly in robot mode with turbojets he called 'Prime Jets'." But in his Transmetal body he could only fly in his beast mode using his hover board, so should this be corrected? 1987olds442 13:33, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are incorrect. Transmetal Optimus Primal flew in robot mode in the first episode of season 3. In the scene where he takes the spark of Optimus Prime, he flies up in robot mode to Optimus Prime and takes the spark. You can even see jets coming out of his feet! He only called them "Primejets" in his season 1 form though. He also flew in robot form in his Optimal Optimus upgrade at least once. user:mathewignash</p>
