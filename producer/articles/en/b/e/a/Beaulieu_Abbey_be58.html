<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaulieu_Abbey_be58.html" title="Edit section: Early history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h2>
<p>The first <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbot.html" title="Abbot">Abbot</a> of Beaulieu was Hugh, a man who stood high in the king's favour and who often served him on important diplomatic missions. The king granted his new abbey a rich endowment, including numerous manors spread across southern England (particularly in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkshire.html" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>), land in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Forest_16bd.html" title="New Forest">New Forest</a>, corn, large amounts of money, building materials, 120 cows, 12 bulls, a golden chalice, and an annual <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tun.html" title="Tun">tun</a> of wine. John's son and successor, King <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III_of_England_cd17.html" title="Henry III of England">Henry III</a> was equally generous to Beaulieu, with the result that the abbey became very wealthy, though it was far from the richest English Cistercian house.</p>
<p>The abbey's buildings were of a scale and magnificence reflecting its status as an important royal foundation. The church was a vast <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruciform.html" title="Cruciform">cruciform</a> structure in early <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">gothic</a> style and heavily influenced by French churches of the order, especially those of Cîteaux, Bonport and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvaux.html" title="Clairvaux">Clairvaux</a>. The church was 102m long and had a semi-circular <a href="../../../a/p/s/Apse.html" title="Apse">apse</a> with 11 radiating chapels. The building took more than four decades to complete and was finally dedicated in <a href="../../../1/2/4/1246.html" title="1246">1246</a>, in the presence of King <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_III_of_England_cd17.html" title="Henry III of England">Henry III</a> and his queen, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard%2C_Earl_of_Cornwall_7fc3.html" title="Richard, Earl of Cornwall">Richard, Earl of Cornwall</a>, and many prelates and nobles.</p>
<p>South of the church stood a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloister.html" title="Cloister">cloister</a>, ranged around which were the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapter_house.html" title="Chapter house">chapter house</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refectory.html" title="Refectory">refectory</a>, kitchens, storehouse and quarters for the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk.html" title="Monk">monks</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/y/Lay_brothers.html" title="Lay brothers">lay brothers</a> and the abbot. A separate <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infirmary.html" title="Infirmary">infirmary</a> complex lay to the east of the main buildings, connected to them by a passage. The abbey was surrounded by workshops, farm buildings, guesthouses, a mill, and extensive gardens and fishponds. Strongly fortified gatehouses controlled entry to the monastic enclosure, which was defended by a wall. A water gate allowed access to ships in the river.</p>
<p>Pope <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocent_III_0dee.html" title="Innocent III">Innocent III</a> constituted Beaulieu an "exempt abbey", meaning that the abbot had to answer to no <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> save the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> himself. Beaulieu was also invested with the right to offer sanctuary; and this was sought in <a href="../../../1/4/7/1471.html" title="1471">1471</a> by <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Beauchamp_4bf7.html" title="Anne Beauchamp">Ann Neville</a>, wife of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Neville%2C_Earl_of_Warwick_b3a7.html" title="Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick">Warwick the King-maker</a>, the day before the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Barnet_3112.html" title="Battle of Barnet">battle of Barnet</a>. Twenty-six years later <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perkin_Warbeck_b45d.html" title="Perkin Warbeck">Perkin Warbeck</a> fled to Beaulieu from the pursuing armies of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VII_of_England_2c03.html" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII</a>.</p>
<p>Monks from Beaulieu founded four daughter houses, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netley_Abbey_cc44.html" title="Netley Abbey">Netley Abbey</a> (1239), <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hailes.html" title="Hailes">Hailes Abbey</a>, (1246), Newenham Abbey (1247) and St Mary Graces Abbey (1350).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaulieu_Abbey_be58.html" title="Edit section: Dissolution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dissolution</span></h2>
<p>In 1535 the abbey's income was assessed in the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valor_Ecclesiasticus_9062.html" title="Valor Ecclesiasticus">Valor Ecclesiasticus</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a>'s great survey of church finances, at £428 gross, £326 net, which meant that it escaped being confiscated under the terms of the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries_9b7b.html" title="Dissolution of the Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>.</p>
<p>The last abbot of Beaulieu was <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Stevens_%28monk%29_bdf8.html" title="Thomas Stevens (monk)">Abbot Thomas Stevens</a>, elected in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1536.html" title="1536">1536</a>. Stevens was the former abbot of the recently dissolved abbey of Netley, across <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southampton_Water_2e8b.html" title="Southampton Water">Southampton Water</a>. Beaulieu managed to survive until April 1538, at which point it was finally forced to surrender to the government. Many of the monks were granted pensions, the abbot receiving 100 marks per year. Abbot Thomas ended his days as treasurer of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salisbury_Cathedral_2cb7.html" title="Salisbury Cathedral">Salisbury Cathedral</a>. He died in 1550.</p>
<p>Shortly before the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries_9b7b.html" title="Dissolution of the Monasteries">dissolution</a> of the monastery in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1538.html" title="1538">1538</a>, the Visitors' report mentioned that "thirty-two sanctuary-men, who were here for debt, felony, or murder", were living within the monastic precincts with their wives and families. When the abbey was dissolved there was some debate about what to do with them, however, in the end it was decided, after pleading by the abbot and certain government officials, to allow the debtors to live in their houses on the abbey grounds permanently. Pardons were given to some of the criminals too, including one Thomas Jeynes, a murderer.</p>
<p>After Beaulieu fell there was much competition amongst <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtier.html" title="Courtier">courtiers</a> to gain ownership of the abbey and its valuable estates, but eventually <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Wriothesley%2C_1st_Earl_of_Southampton_e1e5.html" title="Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton">Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton</a>, won the struggle and King Henry granted him the abbey itself and 3,441ha of the Beaulieu lands.</p>
<p>As soon as he took over, Wriothesley set about building himself a house on the site. He demolished the church, as was common practice but, unusually, instead of converting the remainder of the abbey buildings into a home he chose the great gatehouse as the core of his mansion. This survives - much extended - as the modern country house at Beaulieu known as Palace House. Lord Southampton preserved the monks' refectory, which he gave to the people of Beaulieu village to be their <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish.html" title="Parish">parish</a> church, a function it still serves today. The west range of the abbey, known as the '<a href="../../../d/o/m/Domus.html" title="Domus">Domus</a>' was also saved. The rest of the abbey was allowed to fall to ruin.</p>

<p>Although a great deal was destroyed at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the reign of Henry VIII, there is still much to see. The Domus, once the lay brothers' refectory and lodgings and, later, chambers for important guests once the lay brothers had vanished, now houses an exhibition of monastic life prior to Thomas Wriothesley's takeover. Visitors can view a series of modern embroidered wall hangings made by Belinda, Lady Montagu depicting scenes from mediaeval monastic life and the history of the Abbey since 1204. The abbey refectory survives as the parish church and there are substantial ruins of the other buildings round the cloister. The abbey cloister is a place of tranquillity, planted with fragrant herbs. The Domus is now regularly used for events, dining and corporate hospitality. Beaulieu remains in the hands of the descendents of Wriothesley, who still live there. Both the abbey and Palace House are open to the public. The grounds are home to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Motor_Museum_d9ca.html" title="National Motor Museum">National Motor Museum</a>.</p>

<p>Like many former monastic sites, Beaulieu has its fair share of legends attached. Ghostly monks have been reported in the abbey ruins and in the parish church and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_chant.html" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a> and ghostly footsteps are said to have been in heard. The smell of incense has been reported in rooms of Palace House once used as chapels in the middle ages. According to legend, this manifestation signals tragedy for the people of the abbey or Beaulieu village. The abbey is also said to have a post-Reformation ghost, a grey lady who is seen in Palace House. She is said to be the shade of an 18th century inhabitant of the house, Lady Isabella. The abbey was visited by Most Haunted Live on October 31st 2003 for an investigation by Yvette Fielding and Richard Felix.</p>
