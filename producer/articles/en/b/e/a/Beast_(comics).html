<p>Henry's mutation more fully manifests during adolescence, providing greater strength and agility, and although his powers allow him to briefly excel in athletics during his remaining time at school, he soon attracts the animosity of his fellow students and other non-mutant humans. As he seeks refuge, he is approached by <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor_X_9919.html" title="Professor X">Professor Charles Xavier</a>, who invites him to study at "<a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Mansion_316f.html" title="X-Mansion">Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters</a>". Henry recognizes the opportunities that such an institution can afford him and accepts the offer. He finds the school both a font of scientific knowledge and a place of sanctuary and is there introduced to the <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_5b6b.html" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>, who accept him into their ranks and give him the codename Beast. Alongside workouts in the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danger_Room_e222.html" title="Danger Room">Danger Room</a>, he studies subjects ranging from <a href="../../../d/i/f/Differential_equation.html" title="Differential equation">differential equations</a> to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proust.html" title="Proust">Proust</a> under Xavier's tutelage.</p>

<p>Hank leaves the X-men shortly after his twentieth birthday, claiming that he is no longer one of the "strangest teens of all." In <i>Amazing Adventures</i> (vol. 2) #11, He becomes a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research.html" title="Research">research</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientist</a> at the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brand_Corporation_d65b.html" title="Brand Corporation">Brand Corporation</a>, a genetics research facility. His assistant, Linda Donaldson, quickly becomes his girlfriend. Hank isolates a "<a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormone.html" title="Hormone">hormonal</a> extract" that allows anyone to become a mutant for a short period of time, and uses it on himself to disguise his appearance while foiling an attempt to steal his research. However, he waits too long to reverse the process, leaving him permanently transformed. He grows gray fur (which later turns blue) all over his body and acquires sharp ears, elongated canine teeth, claws, able to run on walls and ceilings like a spider, enhanced senses, an accelerated <a href="../../../h/e/a/Healing_factor.html" title="Healing factor">healing factor</a> - and a feral side he struggles to control. He briefly joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants when Mastermind wipes out his memory, but quickly recovers. Back at Brand Laboratories, he discovers his girlfriend Linda Donaldson is a Communist spy, and the confrontation, though heartbreaking, is inevitable.</p>

<p>Not long after this transformation, he is recruited to join <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">the Avengers</a>, in which he remains a member for many years, becoming a close friend of <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonder_Man_c7e3.html" title="Wonder Man">Wonder Man</a>. He leaves the team at times to rejoin his friends in the X-Men in times of need (such as the <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Phoenix_Saga_0110.html" title="Dark Phoenix Saga">Dark Phoenix Saga</a></i>). He returns to the Avengers each time, but eventually leaves so that the team (which had a six-member limit at the time) could be filled out by new recruits.</p>

<p>He later joins the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defenders_%28comics%29.html" title="Defenders (comics)">Defenders</a> and is one of the final surviving members at the time it disbanded. He and fellow surviving Defenders <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archangel_%28comics%29.html" title="Archangel (comics)">Angel</a> and <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceman_%28comics%29.html" title="Iceman (comics)">Iceman</a> are contacted shortly after by <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclops_%28comics%29.html" title="Cyclops (comics)">Cyclops</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a> to form a new group, <a href="../../../x/-/f/X-Factor_%28comics%29_28ab.html" title="X-Factor (comics)">X-Factor</a>. Early in X-Factor's career (<i>X-Factor</i> vol.1 #2), Hank is kidnapped by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artie_Maddicks_baab.html" title="Artie Maddicks">Artie Maddicks</a>' scientist father for use as a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea_pig.html#Guinea_pigs_in_scientific_research" title="Guinea pig">guinea pig</a> for a treatment that Maddicks was developing to "cure" Artie's mutation.</p>
<p>Once Beast is injected with the drug, he regains his original near-human appearance. In <i>X-Factor</i> (vol. 1) #19, he is infected with an unknown disease by the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Horsemen_of_Apocalypse_%28comics%29_e652.html" title="Four Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)">Horseman</a> <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pestilence_%28comics%29.html" title="Pestilence (comics)">Pestilence</a> but this doesn't kill him; instead, his body fights off Pestilence's infection at the cost of his brilliant mind. Every time he uses his super-strength, his intellect withers. As a result, he is reduced to a childlike state until he steals a kiss from <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infectia.html" title="Infectia">Infectia</a> (who can mutate others by touch) and falls into a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a>. While in the infirmary on X-Factor's sentient <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship_%28comics%29.html" title="Ship (comics)">Ship</a>, his body morphs between his human appearance and his blue-furred one as it fights the effects of the kiss. Eventually he awakens, once more in his furry form, his full intellect and powers restored. He serves this team for years while being a <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lecturer.html" title="Lecturer">college lecturer</a>, and later returns to the X-Men where he remains.</p>

<p>As the world experiences a mutant <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_boom.html" title="Baby boom">baby boom</a>, much of the mutant community seemingly begins experiencing "<a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_mutation.html" title="Secondary mutation">secondary mutations</a>", often taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities. After being brutally attacked, Beast's secondary mutation is "jumpstarted" due to the powers of fellow teammate <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sage_%28comics%29.html" title="Sage (comics)">Sage</a>. The further mutation causes Beast to develop a feline physique, which he initially has some trouble adapting to. A <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a> attack by the genocidal <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra_Nova_e4cd.html" title="Cassandra Nova">Cassandra Nova</a> leaves Beast humiliated, badly beaten, and haunted by the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state of <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devolution_%28fallacy%29.html" title="Devolution (fallacy)">devolution</a>. Additionally, the alteration in form causes his long-time girlfriend, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trish_Tilby_6673.html" title="Trish Tilby">Trish Tilby</a>, to break up with him after being accused of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestiality.html" title="Bestiality">bestiality</a> in the media.</p>
<p>When news of a "cure" that would reverse mutations suddenly arises, Beast finds himself seriously considering taking it so he can once again appear human. Hank eventually decides against it after vigorous "urging" by fellow team member <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverine_%28comics%29.html" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine</a>, as it would send out a negative message to other mutants if an X-Man were to take the cure. After learning that the cure was developed by fellow geneticist <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kavita_Rao_d5e0.html" title="Kavita Rao">Kavita Rao</a> through experimentation on mutant corpses - as well as on the X-Man <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colossus_%28comics%29.html" title="Colossus (comics)">Colossus</a> - Beast helps take down Rao's operation. When the villainous <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellfire_Club_%28comics%29_72d0.html" title="Hellfire Club (comics)">Hellfire Club</a> attacks the X-Men, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra_Nova_e4cd.html" title="Cassandra Nova">Cassandra Nova</a> telepathically strips away Beast's higher human consciousness, leaving him with only his animal instincts. After hunting Wolverine around campus (and even eating his leg), a student named <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blindfold_%28comics%29.html" title="Blindfold (comics)">Blindfold</a> faces him down with a device he and Xavier had built in case his consciousness was ever lost. The device is a high-powered sensory stimulant in the form of a ball of string, which Beast had alluded to as being his greatest fear. Once restored, he is quick to put on a suit and tie and save Wolverine with a hyper-magnetic device. He, along with his teammates, were last taken from the Mansion by the government agency <a href="../../../s/2E/w/S.W.O.R.D._%28comics%29_22cf.html" title="S.W.O.R.D.

<p>Currently, Beast, along with the other X-Men, is assuming a neutral stance in the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_War_%28comics%29_a01c.html" title="Civil War (comics)">Civil War</a> currently being waged between Marvel's heroes.

<p>Originally, Hank McCoy retains the basic features of a normal human alongside a generally simian physiology (e.g., elongated limbs and oversized extremities). This mutation gives him <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhuman.html" title="Superhuman">superhuman</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhuman_strength.html" title="Superhuman strength">strength</a>, speed, agility, and coordination. He can perform many tasks with his feet as easily as with his hands. Because of his gifts and training, Beast can outperform any <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a>-level athlete, contorting his body and performing aerial feats gracefully. Later, Hank mutates further, first through the growth of grey - then blue - fur covering his entire body. He gains sharp nails and fang-like teeth, and his overall appearance becomes more bestial. With this physique, Beast uses his claws to climb vertical surfaces (he has been depicted performing this feat prior to his furry transformation). Beast gains the ability to emit mood altering pheromones, causing sexual attraction in women, and he becomes strong enough to withstand falls that would crush the bones of a normal human. Beast develops extremely powerful limbs, allowing him to make astounding leaps and to run at great speeds for a short duration.</p>

With his own parents denouncing him throughout his childhood for his genetic status, he chose to hide his immense intelligence to avoid further complications. Hank became a founding member of the <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_a58d.html" title="Ultimate X-Men">Ultimate X-Men</a> taking the codename Beast.

<li>Beast was set to appear in <i><a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_%28film%29_795a.html" title="X-Men (film)">X-Men</a></i>, but was taken out due to make-up problems. His doctor persona was transferred into <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Grey_4319.html" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a>'s character.</li>
<li>In the movie <i><a href="../../../x/2/_/X2_%28film%29.html" title="X2 (film)">X2: X-Men United</a></i>, Dr. Hank McCoy was seen in his normal human appearance in a small cameo played by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Bacic_fa93.html" title="Steve Bacic">Steve Bacic</a>. He appears on the television in the bar scene as an authority on human mutation. A deleted scene during the sequence in which Dark Cerebro was set to kill all mutants showed Hank McCoy affected by the machine, causing him to take on his blue-furred simian appearance seen in the next movie.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/X-Men%7E_The_Last_Stand_40ad.html" title="X-Men: The Last Stand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a></i>, <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelsey_Grammer_2ff9.html" title="Kelsey Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a> portrays him. Beast was one of the earlier X-Men, and after he graduated from the academy, he left and became involved in politics, becoming Secretary of Mutant Affairs. He is also confirmed to be a brilliant scientific researcher with great insight into mutant genetics on the official website. <a href="http://www.x-menthelaststand.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.x-menthelaststand.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This is never explicitly revealed in the film, though there are hints that Beast is a scientist, e.g. Beast having a doctorate, his reading of <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_American_3498.html" title="Scientific American">Scientific American</a></i>, and his interrupted correction to Storm's words, "Well, scientifically speaking ..." After the cure is released, he contacts Xavier and informs him of the situation, saying he can understand why some mutants would want to be free of persecution. When the Brotherhood makes a move on the lab which created the cure, Beast joins the X-Men, donning his old uniform (commenting on how it feels smaller than before), and helps to hold the Brotherhood back. He seems to revert to a more primal nature in the fight, often roaring as well as defeating his opponents with a savage fighting style. He also injected Magneto with the cure. After the incident, he is made <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations_36bb.html" title="United States Ambassador to the United Nations">United States Ambassador to the United Nations</a>.</li>
<li>In the <a href="../../../t/h/e/X-Men%7E_The_Last_Stand_40ad.html#Adaptations" title="X-Men: The Last Stand">novelization</a> of the film, and in an alternate ending on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/X-Men%7E_The_Last_Stand_40ad.html#DVD_.28NTSC_Region_1_Version.29" title="X-Men: The Last Stand">DVD</a>, he turns this position down &amp; remains at the school as a teacher.</li>
