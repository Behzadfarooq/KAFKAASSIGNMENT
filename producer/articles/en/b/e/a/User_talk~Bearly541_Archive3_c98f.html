<p>You can edit the TN-FedRep template here: {{<a href="../../../t/n/-/Template%7ETN-FedRep_5d35.html" title="Template:TN-FedRep">TN-FedRep</a>}}. It definitely needs updating today; I might tackle it later if you haven't. I think that's the box you're talking about; please tell me if it's not. Regarding fancyford.com, it was in Ford's article for awhile, but eventually was removed (the website is no longer functioning). I live in Memphis, and have never heard of an RNC attack ad mentioning Allison (was it part of fancyford?). That's not to say that it didn't happen, but I just don't know if it's notable enough to mention in *Ford's* article (but perhaps it should be in Allison's, as her notability seems to be entirely tied to dating the rich and/or powerful). My reasoning is explained by a somewhat unrelated comment on the Ford talk page: "Wikipedia shouldn't be cataloging attack ads by either party" (unless, of course, they rise to a certain level of notability, or, as in the case of the Playboy ads, notoriety). However, Ford's article really needs a "personal life" subsection, and his dating life (including relationship with Allison) could be discussed there. Regarding the Allison article, I think your edits were good. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 14:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You were right to report at the BLP noticeboard. Whether you're dealing with the subject of the article or her publicist, the editor in question has conflict of interest problems. If you've received a specific legal threat, I recommend reporting at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a>, too, as legal threats are taken quite seriously and almost invariably lead to indefinite blocks. My best piece of advice at this point is to just take a breather from the article for a few days. It's ok if it isn't exactly where it should be for a small amount of time, and it might help you sleep if you don't worry about it for a time. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 15:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I posted a somewhat long comment on the Allison talk page, and I hope a constructive conversation with Lillster results.

I also wrote a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_review.html" title="Law review">law review</a> article on a specific issue in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> law that was published during my final year of law school (which was last year). There are several other Wikipedian lawyers, as the category <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedian_lawyers_1489.html" title="Category:Wikipedian lawyers">Wikipedian lawyers</a> attests to. There are at least two (probably more) other lawyer administrators, both of whom contribute a LOT more than I do. My contributions are actually somewhat low compared to a few other users that have been here for about two years.</p>
<p>Your last e-mail concerned me. You seem to be assuming, without any evidence, that I am someone I am most certainly not. Remember, Bearly, that you were the one that asked me to get involved at Julia Allison. I wouldn't have been involved otherwise. I understand you weren't satisfied with my focus on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> over <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. But frankly, Allison was completely correct to point out that some of the article was negative material that was poorly sourced. Yes, she shouldn't have been editing her own article. But she stopped doing so after it was made clear to her that she shouldn't be doing so. And I think you understand the importance of BLP now, right?</p>
<p>But why in the world are you assuming I'm "Harold"? Because I've edited the Tennessee politics articles? Think about this: I edited the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2006_455e.html" title="Tennessee United States Senate election, 2006">Tennessee United States Senate election, 2006</a> article all throughout election day in November while "Harold" was (I suspect) going around the state campaigning.</p>

I mentioned <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> because you don't always follow the policy, and you stalk users (and think that they have some vindetta). If I had the time, I would open a RfC on you, because I feel that you continue to violate policy such as <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and don't assume good faith. Let me explain myself before I leave, cordially.</p>
<p>First, I placed a level four warning on the IP's page, because I thought the edit was vandalism. The issue is squashed because I removed the warning. I used to monitor RC changes at night, because many of the vandalistic occurs late at night ET until the early morning, also ET.</p>
<p>Second, I asked the Beatles user to make a template to keep track of the pages that she made. I didn't see the stub category. I did not realize she was a new user. I was only trying to help. <i>It was not in your place to infringe on my conversation. Your infringement on the conversation made you seem to be a tacky admin instead of helpful.</i></p>
<p>Third, please take my userpage off your <i>watchlist of people to bully,</i> because I deserve(d) the right to edit, <i>freely,</i> instead of being monitored by people who control freedom of expression (FOE). You have violated FOE by editing my userpage, and I did not appreciate that at all. With your RV, you have disrespected me and Wikipedia as a whole.</p>
<p>Fourth, you shouldn't have reversed my warnings on <a href="../../../m/y/k/User%7EMykungfu_b210.html" title="User:Mykungfu">User:Mykungfu</a>'s sockpuppet page. He has been notorious for abusing users and vandalizing pages by using AOL sockpuppets. I can't understand WHY you reversed the warnings after the IP has been BLOCKED 24 HOURS. He may have not vandalized the page, per vandal policy, but he disrupted my page and violated warnings of civilty. Please revert the edits. It's only in the best interest of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Fifth, please be respectful to other administrators, like Mr. Darcy. Even though you disagree with each other, that does not mean that you have to make a rude comment against his character. He is an admin, just like you, and deserves to be treated with respect.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: You need to have an open mind in your administrative duties on Wikipedia. I hope that this is a lesson for you, because this may come up again with future users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, please don't manipulate the leaving message on my user page. Thank you. Have a great day!</p>

<p>Hi Bearly. I appreciate the last e-mail you sent me, and I'm glad you sent it. I noticed that you have decided to open a mediation case. I encourage you to let bygones be bygones in this situation, however. I understand that you're under a lot of real life stress. Opening a mediation case would likely only add to that stress. I also wanted to tell you that if the case persists, I may comment on it. My comments will not be made out of any personal animus toward you, but rather out of wanting the mediator to have all necessary facts to fairly assess the situation. Thanks. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 15:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion, I think you should have been cordial to send me a reply via e-mail, but obviously you did not do it. I am not totally stressed out to the point of craziness like you or others think.

<dd>I didn't expect to hear from you again, and you claimed to have retired from wikipedia, thus I did not respond to your e-mail. I responded here, just now, after seeing that you are not, in fact, completely inactive. My other purpose in commenting here was to make it entirely clear what I will do (i.e. thoroughly comment on the mediation case) if it persists. I just want you to be aware of that, and I want you to know that I absolutely bear you no ill will. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 17:47, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If I <i>retired</i> from Wikipedia, and e-mailed you, it would be rather logical for you to respond to the message. I do not check my userpage all of the time, and this is the first time I have checked it since I left. I came here because users e-mailed me and wanted me to return to check on the status of my page, and cleaned up my pages. That's when I noticed that KC changed my userpage. I asked her about it this morning. She removed my message a "trolling." I took an avenue to settle the disputes amongst her and I, which is mediation with an independent party. <b><a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearly541_de31.html" title="User:Bearly541"><font face="trebuchet ms" color="#FF9999">Bearly</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/a/User_talk%7EBearly541_4054.html" title="User talk:Bearly541"><font face="trebuchet ms" color="#A6F591">541</font></a></b> 17:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Given the content of your previous e-mail messages as well as the content of your messages on my talk page, I chose not to e-mail you. I would rather our conversations occur entirely on Wiki so that they can bear the scrutiny of other editors. Surely you can understand my concern given our prior interaction. I don't entirely understand why you are so concerned about the fact that I responded here instead of via e-mail regarding your apology, but I plan to drop the subject whether you comment further on it or not. Again, my other reason for commenting here is to make it entirely clear that I will comment thoroughly on the mediation case if it persists, as at least some portion of your interaction with KC was regarding your comments on my talk page (otherwise, I would not have any reason to comment, of course). · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 18:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I agree for you to drop the issue. You should have responded with a follow-up e-mail (i.e. acceptance/acknowledgement/forgiveness), but you didn't. This is a <i>non-issue</i>/distraction regarding my edits on Wikipedia, or this case in general. It holds no <i>special</i> value or preference as far as I am concerned. Again, I do not care if you comment on mediation.

<li>Hello Bearly. I used to be an administrator, but recently stepped down due to stress. I see you are a little stressed yourself. I don't think you are seeing everything clearly. The administrator you seem to be "targetting", KillerChihuahua, has not wronged you that I can see. In fact she is one of the most level-headed and nicest admins around here in my experience. Your statement on your user page that she wants you to be indefinitely blocked is, I think, flat-out false; you really should either prove that or remove it, since it's kind of a mean accusation if not true. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 16:08, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I took the bold step of opening a mediation, because I wanted to settle the dispute between us, once and for all. I don't care if all of you call me names, criticize me, call your support for KC, etc. However, I felt that we weren't seeing equally on terms in regards to Wikipedia policy, concerning the power of an administrator over a user. However, I won't remove my claim. This is not new, regarding users. And, I feel that this will be a proper way to settle disputes, rather than RfC, because this is an independent committee rather than KC's friends or my friends (bias) commenting on my or her behavior. <b><a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearly541_de31.html" title="User:Bearly541"><font face="trebuchet ms" color="#FF9999">Bearly</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/a/User_talk%7EBearly541_4054.html" title="User talk:Bearly541"><font face="trebuchet ms" color="#A6F591">541</font></a></b> 17:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
