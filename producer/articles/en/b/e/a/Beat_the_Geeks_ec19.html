<p>The three contestants compete against each other and the Geeks to answer 4 questions, 1 from each category. Each correct answer is worth 10 points. If a contestant submits a correct answer, they go face-to-face with a Geek to answer another question. During this face-off, if the contestant gets the question wrong or the Geek gets it right, the contestant loses 5 points. However, if the contestant gets the question right or the Geek gets it wrong, they are awarded another 10 points. The player with the least amount of points at the end is eliminated.

A total of two questions are asked; if a Geek answers wrong, the player is awarded the medal and 20 points, and if a contestant answers wrong, the other player may buzz in and "steal" the question for 10 points. If both questions are correctly answered, the Geek-off occurs. In the Geek-off, a question is first posed to the contestant, who attempts to answer it with as many valid responses as they can in 15 seconds. After this, a similar but harder question is posed to the Geek. If the Geek fails to surpass the contestant in the number of correct answers, the contestant wins the medal.

At the end of the third round is the "Geek-qualizer". In the "Geek-qualizer", the contestant with the lowest score is given a list of names or titles (with some related theme), and must decide if each one is related to Movies, Music or TV; there are 16 items, worth 10 points each, and the player's turn ends after making a mistake, taking too long to answer on a given item, or answers all 16.

<p>In the final round, the contestant chooses one of the four Geeks to challenge. Once they are face-to-face, the contestant goes first and chooses whether he wants a 1 point (easiest), 2 point (harder), or 3 point (hardest) question. After the contestant gives his answer, the Geek chooses which kind of question they want, but cannot choose a point value lower than what the contestant just chose. The first person to reach 7 points wins, and if the contestant wins they are awarded $5000 worth of prizes in whatever category they chose for the Final Round.</p>

<p>J. Keith van Straaten was replaced by Blaine Capatch by the producers for the second season because he was deemed "not geeky enough." It was felt that van Straaten didn't interact well with the geeks, and that he came off as superior to the geeks.

<p>The show began with Michael Jolly as the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Music</a> Geek but lasted only a short while. Producers felt his on-screen presence wasn't very commanding, and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Zax_848a.html" title="Andy Zax">Andy Zax</a> replaced him for the remainder of the first season. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Zax_848a.html" title="Andy Zax">Andy Zax</a> was an instant fan favorite and proved much more camera friendly, as well as possessing a much deeper knowledge of <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">pop culture</a>. In season two, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Zax_848a.html" title="Andy Zax">Andy Zax</a> was brought back as the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Music</a> Geek.

However, it was evident early on that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Farmer_951f.html" title="Michael Farmer">Michael Farmer</a> didn't have much of an on-screen presence, so <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Zax_848a.html" title="Andy Zax">Andy Zax</a> appeared in 55 of the 65 second season episodes.

The producers were able to find a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> Geek, but because he was only 13, laws would not allow him to appear on the show. As a result, the producers gave the <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudity.html" title="Nudity">Nudity</a> in <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">Movies</a> Geek an extra episode to fill the void.</li>
