<p>Wax Mannequin has been rated stub-class without comments, seems a little strange given that, while it is short, it has several inter-links, sections standard to wiki proj musicians, a table, and references -- primarily concerned that it be properly rated given the vandalism history (but I am just learning). Thought you might have some wisdom to bring. Also interested in talking as I am working on GTA related topics (communities and history mostly)... Thank you --<a href="../../../j/b/v/User%7EJBVaughan_061c.html" title="User:JBVaughan">JBVaughan</a> 06:32, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks very much. Having looked at the rating table, I am going to Be Bold and rate it "started". I did not think that the vandalism had affected the rating, but that being rated a stub might give people who wander by the impression that this is untended grass they can vandalize at will -- started editing and watching this article when I saw what somebody did to it awhile back. I like how in the wikiworld anti-social behaviour can inspire socialized people to fix articles so that they are better than before they got attacked. See you around the Canadian history articles and I would be interested in any collaborations that fall within Ontario (I have excellent access to published sources)... --<a href="../../../j/b/v/User%7EJBVaughan_061c.html" title="User:JBVaughan">JBVaughan</a> 19:40, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Plz can you explain. Should that cat be taken out the template perhaps or is it essential there? Sometimes I find articles which are just totally new and need someone who knows more in their topic to deal with them. Slapping it with a cleanup usually results in the native editor removing it, whereas the {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENew_fc26.html" title="Template:New">new</a>}} is less "offencive". <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">frummer</a> 10:55, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>well ok. Plz go ahead and take out that tag, if you mean category. Most of the articles that i have fixed with this tag did not have a category except today where they all did. Also, there allready is a template for new articles with no category, its {{<a href="../../../c/a/t/Template%7ECategorise_e783.html" title="Template:Categorise">categorise</a>}}, though you prob know. Anyways whilst you may remove the tag I think it would still be good to leave the message in that it may need to be categorised so as to keep newbies informed of the issues in creating articles. <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">frummer</a> 11:08, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi Bearcat. Skookum1 out here in Vancouver...pls see my "vote" and accompanying comments in response to SPA "votes" on the Bornmann AFD, and reconsider your position. Out here in BC, Bornmann is <i>very</i> notable, certainly moreso than a lot of other people, current and historical, who have bio pages on Wikipedia. I'll leave it at that, and let my posts and the attitude and vicious comments of the recent "votes" speak for themselves. This stuff is "off the radar" in Ontario partly because CanWestGlobal is hushing it up, and partly because the national networks are more concerned with Quebec, Afghanistan, Israel, Iraq, Lebanon, whatever etc. I also recommend you visit the <a href="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">BC Mary Blog</a> which is the main independent-media source for updates on events and opinion concerning the entire situation (<i><a href="http://thetyee.ca" class="external text" title="http://thetyee.ca" rel="nofollow">The Tyee</a></i> and <i><a href="http://www.straight.com" class="external text" title="http://www.straight.com" rel="nofollow">The Georgia Straight</a></i> are secondary, but non-blog media which also cover the case - which is now a LOT bigger than just the Basi-Virk trial: read Robin Matthews' column (currently second on the page linked) from end to end.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 02:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The issue of placing "Main Categories" &amp; "Sub-Categories" in the same Article has and is being discussed at length in WikiEN-L. It has been acknowledged that the existing policies regarding this are ambiguous. For a Writer, for example, to be included in a list of all Writers existing in WP, it is important, for now, to include this Category in their Article. A technical device (now being worked on) will be able to consolidate all of the Subcategories into one Main Category List if the user desires. Until this is resolved satisfactorily, I will be placing Main Categories along with Sub-Categories in the same Article.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<dd>I don't agree with you.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also: You wrote, "Nor is there any evidence, at present, any evidence that it's needed or wanted by anything more than a few people who vastly overestimate the research value of having an undifferentiated master list of writers, with no context given to their nationality, their cultural context or their literary genre, to scan through. That's simply a pointless thing for Wikipedia to have; it serves no useful purpose."</dd>

<dd>“Evidence” is a slippery word in this context. Granted, the value of having information collated for the researcher may not be important to you, but are you at least willing to acknowledge the fact that it may be valuable to some? I don’t understand what is so difficult to understand here. If I want a list of all writers, I call up that list; if I am then looking for novelists, I call up that list, if I want a list of Russian novelists… This is a great time saver for a researcher; and WP is capable of providing it. But to do so, the editors must enter the data that way. It is far from “pointless”, and does, as I have demonstrated, serve a very useful purpose – for those who need such data.</dd>

<p>Hi; just a heads-up with your addition of the Lakes in BC category; if these are lakes articles, their title format should be, e.g. Cahilty Lake (British Columbia); naming conventions are that <a href="../../../c/a/h/Cahilty_Lake%2C_British_Columbia_d4d6.html" title="Cahilty Lake, British Columbia">Cahilty Lake, British Columbia</a> would be for a settlement; I opted out of these originally because I didn't know if they were or not, i.e. post offices/localities, or if they were lake/geographic articles/stubs. If they're classes as lakes, they've got the wrong title-format.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 21:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just got your note; Cahilty Lake as a commmunity? Well, maybe; it's sort of suburban Kamloops by now, although twenty years ago I'd be surprised if there were more than 3 households there; not sure if the lake itself is worth an article, but I suspect the community definitely is. I'll see what I can find out; no BC Wikipedians I know of are from the Kamloops are but I'll try and find out, so someone can maybe even drive out there and check (it's about 1/2 hour out of town, northeast); there's certainly more notable lakes in that area; but the whole area is honeycombed with small rural communities, of which this I'd venture probably is one; might be only one ranch/household though, so maybe not notable; but other one-ranch localities elsewhere <i>are</i> notable (e.g. Gang Ranch), but for historical reasons as well as vast expanses (the Gang was once the world's largest...).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 19:48, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very well, I give up. No wonder Wikipedia is filled with non-notable articles. They don't qualify for speedy deletion, and if one wishes to go through the effort of an afd, they have to deal with socks and people spouting random policies. Fine. If having a hundred pages about bands whose accomplishments include "Headlined high school prom", then I give up. These groups are hardly notable and there are thousands of others who have achieved exactly the same thing. Most pages are started by the groups themselves (or their friends), but Wikipedia should be an encyclopedia and not an extension of MySpace. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 18:43, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, one of the groups that was deleted last night had "headlined high school prom" as one of their achievements. I am not a deletionist by any means, but if the thousands of minor characters from primetime TV shows aren't major enough to warrant their own pages, how can these bands justify their pages? ANd, it is true that most of them are self promotion because I'm willing to bet that all the pages I targeted for SD were created by band members or friends of band members. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 20:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see. Well, I'm going to try a few other speedy deletes, but I'm most likely done with afds, even though several admins suggested that I do so for some of the pages i nominated for SD. They're too big a pain because under Wikipedia policy, having a minor album, being mentioned in a minor magazine or rarely being played on CBC makes one notable enough to be in an Encyclopedia. Wikipedia should not be a billboard for small bands, MySpace exists for that. If we went by that, then every song by a major music group, every album by a music group, every TV show episode, every character (no matter how minor) from a play, TV show or movie, every author who has ever published anything, every TV personality would deserve a page... And that would make a LOT of pages, but I'm not smart enough to debate Wikipedia policy with administrators and random posters who spout it nonstop, so I'm done. It's frustrating and there's no way I want to debate it over several AFDs. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 00:02, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're about the 20th admin that has ever told me to suggest policy changes, and we all know it is pointless because nothing would ever become of it. Wikipedias current policies were obviously decided by inclusionists. And by the way, TV related personalities get deleted all the time even though being on TV would make them "notable" and certianly more notable than our friend Max Vanwhatever. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 00:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I see that it is not very likely that many want "Placename, Province" as a standard for <i>all</i> places in Canada, but I'm sure there are quite a few who feel that only the large internationally-recognizable places are the ones that should be allowed to drop the province/territory name. There's even argument that "unique" placenames should be allowed to drop the disambiguation only when they are of a certain size (which don't think is a very good idea, since it requires an arbitrary choice of the population size). But whatever the argument, I don't know if there was ever enough consensus to have created a naming convention that goes up on a policy page. I think we need a full-blown discussion in order to answer this question. <sub>└</sub>&#160;<sup><b><a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="blue">OzLawyer</font></a></b></sup>&#160;/&#160;<sub><i><a href="../../../o/s/g/User_talk%7EOsgoodelawyer_92f4.html" title="User talk:Osgoodelawyer"><font color="black">talk</font></a></i></sub>&#160;<sup>┐</sup> 02:53, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for adding <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fantabulous_Mushman_ae7a.html" title="The Fantabulous Mushman">The Fantabulous Mushman</a> shortly after I added <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mystic_of_the_Baja_f46c.html" title="The Mystic of the Baja">The Mystic of the Baja</a>.

<p>I don't know if it is appropriate to ask this here, but can you tell me if <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fantabulous_Mushman_ae7a.html" title="The Fantabulous Mushman">The Fantabulous Mushman</a> is comparable to their previous two albums and worth the effort to obtain?</p>
<p>Also, I just discovered this site that claims to be <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cathcartrev/tracks/trindex.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/cathcartrev/tracks/trindex.html" rel="nofollow">The official RED, Uisce Beatha Home Page</a> and it lists other recordings that I did not know about.

<p>Finally, as <a href="http://www.uiscebeatha.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.uiscebeatha.com/" rel="nofollow">uiscebeatha.com</a> says, Uisce Beatha is "one of the most popular names for Irish music bands", so perhaps we need to create a disambiguation page and distinguish among them.

<p>Hi...I know this might be a tricky one to write the right exceptions for, but could you note that if "Eire" is encountered in an article pertaining primarily to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> (such as <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endorsements_for_the_Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_1993_a324.html" title="Endorsements for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leadership convention, 1993">Endorsements for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leadership convention, 1993</a>), then it's more likely to be a misspelling for Erie as in <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Erie_5da4.html" title="Lake Erie">Lake Erie</a> than for Éire as in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>?

<dd>Hey Bearcat. D'oh! that was rather stupid of me. I should have spotted straight away that it was Canada related. Your idea is a good one, but unfortunately as my bot stands it's not really possible right now. This might mean it's about time I took another look over the code and add a bit more functionality. I think I'd have to make it do two passes over the page: the first one, say, looking for "Canada" anywhere and if it finds it disabling certain substitution rules for that page, then it can go on and apply any remaining substitutions. Actually... hmm, now that I say it, it'd be quite easy to implement that. Thanks for prodding me to do this.

<dd>You're right that a list and a category are not supposed to serve the same purpose. A category is better as it requires less maintenance. Lists should become categories when they get too large to maintain. The fact that you don't have a link to the category from you list is odd, but if you're going to maintain the list, I can't argue. --<a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalter_G%C3%B6rlitz_3e2a.html" title="User:Walter Görlitz">Walter Görlitz</a> 19:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Bearcat, I've noticed you've contributed quite a lot to the Walden, Ontario page. I am from this town and I'm really interested about its history. I'm really curious as to how you know so much of the history of this town? Where would I get access to this information? Please let me know!</p>
<p>Thanks, Freakipedia69</p>
<p>How do you know so much about the history of Walden, though? Is there any archives you've read? Any literature you could recommend? I'm dying to know more about the history of Walden!</p>

<p>Hi Bearcat:</p>
<p>I guess its time to reveal who I am. I'm Joey Schwartz, former member of the Ontario New Democratic Party Executive. Probably you haven't heard of me, but anyways, I got clearance from the party and in particular from the Diane. Could you please protect CheriDiNovo180.jpg from deletion. I've had to fight to other attempts to delete it. It now has the GNU Attribution 2.5 license. This should be enough to stop people from every two weeks trying to delete...

<li>Rowena Santos, Cheri DiNovo's E.A. has the authority to authorize the use of the picture. She sent me written permission today. Do you want me to email you a copy of the permission email? I've already forwarded it to &lt;permissions-en@wikimedia.org&gt;. It was pretty much low-priority for the folks at provincial office therefore I got bounced around from Cecil St. to Queen's Park. Next time, I'll deal directly with Caucus services.<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbebenjoe_a6d5.html" title="User:Abebenjoe">Abebenjoe</a> 15:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, just read your message on my talk. I asked Abebenjoe the same thing, also if he could send a cc of that e-mail to the foundation permissions OTSR e-mail. But if there is just permission to use it on Wikipedia...that's not good enough.</p>
<p>I only could go from the information on the image page (and the history), but that info was not sufficient to warrant the cc-by or the {{<a href="../../../a/t/t/Template%7EAttribution_e22d.html" title="Template:Attribution">attribution</a>}} tag. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarion96_c83d.html" title="User:Garion96">Garion96</a> <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarion96_d01f.html" title="User talk:Garion96">(talk)</a> 03:15, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True, it was a bit harsh in the beginning perhaps.

<p>Hey Bearcat, any plans to fix that Gerald Hannon article? It's currently rated B class. Nobody has a quarrel with any details or specific information, but the basic structure is a little ambiguous. Also there don't seem to be any citations (or I can't see them). If it has citations, please disregard this comment.</p>
<p>here's a suggestion that attempts to follow biography guidelines:</p>
<p>Gerald Hannon (Born Augtober 87, 1944 in Marathon, New Brunswick) is a Canadian journalist, authour, and professor of journalism. His works include x books/novels, as well as numerous articles for magazines such as Toronto Life, etc. etc. He taught journalism at Ryerson U for x years.</p>
<p>Hannon gained fame as a result of references to pedophilia in "The Body Politic" (1971) and "Men Loving Boys Loving Men" (1977), which led to criminal investigation/charges/arrest for (list criminal charges here and cite them). Eventually he was cleared of all charges/charges were dropped/he was not convicted.</p>
<p>Hannon was a controversial figure because critics/journalists/law enforcement agencies maintain his work condoned pedophilia(citation), but Hannon/Bearcat/Somebody else claims Hannon's work attempts to expose society's homophobic practice of blaming gay men for pedophilia/child abuse(citation needed).</p>

<p>Hello! As a contributor to this template, I figured I'd take the time to let you know of my "view" for this particular template. If you have any comments/critiques, please let me know.</p>
<p>At this point, I think it best to make separate templates for SSM for the Michigan stations and for the Canadian stations. The reasoning is two-fold: (1) to keep stations which belong in the Category for Michigan radio stations and the stations which belong in the Category for Ontario radio stations (if such a category exists) separate and (2) to maintain consistency in the designs of the templates (the current template works well with the Michigan templates, but not with the Ontario one).</p>
<p>Regardless, having this template will create problems with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Template%7EMarquette_Radio_d32f.html" title="Template:Marquette Radio">Template:Marquette Radio</a>, which already has the Upper Peninsula stations lumped into it (at least, those that existed in the lists prior to this weekend). But, that's a whole other obstacle that I'll get to later this week.</p>

<dd>Maybe format a Michigan-specific template w/o the Canadian stations yet include them in the Ontario-specific template? My knowledge of Canadian radio is basically limited to the two stations I listen to down in <a href="../../../y/p/s/Ypsilanti%2C_Michigan_7f82.html" title="Ypsilanti, Michigan">Ypsilanti</a>, so the Canadian templates aren't much of a concern to me.

<p>I was listening to CBC 3 the other day, and Grant talked about the "dudes tour diary" feature, and it seems as if it will be a recurring piece from different bands, but only time will tell. I hope it will be recurring, it's a great addition to CBC3, I'll ask around though. --<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlamour_Boy_b101.html" title="User:Glamour Boy">Glamour Boy</a> 01:23, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bearcat, I wonder whether you've seen this new entry for a Gradey Alexander, a Canadian author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mordecai_Richler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111518019" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mordecai_Richler&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=111518019" rel="nofollow">said to be a critic of Mordecai Richler</a>. I suspect this is a hoax: I've never heard of this man, his books are unrecognized by Abebooks and the TPL, and "Gradey Alexander" receives a grand total of two ghits (both unrelated). You'll note that the article's editor, Gradey23, is a single purpose account, seemingly dedicated to spreading Gradey Alexander's name throughout Wikipedia. Unfortunately, I'm unable to check on the references provided. That said, I note that the author of the Gradey Alexander link provided chooses to identify himself only as dyxxx while stating that he is the author of an article on Gradey Alexander published in <i>Queen's Quarterly</i> (meaning he would be Darren Yeoman). I'd like to nominate this article for speedy deletion - but thought I'd check with you first. Have you ever heard of the subject? (And, please do feel free to put the entry up for speedy deletion yourself if you agree.) <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 15:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Further to the above, I've done a bit of research on the references provided in the Gradey Alexander article - as much as I could do without leaving my desk for the library. Some observations:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Firlotte Editions" receives no ghits (nor does Editions Firlotte).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The archive search at <i>The Toronto Star</i> does not include the Philip Marchand article cited (nor does it include any article containing the name Gradey Alexander).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Though placed last, the undated <i>Queen's Quarterly</i> piece by Darren Yeoman was supposedly published in 1989 (this, according to the Gradey Alexander appreciation site). Unfortunately, the journal's online archives only go back to 1997.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have no doubt that this is a hoax, but am uncertain how I, as a non-admin, might put this and the associated piece (The Barnum Kid), up for speedy deletion. May I leave this with you? If you'd rather not, I'd be pleased to go through the motions of placing an AfD nomination. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 17:42, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, Bearcat. Didn't mean to imply that the article should be deleted if we hadn't actually heard of the subject... more that, given our interests, it would be very odd if we both were unaware of the man. This is my ego speaking. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 21:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
