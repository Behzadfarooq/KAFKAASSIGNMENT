<li>I first looked at this yesterday and didn't really know what to say. Of course Beatlemania is an important concept (although in a way it's just a word, a dictdef if you will). Strip out the list of chart performances <s>and the section on a musical of the same name (which needs its own article, or none at all if not notable)</s> and all we're left with is a couple of paragraphs. I've therefore added this to the new section at the bottom - articles which are about the general history of the Beatles, and which together form multiple merge candidates. <b>Second opinions invited.</b>-- <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">Steve</a> (14 March 2006)</li>

<p>There is a possibility of a <b>learned</b> piece here regarding the phemomenea of Beatlemania as manifested by the (usually) teenage female fans. The hysteria, including fainting and involunatary urine release (is that "learned" enough?), was a highly uncommon event before The Beatles. I think Frank Sinatra had some similar incidents in the early <i>Bobby Soxer</i> days, but they were less frenetic (or at least the reporting of same was not as lurid). Interestingly such behaviour was not reported at Elvis Presley concerts. The only real precessors I can think of are the "Religious orgys" in late medieval times, where acolytes - again normally females - would work themselves into a (non sexual!) ecstatic state.</p>
<p>I feel this should fall under The Beatles umbrella for two reasons; firstly, The Beatles were the first recorded focal point by which this behaviour became apparent, and created the term which has (as mentioned in the article) been subsequently adopted for other groups/individuals and, secondly, "Beatlemania" had an influence on the Beatles themselves. I would argue that much of the early interest by the media regarding the Beatles focused as much on the fans response - the reporting of incidences of "Beatlemania" - as for the music and its popularity. The media exposure that followed created the environment by which any and all aspects of The Beatles were deemed newsworthy, thus creating a self fuelling publicity device building the fame of The Beatles. As commented on in other articles, this behaviour also encouraged The Beatles to give up touring and live performances as they became aware that the audience was not listening to the music and were indifferent to the quality of the playing. As they were then able to devote their creative energies in using the studio environment they were then able to make the advances they did.</p>
<p>As a generally (Western) cultural aspect, "Beatlemania" can be tied into womens financial/economic emancipation/liberation, the advent of "The Pill", and general changes of perception regarding women that was occuring at the time. As I said, this would possibly be a project for someone with a psychology or behavioural background who would know the appropriate scientific sources, and be able to deliver a coherent piece. In any event, there would be enough references to sex and teenage girls to draw the interest of some casual Wiki browser - it would have worked with me!<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 08:49, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone incorperate the fact that girls at beatles concerts would regualrly piss themselves and the people who owned the venues would have to clean it off of the seats.

<dd>I know that "Shout! The Story of the Beatles" refers to the occurrence - I suppose there are other references in other publications, too. It isn't an unusual event at "boy band" concerts of today and the recent past, but it was first remarked upon in relation to The Beatles. I still believe that it would need to be a <i>learned</i> article to counter any accusation of being salacious.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:01, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Ha, yeah. But what does it all mean, Basil? I think given screaming girls were an essential element to Beatlemania, it shouldn't be too hard.--<a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECrestville_26d9.html" title="User:Crestville">Crestville</a> 12:28, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Should this article be a stub? Just from reading it once and admittantly not knowing alot about The Beatles myself, I can casually see here that there is not very much information on the phenominon. Personally I would like some information regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>how it started (what led to Ed Sullivan and after?)</li>
<li>what happened to The Beatles personally (as mentioned above, they were scared and 'retrated')</li>
<li>more information on mobs, eg. what was the biggest number of people to swarm The Beatles? What were the early incidences of them being chased? What happened when/if they got caught by the fans? and info on the more famous incidents of mob activities.</li>
<li>What the deal was with the constant squealing at concerts? (There is a term for this, I beleive, but I only read it once and don't know if its real)</li>
</ul>
<p>You know... stuff like that. I think this article could be much more interesting and as it stands today, should it be a stub article, until more information can be added? <a href="../../../g/o/h/User%7EGohst_db4c.html" title="User:Gohst">Gohst</a> 01:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Twice now I've added Crouchamania as a similar example of the phenomenon. Twice it's been removed in a quite high-handed and frankly patronising way with comments of "nowhere near" and "idiocy". I amended the entry the second time to make it clearer to anyone who may be quite blinkered why it should be there, yet it was still removed. If Wikipedia is to remove the perception that huge sections are written by members of a "clique" who will not allow others to have an opinion on what is and isn't valid then I think something of a better explanation of this removal would be helpful. I've not put the entry back yet, as I am giving you the opportunity to explain. There's an example of some band most of the world will have never heard of, why is that there? If Beatlemania is (as seems from this discussion page) basically a phenomenon where teenage girls piss themselves at the sight of members of a boy band then it needs to be explained more clearly in the article itself. Read the article itself and explain why Crouchamania isn't a valid example. --Realred 07:30, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not a recognised phenomimnon (Crouch's time may have already been and gone) and even if it is, what's it got to do with Beatlemania? If you can establish that Crouchmania is recognised (and not ironically) maybe look to creating an independant article which you can link to this one in the "See Also" section. However, it does not belong in the Beatlemania article. A person who types "Beatlemania" into the search engine will most likely have no desire to know about Peter Crouch. Frankly the first time I saw it, I assumed it was a joke, as while I know Crouch's staus (prior to the last game) was growing, it has come nowhere near to the mania or Beatlemania.</dd>

<dd>If you honestly believe that wikipedia is a "clique" I would advise you to think again. I argue with just about every other user I come into contact with, and yet even I am not prevented from editing. Whilst I appreciate your frustration, if you continue with wikipedia (which I sincerely hope you do, I assure you in a few months you will look back and think "What a silly thing I did". The same thing happened to me, but I kicked and screamed for ages and, a few months down the line, felt quite silly.</dd>

<dd>BTW, you seem to deride the current state of the Beatlemania artice.

<dd>What Crestville said; and frankly, I don't think that your proposing of Peter Crouch is entirely unbiaised given your username. The only footballer I can think of to approach the level of "mania" is George Best (in the UK). It should be remembered that Wiki is for all with access to the internet, and that some readers don't even realise there is a game called football (FIFA type). The Beatles, however, are a much more world wide phemomena, and "other examples" should be in that category (I had trouble with the Latin American boyband until I read the article and all the links). Until there is a case for including Crouch (and Wayne Rooney, who is a stronger candidate, and any other popular athlete/artist) then such examples will be removed.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 21:51, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So there's no chance of having 'Mick McManus-mania' article? Pretty good wrestler in the 70s, even though his shorts looked like large sweaty underpants. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreasegde_c4ec.html" title="User:Andreasegde">andreasegde</a> 20:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>It seems to me that only some of the crud in the last section should even be here. Certainly a summary of record sales as a whole should be mentioned but not in so much depth. Should some of it be carted off to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_discography_224d.html" title="The Beatles discography">The Beatles discography</a>, or just deleted?
