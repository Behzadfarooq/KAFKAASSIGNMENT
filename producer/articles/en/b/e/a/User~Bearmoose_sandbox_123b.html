<p><i>Titanic</i> was 882&#160;ft&#160;9&#160;in (269&#160;m) long and 92&#160;ft&#160;6&#160;in (28&#160;m) at its beam, it had a <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonnage.html" title="Tonnage">Gross Register Tonnage</a> of 46,328&#160;tons, and a height from the water line to the boat deck of 60&#160;ft (18&#160;m).

Only three of the four 63&#160;foot (19&#160;m) tall <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funnel_%28ship%29.html" title="Funnel (ship)">funnels</a> were functional; the fourth funnel, which only served as a vent, was added to make the ship look more impressive. The ship could hold a total of 3,547 passengers and crew and, because it carried <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail.html" title="Mail">mail</a>, its name was given the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship_prefix.html" title="Ship prefix">prefix</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Mail_Ship_78bb.html" title="Royal Mail Ship">RMS</a> (Royal Mail Steamer) as well as SS (Steam Ship).</p>
<p><i>Titanic</i> was considered a pinnacle of <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_architecture.html" title="Naval architecture">naval architecture</a> and technological achievement. It was thought by <i>The Shipbuilder</i> magazine to be "practically unsinkable". <i>Titanic</i> was divided into 16 compartments with doors that were held by a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic.html" title="Magnetic">magnetic</a> latch and would fall by moving a switch on the bridge; however, the watertight <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulkhead_%28partition%29.html" title="Bulkhead (partition)">bulkheads</a> did not reach the entire height of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deck_%28ship%29.html" title="Deck (ship)">decks</a> (only going as far as E-Deck). <i>Titanic</i> could stay afloat with any two of its compartments flooded, eleven of fourteen possible combinations of three compartments flooding or the first/last four compartments flooded; any more and the ship would sink.</p>

<p>For its time, the ship was unsurpassed in its luxury and opulence. The ship offered an onboard swimming pool, gymnasium, a <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_bath.html" title="Turkish bath">Turkish bath</a>, library and <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squash_%28sport%29.html" title="Squash (sport)">squash court</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_class_travel.html" title="First class travel">First-class</a> common rooms were ornately decorated with elaborate wood paneling, expensive furniture and other elegant decorations. In addition, Café Parisienne offered superb cuisine for the first-class passengers with a delightful sunlit veranda fitted with trellis decorations.</p>
<p>Second-class and even third-class accommodation and common rooms were likewise considered as opulent as first-class on many other ships of the day. The ship offered three <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevator.html" title="Elevator">lifts</a> for use of first-class passengers and, as an innovation, offered one lift for second-class passengers.</p>
<p>The crown jewel of the ship's interiors was undoubtedly its forward first-class grand <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staircase.html" title="Staircase">staircase</a>, between the forward and second funnels. Extending down to E-Deck and decorated with oak paneling and gilded balustrades, it was topped by an ornate wrought-iron and glass dome which brought in natural light. On the uppermost landing was a large panel containing a clock flanked by the allegorical figures of Honour and Glory crowning Time. A similar, less ornate staircase, complete with matching dome, was located between the third and fourth <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funnel_%28ship%29.html" title="Funnel (ship)">funnels</a>.</p>

<p><i>Titanic</i> was nearly identical to its older sister, <i>Olympic</i>, but there were a few differences between the ships. Some of them were suggested by <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Ismay_3971.html" title="Bruce Ismay">Bruce Ismay</a>, based on observations he had made of <i>Olympic</i>. The most noticeable differences were that half of <i>Titanic's</i> forward promenade A-Deck (below the lifeboat deck) was enclosed, while its B-Deck configuration was completely different from that found on <i>Olympic</i>. <i>Titanic</i> was fitted with a specialty restaurant called Café Parisienne, a feature that <i>Olympic</i> wouldn't be provided with until 1913. Some of the flaws found on <i>Olympic</i>, such as the creaking of the aft expansion joint, were corrected on <i>Titanic</i>. Other differences such as <i>Titanic's</i> skid lights, that provide natural illumination on A-deck, were round while on <i>Olympic</i> they were oval. <i>Titanic's</i> wheelhouse was modified to be narrower and longer than <i>Olympic's</i>. <a href="http://titanic-model.com/db/db-01/db_09.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://titanic-model.com/db/db-01/db_09.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> These and other modifications made <i>Titanic</i> 1,004 tonnes larger than <i>Olympic</i>.</p>
