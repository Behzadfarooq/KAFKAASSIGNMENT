<p><a href="../../../c/a/c/Cache_Valley_1145.html" title="Cache Valley">Cache Valley</a>, originally called <b>Seuhubeogoi</b> (Shoshoni for <i>Willow Valley</i>), was the traditional hunting grounds for the Northwestern Shoshone, particularly as a gathering place for grain and grass seeds, as well as hunting both small game like <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodchuck.html" title="Woodchuck">woodchuck</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_squirrel.html" title="Ground squirrel">ground squirrel</a>; large game animals including <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deer.html" title="Deer">deer</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/k/Elk_%28Cervus_canadensis%29_9b80.html" title="Elk (Cervus canadensis)">elk</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bison.html" title="Bison">buffalo</a>; as well as <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trout.html" title="Trout">trout</a> from the rivers.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> This mountain valley had also attracted the attention of fur traders and trappers, where trappers and explorers like <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Bridger_6281.html" title="Jim Bridger">Jim Bridger</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedediah_Smith_3023.html" title="Jedediah Smith">Jedediah Smith</a> made visits to the region. The name <i>Cache Valley</i> derives its name from the fact that these fur trappers left stores of their furs and goods (aka a <i>cache</i> of furs) in this valley as a central staging area for hunting trips in the surrounding mountain ranges.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>So impressed were the trappers by the region that they recommended to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> that he consider the valley as a location for the original settlement of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_pioneers.html" title="Mormon pioneers">Mormon pioneers</a>. Instead, Brigham Young chose <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_Valley_732b.html" title="Salt Lake Valley">Salt Lake Valley</a>, even though Mormon settlers would eventually move to Cache Valley.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> As early as July 31st, 1847, a Shoshone delegation of about 20 met with the Mormons to discuss land claims over northern Utah.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Population_pressures_on_the_Shoshone" id="Population_pressures_on_the_Shoshone"></a></p>

<p>The establishment of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Trail_9b01.html" title="California Trail">California</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon_Trail_4b43.html" title="Oregon Trail">Oregon</a> trails, as well as the establishment of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Lake_City_6042.html" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a> in 1847 brought the Shoshone people into regular contact with American emigrants moving westward. By 1856, the first permanent settlements and farms in Cache Valley were established, starting at <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellsville%2C_Utah_6be4.html" title="Wellsville, Utah">Wellsville</a> and gradually moving northward.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>A significant policy established by Brigham Young at the time recommended that the Mormon settlers establish friendly relationships with the surrounding American Indian tribes, particularly with a policy to "feed them rather than fight them".<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Even with this policy, however, significant food resources were being consumed and overtaken by settlers pushing the Shoshone increasingly into areas of marginal food production. In addition, foraging and hunting by pioneers traveling on the western migration trails took additional resources away from the Shoshone. As early as 1859 this was recognized by Jacob Forney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory of Utah, who wrote "The Indians...have become improverished by the introduction of a white population". He further recommended that an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Reservation_33a9.html" title="Indian Reservation">Indian Reservation</a> be established in Cache Valley to protect essential resources for the Shoshone. This recommendation was ignored by the U.S. Dept. of Interior and his superiors.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Into this environment, it is almost inevitable that conflicts would arise between these Native Americans and the settlers in this region. The Shoshone, desperate and starving, found attacking nearby farms and cattle ranches not just a matter of revenge but a matter of survival.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>To add the capstone of problems to all of the rest in Cache Valley, gold was discovered by John White on Grasshopper Creek in the mountains of southwestern <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana.html" title="Montana">Montana</a> on July 28th, 1862, just north of Cache Valley.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> This lead to the the establishment of a migration and supply trail right through the middle of Cache Valley between this mining camp and Salt Lake City, the nearest significant source of goods and food in the area.<sup id="_ref-Glory_Hunter.2C_p._78_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glory_Hunter.2C_p._78" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>There were several incidents in the summer and fall of 1862 that lead to the eventual confrontation between Bear Hunter and Col. Connor. While viewed as isolated incidents they seem insignificant, when grouped together a picture of broad struggles over almost the entire United States west of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> can be seen during this time period when the attention of the nation was focused on the battles going on in the eastern states. Modern historians have often overlooked these incidents because they occurred near the ill-defined boundary of two different territorial jurisdictions (<a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Territory_b08e.html" title="Washington Territory">Washington Territory</a> and <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Territory_8ecd.html" title="Utah Territory">Utah Territory</a>), where the incidents are geographically close but the administrative centers dealing with them are over 1000 miles apart. Indeed, the vicinity of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin%2C_Idaho_8180.html" title="Franklin, Idaho">Franklin</a> and the general location of the conflict was assumed to be in the Utah Territory, with residents of Franklin sending elected representatives to the Utah Territorial Legislature and participating in the politics of <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cache_County%2C_Utah_ff43.html" title="Cache County, Utah">Cache County, Utah</a> until 1872 when a surveying team pointed out that they were, in fact, in Idaho.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>A resident of Summit Creek (now <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithfield%2C_Utah_33a7.html" title="Smithfield, Utah">Smithfield</a>) found his horse missing and accused a young Indian who was fishing in Summit Creek of having stolen the animal. Robert Thornley, an English immigrant and first resident of Summit Creek defended the young Indian by pointing out that he still had live fish strung on a willow immersed in the creek, so he would have had no time to steal a horse, hide it away, and return to his fishing. But a jury of locals hung the young Indian anyway. The name of the young man has come down in local history as Pugweenee. Later information reveals that <i>Pugweenee</i> is the Shoshone word for "fish," so it is probable that the young man was merely saying "look at my fish," or "I was just fishing."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It turned out that the young Indian was the son of the local <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoshone.html" title="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> Chief and within a few days the Indians retaliated by killing a couple of young men of the Merrill family who were gathering wood in the nearby canyon.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p>On September 9th, 1860, Elijah Otter lead a group of migrants on the Oregon trail when they were attacked by a group of presumably Bannock and Boise Shoshone. In spite of attempts to placate these Native Americans, an attack ensued and nearly the entire migrant party was killed and their livestock driven off. Alexis Van Ornum, his family, and about ten others made an escape to avoid death by leaving all of their possessions and hide in some nearby brush, only to be massacred. They were later discovered by a company of U.S. Soldiers lead by Captain F.T. Dent. One of the officers of this company, Lieutenant Marcus A. Reno, came across the mutilated bodies of six of the Van Ornums, where four of their children were apparently taken captive by the attacking warriors.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a direct result of this incident, a military fort was established near the present location of <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boise%2C_Idaho_9089.html" title="Boise, Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a>, where Colonel George Wright requested $150,000 from the Federal Government to establish a military post able to sustain five companies of troops.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Zachias Van Ornum, the brother of Alexis, heard a story from a relative who had just been on the Oregon Trail that a small white boy of about the same age as his nephew was being held by a group of Northwestern Shoshone and likely to be in Cache Valley.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[21]</a></sup> Assuming this to be his nephew Reuben Van Ornum, he gathered a small group of friends and traveled to Salt Lake City in order to get some help from the territorial government.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[22]</a></sup> Upon arrival in Salt Lake City, he visited Col. Connor at Fort Douglas requesting assistance at trying to retrieve his nephew. Col. Connor agreed to help out, and sent a detachment of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> under the command of Major Edward McGarry to Cache Valley to rendezvous with Van Ornum near the town of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Providence%2C_Utah_953d.html" title="Providence, Utah">Providence, Utah</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Van Ornum located a small group of Shoshoni warriors being lead by Chief <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_Hunter_b7f6.html" title="Bear Hunter">Bear Hunter</a> and soon joined with McGarry in following the Shoshone as they retreated to nearby Providence Canyon.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[24]</a></sup> McGarry gave the order "to kill every Indian they could see."<sup id="_ref-Sagwitch.2C_p._42_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sagwitch.2C_p._42" title="">[25]</a></sup> A skirmish between the Shoshone and the U.S. Army lasted for about two hours after the Shoshone established a defensible position in the canyon.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[26]</a></sup> Afterward, Chief Bear Hunter then attempted to signal surrender by climbing a foothill and waving a flag of truce.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chief Bear Hunter, together with approximately 20 of his people, were taken prisoner into the soldier's camp near Providence.

<p>On December 4th, 1862, Connor sent McGarry on another expedition to Cache Valley, this time to recover some stolen stock from an encampment of Shoshone. In spite of attempted secrecy, the Shoshone were able to break camp and flee before the Army arrived, cutting the ropes of a ferry at the crossing.

<p>A.H. Conover, an operator of a freight hauling service between the mining camps of Montana and Salt Lake City, was attacked by a group of Shoshoni warriors that killed two other men that were accompanying him on the journey: George Clayton and Henry Bean. When he arrived in Salt Lake City following the incident, he told a reporter for the <i>Deseret News</i> that the Shoshone were "determined to avenge the blood of their comrades" killed by Major McGarry and his soldiers, and that the Shoshone intended to "kill every white man they should meet on the north side of the Bear River, till they should be fully avenged." <sup id="_ref-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._178_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._178" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>The final incident that ultimately triggered Connor's expedition into Cache Valley involved a group of eight miners also on the Montana trail, which unfortunately came within just two miles of the main Shoshoni winter encampment north of Franklin.</p>
<p>As the miners traveled down the general path of the Montana Trail, they missed a turn in the road and instead ended up mired and lost on the western side of the Bear River, unable to cross the river because it was too deep. Three men from the party swam across the river to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Utah_5163.html" title="Richmond, Utah">Richmond</a> and attempted to obtain some provisions and a guide from the settlers.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[34]</a></sup> Before they could return, the rest of the group was attacked by Shoshone, killing John Henry Smith of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walla_Walla%2C_Washington_c956.html" title="Walla Walla, Washington">Walla Walla</a>, as well as some horses. Residents of Richmond soon returned with the advance party, and recovered the body of John Smith, where he was eventually buried in the Richmond city cemetery.<sup id="_ref-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._178_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._178" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>The miners eventually made their way to Salt Lake City. William Bevins, one of the miners, came before Chief Justice John F. Kinney and swore an affidavit describing the murder of John Smith. Kinney then issued a <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrant_%28law%29.html" title="Warrant (law)">warrant</a> for the arrest of Chiefs Bear Hunter, Sanpitch, and Sagwitch and ordered the territorial marshal to seek assistance from Col.

<p>While the legal documents certainly were a motivating factor for Connor, he later described that the legal basis was not strictly necessary for him to mount an expedition against the Shoshone. As explained by Connor in an official report to the U.S. War Department prior to the engagement:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I have the honor to report to you that from information received from various sources of the encampment of a large body of Indians on the Bear River, 140 miles north of this point, who had murdered several miners, during the winter, passing to and from the settlements in this valley to the Bear River mines east of the Rocky Mountains. And being satisfied that they were part of the same band who had been murdering emigrants on the Overland Mail Route for the last 15 years, and the principal actors and leaders in the horrid massacre of the past summer. I determined, although the season was unfavorable to military expedition in consequence of cold weather and deep snow, to chastise them if possible."<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[35]</a></sup></dd>

<p>In many ways, the soldiers stationed at Fort Douglas were spoiling for a fight. In addition to discipline problems among the soldiers, there was a minor "mutiny" among the soldiers where a joint petition by most of the California Volunteers made a request to withhold over $30,000 from their paychecks for the sole purpose of instead paying for naval passage to the eastern states, and to "serve their country in shooting traitors instead of eating rations and freezing to death around sage brush fires..." Furthermore, they stated that they would gladly pay this money "for the <i>privilege</i> (original emphasis) of going to the Potomac and getting shot." This request was declined by the War Department.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout most of January 1863, soldiers at Fort Douglas were preparing for a lengthy expedition traveling north to the Shoshone. Connor also wanted to keep word of his expedition secret, in order to make a surprise attack upon the Shoshone when he arrived. To do this, he separated his command into two different detachments, that were to periodically come together on their journey to Cache Valley. His main concern was to not duplicate the problems that McGarry faced in the earlier action, where the Shoshone moved and scattered even before his troops could arrive.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Reaction to this military campaign was mixed. George A. Smith, in the official <b>Journal History of the LDS Church</b>, wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It is said that Col. Connor is determined to exterminate the Indians who have been killing the Emigrants on the route to the Gold Mines in Washington Territory. Small detachments have been leaving for the North for several days. If the present expedition copies the doings of the other that preceded it, it will result in catching some friendly Indians, murdering them, and letting the guilty scamps remain undisturbed in their mountain haunts."<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[37]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>On the other hand, the <i>Deseret News</i> in an editorial expressed:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"...with ordinary good luck, the volunteers will 'wipe them out.' We wish this community rid of all such parties, and if Col. Connor be successful in reaching that bastard class of humans who play with the lives of the peaceable and law abiding citizens in this way, we shall be pleased to acknowledge our obligations."<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[38]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The first group to leave from Fort Douglas was an infantry company commanded by Captain Samuel W. Hoyt of about 80 soldiers, accompanied by 15 baggage wagons and two "mountain howitzers". They left on January 22nd, 1863.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second group, led personally by Connor himself, was a group of 220 cavalry which left on January 25th. As orders specific for this campaign, Connor ordered each soldier to carry "40 rounds of rifle ammunition and 30 rounds of pistol ammunition". This was a total of nearly 16,000 rounds for the campaign. In addition, nearly 200 rounds of artillery shot were brought with the howitzers.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[40]</a></sup> As a part of the deception, the cavalry were to travel at night while the infantry moved during the day.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[41]</a></sup> Accompanying Connor was the former U.S. Marshall and Mormon scout, <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin_Porter_Rockwell_a5b3.html" title="Orrin Porter Rockwell">Orrin Porter Rockwell</a>.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the evening of January 28th, Captain Hoyt's infantry finally arrived near the town of Franklin, where they spotted three Shoshone who were attempting to get food supplies from the settlers in the town. The Shoshone received nine bushels of wheat into three sacks. William Hull, the settler who was assisting the Shoshone, noted later:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"we had two of the three horses loaded, having put three bushels on each horse...when I looked up and saw the Soldiers approaching from the south. I said to the Indian boys, 'Here comes the <i>Toquashes</i> (Shoshoni for U.S. Soldiers) maybe, you will all be killed. They answered 'maybe Toquashes be killed too,' but not waiting for the third horse to be loaded, they quickly jumped upon their horses and led the three horses away, disappearing in the distance."<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[43]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The sacks of grain carried by these Shoshoni were later found by the 3rd California Volunteers during their advance the next day, apparently dropped by the Shoshone in their attempt to get back to their camp.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Col. Connor met up with Hoyt that evening as well, with orders to begin moving at about 1:00 A.M. the next morning for a surprise attack, but an attempt to try and get a local settler to act as a scout for the immediate area led the actual advance to wait until 3:00 A.M.<sup id="_ref-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._183_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._183" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>It should be noted that this military action took place during perhaps the coldest time of the year in Cache Valley. Local settlers commented that it was unseasonably cold even for northern Utah, and it may have been as cold as -20° F (-30° C) on the morning of the 29th when the attack began. Several soldiers had come down with frostbite and other cold-weather problems, so that the 3rd volunteers were only at about 2/3rds of their strength compared to when they left Fort Douglas.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[45]</a></sup> Among the rations issued to the soldiers during the campaign was a ration of <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey.html" title="Whiskey">whiskey</a> held in a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canteen.html" title="Canteen">canteen</a>, where several soldiers noted that this whiskey froze solid on the night before the attack.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is apparent that the Shoshoni chiefs were far from ignorant of the potential for conflict with Col. Connor's soldiers, and some minor preparations were made at the same time. Most of this involved mainly gathering foodstuffs from surrounding Mormon settlements, in a fashion very similar to the incident listed above with the residents of Richmond, Utah.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Most of the weapons that the Shoshone had at the time of the attack were mainly guns that had been captured from the various small skirmishes they were involved with, as trading goods with fur trappers and settlers and other Native American tribal groups, or simply antiques that had been handed down from one generation to another over the years.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[47]</a></sup> Clearly they were not as standardized or as well built as the guns issued by the Union Army to the soldiers of the California Volunteers.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Bear Hunter and the other Shoshoni chiefs did, however, make some defensive arrangements around their encampment, in addition to simply selecting a generally defensible position in the first place. Willow branches had been woven into makeshift screens, hiding the position and numbers of Shoshone. They also dug a series of "rifle pits" along the eastern bank of Beaver Creek as well as along the Bear River.<sup id="_ref-Sagwitch.2C_p._48_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sagwitch.2C_p._48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps most ironic was that at the same time the arrest warrant was being issued by Justice Kinney, Chief Sanpitch (named in the warrant) was in Salt Lake City trying to negotiate peace on behalf of the Northwestern Shoshone. A correspondent for the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento_Union_8448.html" title="Sacramento Union">Sacramento Union</a> reported "The Prophet (Brigham Young) had told Sanpitch the Mormon people had suffered enough from the Shoshoni of Cache Valley and that if more blood were spilled the Mormons might just "pitch in" and help the troops."<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>While it appears as though the deception by Connor to hide the numbers of his soldiers involved in the confrontation was successful, the Shoshone were not even then anticipating a direct military engagement with these soldiers. Instead, they were preparing for a negotiated settlement where the chiefs would be able to talk with officers of the U.S. Army and try to come to an understanding.<sup id="_ref-Sagwitch.2C_p._48_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sagwitch.2C_p._48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>

<p>Major McGarry and the first cavalry units of the 2nd California Cavalry Regiment arrived at the battle scene at 6:00 a.m., just as dawn was breaking over the mountains. Due to the weather conditions and deep snow, it took some time for Connor to organize his soldiers into a battle line. The artillery pieces never did make it to the battle as they got caught in a snow drift six miles from the Shoshone encampment.<sup id="_ref-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._183_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shoshoni_Frontier.2C_p._183" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chief Sagwitch noted the approach of the American soldiers when he said, according to his grandson Moroni Timbimboo, "Look like there is something up on the ridge up there. Look like a cloud. Maybe it is a steam come from a horse. Maybe that's them soldiers they were talking about"<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[50]</a></sup> Soon afterward, the first shots of this incident occurred.</p>
<p>Initially Connor tried a direct <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frontal_assault.html" title="Frontal assault">frontal offensive</a> against the Shoshoni positions, but was soon overwhelmed with return gunfire from the Shoshone. It was during this initial assault that most of the direct combat related casualties occurred to the California Volunteers.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After temporarily retreating and regrouping, Connor sent McGarry and several other smaller groups into <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanking.html" title="Flanking">flanking</a> manuvers attacking the village from the sides and from behind, with a line of infantry that stood to block any attempt by the Shoshone to flee from the battle.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After about two hours, the Shoshone had run out of ammunition. According to some later reports, some Shoshone were seen attempting to cast lead ammunition during the middle of the battle, and had died with the molds still in their hands. When the ammunition ran out for the Shoshoni warriors, the battle quickly turned into a massacre.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>As the Shoshone were reaching desperate measures to fight off the U.S. Army, including the use of tomahawks and archery, the soldiers seemed to lose all sense of control and discipline. After most of the men were killed, soldiers proceeded to rape and molest the women of the encampment, and many of the children were also shot and killed. In some cases, soldiers held the feet of infants by the heel and "beat their brains out on any hard substance they could find." Those women who refused to submit to the soldiers were shot and killed. One local resident, Alexander Stalker, noted that at this time many soldiers pulled out their pistols and shot several Shoshoni people at point blank range. The soldiers also deliberately burned almost everything they could get their hands on, especially the dwelling structures that the Shoshone had been sleeping in, and killing anybody they found to be still inside.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

<p>While the death toll among the Shoshoni people was very large, there were some survivors of the experience. Most notable was that Chief Sagwitch was able to flee from the scene, who was able to help gather the remaining survivors and attempt to keep his community alive. Sagwitch himself was shot twice in the hand and attempted to flee on horseback only to have the horse shot out from under him. Eventually he ran down the ravine and tumbled into the Bear River, floating in some brush until nightfall.</p>
<p>Sagwitch's son, Beshup Timbimboo, was shot at least seven times but somehow survived and lived long enough to be rescued by family members. Other members of the band somehow hid in the willow brush of the Bear River, or tried to act as if they were dead. After the battle was considered over by the Army officers, the soldiers returned to their temporary encampment near Franklin. This gave Sagwitch and the rest of the Shoshone the opportunity to retrieve the wounded and build a fire for those that were still alive.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>The residents of Franklin opened their homes to the wounded soldiers that night, and brought in blankets and hay into the church meetinghouse for the rest of the soldiers to avoid exposure to the cold. Connor also hired several residents of Franklin to hitch up sleighs and help bring the wounded back to Salt Lake City.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The California Volunteers lost 27 soldiers, including five officers.

Connor continued for many more years with accusations of harassment of non-Mormons in the Utah Territory and criticisms by Mormons of Connor's attempts to begin a mining industry in Utah.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chief Sagwitch and many members of his band made a much more formal alliance with the Mormons, with many of them being baptized and joining the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">LDS Church</a>. Sagwitch himself was ordained to the office of an Elder in the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchizedek_priesthood.html" title="Melchizedek priesthood">Melchizedek priesthood</a>. Eventually members of this band helped to establish the town of Washakie, Utah, named in honor of the Shoshone chieftain. Most of the remaining members of the Northwestern band of Shoshone built farms and homesteads under LDS Church sponsorship, and their descendants became largely integrated into the mainstream LDS society. The remaining Shoshone that did not get involved with this settlement instead went to the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Hall_Indian_Reservation_7ec9.html" title="Fort Hall Indian Reservation">Fort Hall Indian Reservation</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for Col. Connor and the California Volunteers, they were treated as heroes upon arrival at Fort Douglas as well as by members of their community in California, according to published newspaper articles. As a direct result of this military campaign, Connor was promoted to the permanent rank of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_General_8b0d.html" title="Brigadier General">Brigadier General</a> and given a <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet_%28military%29.html" title="Brevet (military)">brevet</a> promotion shortly afterward to the rank of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Major General</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[56]</a></sup> Connor was to continue his campaigns against Native American peoples throughout the remainder of the U.S. Civil War, with a significant campaign of note called the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powder_River_Expeditions_e118.html" title="Powder River Expeditions">Powder River Expedition</a> against the <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux.html" title="Sioux">Sioux</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne.html" title="Cheyenne">Cheyenne</a>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
