<dd>I second this question - it looks like someone deleted the introductory paragraph and went straight into etymology. And judging by the discussion below, this has been an issue for over a year. Should be merged into <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_Generation_1eb4.html" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a>? <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMosmof_7aef.html" title="User:Mosmof">Mosmof</a> 06:38, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, lead paragraph fixed. The problem with this article is that the original writing was done by someone who mistakenly believed that beatniks were real people rather than media caricatures. Thus, when I did a total rewrite, I found it difficult to make changes because that attitude permeated every paragraph. The article still needs a direct quote from Kerouac's "Origins" PLAYBOY article in contrast with a description of Roger Corman's <i>A Bucket of Blood</i> (1959). Discussion below makes it clear why it should not be merged. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepso_53bb.html" title="User:Pepso">Pepso</a> 11:18, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article did not contain anything that was not present at <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_Generation_1eb4.html" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a>, and frankly, I don't see how it ever could...if not for the programming language, I would have preferred a simple redirect to Beat Generation.</p>

<dd>The slew of links to the page all seem to refer to the Beat Generation meaning; what I suggest is a redirect to Beat Generation and one of those notices there saying "Beatnik redirects here. There is also a programming language..." If anyone objects to this, say so now or forever hold your peace.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, I object to it very strongly. I'm one of the authors of the Beat Generation page, and (1) I really don't like having a remark about an obscure programming language being the first thing someone sees on the page; and (2) many things are discussed in the Beat Generation page besides the term Beatnik... you need to read really far down the page in order find the discussion of the "Beatnik Stereotype". This has already created some confusion where another author came by and decided that we really needed the bit about Herb Caen inventing the term Beatnik in the first paragraph, even though this repeats material further down in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I would suggest is to leave the page "Beatnik" in place as a disambiguation node, included the cross-reference to Beatnik. Don't automatically re-direct from Beatnik to Beat Generation. If we've got to repeat the Herb Caen bit, we might as well do it on another page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I don't understand how these redirects work well enough to fix the thing myself... it looks a lot to me like it should skip automatically down to the sub-topic The Beatnik Sterotype, but instead it points at the top of the Beat Generation page, which is a big part of the problem in itself.</dd>

<p>I, for one, am of the belief that referring to a member or disciple of the Beats as a "Beatnik" is quite derogatory. The definition of Beat is detailed sufficiently in the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">Beat generation</a> article, but a Beat<i>nik</i> is the type of person who followed the egregious stereotypes of the culture presented in the mass media for the sake of trendiness and/or superficial style. The type of people that hounded <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a> into the solace of the bottle, and thereby a tragically early grave. My weak side despises this kind of person, fervently. For the sake of respect, if nothing else, I've changed this redirect to point to the subsection on Beatniks within the main Beat Generation article (even though redirection to an anchor is not correctly implemented in Wikipedia}.</p>

<dd>I fixed the link so that it goes to the subtopic: it needed to be in "canonical form", i.e. "The_Beatnik_Stereotype". Currently there is no mention of the "Beatnik programming language" in the landing pad at that point though... maybe I'll get around to "fixing" that later (I still think a disambiguation page might be better than this redirect).</dd>

<p>I agree with the discussion immediately above about how the term beatnik was originally intended to be <i>derogatory</i>, but I think that just as the term 'yankee doodle' was originally intended by the British to be derogatory, what was later done with the term remained up to the 'yankees', who seem to have done quite well with it thank you. So I believe that the term 'beatnik' need not be shunned, but merely accepted and moved on with. Accordingly I have now reinstated this article as a Wiki article, removed its status as a mere redirect, and I have rewritten the article to attempt to better clarify the distinction between <i>communism</i> and <i>beatnikism</i>, whatever that is....</p>
<p>I think that this article on <i>beatnks</i> deserves its own dedicated article, as the term looms so large in popular vernacular usage. As such, it seems to me that an article that serves to clarify the meaning of the term might be of value to some, especially if it might delineate the differences between the beatnik philosophy and the communist philosophy.</p>

<dd>But you haven't succeeded in adding any information that wasn't in the original squib that I wrote inside the "Beat Generation" article. There's a weak connection to the "Beatles" in there, and a *really* dubious assertion that Yoko Ono is seen as a beatnik... otherwise it's a lot of words that don't say too much, if you ask me. Oh, and you used the phrase "anti-materialist" a lot, which could be played up in "Beat Generation" if you're really interested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I'm not *entirely* opposed to having this as a second page, I suppose... it may help alleviate the tendency to bloat the original "Beat Generation" page, but on the other hand I'm not going to be happy if this node siphons off material that really should go over there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The distinction between beatniks and beats seems awfully small to try and justify a second page. You're worried that people might confuse beats and commies? This strikes me as being an issue that dies along with communism. And anyway, some beats really were commies, of a sort.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe a page on "beatnik fashion"? That might make some sense. As it is most of this article is redundant with what's in "beat generation".</dd>

<dd>The main reason that I see a need for two separate articles is the difference between the popular image of what <i>beatnik</i> means, and the actual <i>beat generation</i> school of thought. Trying to merge this article with the article about the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">Beat generation</a> would seem to me to be like trying to merge the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">Hippie</a> article with a <i>New Age Thought</i> article. I do agree that <i>detailed</i> information about the actual <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">Beat generation</a> belongs only in that article, and only a very brief summary of this type of information would seem to belong here.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't know Yoko Ono considers herself to be a beatnik. Also, I looked for evidence of actual beatniks that were commies and wasn't able to find any. I'd like to know who you might be referring to. I did see one reference to Ginsberg being called a commie, but nothing in Ginsberg's writings accepting that title.

<p>I came to this article after typeing in "beatnik" as opposed to "beat generation", because I was <i>not</i> aware there was a difference. I found the article to be informative and quite well written.

<p>The picture from Zig Zag cigarettes has nothing to do with the Beat movement. The man depicted on Zig zag products is a French soldier known as a Zouave, and is used because the Zouave is credited with inventing the cigarette.</p>

<dd>The old zig-zag image that was a bereted and bearded dude did seem to me to be at least somewhat representative of a beatnik, however, working on your suggestion, I have replaced it with what is probably a more representative image. Namely a cartoon portrayal of a beatnik. Thanks for pointing out the need for a better image.</dd>

<p>Having read the above discussion... I agree with the arguments against maintaining this page separate from <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_Generation_1eb4.html" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a>, not because of any past or present perjorative connotations (we have a page for <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> after all), but simply because the information is mostly already there, and might as well be centralized there, until the Beatnik section is big enough to bud off on its own. So, I wonder if anyone has an argument against this being a disambiguation page, something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Beatnik</b> may refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Beatnik programming language</b></li>
<li>A stereotypical member of the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_Generation_1eb4.html" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a></li>
</ul>
{{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisambig_6efb.html" title="Template:Disambig">disambig</a>}}</blockquote>
<p>Some of the current contents of this page could be merged into <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_Generation_1eb4.html" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a>, but a lot of it is just attempting to summarize information that's more well-covered there already. Opinions?<br />

<dd>You are correct that much of the information in this article is duplicated in the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">Beat generation</a> article, however much of it is not. It seems to me that the etymological explanation of the different derivations and connotations of the words <i>beat</i>, vs: <i>beatnik</i> is an explanation worthy of its own article, and that these types of information would probably have to be mostly deleted if a merge were attempted. Also, the term, <i>beatnik</i> seems to me to have a certain popular iconic status, which seems to me to also show the merit of this separate article here about the word's etymology and popular meaning, cross-linked with, but not merged with, the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">Beat generation</a> article.</dd>

<p>I'd have to agree with the earlier suggestions that "Beatnik" be merged as a subset of "Beat generation", if for no other reason that that this article seems more about the coinage of the term than about the stereoptype itself. And since the stereotype isn't really the point of the beat movement, but simply an essentially made-up media idea that was then assimilated as pop-culture iconography, it probably would make sense to discuss it simply within the context of the beats in general.</p>
<p><i>However</i>, this entry with some trimming could be put in the category of word etymology, so that, with a name change (and I'm afraid the etymology category isn't my beat, so I don't know its Wiki conventions), it becomes about the <b>word</b> not the stereotype, which might best be discussed under <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Beat generation">Beat generation</a>.

<dd>I don't see a problem with reporting on iconography, which, admittedly this article does. For example, to create an article on iconography itself, or the making of actual religious icons in the Eastern Orthodox Church, may not have much to do with early Christianity, but it would have much to do with the society of the Eastern Orthodox Church. To delete or merge such an article merely because it would not have much to do with early Christianity itself would seem to me to be a mistake, well intended though it might be. Likewise to delete this article about the iconography of the Beatnik movement and the etymology of the term, simply because that iconography has little to do with the original Beat Generation philosophy would seem to me to be a mistake as well.</dd>

<p>The etymology of the word 'Beatnik' contradicts the explanation offered in the 'Beat Generation' article, which explains it as a combination of the word 'Beat' used by the beat poets, and the '-nik' suffix used to insult them by implying communist sympathies. Where did this whole string of older words come from? All these assigned meanings to 'dig' and 'cool', is this page intended for Uncyclopedia? -user:207.190.229.94 March 31, 2006</p>

<dd>I agree. All the statements detailing Cornish or Irish etymologies need sources very soon. I'm <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a>; otherwise I would've removed the statements immediately and possibly archived them here on the talk page. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=beatnik+bennek" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=beatnik+bennek" rel="nofollow">Google for <i>beatnik bennek</i></a> does not impress me at all. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beatnik&amp;diff=45508072&amp;oldid=44726996" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beatnik&amp;diff=45508072&amp;oldid=44726996" rel="nofollow">The passages that I question</a> span several edits from 2006-03-23 03:06:51 UTC to 2006-03-26 03:03:10 UTC. --<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficiallyover_61b0.html" title="User:Officiallyover">Officiallyover</a> 22:14, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed the undocumented etymology references. The fact that the references themselves stated within them that they were <i>undocumented</i> and <i>only verbal</i> was enough for me to assume that they were what Wiky defines as <i>original research</i> and therefore not suitable as Wiky content.</p>

<p>This article needs to be revised. Marxist-Leninism is a materialist philosophy. And I don't mean in the "spiritual" sense as this article implies. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.236.5.240" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=68.236.5.240" rel="nofollow">User 68.236.5.240</a> 19:06, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not certain exactly what you mean here. Would you be able to point out exactly which wording of the article you think could be improved? (BTW, if you sign your entries with a dash followed by four tildes like: -~~~~, then Wiki will automatically fill in your user info and the date for you.)

<dd>Sure thing, the article on wikipedia about <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialism.html" title="Materialism">Materialism</a> goes into detail about it. Marxist-Leninism is a materialist philosophy, it doesn't have a problem with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumerism.html" title="Consumerism">Consumerism</a> other than it being a perpetuation of the Capitalist system by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodity_fetishism.html" title="Commodity fetishism">commodity fetishism</a>, it is not anti-materialistic like in Beatnik culture and as such is not based on spiritual grounds. The thing Beatnik culture has in common with Marxist Leninism is its subversiveness to the status quo in a Capitalist country.--68.236.5.240 02:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
