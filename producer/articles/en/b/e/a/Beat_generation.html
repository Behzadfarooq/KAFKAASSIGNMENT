<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Edit section: Meaning and usage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Meaning and usage</span></h2>
<p>Kerouac introduced the phrase <i>Beat Generation</i> sometime around <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> to describe his friends and as a general term describing the underground, anti-conformist youth gathering in New York at that time to the novelist <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Clellon_Holmes_253d.html" title="John Clellon Holmes">John Clellon Holmes</a> (who published an early novel about the beat generation, titled <i>Go</i>, in 1952, along with a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifesto.html" title="Manifesto">manifesto</a> of sorts in the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> Magazine: "This is the beat generation"). The adjective <i>beat</i> (introduced to the group by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Huncke_39ae.html" title="Herbert Huncke">Herbert Huncke</a>) had the connotations of "tired" or "down and out," but Kerouac added the paradoxical connotations of <i>upbeat</i>, <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatific_vision.html" title="Beatific vision">beatific</a></i>, and the musical association of being "on the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_%28music%29.html" title="Beat (music)">beat</a>."</p>
<p>Calling this relatively small group of struggling writers, students, hustlers, and drug addicts a "generation" was to make the claim that they were representative and important—the beginnings of a new trend, analogous to the influential <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Generation_f04d.html" title="Lost Generation">Lost Generation</a>.</p>
<p>In trying to define the "Beat Generation", it is important to note that the term was originally used to refer not only to Kerouac's inner circle, but to the burgeoning counter-culture as well. The press used the term in reference to a small group of writers, the friends of Ginsberg, Kerouac, or Burroughs, and a joke among Beat writers (attributed to both <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>) persisted in various forms: "Three friends does not make a generation." A narrow definition of the Beat Generation would include only those who consistently defined themselves as "Beat" writers: Ginsberg, Kerouac, <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Orlovsky_3f36.html" title="Peter Orlovsky">Peter Orlovsky</a>. If "Beat Generation" is defined broadly, the smaller group is called "The New York Beats." In this sense, movements like the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Renaissance_cfee.html" title="San Francisco Renaissance">San Francisco Renaissance</a> and the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mountain_poets_b86d.html" title="Black Mountain poets">Black Mountain poets</a> would be completely separate movements. Defined broadly, (the way <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake">William Blake</a> is defined as a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_poetry.html" title="Romantic poetry">Romantic poet</a>), other writers who reached prominence in the late 1950s, early 1960s, who shared many of the same themes, ideas, intentions, etc. (for example, dedication to spontaneity, open-form composition, subjectivity, and so on), would also be included.</p>
<p>The press also mistakenly pointed to Ginsberg and Kerouac as leaders. This has often led to confusion about who actually should be included in the so-called "Beat Generation." Writers who qualify as part of the "Beat Generation" might deny they were ever a part of it, based on this limiting definition the press gave it. For example, they may say that they were friends of Ginsberg and Kerouac, not followers.Orlovsky had little connection with New York. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_S._Burroughs_4c27.html" title="William S. Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>, one of the most important figures of this group, always adamantly denied he was a part of the "Beat Generation," but an accurate list of the close inner circle would have to include him. Even Kerouac in his later career denied that he was part of the "Beat Generation." Friendship, or at least a brief association, with Ginsberg or Kerouac would be an indication that a writer belongs in this broadly defined list of "Beat" writers.

<p>By either definition, the members of the Beat Generation were new <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemianism.html" title="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> ecstatic epicureans, who often engaged in spontaneous creativity. The style of their work may seem chaotic, but the chaos was purposeful; it highlighted the primacy of such Beat Generation essentials as spontaneity, open emotion, visceral engagement in often gritty worldly experiences. The Beat writers produced a body of written work controversial both for its advocacy of non-conformity and for its non-conforming style.</p>

<p>The first "Beat" work to gain nationwide attention was Ginsberg's "Howl." An obscenity-trial helped fuel its fame. One of the most enduringly famous "Beat" works, Kerouac's <i>On the Road</i> (written in 1952), which heralded the beginning of "Beat" popularity, was not published until 1957, in a sense capitalizing on the fame brought by the "Howl" obscenity-trial. Burroughs' magnum opus, <i>Naked Lunch</i> , likewise went to trial for obscenity. Both obscenity-trials helped to liberalize the kinds of books that could be legally published in the United States. From then on, if anything was deemed to have literary value, it was no longer considered obscene.</p>
<p>Echoes of the Beat Generation run throughout all the forms of alternative/counter culture that have existed since then (e.g. "<a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippies.html" title="Hippies">hippies</a>," "<a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_ideology.html" title="Punk ideology">punks</a>," etc). Also, since the "Beat Generation" had so much direct influence on rock-musicians (the spelling of the name "Beatles" is a sign of this), they had a hand in fostering the image of the rebellious rock-star. The Beat Generation can be seen as the first modern <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subculture.html" title="Subculture">subculture</a> and the first fully American literary movement since the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcendentalists.html" title="Transcendentalists">Transcendentalists</a>.

Though endless travel around the country is part of their romanticized image, most of the central figures (excluding Burroughs) ended up together in San Francisco in the mid-1950s where they met and became friends with figures associated with the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Renaissance_cfee.html" title="San Francisco Renaissance">San Francisco Renaissance</a> such as <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Rexroth_0f2c.html" title="Kenneth Rexroth">Kenneth Rexroth</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Ferlinghetti_56d2.html" title="Lawrence Ferlinghetti">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McClure_8fef.html" title="Michael McClure">Michael McClure</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Whalen_c5f0.html" title="Philip Whalen">Philip Whalen</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Norse_a8d0.html" title="Harold Norse">Harold Norse</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Welch_9f93.html" title="Lew Welch">Lew Welch</a>, and <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby_Doyle_d5f4.html" title="Kirby Doyle">Kirby Doyle</a>. There they met many other poets who had migrated to San Francisco because it had a reputation as an important new center of creativity. This included <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kaufman_3a3b.html" title="Bob Kaufman">Bob Kaufman</a> who was the first to actually be called a "beatnik." Also of significance were <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Lamantia_5e3a.html" title="Philip Lamantia">Philip Lamantia</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tuli_Kupferberg_6cce.html" title="Tuli Kupferberg">Tuli Kupferberg</a>, and members of the recently dissolved Black Mountain College looking for a new center of communal creativity, poets such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Creeley_5801.html" title="Robert Creeley">Robert Creeley</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Dorn_c0f7.html" title="Edward Dorn">Edward Dorn</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Duncan_4f59.html" title="Robert Duncan">Robert Duncan</a>.</p>
<p>Many writers were inspired by the publication of "Howl" and <i>On the Road</i> and decided to join the group. The Beats met most of these writers when they returned to New York: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wieners_8719.html" title="John Wieners">John Wieners</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/r/LeRoi_Jones_b808.html" title="LeRoi Jones">LeRoi Jones</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_DiPrima_af51.html" title="Diane DiPrima">Diane DiPrima</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Waldman_cccf.html" title="Anne Waldman">Anne Waldman</a>.

<p>Perhaps equally important were the less obviously creative members of the scene, who helped form their intellectual environment and provided the writers with much of their content: There was <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Huncke_39ae.html" title="Herbert Huncke">Herbert Huncke</a>, a drug-addict and petty thief whom Burroughs had met in 1946, who introduced the word "beat" and a lot more junky-lingo and the junky lifestyle; <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucien_Carr_468f.html" title="Lucien Carr">Lucien Carr</a>, who was key to introducing many of the central figures to one another; and Hal Chase, an anthropologist from <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver</a>, who, in 1947, introduced into the group <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a>, the hero and symbol of the American dream idolized in much Beat literature.</p>
<p>Also important were the oft-neglected women in the original circle, including <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Vollmer_f542.html" title="Joan Vollmer">Joan Vollmer</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edie_Parker_a13e.html" title="Edie Parker">Edie Parker</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Edit section: Columbia University and The Kammerer Stabbing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Columbia University and The Kammerer Stabbing</span></h3>
<p>The original circle met at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>; although they were later considered anti-academic artists, the seed for the Beat Generation was planted in a highly academic environment. For example, many of their early ideas were formed during arguments with professors such as <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lionel_Trilling_435b.html" title="Lionel Trilling">Lionel Trilling</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Van_Doren_8c22.html" title="Mark Van Doren">Mark Van Doren</a>. This was the very same environment in which some of their classmates, such as <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Simpson_a531.html" title="Louis Simpson">Louis Simpson</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Hall_192e.html" title="Donald Hall">Donald Hall</a>, became champions of formalism. This is where Carr and Ginsberg discussed the need for a "New Vision" (a term borrowed from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rimbaud_4c24.html" title="Arthur Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a>) to move away from Columbia University's conservative notions of literature. With the introduction of Burroughs, Huncke, and Cassady, the new focus became real life experiences instead of academic intellectualizing. Perhaps the most important early experience that drew most of the members of the Beat Generation together was Lucian Carr's stabbing of David Kammerer. This was one reason why Burroughs maintained his close-but-distant relationship with the rest of the Beats. The stabbing was an incident that Kerouac tried to capture twice, once in his first novel <i>The Town and the City</i> and then again in one of his last, <i>The Vanity of Duluoz</i>.</p>
<p>Burroughs was born in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> in 1914; making him roughly ten years older than most of the other original beats. While still living in St. Louis, Burroughs met David Kammerer, and thus began an association presumably based on their shared <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexual</a> orientation and intellectual tendencies.</p>
<p>As a boys' youth-group-leader in the mid-1930s, David Kammerer had become infatuated with the young <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucien_Carr_468f.html" title="Lucien Carr">Lucien Carr</a> (with what encouragement, if any, it is difficult to say). Kammerer formed a pattern of following Carr around the country as he attended (and was expelled from) different colleges. In the fall of 1942, at the University of Chicago, Kammerer introduced 17-year-old Lucien Carr to William S. Burroughs.</p>
<p>Burroughs was a Harvard-graduate who lived off a stipend from his relatively wealthy family. His grandfather had invented the Burroughs Adding Machine, though the amount of wealth in the family is often exaggerated (Kerouac remarked on "the Burroughs Millions", which didn't actually exist).</p>
<p>The three became good friends, whose sprees got Burroughs kicked out of his rooming-house and culminated with Carr confined in a mental ward after an apparent attempted suicide with a gas oven (one version of the story holds that this was a way of avoiding military service).</p>
<p>In the spring of 1943, Carr's family moved him to Columbia University in New York, where Kammerer, and then Burroughs shortly followed.</p>
<p>At Columbia, Carr met the freshman Allen Ginsberg, whom he introduced to Burroughs and Kammerer. Edie Parker, another member of the crowd, introduced Carr to her boyfriend Jack Kerouac when he came back from his stint as a merchant marine. In 1944, Carr introduced Kerouac and Burroughs.</p>
<p>Kammerer's fixation was obvious to everyone in the circle, and he became jealous as Carr developed a relationship with a young woman (Celine Young). In mid-August, 1944, Lucien Carr killed him with a boy scout knife in what may have been self-defense after an altercation in a park on the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson_River_318c.html" title="Hudson River">Hudson River</a>.</p>
<p>Carr disposed of the body in the river. He then sought advice from Burroughs, who recommended that he get a lawyer and turn himself in with a claim of self defense. Instead, Carr then went to Kerouac, who helped him dispose of the weapon.</p>
<p>On the following morning, Carr turned himself in, and Kerouac and Burroughs were both charged as accessories to the crime. Burroughs quickly got the money for bail, but Kerouac's parents refused to post it for him. Edie Parker and her family came through, with the condition that she and Kerouac be married immediately.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Edit section: The Times Square Underworld">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Times Square Underworld</span></h3>
<p>Burroughs had long had an interest in experimenting with criminal behavior, and gradually made contacts in the criminal underground of New York, becoming involved with dealing in stolen goods and narcotics and developing a decades-long addiction to <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium.html" title="Opium">opiates</a>. Burroughs met Herbert Huncke, a small-time criminal and drug-addict who often hung around the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_Square_cdcd.html" title="Times Square">Times Square</a> area.</p>
<p>The beats found Huncke a fascinating character. As Ginsberg put it, they were on a quest for "supreme reality", and felt that Huncke, as a member of the underclass, had learned things they were sheltered from in their middle-class lives.</p>
<p>Various troubles arose from this association: In 1949 Ginsberg was in trouble with the law (his apartment was packed with stolen goods; he had been riding in a car full of stolen goods; and so on). He pleaded insanity and was briefly committed to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellevue_Hospital_1b55.html" title="Bellevue Hospital">Bellevue</a>, where he met <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Solomon_0f21.html" title="Carl Solomon">Carl Solomon</a>. When committed, Carl Solomon was more eccentric than psychotic. A fan of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonin_Artaud_5c9d.html" title="Antonin Artaud">Antonin Artaud</a>, he indulged in some self-consciously "crazy" behavior, e.g. throwing potato salad at a lecturer on <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dada.html" title="Dada">Dadaism</a>. Ted Morgan also mentions an incident where he stole a peanut-butter sandwich in a cafeteria, and showed it to a security-guard. If not crazy when he was admitted, Solomon was arguably driven mad by the shock-treatments applied at Bellevue, and this is one of the things referred to in Ginsberg's poem "Howl" (which was dedicated to Carl Solomon). After his release, Solomon became the publishing contact that agreed to publish Burroughs' first novel <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junky_%28novel%29.html" title="Junky (novel)">Junky</a> (1953), shortly before another episode resulted in his being committed again.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Edit section: Neal Cassady">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Neal Cassady</span></h3>
<p>The introduction of <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a> into the scene in 1947 had a number of effects. A number of the beats were enthralled with Cassady — Ginsberg had an affair with him and became his personal writing-tutor; and Kerouac's road-trips with him in the late 40s became a focus of his second novel, <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Road_e0ec.html" title="On the Road">On the Road</a></i>. Cassady is one of the sources of "rapping" - the loose spontaneous babble that later became associated with "beatniks" (see below). He was not much of a writer himself, though the core writers of the group were impressed with the free-flowing style of some of his letters, and Kerouac cited this as a key influence on his invention of the spontaneous prose style/technique that he used in his key works (the other obvious influence being the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Improvisation.html" title="Improvisation">improvised</a> solos of <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> music). <i>On the Road</i>, written somewhat in this style, transformed Cassady (under the name "Dean Moriarty") into a cultural icon: a hyper wildman, frequently broke, going from woman to woman, car to car, town to town; largely amoral, but frantically engaged with life.</p>
<p>The delays involved in the publication of Kerouac's <i>On the Road</i> often create confusion: The novel was written in 1952 — shortly after John Clellon Holmes published "Go", and the article "This is the Beat Generation" — and it covered events that had taken place much earlier, beginning in the late '40s. Since the book was not published until 1957, many people received the impression that it was describing the late '50s era, though it was actually a document of a time ten years earlier.</p>
<p>The legend of how "On the Road" was written was as influential as the book itself: High on speed, Kerouac typed rapidly on a continuous scroll of telegraph-paper to avoid having to break his chain of thought at the end of each sheet of paper. Kerouac's dictum was that "the first thought is best thought", and insisted that you should never revise a text after it is written — though there remains some question about how carefully Kerouac observed this rule. Although Kerouac maintained that he wrote this particular book in one mad three-week burst, it is clear from manuscript evidence that he had previously written several drafts and had been contemplating the novel for years. Also, the text went through many changes between the final "roll" manuscript and the published version — more evidence to suggest Kerouac's deviation from his dictum — although, to be fair, he had written the book before devising this code.</p>

<p>In 1950 <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a> met Ginsberg, who was impressed by the poetry that Corso had written while incarcerated for burglary. Gregory Corso was the young <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Artagnan_1945.html" title="D'Artagnan">d'Artagnan</a> added to the original three of the core beat writers, and for decades the four were often spoken of together, though later critical attention for Corso (the least prolific of the four) waned. Corso's first book <i>The Vestal Lady on Brattle and Other Poems</i> appeared in 1955.</p>

<p>Some time later there was much cross-pollination with <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>-area writers (Ginsberg, Corso, Cassady, and Kerouac each moved there for a time). Ferlinghetti (one of the partners who ran the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Lights_Bookstore_3e0b.html" title="City Lights Bookstore">City Lights Bookstore</a> and press) became a focus of the scene as well as the older poet Rexroth, whose apartment became a Friday night literary salon. Ginsberg was introduced to Rexroth by an introductory letter from his mentor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carlos_Williams_dd5e.html" title="William Carlos Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>, an old friend of Rexroth's. When Ginsberg organized the famous <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Gallery_reading_fb24.html" title="Six Gallery reading">Six Gallery reading</a> in 1955, he had Rexroth serve as master of ceremonies; in a sense, Rexroth was bridging two generations. This reading included the first public performance of Ginsberg's poem <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html" title="Howl">Howl</a></i> and thus it is considered one of the most important events in the history of the Beat Generation. It brought East Coast and West Coast poets together in public performance for the first time, and the reading quickly sparked a legend and led to many more readings around California by the now locally famous Six Gallery poets. Soon after the Six Gallery reading, Ferlinghetti wrote Ginsberg a letter, saying, "I greet you at the beginning of a brilliant career. When do I get the manuscript?" This was an adaptation of Emerson's comment about Whitman's poetry, a prophecy of sorts that <i>Howl</i> would bring as much energy to this new movement as Whitman brought to 19th-century poetry. This is also a marker of the beginning of the Beat movement, since the publication of <i>Howl</i> and the subsequent obscenity-trial brought nationwide attention to many of the other members of this group.</p>
<p>An account of the Six Gallery reading forms the second chapter of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>'s 1958 novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dharma_Bums_31a8.html" title="The Dharma Bums">The Dharma Bums</a></i>, a novel whose chief protagonist is a character based on one of the poets who had read at the event, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a> (called "Japhy Ryder" in Kerouac's Roman à clef). Most of the people in the Beat movement had urban backgrounds and they found Snyder to be an almost exotic individual, with his rural and back-country experience, and his education in <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_anthropology.html" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural anthropology</a> and Oriental languages. Lawrence Ferlinghetti has referred to him as "the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_David_Thoreau_badf.html" title="Henry David Thoreau">Thoreau</a> of the Beat Generation".

<p>There is typically very little mention of women in a history of the early Beat Generation, and a strong argument can be made that this omission is largely a reflection of the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexism.html" title="Sexism">sexism</a> of the time, rather than a reflection of the actual state of affairs.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Vollmer_f542.html" title="Joan Vollmer">Joan Vollmer</a> (later, Joan Vollmer Adams Burroughs) was clearly there at the beginning of the Beat Generation, and all accounts describe her as a very intelligent and interesting woman. But she did not herself write and publish, and unlike the treatment given to <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a>, no one chose to write a book about her. She has gone down in history as the wife of William S. Burroughs, who was killed by him in a shooting-incident. (This is sometimes termed "accidental", but the actual events allow for multiple interpretations<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, ranging from murder to "assisted suicide".)</p>
<p>Joan is mentioned in "On the Road", in the chapters dealing with Kerouac's and Cassady's visits to see "Old Bull Lee" (Burroughs) in New Orleans, where she is referred to as "Jane". She is described paradoxically as a distant woman who was "never more than 10 feet away from Old Bull" at any given time, giving the impression that she was complex and difficult to get to know.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a> insisted that there were many female beats. In particular, he claimed that a young woman he met in mid 1955 (Hope Savage, also called "Sura") introduced Kerouac and Ginsberg to subjects such as <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_Po_9e74.html" title="Li Po">Li Po</a> and was in fact their original teacher regarding eastern religion (this claim must be an exaggeration, however: a letter from Kerouac to Ginsberg in 1954 recommended a number of works about Buddhism).</p>
<p>Corso insisted that it was hard for women to get away with a Bohemian existence in that era: they were regarded as crazy, and removed from the scene by force (e.g. by being subjected to <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electroshock.html" title="Electroshock">electroshock</a>). This is confirmed by <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_DiPrima_af51.html" title="Diane DiPrima">Diane DiPrima</a> (in a 1978 interview collected in <i>The Beat Vision</i>):</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Potentially great women writers wound up dead or crazy. I think of the women on the Beat-scene with me in the early '50s, where are they now? I know <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Moraff_9b1b.html" title="Barbara Moraff">Barbara Moraff</a> is a potter and does some writing in Vermont, and that's about all I know. I know some of them ODed and some of them got nuts, and one woman that I was running around the Village with in '53 was killed by her parents putting her in a shock-treatment-place in Pennsylvania ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a number of female beats have persevered, notably <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joyce_Johnson_deab.html" title="Joyce Johnson">Joyce Johnson</a> (author of <i>Minor Characters</i>); <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolyn_Cassady_c963.html" title="Carolyn Cassady">Carolyn Cassady</a> (author of <i>Off the Road</i>); <a href="../../../h/e/t/Hettie_Jones_53a6.html" title="Hettie Jones">Hettie Jones</a> (author of <i>How I Became Hettie Jones</i>); <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joanne_Kyger_0e99.html" title="Joanne Kyger">Joanne Kyger</a> (author of <i>As Ever</i>; <i>Going On</i>; <i>Just Space</i>); <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Sohmers_Zwerling_ff65.html" title="Harriet Sohmers Zwerling">Harriet Sohmers Zwerling</a>; and the aforementioned Diane DiPrima (author of <i>This Kind of Bird Flies Backward</i>, <i>Memoirs of a Beatnik</i>, "Loba", "Recollections of My Life as a Woman: The New York Years"). Later, other women writers emerged who were strongly influenced by the beats, such as <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janine_Pommy_Vega_8521.html" title="Janine Pommy Vega">Janine Pommy Vega</a> (published by <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Lights_Bookstore_3e0b.html" title="City Lights Bookstore">City Lights</a>) in the 1960s, and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patti_Smith_5e35.html" title="Patti Smith">Patti Smith</a> in the early 1970s.</p>

<p>Collaboration and mutual inspiration are essential aspects of movements; this is certainly true for the Beat Generation. Here are a few examples of collaborations, mutual promotion and inspiration, and references in works by Beat associates to other writers of the broadly defined Beat Generation.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> was a tireless promoter of the works of other members of the Beat Generation. He considered himself a pro bono literary agent for all of his friends and for those with similar ideas. For example, he was instrumental in getting <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_S._Burroughs_4c27.html" title="William S. Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>'s first book, (<i><a href="../../../j/u/n/Junkie_%28novel%29.html" title="Junkie (novel)">Junkie</a></i>), published. Ginsberg had encouraged Burroughs to write in the first place. He did extensive editing on <i>Naked Lunch</i>, with some help from Kerouac and others. Burroughs and Ginsberg also collaborated on the book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Yage_Letters_8d94.html" title="The Yage Letters">The Yage Letters</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a> and William S. Burroughs collaborated early on a parody of hardboiled detective fiction called <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/And_the_Hippos_Were_Boiled_in_Their_Tanks_8adc.html" title="And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks">And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a> incorporates many important Beat figures as characters in his novels. Two of his most important novels, <i>On the Road</i> and <i>The Dharma Bums</i>, feature characters based on <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, respectively, as their chief protagonists.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Beats often provided titles for one another's work. The naming of two important works is the subject of Beat legend. Ginsberg gives Kerouac credit for the name "<a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html" title="Howl">Howl</a>", even though the original manuscript Ginsberg sent to Kerouac had already been given the title "Howl for Carl Solomon." It's uncertain why Ginsberg would give Kerouac credit, but it's not surprising, considering the nature of their relationship. Kerouac also provided Burroughs with the title "<a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_Lunch_5374.html" title="Naked Lunch">Naked Lunch</a>", and, according to legend, when Ginsberg asked what it meant, Kerouac said he didn't know but they'd figure it out. Ginsberg gives some suggestions in a later poem: "On Burroughs' Work." He says, "A naked lunch is natural to us,/we eat reality sandwiches." Ginsberg also supposedly coined the term "the subterraneans" (an early attempt at a name for the Beat Generation), which became the title of an early Kerouac novel that was later made into a movie.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Members of the Beat Generation provided subject-matter for much of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>'s poetry. <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a> in particular was a favorite subject of Ginsberg. Ginsberg dedicates his most famous poem, <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html" title="Howl">Howl</a></i>, to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Solomon_0f21.html" title="Carl Solomon">Carl Solomon</a>; Cassady and Solomon are specifically referenced throughout the poem. Other Beat Generation figures referenced in <i>Howl</i> include: Kerouac, Burroughs, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Huncke_39ae.html" title="Herbert Huncke">Herbert Huncke</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tuli_Kupferberg_6cce.html" title="Tuli Kupferberg">Tuli Kupferberg</a>, and many more. He dedicated his first collection of poems, <i>Howl and Other Poems</i>, to Kerouac, Burroughs, Cassady, and originally <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucien_Carr_468f.html" title="Lucien Carr">Lucien Carr</a>, though his name was taken off later at Carr's request. The dedication included all of their accomplishments including then unpublished <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Road_e0ec.html" title="On the Road">On the Road</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../n/a/k/Naked_Lunch_5374.html" title="Naked Lunch">Naked Lunch</a></i>, and Cassady's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_First_Third_ce01.html" title="The First Third">The First Third</a></i>. Carr requested his name be taken off because he didn't want the attention. He dedicated many of his other poetry collections and some individual to poems to other Beat figures, including: Huncke, Cassady, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Orlovsky_3f36.html" title="Peter Orlovsky">Peter Orlovsky</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Ferlinghetti_56d2.html" title="Lawrence Ferlinghetti">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_O%27Hara_27bf.html" title="Frank O'Hara">Frank O'Hara</a>. Many of them were also subjects of specific poems with in these collections.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Cassady collaborated on a poem called "Pull My Daisy." A section from "Pull My Daisy" was one of the first poems Ginsberg published. When Kerouac and Ginsberg later collaborated on a film with photographer <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Frank_43cc.html" title="Robert Frank">Robert Frank</a> based on a script by Kerouac for a play called "The Beat Generation," they found that the title had already been copyrighted. They called the film "<a href="../../../p/u/l/Pull_My_Daisy_dbf8.html" title="Pull My Daisy">Pull My Daisy</a>" instead. The actors included Ginsberg, Orlovsky, Corso, and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Rivers_a802.html" title="Larry Rivers">Larry Rivers</a> (a painter associated with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_School_3622.html" title="New York School">New York School</a>), and Kerouac did the narration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a> dedicated several poems to <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Welch_9f93.html" title="Lew Welch">Lew Welch</a> and has mentioned other Beat figures, such as Kerouac and Philip Whalen, in his poetry.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_O%27Hara_27bf.html" title="Frank O'Hara">Frank O'Hara</a> in his conversational poems often talks about eating lunch with "LeRoi" (<a href="../../../l/e/r/LeRoi_Jones_b808.html" title="LeRoi Jones">LeRoi Jones</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiri_Baraka_5316.html" title="Amiri Baraka">Amiri Baraka</a>) and often alludes to other Beat writers, such as Ginsberg and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wieners_8719.html" title="John Wieners">John Wieners</a>.</li>

<p>One way of understanding why the Beat Generation was considered radical, as well as measuring its impact on later writers, is to compare the literary establishment of the 1950s, especially as it involved poetry, with that of the 1960s to see how it had changed. Poetry in the 1950s was under the heavy influence of <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._S._Eliot_4975.html" title="T. S. Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s often misinterpreted idea of poetry being an escape from self and the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernist.html" title="Modernist">Modernist</a> focus on objectivity. Similar to this, and perhaps an even more pervasive influence, were the ideas of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Critics_0c95.html" title="New Critics">New Critics</a>, including their conception of a poem as a perfectible object. In particular, the poetry of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Crowe_Ransom_00fc.html" title="John Crowe Ransom">John Crowe Ransom</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Penn_Warren_cada.html" title="Robert Penn Warren">Robert Penn Warren</a> was highly influential at this time. The focus of these poets on the formal aspects of poetry and their celebration of the short, ironic lyric led to a rise in formalist poetry and a preference for the short lyric. When the Beat poets came to prominence during this time, they were decried as sloppy libertines, and the Beat movement was characterized as at best only a passing fad which had been largely fueled by media-attention.</p>
<p>This antgonism between literary camps was framed by two rival anthologies. Three champions of formalist poetry, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Simpson_a531.html" title="Louis Simpson">Louis Simpson</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Hall_192e.html" title="Donald Hall">Donald Hall</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Pack_b5ce.html" title="Robert Pack">Robert Pack</a>, were putting together an anthology of young poets called <i>New Poets of England and America</i>. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> (who was a relentless promoter of the work of his friends and the work of those he admired), believing at the time that the Beat poets would be accepted by the literary establishment, brought Simpson, his old Columbia classmate, a packet of poetry including works by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Whalen_c5f0.html" title="Philip Whalen">Philip Whalen</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Duncan_4f59.html" title="Robert Duncan">Robert Duncan</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Dorn_2047.html" title="Ed Dorn">Ed Dorn</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Creeley_5801.html" title="Robert Creeley">Robert Creeley</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Lamantia_5e3a.html" title="Philip Lamantia">Philip Lamantia</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denise_Levertov_b38f.html" title="Denise Levertov">Denise Levertov</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McClure_8fef.html" title="Michael McClure">Michael McClure</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Olsen_659b.html" title="Charles Olsen">Charles Olsen</a> in hopes that these poets would be included in this new anthology. Simpson rejected every one of them. The introduction for the anthology was written by formalist hero <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Frost_a3c9.html" title="Robert Frost">Robert Frost</a>. The anthology included poetry by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bly_efa4.html" title="Robert Bly">Robert Bly</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Justice_7730.html" title="Donald Justice">Donald Justice</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Merrill_c13d.html" title="James Merrill">James Merrill</a>, <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._S._Merwin_a746.html" title="W. S. Merwin">W. S. Merwin</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Nemerov_a7eb.html" title="Howard Nemerov">Howard Nemerov</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrienne_Rich_921c.html" title="Adrienne Rich">Adrienne Rich</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wilbur_1c8f.html" title="Richard Wilbur">Richard Wilbur</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wright_ea5a.html" title="James Wright">James Wright</a> and many others. There is not a strict demarcation here between conservative and avant-garde poetry. The anthology also included a number of English poets who were associated with a movement that, chronologically at least, ran parallel with the Beat Generation, The Angry Young Men, These included poets such as <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsley_Amis_530a.html" title="Kingsley Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Larkin_acc6.html" title="Philip Larkin">Philip Larkin</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thom_Gunn_9f1b.html" title="Thom Gunn">Thom Gunn</a>. However, the anthology did set a trend for who would become poets acceptable to academia and the literary establishment. For example, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lowell_cfce.html" title="Robert Lowell">Robert Lowell</a> and <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._D._Snodgrass_6253.html" title="W. D. Snodgrass">W. D. Snodgrass</a> would be seminal in the creation of what later became known as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confessional_poetry.html" title="Confessional poetry">confessional poetry</a>, which helped finally overturn the strict focus on objectivity (Lowell, according to some accounts, was inspired to write more personal poetry by Ginsberg and the Beats).</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Allen_247b.html" title="Donald Allen">Donald Allen</a> of Grove Press accepted many of the manuscripts Ginsberg gave him for his rival anthology <i>The New American Poets: 1945-1960</i>. Poets in that anthology included <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ashbery_1c76.html" title="John Ashbery">John Ashbery</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Blackburn_ff19.html" title="Paul Blackburn">Paul Blackburn</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Bremser_e7b7.html" title="Ray Bremser">Ray Bremser</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Creeley_5801.html" title="Robert Creeley">Robert Creeley</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Dorn_2047.html" title="Ed Dorn">Ed Dorn</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirby_Doyle_d5f4.html" title="Kirby Doyle">Kirby Doyle</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Duncan_4f59.html" title="Robert Duncan">Robert Duncan</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Ferlinghetti_56d2.html" title="Lawrence Ferlinghetti">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/r/LeRoi_Jones_b808.html" title="LeRoi Jones">LeRoi Jones</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kerouac_011e.html" title="Jack Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Koch_1471.html" title="Kenneth Koch">Kenneth Koch</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Lamantia_5e3a.html" title="Philip Lamantia">Philip Lamantia</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denise_Levertov_b38f.html" title="Denise Levertov">Denise Levertov</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McClure_8fef.html" title="Michael McClure">Michael McClure</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_O%27Hara_27bf.html" title="Frank O'Hara">Frank O'Hara</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Olson_1988.html" title="Charles Olson">Charles Olson</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Oppenheimer_e3ef.html" title="Joel Oppenheimer">Joel Oppenheimer</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Orlovsky_3f36.html" title="Peter Orlovsky">Peter Orlovsky</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Schuyler_0adf.html" title="James Schuyler">James Schuyler</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Spicer_7305.html" title="Jack Spicer">Jack Spicer</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Welch_9f93.html" title="Lew Welch">Lew Welch</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Whalen_c5f0.html" title="Philip Whalen">Philip Whalen</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wieners_8719.html" title="John Wieners">John Wieners</a>, and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Williams_3557.html" title="Jonathan Williams">Jonathan Williams</a>. Don Allen framed the debate as "Open Form" (his anthology) vs. "Closed Form" (the other anthology). Though seeing it as a rivalry is overly simplistic (for example, many poets in <i>New Poets of England and America</i> were not strict formalists or have since moved away from formalism), the development of U.S. poetry in the later half of the twentieth century is framed in these two anthologies.</p>
<p>Arguably, these poets have had equal impact on literature, and it can be said that Beat literature has changed the establishment so that academia is now more open to more radical forms of literature. For example, of the poets listed in this section, ten from <i>New Poets of England and America</i> and nine from <i>The New American Poetry</i> have been included in the <i>Norton Anthology of American Literature</i>. But Jack Kerouac, despite his impact on American culture and his status as an American icon, has never been included in <i>Norton</i>. Also, three poets from <i>New Poets of England and America</i> have served as Poets Laureate of the U.S. No Beat poet has ever served as <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet_Laureate_Consultant_in_Poetry_to_the_Library_of_Congress_5261.html" title="Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress">Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress</a>.</p>

Caen's coining of this term appeared to suggest that beatniks were (1) "far out of the mainstream of society" and (2) "possibly pro-<a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communist</a>". The episode from his characteristically sardonic column, with ellipses intact, reads as follows: "...Look magazine, preparing a picture spread on S.F.'s Beat Generation (oh, no, not AGAIN!), hosted a party in a No. Beach house for 50 Beatniks, and by the time word got around the sour grapevine, over 250 bearded cats and kits were on hand, slopping up Mike Cowles' free booze.

Thousands of young people on college campuses and even in high schools came to regard themselves as beats or beatniks in the late 1950s and very early 1960s and many of them behaved in a manner very similar to that of the popular stereotype; indeed they comprised a cultural movement of sorts, apart from the literary beats, and often were proud to be called beatniks.</p>

<p>While many authors claim to be directly influenced by the beats, the Beat Generation phenomenon itself has had a huge influence on Western Culture more broadly.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Beats can be taken as the first subculture (here meaning a cultural subdivision on idiotic/archaic/lifestyle/political grounds, rather than on any obvious difference in ethnic or religious backgrounds). During the very conformist post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> era they were one of the forces engaged in a questioning of traditional values which produced a break with the mainstream culture that to this day people react to -- or against.</p>
<p>There's no question that Beats produced a great deal of interest in lifestyle experimentation (notably in regards to sex and drugs); and they had a large intellectual effect in encouraging the questioning of authority (a force behind the anti-war movement); and many of them were very active in popularizing interest in <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen_Buddhism_af30.html" title="Zen Buddhism">Zen Buddhism</a> in the West.</p>
<p>A quotation from <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>'s <i>A Definition of the Beat Generation</i> as published in <i>Friction, 1</i> (Winter 1982), revised for <i>Beat Culture and the New America: 1950-1965</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ginsberg has characterized some of the essential effects of Beat Generation artistic movement in the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiritual liberation, sexual "revolution" or "liberation," i.e., gay liberation, somewhat catalyzing women's liberation, black liberation, Gray Panther activism.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Liberation of the world from <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Demystification and/or decriminalization of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis.html" title="Cannabis">cannabis</a> and other <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The evolution of rhythm and blues into rock and roll as a high art form, as evidenced by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, and other popular musicians influenced in the later fifties and sixties by Beat generation poets' and writers' works.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The spread of ecological consciousness, emphasized early on by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Snyder_f42a.html" title="Gary Snyder">Gary Snyder</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McClure_8fef.html" title="Michael McClure">Michael McClure</a>, the notion of a "Fresh Planet."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Opposition to the military-industrial machine civilization, as emphasized in writings of Burroughs, Huncke, Ginsberg, and Kerouac.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attention to what <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerouac.html" title="Kerouac">Kerouac</a> called (after <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spengler.html" title="Spengler">Spengler</a>) a "second religiousness" developing within an advanced civilization.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Return to an appreciation of idiosyncrasy as against state regimentation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Respect for land and indigenous peoples and creatures, as proclaimed by Kerouac in his slogan from <i>On the Road</i>: "The Earth is an Indian thing."</li>
</ul>
The essence of the phrase "beat generation" may be found in <i>On the Road</i> with the celebrated phrase: "Everything belongs to me because I am poor."</blockquote>

<p>Some time during the 1960s, the rapidly expanding "beat" culture underwent a transformation: the "Beat Generation" gave way to "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture_of_the_1960s.html" title="Counterculture of the 1960s">The Sixties Counterculture</a>", which was accompanied by a shift in public terminology from "Beatnik" to "<a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippie.html" title="Hippie">hippie</a>".</p>
<p>This was in many respects a gradual transition. Many of the original Beats remained active participants, notably Allen Ginsberg, who became a fixture of the anti-war movement -- though equally notably, Kerouac did not remain active on the scene: he broke with Ginsberg and criticized the 60s protest movements as "new excuses for spitefulness".</p>
<p>The Beats in general were a large influence on members of the new "<a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a>", for example, in the case of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> who became a close friend of Allen Ginsberg. Ginsberg as early as 1960 became close friends with 60's icon <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Leary_7ce7.html" title="Timothy Leary">Timothy Leary</a> and helped him in distributing LSD to influential people (including <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lowell_cfce.html" title="Robert Lowell">Robert Lowell</a>) in order to demystify drug paranoia.</p>
<p>The year 1963 found Ginsberg living in San Francisco with <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Cassady_c167.html" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Plymell_8e95.html" title="Charles Plymell">Charles Plymell</a> at 1403 Gough St. Shortly after that Ginsberg connected with <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Kesey_cdba.html" title="Ken Kesey">Ken Kesey</a>'s crowd who was doing LSD testing at Stanford, and Plymell was instrumental in publishing the first issue of <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._Crumb_0f63.html" title="R. Crumb">R. Crumb</a>'s <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zap_Comix_bd1a.html" title="Zap Comix">Zap Comix</a> on his printing press a few years later then moved to Ginsberg's commune in Cherry Valley, NY in the early 1970s. (The Plymells never lived at the Farm, just visited there; although they remained in Cherry Valley.)</p>
<p>Cassady was the bus driver for one of the most important early Hippie groups, Ken Kesey's <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merry_Pranksters_4674.html" title="Merry Pranksters">Merry Pranksters</a>, which included several members of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grateful_Dead_1b8b.html" title="Grateful Dead">Grateful Dead</a>. A sign of Kerouac's break with this new direction in counterculture occurred when the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merry_Pranksters_4674.html" title="Merry Pranksters">Merry Pranksters</a>, with Cassady's insistence, attempted to recruit Kerouac. Kerouac angrily rejected their invitation and accused them of attempting to destroy the American culture he celebrated.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Sanders_0683.html" title="Ed Sanders">Ed Sanders</a> the change in the public label from "beatnik" to "hippie" happened after the 1967 <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Be-In_d6f7.html" title="Human Be-In">Human Be-In</a> in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park (where Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder and Michael McClure were leading the crowd in chanting "Om"). Ginsberg was also present at another important event in Hippie culture: the protest at the 1968 Democratic Convention, and was friends with <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbie_Hoffman_fdec.html" title="Abbie Hoffman">Abbie Hoffman</a> and other members of the "<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Seven_cbbe.html" title="Chicago Seven">Chicago Seven</a>".</p>
<p>There were certainly some stylistic differences between "beatniks" and "hippies" — somber colors, dark shades, and goatees gave way to colorful "psychedelic" clothing and long hair. The beats were known for "playing it cool" (keeping a low profile) but the hippies became known for "being cool" (displaying their individuality).</p>
<p>In addition to the stylistic changes, there were some changes in substance: the beats tended to be essentially apolitical, but the hippies became actively engaged with the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. To quote Gary Snyder in a 1974 interview (collected in <i>The Beat Vision</i>):</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>... the next key point was Castro taking over Cuba. The apolitical quality of Beat thought changed with that. It sparked quite a discussion and quite a dialogue; many people had been basic pacifists with considerable disillusion with Marxian revolutionary rhetoric. At the time of Castro's victory, it had to be rethought again. Here was a revolution that had used violence and that was apparently a good thing. Many people abandoned the pacifist position at that time or at least began to give more thought to it. In any case, many people began to look to politics again as having possibilities. From that follows, at least on some levels, the beginning of civil rights activism, which leads through our one whole chain of events: the Movement.<br />
<br />
We had little confidence in our power to make any long range or significant changes. That <i>was</i> the 50s, you see. It seemed that bleak. So that our choices seemed entirely personal existential lifetime choices that there was no guarantee that we would have any audience, or anybody would listen to us; but it was a moral decision, a moral poetic decision. Then Castro changed things, then Martin Luther King changed things ...</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Edit section: Drug usage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drug usage</span></h2>
<p>The original members or the Beat Generation group — in Allen Ginsberg's phrase, "the libertine circle" — used a number of different drugs.</p>
<p>In addition to the alcohol common in American life, they were also interested in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzedrine.html" title="Benzedrine">benzedrine</a> and, in some cases, opiates such as <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morphine.html" title="Morphine">morphine</a>. As time went on, many of them began using other <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic_drug.html" title="Psychedelic drug">psychedelic drugs</a>, such as <a href="../../../p/e/y/Peyote.html" title="Peyote">peyote</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/g/Yage.html" title="Yage">yage</a> (also known as <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayahuasca.html" title="Ayahuasca">Ayahuasca</a>), and <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a>.</p>
<p>Much of this usage can fairly be termed "experimental", in that they were generally unfamiliar with the effects of these drugs, and there were intellectual aspects to their interest in them as well as a simple pursuit of hedonistic intoxication.</p>
<p>Benzedrine at that time was available in the form of plastic inhalers, containing a piece of folded paper soaked in the drug. They would typically crack open the inhalers and drop the paper in coffee, or just wad it up and swallow it whole.</p>
<p>Opiates could be obtained in the form of morphine "syrettes": a squeeze tube with a hypodermic needle tip.</p>
<p>As the Beat phenomenon spread (transforming from Beat to "beatnik" to "hippie"), usage of some of these drugs also became more widespread. According to stereotype, the "hippies" commonly used the psychedelic drugs (marijuana, LSD), though the use of other drugs such as amphetamines was also widespread.</p>
<p>The actual results of this "experimentation" can be difficult to determine. Claims that some of these drugs can enhance creativity, insight or productivity were quite common, as is the belief that the drugs in use were a key influence on the social events of the time (see <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreational_drug_use.html" title="Recreational drug use">recreational drug use</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Historical_context" id="Historical_context"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Edit section: Historical context">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Historical context</span></h2>
<p>The postwar era was a time where the dominant culture was desperate for a reassuring planned order; but there was a strong intellectual undercurrent calling for spontaneity, an end to psychological repression; a romantic desire for a more chaotic, Dionysian existence.</p>
<p>The Beats were a manifestation of this undercurrent (and over time, a primary focus for those energies), but they were not the only one. Before Jack Kerouac embraced "spontaneous prose", there were other artists pursuing self-expression by abandoning control, notably the improvisational elements in jazz music. The <a href="../../../b/o/p/Bop.html" title="Bop">bop</a> form of jazz championed by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_db29.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a> and others was one of the biggest influences on many of the Beats; in fact, the horn-rimmed glasses, goatee, and beret sported by the stereotypical beatnik was derived from the fashion of trumpeter <a href="../../../d/i/z/Dizzy_Gillespie_1696.html" title="Dizzy Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a>.</p>
<p>Close analogies to the writings of the Beats can be found in the action paintings of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Pollock_e5b4.html" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> and the work of other <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstract_Expressionists_76c5.html" title="Abstract Expressionists">Abstract Expressionists</a> such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willem_DeKooning_9343.html" title="Willem DeKooning">Willem DeKooning</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Kline_fbea.html" title="Franz Kline">Franz Kline</a>. It's not surprising that members of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_School_3622.html" title="New York School">New York School</a> of Abstract Expressonism were friends with many members of the Beat Generation; they were so closely tied with parallel movements such as the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_School_3622.html" title="New York School">New York School</a> of poetry and the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mountain_poets_b86d.html" title="Black Mountain poets">Black Mountain school</a>.</p>
<p>Black Mountain was associated with many other artists in the post-war period who embraced a similar disdain for refined control, often with the opposite intent of suppressing the ego, and avoiding self-expression; notably, the works of the composer/writer <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cage_f879.html" title="John Cage">John Cage</a> and the paintings and "assemblages" of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Rauschenberg_89ae.html" title="Robert Rauschenberg">Robert Rauschenberg</a>. The "cut-up" technique that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brion_Gysin_dc40.html" title="Brion Gysin">Brion Gysin</a> developed and that William Burroughs adopted after publishing <i>Naked Lunch</i> bears a strong resemblance to Cage's "chance operations" approach.</p>
<p>The "cut-up" method may have its origins many years earlier in the poetry of <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dadaist.html" title="Dadaist">Dadaist</a>/<a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealist.html" title="Surrealist">Surrealist</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tristan_Tzara_beea.html" title="Tristan Tzara">Tristan Tzara</a> who recommended putting cut up words in a bag and pulling them out randomly to create a poem. <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dadaism.html" title="Dadaism">Dadaism</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a> arguably had the most direct impact on the Beats: Dadaism with its attack on the elitism of high culture and its celebration of spontaneity; Surrealism with its transformation of the Dadaist rebellion into positive social intentions and its focus on revelations from the subconscious. Both movements, in a sense, developed as a reaction to WWI, just as the Beat Generation was reacting to the environment of post-WWII America. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Solomon_0f21.html" title="Carl Solomon">Carl Solomon</a> introduced the work of Surrealist <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonin_Artaud_5c9d.html" title="Antonin Artaud">Antonin Artaud</a> to Ginsberg. Artaud had a strong influence on many of the other Beats. The poetry of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Breton_0241.html" title="Andre Breton">Andre Breton</a> was also a direct influence (see for example Ginsberg's <i>Kaddish</i>). Since <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a> was still in many ways a vital movement in the 1950s, the Beats had interactions with many Surrealists and former Dadaists. Beat associates such as Rexroth, Ferlinghetti, and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Padgett_3df0.html" title="Ron Padgett">Ron Padgett</a> were responsible for translating a lot of the poetry from French and introducing it to English-speaking audiences. Several Beat associates, such as <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Joans_a1dc.html" title="Ted Joans">Ted Joans</a>, were actual members of the Surrealist group; another example is <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Lamantia_5e3a.html" title="Philip Lamantia">Philip Lamantia</a> who was close with Breton and was responsible for introducing a lot of Surrealist poetry to the other Beats. The poetry of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kaufman_3a3b.html" title="Bob Kaufman">Bob Kaufman</a> show the clearest influence of Surrealist poetry (the dream-like images, the seemingly random juxtaposition of dissociated images, for example), though this influence can also be seen in more subtle ways in other poetry, Ginsberg's in particular. When in France the Beats met many Surrealists and former Dadaists. As the legend goes, when they met <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Duchamp_9a05.html" title="Marcel Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>, Ginsberg kissed his shoe and Corso cut off his tie.</p>
<p>Many other French writers still active in the 1950s had a tremendous impact on the writing of the Beat Generation, writers such as <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis-Ferdinand_Celine_5021.html" title="Louis-Ferdinand Celine">Louis-Ferdinand Celine</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Genet_ee64.html" title="Jean Genet">Jean Genet</a>. Older French writers rank high on the list of shared Beat influences: <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollinaire.html" title="Apollinaire">Apollinaire</a>, for example. Beats also repeatedly invoke the spirit of Symbolists such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Rimbaud_4c24.html" title="Arthur Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Baudelaire_c598.html" title="Charles Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a>.</p>
<p>As for older poetic movements, perhaps the most important to the Beats was the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_movement.html" title="Romantic movement">Romantic movement</a>. Like the Beats, the Romantics emerged as a reaction to war (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_French_Revolution_7cb0.html" title="The French Revolution">The French Revolution</a>). And in many ways America of the 1950s saw a reemergence of the <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> ideals the Romantics had fought against. If literature is seen simplistically as a fluctuation between Romantic and Enlightenment values, the Beat Generation would certainly side with the Romantics.</p>
<p>Specific Romantic writers had a heavy influence on Beats: <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Corso_e0a9.html" title="Gregory Corso">Gregory Corso</a>, for example, worshipped <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Shelley_2952.html" title="Percy Shelley">Percy Shelley</a> as a hero. Ginsberg mentions Shelley's <i>Adonais</i> at the beginning of <i>Kaddish</i>, and he cites it as a major influence on the composition of one of his most important poems. Michael McClure compared Ginsberg's <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html" title="Howl">Howl</a></i> to Shelley's breaktrhough poem <i>Queen Mab</i>. Ginsberg's most important Romantic influence was <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blake_00bd.html" title="William Blake">Blake</a>, who was the subject of Ginsberg's self-defining auditory hallucination/revelation in 1948, and Ginsberg subsequently spent much of his life studying Blake. Blake was also a major influence on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_McClure_8fef.html" title="Michael McClure">Michael McClure</a>. The first conversation between McClure and Ginsberg was about Blake (McClure saw him as a revolutionary; Ginsberg saw him as a prophet). <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Keats_3200.html" title="John Keats">John Keats</a> was also an influence on many of the Beats.</p>
<p>Of arguably equal importance to the British Romantics was what is often termed American Romanticism. Whether or not this term is accurate, many writers under this umbrella were important to the Beats: <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_David_Thoreau_badf.html" title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_1ca0.html" title="Ralph Waldo Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Melville_9326.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a> and especially <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Whitman_fc20.html" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_4636.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> is occasionally cited as an influence, as in the line from <i><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howl.html" title="Howl">Howl</a></i> "who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kaballah..." And, though the comparison might not seem obvious, Ginsberg even claimed <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Dickinson_0e72.html" title="Emily Dickinson">Emily Dickinson</a> was an influence on Beat poetry.</p>
<p>The novel <i>You Can't Win</i> by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Black_%28author%29_7ef8.html" title="Jack Black (author)">Jack Black</a> had a strong influence on Burroughs.</p>
<p>Though in ways the Beats were reacting against the tendency toward objective distancing and the focus on craft brought on by literary <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernism.html" title="Modernism">Modernism</a>, (hence why the Beats are sometimes considered <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodern.html" title="Postmodern">Postmodern</a>) many modernist writers were major influences on the Beats: <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Proust_9cf8.html" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a>,<a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Pound_79cc.html" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Carlos_Williams_dd5e.html" title="William Carlos Williams">William Carlos Williams</a> and <a href="../../../h/2E/d/H.D._a8da.html" title="H.D.">H.D.</a>. Pound was specifically important to poets such as Gary Snyder, Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley. Pound was instrumental in introducing ideas of <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiku.html" title="Haiku">haiku</a> and other Japanese and Chinese literary forms into Western literature. The Beats further adapted these ideas in their own work. William Carlos Williams was an influence on most of the Beats with his encouragement to speak with an American voice instead of imitating the European poetic voice and European forms. He specifically influenced Snyder, Whalen, and Welch when he came to lecture at Reed College. More importantly he personally mentored many important Beat figures: Charles Olson, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, Denise Levertov, among others. He published several of Ginsberg's letters to him in his epic poem <i>Paterson</i> and wrote an introduction to two of Ginsberg's books. And many of the Beats (Ginsberg specifically) helped promote Williams' poetry and his play <i>Many Loves</i>. Ferlinghetti's City Lights even published a volume of his poetry. Williams is occasionally classified as both an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagist.html" title="Imagist">Imagist</a> and an <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_poets.html" title="Objectivist poets">Objectivist</a>. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Rexroth_0f2c.html" title="Kenneth Rexroth">Kenneth Rexroth</a> was also considered a member of the Objectivists. H.D. (<a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilda_Doolittle_66c1.html" title="Hilda Doolittle">Hilda Doolittle</a>), one of the key Imagists, was another important influence on the Beats. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Duncan_4f59.html" title="Robert Duncan">Robert Duncan</a> wrote a book-length study of her work. <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gertrude_Stein_1b4d.html" title="Gertrude Stein">Gertrude Stein</a>, another important modernist and a major influence on many of the Beats, was the subject of a book-length study by <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Welch_9f93.html" title="Lew Welch">Lew Welch</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Proust_9cf8.html" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a>, specifically in his <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, had an influence on Kerouac's <i>Duluoz Legend</i> concept: a single epic/personal story in multiple volumes. Other important Kerouac influences (and by extension Beat influences) include: <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Wolfe_ee37.html" title="Thomas Wolfe">Thomas Wolfe</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps even greater than their influence on literature is the influence the Beats had on Rock and Roll, if one considers the subsequent influence of Beat fans like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">the Beatles</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Morrison_e018.html" title="Jim Morrison">Jim Morrison</a>. The image of the rebellious rock star is in many ways analogous to the Beat image of, say, Dean Moriarty in <i>On the Road</i>, a book that had a direct influence on many rock musicians. Here are a few examples of their involvement in Rock and Roll and other forms of Pop Culture:</p>

<li>Supposedly, one reason the Beatles spell their name with an "a" is because <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> was a fan of Kerouac.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beat_generation.html" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>One prominent critic of the Beats was <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Podhoretz_3680.html" title="Norman Podhoretz">Norman Podhoretz</a>. He was a student at Columbia who knew Ginsberg and Kerouac (some of his student poetry was published by Allen Ginsberg before their falling-out). Later Podhoretz became editor of the neo-conservative publication <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Commentary_Magazine_bd6f.html" title="Commentary Magazine">Commentary</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1958, he published an article in the <i>Partisan Review</i> titled "The Know-Nothing Bohemians". As Russell Jacoby (in his book <i>The Last Intellectuals</i>) describes it, in this essay Podhoretz "defended civilization against the barbarians":</p>
<dl>
<dd>"There is a suppressed cry in those books [of Kerouac]: Kill the intellectuals who can talk coherently, kill the people who can sit still for five minutes at a time." "The Bohemianism of the 1950s" is "hostile to civilization; it worships primitivism, instinct, energy, 'blood.'" For Podhoretz, "This is the revolt of the spiritually underprivileged."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Podhoretz thought he glimpsed a link between the beats and the delinquents, a common hatred of civilization and intelligence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I happen to believe that there is a direct connection between the flabbiness of American middle-class life and the spread of juvenile crime in the 1950s, but I also believe that juvenile crime can be explained partly in terms of the same resentment against normal feeling and the attempt to cope with the world through intelligence that lies behind Kerouac and Ginsberg."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another quotation from "The Know-Nothing Bohemians":</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Being against what the Beat Generation stands for has to do with denying that incoherence is superior to precision; that ignorance is superior to knowledge; that the exercise of mind and discrimination is a form of death ..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ginsberg responded in a 1958 interview with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Village_Voice_902a.html" title="The Village Voice">The Village Voice</a></i> (collected in <i>Spontaneous Mind</i>), specifically addressing the charge that the Beats destroyed "the distinction between life and literature.":</p>
<dl>
<dd>The novel is not an imaginary situation of imaginary truths — it is an expression of what one feels. Podhoretz doesn't write prose, he doesn't know how to write prose, and he isn't interested in the technical problems of prose or poetry. His criticism of Jack's spontaneous bop prosody shows that he can't tell the difference between words as rhythm and words as in diction ... The bit about anti-intellectualism is a piece of vanity, we had the same education, went to the same school, you know there are 'Intellectuals' and there are intellectuals. Podhoretz is just out of touch with twentieth-century literature, he's writing for the eighteenth-century mind. We have a personal literature now-Proust, Wolfe, Faulkner, Joyce.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Gary Snyder in a 1974 interview (collected in <i>The Beat Vision</i>), comments on the subject of "casualties" of the Beat Generation:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Kerouac was a casualty too. And there were many other casualties that most people have never heard of, but were genuine casualties. Just as, in the 60s, when Allen and I for a period there were almost publicly recommending people to take acid. When I look back on that now I realize there were many casualties, responsibilities to bear.</dd>
