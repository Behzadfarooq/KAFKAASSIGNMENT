<li>What I meant was that it would be neat to have the <i>commentary</i> that the song provides on <i>The Internationale</i>. I.e. if it's not just "beasts" for "workers," then the ways that Orwell is making a commentary on the socialist view of people is interesting. It's already implicit in the book elsewhere that Orwell thinks that the Soviets thought of the people as sheep -- an inherent class structure implicit in a classless society and intellectuals who argue against distinctions and feel themselves to be a better sort of person for it -- that kind of thing. At any rate, I can be a little literary and lavish, so I'd make it too big and off topic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:18, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep <i>if copyight issues are resolved</i>. "No source text" is a guideline meant to keep articles encyclopedic -- that is, to encourage explication rather than mere accumulation of facts --, but it should not be mase a strait-jacket: if the source text is brief enough, if including it aids the artcle's explication, <i>or even makes the article more fun to read and thus more likely to be read</i>, we should keep such source text.<a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 06:50, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Warning!

Many of them are also copyrighted in European Union countries and other countries where copyrights can last longer than 50 years past the author's death.

<dd>I would be almost certain we could defend quoting the song in its entirety on a fair use basis in the U.S. if we had to. Alternatively, we could seek out the U.S. copyright holder and ask their permission for use in the context of an encyclopedia article, and I imagine we'd get it. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 05:34, Aug 23, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Does the fair use clause allow quotations of a proportion of the original work? <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc_Harris</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">â˜º</a> 10:43, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Everything about copyright law is complex and fair use is notoriously complex. The only thing that every writer seems to agree about is that the copyright law does <i>not</i> give any "bright line" definition of what is or isn't fair use. (At least some people I know, who are not raving conspiracy theorists, have opined that the complexity of IP law is sort of deliberate and ensures that the balance of power is on the side of large organizations who can afford to retain legal counsel). The universities and university libraries are the biggest organizations with a vested interest in understanding this, because they're big enough to be sued and they need to know what a prof can and cannot photocopy and hand out in class. Take a quick look at <a href="http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/copypol2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/copypol2.htm" rel="nofollow">University of Texas'</a> guidelines. By my reading, "Beasts of England" is under copyright, so we need to apply the four-factor thingy.</dd>
<dd>Factor 1: Our use is educational and noncommercial (good); Factor 2: What is the nature of the work to be used? Imaginative (bad). Factor 3: How much? Probably small amount (good), but on the other hand it is an entire poem or song lyric. If this were an actual song in itself that was widely sung as a separate work (e.g. like is-it-Flanders' setting of Tolkien's "The Road") what would be bad, but it isn't. Factor 4: If this kind of use were widespread, what effect would it have on the market for the original or for permissions? Now this one is SUPER complicated. It certainly doesn't fall in the category of "Original is out of print or otherwise unavailable; No ready market for permission; Copyright owner is unidentifiable" which would let us off the hook. On the other hand, there's no market for performances of "Beasts of England" and copying it isn't going to affect sales of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a> negatively.</dd>
<dd>So, I run it through the U Texas system's guidelines and the answer I personally get is... <b>I dunno. Maybe, and then again maybe not.</b></dd>
<dd>The U Texas system's guideline are for work that's going to be used in a class handout <i>for a limited time.</i> Specifically, two years. Wikipedia would presumably need to be more stringent because we're reaching a much larger audience and hopefully will exist for far more than two years.</dd>
<dd>I don't think this one is simple. And I'm not sure about the status within Wikipedia of "used-by-permission." I think <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> is right that we are <i>not</i> safe unless we ask permission, but it would need to be permission <i>to release it under the GFDL</i> and I don't think it's by any means <i>certain</i> that they would agree to that.

<dd>I'd like to see The Internationalle text directly adjacent to the lyrics here to facilitate comparison (and make it more obvious just why the whole of the poem is included) but I don't see a copyright problem here. It's review and commentary and I do think that to compare the whole of two short works (or portions, in this case) you need those works so that those who don't know them can see what you're talking about. I don't see much prospect of an independent market for a poem from Animal Farm and the poem itself certainly can't compete with or replace the book Animal Farm.

<p>I guess Orwell is referring to the American folk song "<a href="../../../o/h/_/Oh_My_Darling%2C_Clementine_7010.html" title="Oh My Darling, Clementine">Oh My Darling, Clementine</a>", perhaps to connect to American readers. I prefer the "Clementine" version over "<a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Cucaracha_9feb.html" title="La Cucaracha">La Cucaracha</a>." Somehow it's easier to imagine a group of farm animals singing to the tune of "Clementine" rather than "La Cucaracha." In reality, Orwell probably had "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Internationale_1783.html" title="The Internationale">The Internationale</a>" in mind but did not mention it because he did not want to directly refer to real counterparts of his alleghorical characters anf plot elements. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride">TantalumTelluride</a> 22:56, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
