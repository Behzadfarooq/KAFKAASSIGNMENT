<p>A school assembly takes place where a beautiful woman named Dora Mattingly (sporting a light blue <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dress.html" title="Dress">dress</a> and an oversized ring) hosts the "<i>Miss Teenage Happy Princess Beauty Pageant</i>", something Sam clearly isn't into. Dora needs to pick out an "<i>average"</i> boy to judge the pagenant. Elsewhere, Danny busies himself with a battle with a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> Ax Ghost executioner, the headsman. He ties Danny by the legs from his rope and drags him on stage where Danny quickly turns human. Dora immediately spots him and makes him the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">judge</a> for the pageant, all the while as a dark <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince.html" title="Prince">prince</a> watches from his <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_ball.html" title="Crystal ball">crystal ball</a>.</p>

Sam and Paulina practice for the beauty pageant.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As a result of his new status as pageant judge, all the girls in Casper High sucks up to him (giving him <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookies.html" title="Cookies">cookies</a>, doing his <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homework.html" title="Homework">homework</a>, etc.), something Dash is not too pleased with (to which Danny sends the girls after him), but Tucker is, seeing as he can date any girls he desires as he is the "<i>judge's best friend</i>". Whilst checking Tucker's PDA list of pagenant entries, Danny and Tucker are surprised to spot Sam listed as a candiate, something the entire student body is also in total shock at. Sam however expresses she merely joined to state her statement of disgust towards it.</p>
<p>Later, Sam and the other girls are getting trained and ready for the pageant while Danny fights the Headsman ghost once more. Sam's skills to be an elegant girl doesn't bode well for Dora, eventually accidentally stepping on Dora's foot, causing her to temporary display a fit of anger, showcasing a quick dose of a lizard-like tongue and red eyes. Sam notices this and confronts Danny about it, but he's unfortunately too into the pageant judge position to seemingly care, letting her know he'll deal with it after his popularity goes out. His ghost senses then appears and a medieval <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archer.html" title="Archer">Archer</a> Ghost approaches. Danny does battle with him until he is flung back, the Archer Ghost flying off. Danny (now human) decides something needs to be done...as soon as the pageant is over. Meanwhile, Dora (now revealed as Dora the Dragon Ghost girl) sees all this from her giant ring (which protects her from Danny by covering up her status as a ghost so he's ghost sense won't go off when nearby), using the Headsman and Archer ghosts as further distraction. However, her brother, the dark prince, is rather angry with her due to that one mishap where she almost revealed her identity as a ghost when her foot was stepped on. Dora begs for his forgiveness while Sam watches all this from afar.</p>
<p>The night of the pageant arrives where Sam tries to tell Danny about Dora's true nature. However he is interrupted when both the Ax and Archer ghosts come down to further distract him. Sam tries to make her escape, but Dora pushes her on stage, her anger causing her to revert to her dragon ghost self for a temporal moment. Danny meanwhile manages to escape from the two ghosts (who flies off when the clock strikes eight), and heads over to judge the pageant. After a number of contestants, Sam arrives and uses her talent of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth_subculture.html" title="Goth subculture">Goth</a> <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiku.html" title="Haiku">Haiku</a> to warn Danny Dora is a ghost. After getting that note, Lancer asks if he has chosen a winner. Not listening to what he said and only concerned for Sam, he cries out her name, inadvertently declaring her the winner. Dora places a <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiara.html" title="Tiara">tiara</a> on Sam's head, sending both girls to the Ghost Zone where Dora's brother announces he has chosen a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bride.html" title="Bride">bride</a>: Sam herself.</p>

</div>
<p>Sam is being prepped for Dora's brother (now revealed as Prince Aragon). As much as she tries to, Sam cannot escape the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">castle</a> (the tiara refuses to let her nor will it leave her head) and cries out to Dora on his mistreatment of women. Dora sadly explains that is how things work in his lair where time has stopped to that of the Dark Ages and later reveals his desire to possess what no ghosts possess: a human wife, so it is why Dora chose Danny, a half ghost, to pick out a suitable bride for her brother. After Dora leaves, Sam decides to take matters into her own hand to get herself out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all the girls from the pageant angrily storms towards the boy's <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restroom.html" title="Restroom">restroom</a>, trying to get Danny out. Dash and his team of bullies enter the restroom to soundly beat him up, but finds him missing. Danny and Tucker manage to escape, riding the Spector Speeder inside the <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_Zone_1817.html" title="Ghost Zone">Ghost Zone</a> where they managed to detect Sam from the machine. Heading inside Aragorn's lair, the Spector Speeder completely dies on them, technology not working on the Dark Age time period there.</p>
<p>Back inside Aragon's castle, he asks for his bride to come to which Sam does, dressed like a goth princess and acting in a slobbish manner (to the cheers of the other ghosts around), much to Aragorn's displeasure. Meanwhile, Danny and Tucker does battle with the Headsman and Archer Ghosts once more. Without technology, Tucker relies instead on chucking his PDA towards said ghosts while Danny handles things the usual way. By the time Sam has done rough housing around and looking bad in the eyes of her future <a href="../../../h/u/s/Husband.html" title="Husband">husband</a>, Aragorn has already blamed his sister and sends the guards to surround Sam. He goes to remove her tiara as she is unfit to wed, but then she is dragged away by Danny and Tucker (dressed as a <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knight</a> and archer respectfully) who has come to rescue her (to which Sam cries her she was doing fine till they come).</p>
<p>Aragon, angry, takes "<i>his bride</i>" back to which Dora nervously states why he wants her back. Aragon slowly turns into his dragon form as he insults his sister further. Danny attacks Aragorn while Tucker plugs his nose by throwing PDA like arrows from a bow. Aragon manages to fly out of the castle however, shoots out the PDAs, then sets the entire forest surrounding the castle on fire. As Danny fights Aragon, Sam tries to convince Dora to stop getting pushed around, Dora countering that is not how princesses act. Sam however lets her know they possess the same level of power and with that added confidence, Dora removes the tiara from Sam and changes into her dragon form.</p>

<p>Danny and Aragon are evenly matched until Aragon smashes Danny to the ground, causing him to get knocked unconscious. Luckily, Danny wakes up and is saved when Dora (with Sam riding on her) comes over and commences attack on Aragon, taking her anger out on him and his mistreatment for the past 1600 years. Danny takes this time to remove the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pendant.html" title="Pendant">pendant</a> that turns Aragon into a dragon as well as apology to Sam for acting the same way as Aragon did when it comes to women. Now a normal ghost, Aragon faces the presences of his sister who manages to put the flames out as well as move the clouds so time moves forward instead of getting stuck. With that fixed, Danny flies Tucker and Sam home.</p>
<p>Back in the pageant, all the girls surround Danny, angry for his choice on picking Sam, however he states he has not officially declared a winner. The girls then await for his results, but Danny still ends up picking her. Sam is a bit shocked, then claims the pageant is still stupid. She leaves with Danny to go to the Nasty Burger, leaving Tucker alone to fend off the angry teenage girls.</p>

<li>In this episode, the prince's name is Aragon. This may be a reference to <i>Eragon</i>, a popular series by Christopher Paolini (in said series, Eragon is a dragon-riding swordsman) due to the dragon connection. (This <i><a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon.html" title="Eragon">Eragon</a></i> link is later enforced when Dora transforms into a blue, <a href="../../../s/a/p/Saphira.html" title="Saphira">Saphira</a>-like dragon.) Incidentally, he also shares the same name as <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragorn.html" title="Aragorn">Aragorn</a> from the "<i><a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a></i>" book trilogy.

<li>The glass slippers Sam tries on are identical to the ones wore by Disney's <i><a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella.html" title="Cinderella">Cinderella</a></i>. Dora's human appearance also looks similar to Cinderella's "princess look".</li>
