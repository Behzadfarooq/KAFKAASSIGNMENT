<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Wars_98b4.html" title="Edit section: Basic plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Basic plot</span></h2>
<p>Early <i>Beast Wars</i> toy tech spec cards painted a picture of the Transformers taking on life-sized forms in the present era (similar to the '<a href="../../../8/0/s/80s.html" title="80s">80s</a> series it was based upon). However, when Forward and DiTillio began writing the show, they instead chose a considerably earlier setting; this would later be revealed to be Earth’s prehistoric past, long after the original Transformers ship <i><a href="../../../a/r/k/Ark_%28Transformers%29_7395.html" title="Ark (Transformers)">The Ark</a></i> crash-landed inside a <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcano.html" title="Volcano">volcano</a>. Larry DiTillio revealed that the decision to make the planet Earth was not made until the end of the first season. They gave the planet two satellites and decided that they would destroy one moon if the planet was indeed to be Earth.</p>
<p>The premise for the series was that two groups of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robot.html" title="Robot">robots</a> from the planet '<a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybertron.html" title="Cybertron">Cybertron</a>' crash-landed their ships, the <i><a href="../../../a/x/a/Axalon.html" title="Axalon">Axalon</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkside_%28Transformers%29_891a.html" title="Darkside (Transformers)">Darkside</a></i>, on a mysterious planet after a brief fight in space. Before crashing, the <i>Axalon</i> deployed several “stasis pods”, which orbited the planet throughout the rest of the first season. The two main factions are descendants of the two main factions in the original cartoon series: the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximal_%28Transformers%29_4602.html" title="Maximal (Transformers)">Maximals</a> are the descendants of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobot.html" title="Autobot">Autobots</a> and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predacon_%28Transformers%29_be3b.html" title="Predacon (Transformers)">Predacons</a> are the descendants of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decepticon.html" title="Decepticon">Decepticons</a>. The names were intended to stem from the terms <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">Mammal</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predator.html" title="Predator">Predator</a> but were not necessarily consistent with the alternate forms of the Transformers. In <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Machines_b86e.html" title="Beast Machines">Beast Machines</a></i>, the process during which Autobots and Decepticons became Maximals and Predacons is respectively referred to as the "The Great Upgrade". <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Primal_d343.html" title="Optimus Primal">Optimus Primal</a> was the leader of the Maximal team stranded on Ancient Earth and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron_%28Beast_Wars_and_Beast_Machines%29_4baa.html" title="Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)">Megatron</a> was the leader of the Predacons team. (The factions themselves were ruled by the Maximal Elders and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripredacus_Council_b68b.html" title="Tripredacus Council">Tripredacus Council</a> respectively)</p>

Megatron, as he appeared pre-<i>Beast Wars</i> in Dreamwave comics, stealing the Golden Disk (note that is the incorrect disk, as he is seen holding the Alien Disk).</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the premiere episode, it was revealed that Optimus' crew was a team of four scientists on an exploration mission and that Megatron's crew was a band of six convicts who had stolen the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Disk_1325.html" title="Golden Disk">Golden Disk</a> artifact and a transwarp ship, claiming to be searching for the planet Earth, which the Golden Disk said contained high amounts of Energon, the Transformers' power source. To survive volatile levels of Energon, the Transformers changed their alternate modes to animals. These animals, or their DNA, were scanned by ships or stasis pods. All attempts at peace between the Maximals and Predacons failed, and their continuing conflicts were referred to as "The Beast Wars".</p>
<p>Eventually, more characters were added to the cast and Megatron's true intentions for seeking out Earth were revealed. He intended to either destroy humanity before they could assist the Autobots in their war against the Decepticons, or to gain access to the Autobot <i>Ark</i>, and kill the deactivated original <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. The later plot was directly told to him by original <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatron.html" title="Megatron">Megatron</a> on a video played from the Golden Disk. He actually succeeded in this, but Optimus Primal took the spark of Prime into his own body (which transformed his body into the Optimal Optimus form) while <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhinox.html" title="Rhinox">Rhinox</a> and the other Maximals performed vital repairs on Optimus Prime's head. When the repairs were complete, the timeline was restored to its original state.</p>
<p>Early concepts for the series show that the original faction leaders (Primal and Megatron) were in fact going to be re-imaginations of the original 'series faction leaders, Optimus Prime and Megatron (later Galvatron), but the series itself shows that they are indeed separate characters. (Both Primal and Megatron come face-to-face with the currently-deactivated forms of their ancestors inside the <i>Ark</i> at different points.) The idea of both faction leaders being the original characters was probably abandoned when the idea of the series taking place in modern times was dropped.</p>
<p>When the <i>Axalon</i> initially began to crash, it released several stasis pods (escape-like pods with an undeveloped Transformer called a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoform.html" title="Protoform">Protoform</a> inside). These stasis pods were used as a <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plot_device.html" title="Plot device">plot device</a> to introduce new characters to the show during the first and early second seasons. A pod would crash to the Earth, and then the Maximals and Predacons would be alerted of it and set out to retrieve it, usually resulting in a battle in which the victor would get the pod and the resulting character inside of it.</p>
<p><i>Beast Wars</i> was the first Transformers series to include deaths in the television episodes (the original 80s series continuity had several characters die in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Transformers%7E_The_Movie_e0ea.html" title="Transformers: The Movie">theatrical movie</a>, but no characters died in the series itself). The most memorable death was that of the character <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinobot.html" title="Dinobot">Dinobot</a> in <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_of_Hero_c0fc.html" title="Code of Hero">Code of Hero</a>. Also of note is the character <a href="../../../w/a/s/Waspinator.html" title="Waspinator">Waspinator</a>, who was blown to pieces or otherwise dismantled in almost every episode of the series, but never officially "died." Even in the sequel series <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Machines_b86e.html" title="Beast Machines">Beast Machines</a></i>, Waspinator survived, albeit in a new body and identity, as <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust_%28Transformers%29_7750.html" title="Thrust (Transformers)">Thrust</a>.</p>

Optimus Primal in his "Optimal" body</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Leader of the Maximals whose beast mode is a silverback <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorilla.html" title="Gorilla">gorilla</a>. Primal is a compassionate and charismatic commander who shares much concern for his friends and comrades. Although originally the commander of an exploration team, he is a very capable and intelligent commander in warfare. Occasionally, when the right buttons are pushed, and especially when dealing with the security and safety of his team, he <i>does</i> fly off the handle, but later regrets it and then apologizes, albeit with some help from his team. <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rattrap.html" title="Rattrap">Rattrap</a> often refers to him as "<i>Fearless Leader,</i>" (as well as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackarachnia.html" title="Blackarachnia">Blackarachnia</a>) or "<i>the Boss Monkey,</i>" while <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheetor.html" title="Cheetor">Cheetor</a> is prone to calling him "<i>Big Bot</i>". Primal sacrificed himself at the end of the first season against the Vok's deadly planet killing alien weapon. However he was revived by Rhinox at the start of season two in a new transmetal body which Rhinox acquired from a stasis pod with a “blank” protoform inside. He became Optimal Optimus after briefly being a host for Optimus Prime's spark in season three.</p>
<p>Primal's original season one form was armed with two dual-barrel wrist cannons in his forearms, as well as two shoulder-mounted missile launchers, and two curved spinal swords. His transmetal form had a handheld pistol and a “hoverboard”, plus two maces that could also be used in conjunction with his backpack as cannons. His final "<i>Optimal Optimus</i>" form had two retractable chest-mounted cannons, could transform in to robot, animal, all-terrain vehicle, and finally a flight mode.</p>
<p>Optimus Primal's favorite catchphrase for most situations, usually bad ones, is: <i>"Well, that's just prime,"</i> with the word "prime" being used as the word "great," or anything else of the essence.</p>
<p>In all of Primal's forms, he was able to fly in robot mode with turbojets he called 'Prime Jets'. These were located in his back in his first form, but when he became Optimal Optimus they were located in his feet. Even though his transmetal and Optimal forms had alternate modes which were capable of flying, Primal still used his Prime Jets occasionally.<br clear="all" /></p>

Transmetal Rattrap</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Subcommander (and a somewhat pessimistic smart-aleck) whose beast mode is a <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rat.html" title="Rat">rat</a>. While he fills the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_relief.html" title="Comic relief">comic relief</a> portion of the show, Rattrap is the Maximals' <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covert_ops.html" title="Covert ops">covert ops</a>/<a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy.html" title="Spy">spy</a> and once "defected" to the Predacons to retrieve a salvaged Maximal decoder chip that was being used to intercept Maximal communications. Rattrap has once been forced to take on the mantle of leadership when Optimus was apparently dead. His favorite phrase for most situations is: <i>"We're all gonna die!"</i> often followed by the other Maximals' favorite saying: <i>"Shut up Rattrap!"</i>. Rattrap developed a begrudging "friendship" with Dinobot, though it was veiled beneath constant bickering and arguing. In fact, when Dinobot 'doesn't' take shots back Rattrap knows there's something wrong with him.</p>
<p>As a transmetal, his vehicle mode is a high-powered <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragster.html" title="Dragster">dragster</a>. Rattrap's weapon in both his original and his transmetal form was a pistol, though the action figure of his transmetal form was equipped with only a serrated whip from the beast mode tail. In the cartoon, Rattrap (in both regular and transmetal forms) also used demolition charges, which were sometimes stored in a wrist compartment. These charges could stick to surfaces, and Rattrap would either throw them like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenades.html" title="Grenades">grenades</a> or stick them directly to an object.<br clear="all" /></p>

Rhinox</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Subcommander and mechanic robot who is proficient in technological creation; beast form is a <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhinoceros.html" title="Rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>. Rhinox's personality is a two-sided coin. On one side, he is a gentle giant who loves peace and quiet and smelling flowers; on the other, when agitated, Rhinox is prone to making threats or using his imposing body to gain compliance. In one particular and interesting instance (in the episode "<a href="../../../a/f/t/Aftermath.html" title="Aftermath">Aftermath</a>"), Rhinox, due to Optimus's destruction, issued an order. Dinobot protested and began to argue, to which Rhinox responded by grabbing him by the throat, pulling him towards his face, and said in a low and threatening tone, "<i>I'm in a baaaaad mood...understand?</i>", to which Dinobot quickly responded with, <i>"Uh huh."</i></p>
<p>Rhinox's weaponry consists of two machine gun weapons that are quickly identified as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chainguns.html" title="Chainguns">chainguns</a> of first-person shooter popularity, and were soon "officially" named 'the Chainguns of Doom' by Bob Forward on Internet message boards. This name was officially acknowledged by Hasbro on the packaging of the 2006 reissue of the toy.<br clear="all" /></p>

Transmetal II Cheetor</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cheetor functions as jungle patrol, acts immaturely and has the beast mode of a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheetah.html" title="Cheetah">cheetah</a>. He is one of the characters to receive two upgrades during the series; each one seemingly helping to mentally mature the character a bit. While Cheetor started the series as a childish character, by the end he matured to a late adolescent or early adult (this was hinted at by Rattrap, who mentioned 'cyber-puberty' after Cheetor achieved transmetal II form). He also shows feelings for the Predacon-turned-Maximal <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackarachnia.html" title="Blackarachnia">Blackarachnia</a>, even going so far as having a picture of her in his room.</p>
<p>Cheetor's original form had two separate guns. His transmetal upgrade eliminated the guns, but he could now hold together both of his hands (which had the head of his cheetah form attached to them) to fire blasts of energy from the mouth section. He also gained flight capabilities. His final Transmetal II form gave him a large missile launcher that was usually attached to his back that when in beast mode, would act as a rocket that could propel him to speeds of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mach_number.html" title="Mach number">Mach 2</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>

Dinobot</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A seemingly merciless combat specialist, who lives by a strict yet complex code of honor and has the beast mode of a <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velociraptor.html" title="Velociraptor">velociraptor</a> (this is confirmed by a taunt from Rattrap <i>"...Do ya wanna know just how velociraptors got extinct?!"</i> and in his official bio).</p>
<p>In the beginning of the <i>Beast Wars</i> series, Dinobot was a Predacon who left Megatron and allied himself with Optimus Primal's group. He is very aggressive and has a short temper. He often argued with Rattrap, calling him "<i>Vermin</i>". Dinobot briefly returned to the Predacons, but then defected back to the Maximals. He died after destroying Megatron's Golden Disk, and saving the early humans (and therefore the entire human race) from an attack from the Predacons.</p>
<p>Dinobot shares his name with a sub group of near-indestructible Autobots. His weapons were a sword resembling a spinal cord, and a rotary shield device from his tail, as well as laser cannons built into his optics. It was never clear what function the tail weapon, consisting of two spinning blade-like sections, served. It has been used as a shield to deflect missiles from <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inferno_%28Transformers%29_fe31.html" title="Inferno (Transformers)">Inferno</a>, as a weapon against Scorponok (where the spinning sections were used to beat him into submission) and even to slow Dinobot's fall like a parachute.</p>
<p>Several clones of Dinobot were made by Megatron during the series. In season one, Megatron created a DNA clone which only had a beast mode. Later on, in season three, Megatron created a fully transformable clone by using the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmetal_Driver_50e9.html" title="Transmetal Driver">Transmetal Driver</a> on a blank Protoform and bestowing it with half the essence of <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rampage_%28Transformers%29_4ae0.html" title="Rampage (Transformers)">Rampage</a>'s spark.</p>

Tigatron</div>
</div>

<p>The first Maximal protoform to be awakened from an Earth-fallen stasis pod, Tigatron served as the team's recon unit. His beast mode was a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_tiger.html" title="White tiger">white tiger</a>.</p>

They were later restored as the transmetal fuzor <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigerhawk.html" title="Tigerhawk">Tigerhawk</a>.</p>
<p>Tigatron's only form was based on a repaint of Cheetor's with several cosmetic modifications, so (while only use of the smaller gun was ever seen, in scenes with Tigatron, Cheetor would use the other gun) it can be assumed that Tigatron has his own versions of both Cheetor's weapons. In his first appearance in the show, Tigatron also launched small homing missiles, from a launcher hidden in his arm, at a retreating Megatron.</p>

Depth Charge</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Marine Commander and former Maximal Security Officer. His beast mode was a transmetal <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manta_ray.html" title="Manta ray">manta ray</a> with a third flight mode. Before joining the <i>Beast Wars</i>, he was the chief security officer upon the Maximal colony Omicron, where Rampage was imprisoned. Unfortunately, Rampage escaped and destroyed Colony Omicron, along with every Transformer in that colony. That left Depth Charge bitter and thirsting for vengeance, going as far as to illegally retune his own scanners to pick up the spark of Rampage. He occasionally referred to Rampage by his given name, but preferred to call him <i>Protoform X</i> (or the abbreviated "X"), Rampage's name in developmental stages. Depth Charge originally ignored the other Maximals, preferring to head off after Rampage on his own, but after botching their attempt to retrieve the security system Sentinel from the underwater <i>Axalon</i>, he agreed to officially join. He eventually killed Rampage in the episode <i>Nemesis, part 1</i> by driving a shard of raw Energon through his exposed spark; however, the resulting explosion killed Depth Charge as well.</p>
<p>Depth Charge had a handheld missile launcher which resembled a shark. In beast mode, it became a remote probe which looked like a shark-shaped torpedo. In robot mode, he used his fins to block enemy weapon fire, making him an extremely formidable adversary. He also has a energy disk launcher in his chest and can use his tail as a sword.</p>
<p>Depth Charge was scheduled to return in the <i>Transtech</i> series which was never produced, but did eventually returned in the <i><a href="../../../u/n/i/Transformers%7E_Universe_d810.html" title="Transformers: Universe">Transformers: Universe</a></i> line.<br clear="all" /></p>

Tigerhawk</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After Megatron stole the original Megatron's spark, the Vok decided to send an emissary to stop Megatron from interfering with the flow of time, once and for all. They merged the bodies of Tigatron and Airazor to create a powerful new being named Tigerhawk. His beast mode was Fuzor-like: as his name suggests, a white tiger with the wings and tail and rear legs of a hawk (disregarding the fact that Airazor was a falcon). In the cartoon, Tigerhawk was a male character who spoke with a voice identical to Tigatron's voice.</p>
<p>After his creation, he was sent to Earth in a manner reminiscent of a comet, but somehow was followed by the sparks of Tigatron and Airazor. He crashed into the <i>Darkside</i>, destroying it and then attacking Megatron and his Predacons. Optimus interrupted the battle, knowing that destroying Megatron would destroy the original Megatron's spark and disrupt the timeline even worse. Unfortunately Tigerhawk, unaware that Megatron has the spark of the original Megaon inside of him, did not give Optimus a chance to explain before doing away with him. However this did gave Tarantulas an opening to capture Tigerhawk and take him to his lair, preventing Megatron’s death.</p>
<p>Tarantulus' plan was to remove the Vok influence from Tigerhawk's body (which would leave Tigerhawk free to be reprogrammed as a servant), but the plan backfired when the Vok influence turned on Tarantulas. Tarantulas and his lair were then destroyed by a combination of his own volatile machines and the alien influence. Cheetor, who was led to the lair by the combined spark of Tigatron and Airazor, rescued Tigerhawk in the nick of time. After this, the combined spark entered Tigerhawk's body and he became his own being. He remarked that he was home, but home had changed greatly, establishing that the spark carried the memories of the original Tigatron and Airazor.</p>
<p>As well as a gun, Tigerhawk had chainguns under his wings which could be used in vehicle or robot mode. His most powerful weapon was his alien ability to control the weather, allowing him to use earthquakes, lightning, and tornadoes to combat his foes.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>Devious leader of the Predacons, and part-time inventor; whose beast mode was a purple <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrannosaurus_Rex_d58a.html" title="Tyrannosaurus Rex">Tyrannosaurus Rex</a>. He is considered a megalomaniac among his peers and some of his followers, and unqualified to be their leader by a few. That has led many Predacon subordinates to periodically plot against him or defect. Megatron became a transmetal t-rex after the quantum surge, and later took the spark of the original Megatron (whose body was still in status lock within the crashed Autobot ship <i>The Ark</i>) into his own body, similar to what Primal had done with Optimus Prime; this, combined with Megatron being thrown into a lava pit in the <i>Ark</i> volcano by treacherous Predacons, transformed Megatron into a transmetal <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">dragon</a>.</p>
<p>His original form had a laser cannon in the T-Rex head and a missile launcher in the tail (which doubled as a claw weapon). The transmetal body had a claw tail with a toothed edge, and could also fire energy. The dragon body, similar to his season one form, had the dragon head mounted on one arm, allowing him to fire flaming plasma or molten ice in robot mode.<br clear="all" /></p>

Later, he was destroyed, along with Terrorsaur, when he fell into lava during the Quantum Surge. Ironically, if the Surge hadn't caused them to fall in the lava, it would have probably transformed them into Transmetals and rendered them immune to the heat.</p>
<p>Scorponok's claws doubled as powerful missile launchers, and he often served as the heavy artillery in Predacon attacks. He also invented a 'Cyber Bee' drone, a robotic bee which was launched from his claw. The toy had a missile launcher in one claw and the Cyber Bee drone in another.<br clear="all" /></p>

Waspinator</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A not-very-bright and easily intimidated flyer; his beast form is a <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasp.html" title="Wasp">Wasp</a>. Waspinator often refers to himself in the third person, and generally has a gloomy outlook on his own life (<i>"...Inferno blow up, Waspinator salvage; Waspinator blow up, nobody salvage! Why universe hate Waspinator??"</i>).</p>
<p>Through bad luck, Waspinator was often shot at or damaged throughout the series, by Maximals and Predacons alike. Later in the show's lifespan, this became a cartoony gimmick, in that Waspinator was blown to bits in every episode. In 'Feral Scream, Part 2' Waspinator was literally cut into ribbons by Dinobot, but he returned less then five minutes later restored, but with his arm in a sling and band-aids all over his body.</p>
<p>Waspinator had a hand held gun, firing projectiles which would explode on impact. He could also fire poisonous barbs. He fired purple laser beams from his optical cannons in season 1, but he never used this ability in season 2 or 3.</p>
<p>In 'Nemesis, Part 1', Waspinator renounced his Predacon allegiance, claiming that he was sick of being Predacon, sick of being evil, and sick of being blown to scrap (ironically, this outburst led him to being blown to scrap). He did not reappear until the very end of 'Nemesis, Part 2', where he was being treated like a god by the humans. He ended up having the last piece of dialogue in the entire series when he said <i>"Waspinator happy at last."</i><br clear="all" /></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Saboteur, spy, and master of techno-gadgets, originally a Maximal-aligned protoform, Blackarachnia's alliance was switched to the side of the Predacons by Tarantulas, who also chose her beast mode: a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Widow_Spider_1414.html" title="Black Widow Spider">Black Widow Spider</a>. She often aligned herself with Tarantulas over Megatron, possibly due to the fact that he was the one who activated her and had the opportunity to introduce modified programming. Given the choice, however, she always looked out for her own skin, and only joined either of the two when she had no choice. Though still containing Predacon programming, Blackarachnia joined the Maximals when Megatron tried to destroy the original Optimus Prime, which would have resulted in eradication of the Maximals and the Maximal protoforms, including herself. She later attempted to give herself a transmetal II form using the Transmetal Driver, but doing so caused her Predacon shell program to fail. To save her life, Rhinox had to remove the shell program; after this, she became an 'official' Maximal.<br clear="all" /></p>

Inferno</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Maximal protoform converted by Tarantulas and later second-in-command after Scorponok's death; his beast form was a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_ant.html" title="Fire ant">fire ant</a>. Due to damage to his programming when he was activated, the instincts of his beast form integrated into his shell program, which causes him to have a personality close to an ant. This gives him predetermined instincts to "defend the colony" (the Predacon base), and an unquestionable allegiance to his 'queen' and 'royalty', Megatron. He would, ironically, be killed by Megatron when he is accidentally obliterated by the guns of the <i>Nemesis</i>.</p>
<p>Inferno wielded a large gun; sometimes two. These guns appeared to function identically to every other 'missile launching' handgun in <i>Beast Wars</i>, but Inferno's guns fired white hot plasma bolts, missiles and even functioned as flamethrowers.<br clear="all" /></p>

Rampage</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A Maximal experiment gone horribly wrong; Maximal scientists once attempted to recreate Starscream's mutant immortal spark, but instead made the hopelessly psychotic "Protoform X". "X" destroyed countless Maximals, razing Colony Omicron and earning him the eternal enmity of Depth Charge (who was Omicron head of security). When his stasis pod crashed on Earth, it was thought that his spark had finally extinguished, but this was not the case as an Energon explosion and subsequent storm awoke his dormant spark. He was forced to join the Predacon ranks by Megatron, who gave him the name Rampage and removed half his spark, using it to tortured Rampage whenever he stepped out of line. He was eventually killed in a confrontation with his rival Depth Charge.</p>
<p>Rampage's beast form is that of a transmetal <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crab.html" title="Crab">crab</a> with a third form that resembles a <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a>.

Dinobot Clone</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A clone of the original Dinobot, created by Megatron and enhanced with <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmetals.html" title="Transmetals">transmetal II</a> technology, the Dinobot clone served as one of Megatron's most loyal warriors (and is not to be confused with the very first clone of a Dinobot, a direct duplicate unable to transform).</p>
<p>The details of his creation are unique: His body was originally a lifeless blank protoform, one of many that crashed as a result of the Vok's attempt to destroy the planet Earth. In a twisted experiment, Megatron infused the blank protoform with Dinobot's D.N.A. and was given life by the spark of Rampage (half of which Megatron had removed to keep the reluctant Predacon in line), and so could squeeze his own spark to force Rampage to obey him. Stronger due to transmetal II technology and without any of the original Dinobot's honor, the Dinobot clone was a formidable foe. However, Rattrap was able to download the original Dinobot's personality into him with aid from Depth Charge (in the missing episode "Dark Glass"), having no effect until Rampage's death. At the end of the series, he betrayed Megatron, and when the <i>Nemesis</i> was finally destroyed, he chose to go down with the ship. It is unknown whether or not Dinobot was killed by the crash, due to the fact that he possesses Rampage's immortal spark.</p>
<p>His beast mode was a Transmetal II Velociraptor. In robot mode he had blades on his hands and feet, and an energy weapon is mounted on his left optic.<br clear="all" /></p>

<dt><b>Jak and Una</b></dt>
<dd>Two human children who befriend the Maximals. Jak and Una are originally saved by the Maximals from a cyborg raptor created by Megatron. Subsequently, Blackarachnia and Cheetor are sent to escort them home. Later, Cheetor attempts to educate them in basic technology, and they quickly begin to develop. Una is shortly afterward abducted by Waspinator, as the Predacons need her to finish work on an Energon cannon they are developing but cannot get too close too. However, thanks to her primitive mindset, Una unwittingly manages to sabotage the cannon by stealing a stabilizer crystal. Jak and Una also appear in the last episode of the series, where they fight against a Predacon invasion of the human settlement. Though they are too young to do much, Una does an admirable job of pounding on Waspinator's head.</dd>

<dl>
<dt><b>Hammer</b></dt>
<dd>An adult human and the strongest non-machine combatant in the <i>Beast Wars</i>. Not actually named in the series, he first appears with other early humans in the episode "Code of Hero", where he is held hostage by Megatron to prevent violence on the part of Dinobot. As such, he witnesses Dinobot's stunning defeat of Megatron, when the Maximal attaches a stick to a rock to form a primitive weapon/tool, using it to subdue Megatron. The curious anthropoid takes the abandoned weapon, and learns that it can be used both to get food and to fight. Upon realizing the latter, he bellows at the sky, and a light -- presumably Dinobot's spark -- flashes in the sky. In later episodes, Dinobot's influence appears to have caused accelerated development in the early humans, as they are now using basic tools with Hammer as their leader. Despite the fact that he is no real match for the Predacons, he does an admirable job defending the young Jak and Una, and is the first to discover the vulnerabilities of the cyborg raptors. Hammer's last appearance is in the final episode of the series, where he battles against Inferno and Quickstrike. He is targeted by the <i>Nemesis</i> fusion cannon, but fortunately manages to escape (Inferno and Quickstrike are killed instead). He is also likely the one who first rebelled against Waspinator's establishment of himself as a deity over the early humans, leading to the Predacon's exile and his presence in <i>Beast Machines</i>.</dd>

A Vok</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A mysterious and powerful alien race. They travelled through time and space conducting several experiments, Prehistoric Earth being one of their testing grounds. Seeding it with vast amounts of raw Energon deposits and other anomalies such as flying islands, Stonehenge-like formations and golden disks, they even constructed a second moon. The artificial moon was in reality a giant heat ray capable of igniting the planet's Energon deposits should they need to "sterilise" their experiment. This was seen as a necessary step when the Maximals and Predacons arrived from the future and started the <i>Beast Wars</i>. The <i>Beast Wars</i> tainted the experiment on Earth with its outside influence, and the Vok chose to wipe the planet clean to start the process again. After losing direct contact with the Beast Wars Transformers, the Vok abducted Tigatron and Airazor, and fused them together as their emissary, Tigerhawk. The Vok element was removed from Tigerhawk by Tarantulas, who wanted to gain its power. Both were apparently destroyed by a weapon fired at Tarantulas. It is unknown how many Vok exist. However, as the non-canon BotCon <i>Beast Wars: Primeval Dawn</i> storyline claims that Tarantulas and the two Vok survived, and battle once more. It is also claims that the Vok species evolved from the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swarm_%28Transformers%29_c0bc.html" title="Swarm (Transformers)">Swarm</a> (as seen in the <i>Transformers: Generation 2</i> comic book) and that the Vok sought to correct the 'sins' they had committed as the Swarm and went on a mission to maintain creation.)

<dd>A Maximal from a stasis pod that was so extensively damaged, it created her with permanent neurological and physical impairments and without a beast mode or any alternate form. Transmutate was inarticulate in speech or thought, and unable to transform, but deeply emotional and powerful; she was capable of flight and energy projection. Transmutate befriended both the Maximal Silverbolt, who sought to protect her, and the Predacon Rampage, who knew the pain of being labelled a "freak," and sought to form a sympathetic friendship with her. Megatron saw Transmutate as having no value as a combatant and initially wanted to destroy her. With Transmutate's immense physical powers but limited mental capacity, Optimus Primal viewed her as a threat and thought it best if she were shut down. This caused a moral divide between Optimus Primal and Silverbolt. Silverbolt and Rampage battled over custody of Transmutate. Unable to tolerate watching her friends fight, she sacrificed herself to protect Silverbolt and Rampage from each other, leaving Maximal and Predacon alike to mourn for her passing.</dd>

</div>
</div>
<p>Leader of the ancient Autobots. Optimus would be seen in the <i>Agenda pt 3</i> and <i>Optimal Situation</i> as the whole reason that the <i>Beast Wars</i> incarnation of Megatron had come to Earth, as part of a plan by the original Megatron to change history. With the unwilling help of Blackarachnia, Megatron gained access to the Ark and blasted Optimus in the head with a full power blast, blowing his head open. Blackarachnia, however, betrayed Megatron and allowed Optimus Primal to safeguard Prime's life by taking his spark into his own body, resulting in his mutation into his "Optimal" body. Once the Predacons were defeated, Prime's spark would return to its rightful owner.</p>

Megatron</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Leader of the ancient Decepticons. Even though Megatron was long since defeated, his shadow still fell over the <i>Beast Wars</i>. Before the conflict started, a Predacon named Megatron (taking his name from the Covenant of Primus as well as the original character) discovered a message from his namesake on the Golden Disk, detailing how to use transwarp technology to go back in time and change history. Although <i>Beast Wars</i> Megatron would steal the golden disk and head back in time, he was reluctant to carry out his namesake's plan, especially with the discovery of vast Energon deposits.</p>
<p>Later, with his options exhausted, Megatron revealed to Ravage the message from the Decepticon Megatron, prompting him to immediately switch sides. Megatron would then attempt to carry out his ancestor's instructions and kill Optimus Prime, changing the future. He failed, but this was not the last we would see of the original Megatron. Encouraged by the mutation of Optimus Primal into a massive new Optimal form, Megatron attempted to duplicate the experiment with his ancestor's spark. Shortly after taking the spark of the Decepticon Megatron, he was betrayed by Quickstrike and Tarantulas, and hurled into a lava pit. Unexpectedly however Megatron rose from the lava pit, in a new twisted transmetal dragon form. Although Megatron did not return his namesake's spark himself, the spark of the Decepticon Megatron would be returned to its rightful owner in a deleted scene from the <i>Beast Wars</i> third season DVD.</p>

Ravage</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Intelligence/Saboteur. Another returning Decepticon from the original series that appeared in the three part episode, "The Agenda". After <i>The Great War</i>, several of the Decepticons that had been captured or that surrendered were granted amnesty. In time, one was reprogrammed and rebuilt as a Predacon, Ravage. In his upgraded form, Ravage was more humanoid and possessed <a href="../../../a/c/t/Active_camouflage.html" title="Active camouflage">active camouflage</a>, although he could still transform into a tape <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_audio_cassette.html" title="Compact audio cassette">cassette</a> and even still made the same transforming sounds as the original Transformers. When the Maximals on prehistoric Earth were finally able to send a "signal" back to Cybertron, it was intercepted by the Tripredacus Council, the leaders of the Predacons, who diverted the signal and ordered Ravage on a clandestine mission to the planet aboard an advanced stealth warship, with orders to kill Megatron and all witnesses, including the Maximals. Initially, Ravage aided the Maximals in capturing Megatron. However, the imprisoned Megatron then informed Ravage of his true agenda in coming to Earth; the <i>original</i> Megatron had encoded a message on the <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyager_Golden_Record_92a4.html" title="Voyager Golden Record">Voyager Golden Record</a>. The message would only have been found if Megatron was defeated in <i>The Great War</i> (which he was), and it ordered any remaining loyal followers to go to Earth (whose coordinates the record provided) in the past and attempt to attack the Autobot <i>Ark</i> ship while Optimus Prime was still frozen in stasis-lock. On hearing these orders from his former commander, Ravage switches sides and joined the Predacons in a massive but ultimately thwarted attack on the Maximals. Destroyed in the explosion of his ship, his last words were "Decepticons <i>forever</i>!"

<p>There is a great deal of fan debate over which character is the second in command of the Maximals. The primary candidates are Rattrap and Rhinox.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rattrap</b> - Rattrap was placed officially in charge in Primal's absence in <i>Chain of Command</i>, although he seemed to show a distaste for making command decisions afterwards. The official show bible also stated Rattrap was second in command. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Rhinox</b> - Rhinox seemed to take charge several times in season 2-3. Although his original toy shipped with a low rank, the <i>10th Anniversary</i> toy had it greatly increased, and the text of his new bio described him as second in command of the <i>Axalon</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
However there also exists arguments for others although many of these come with less show-based evidence and less fan support, as some didn't even appear in the series.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cheetor</b> - Cheetor's tech spec rank was the second highest of the original Maximal crew, although he didn't seem to have any command position in any episode of the <i>Beast Wars</i> as he later did in <i>Beast Machines</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Depth Charge</b> - With the coming of season three Depth Charge had the second highest tech spec rank of the Maximals on the show, but didn't seem to take command either, usually working on his own. His tech spec described his rank as "Aquatic Forces Commander", however in the animated series Depth Charge was the <i>only</i> marine Maximal. In the tech specs the Maximal <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybershark.html" title="Cybershark">Cybershark</a> was supposed to work for him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dinobot</b> - In the episode <i>Gorilla Warfare</i> it could be said that Dinobot took charge in Primal's absence, and did his best to lead in the fashion of a Maximal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Polar Claw</b> - The first year tech specs rated Polar Claw the second in command and gave him the function of <i>Battle Infantry Commander</i>, but Polar Claw didn't make it to the animated series. It was later revealed in the comics that Polar Claw was among the Maximals placed in the stasis pods.</li>

<p><i>Beast Wars</i> was followed up by <i>Beast Machines</i>, a new series with a new creative team in charge of the cartoon. As a sequel, it was not initially well received among some fans mostly due to the surviving Maximals and Predacons being out-of-character to a variable, and others to a considerate, degree. Others did not find its <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technorganic.html" title="Technorganic">technorganic</a> Cybertron concept to be agreeable, as the planet was always referred to previously as never having organic life. However, in more recent years, it has been held in somewhat higher regard, especially compared to the perceived poor quality of the newer and Japanese produced series that are unconnected to the original core universe.</p>

Over the next two years, <i>Beast Wars: The Complete Second Season</i> and <i>Beast Wars: The Complete Third Season</i> were released.</p>
<p><i>The Complete First Season</i> was released in Australia by <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madman_Entertainment_5b63.html" title="Madman Entertainment">Madman Entertainment</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>,2006. Each season set, released over the course of the year, coincided with the 10th Anniversary of <i>Beast Wars</i> toys released in Australia from April 2006. These sets are more heavily packed with extra features than their U.S. counterparts, including audio commentaries by <i>Beast Wars</i> writers Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio and Transformers consultant Benson Yee, documentaries, TV spots, convention panels and toy galleries.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures U.K., the license holder for <i>Beast Wars</i> in the U.K., has not announced any plans for a release. Although no box sets have been released, single disc DVDs have instead; strangely, releases started with the three-part finale from season two, "The Agenda." Only two volumes have been released.</p>

<p>In the <i>Point Omega</i> storyline, several events lead up to a tremendous battle against <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shokaract.html" title="Shokaract">Shokaract</a>, a Predacon fueled by the Dark Essence of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a> himself. This also serves as an introduction for <a href="../../../a/p/e/Apelinq.html" title="Apelinq">Apelinq</a>, and the only appearances of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windrazor.html" title="Windrazor">Windrazor</a>, Sandstorm, Antagony, and Cataclysm.</p>
<p>In the <i>Primeval Dawn</i> story, Tarantulas comes back from the dead alongside Ravage, Spittor, Iguanus and Razorclaw to complete the mission he set out to do, while the Vok create <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primal_Prime_a3da.html" title="Primal Prime">Primal Prime</a> to stand in his way; Primal Prime teams up with Airazor, Tigatron and Ramulus, who have come back from the dead as well.</p>

<p>The Japanese series <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Wars_II_a761.html" title="Beast Wars II">Beast Wars II</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Wars_Neo_e380.html" title="Beast Wars Neo">Beast Wars Neo</a></i> were created to fill the gap while the second and third seasons of <i>Beast Wars</i> were being translated into Japanese (oddly called <i>Beast Wars: Metals</i>). The characters originate from the future that the <i>Beast Wars</i> teams left, but the events of the series take place in the far future. The series are noted primarily for the return of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>, but more negatively, for their childish, comedic nature, as the Transformers franchise is aimed at a very young age group in Japan in comparison to the United States. <i>Beast Wars II</i> spawned a theatrical movie. The <i>Beast Wars Neo</i> toyline was created to cater to the Japanese market. Whereas the cybernetic transmetal Beast Wars Transformers sold well in Western markets, Japanese fans preferred more realistic looking beast modes, thus <i>Beast Wars Metals</i> was not as successful with Japanese fans. The second and thirds season of <i>Beast Wars</i> and its toy line only lasted a few months before being quickly replaced by <i><a href="../../../r/o/b/Transformers%7E_Robots_In_Disguise_c89e.html" title="Transformers: Robots In Disguise">Transformers: Robots In Disguise</a></i> in the following new year.</p>

<p><a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamwave_Productions_d154.html" title="Dreamwave Productions">Dreamwave Productions</a> released a Summer Special which contained a <i>Beast Wars</i> story. It introduced three new characters, <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Minor_0450.html" title="Optimus Minor">Optimus Minor</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonecrusher_%28Transformers%29_8313.html" title="Bonecrusher (Transformers)">Bonecrusher</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfang.html" title="Wolfang">Wolfang</a>. The comic had a survey as to whether Dreamwave's new comic would be <i>Robots In Disguise</i> or <i>Beast Wars</i>. <i>Beast Wars</i> won.</p>
<p>Dreamwave Productions had plans to release a <i>Beast Wars</i> comic in early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, which would have been done by the <i>War Within</i> creative team of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Furman_383c.html" title="Simon Furman">Simon Furman</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Figueroa_ff2f.html" title="Don Figueroa">Don Figueroa</a>. James "Brad Mick" McDonough and Adam Patyk were originally planned to write the series until they left Dreamwave after not being paid for several projects. However, although some cover art did appear on the internet, Dreamwave entered bankruptcy before one issue could be published.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>After Dreamwave filed for bankruptcy in January 2005, the license for all Transformers comics, including Beast Wars were picked up by <a href="../../../i/d/w/IDW_Publishing_39c9.html" title="IDW Publishing">IDW Publishing</a>, and was released in early 2006 as a four-issue miniseries. The series was written by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Furman_383c.html" title="Simon Furman">Simon Furman</a> and drawn by <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Figueroa_ff2f.html" title="Don Figueroa">Don Figueroa</a>. The Beast Wars comic takes place parallel to the third season of Beast Wars and introduced characters who were not shown in the original series such as <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magmatron.html" title="Magmatron">Magmatron</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razorbeast.html" title="Razorbeast">Razorbeast</a> and Injector. Other characters who made an appearance are <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimlock.html" title="Grimlock">Grimlock</a> in his Beast Wars body (recolored Dinobot toy) and <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravage_%28Transformers%29_55b3.html" title="Ravage (Transformers)">Ravage</a> in his transmetal II "Tripredacus Agent" incarnation.</p>
<p>Taking place around the events of the season three episode <i>Deep Metal</i> (the Predacons are just installing Sentinel), the comic focused on Magmatron, sent by the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripredacus_Council_b68b.html" title="Tripredacus Council">Tripredacus Council</a> to capture Megatron after Ravage's failure. However, Magmatron had his own agenda - to create his own army from the stasis pods the Axalon had ejected in the pilot episode. His scheme was partially thwarted by the Maximal double-agent Razorbeast, who ensured the shell program used reconfigured many of the protoforms as Maximals rather than Predacons. The two sides would clash in an attempt to stop Magmatron from returning to Cybertron with a captured Megatron, with some unexpected aid from Grimlock ensuring Magmatron was sent back to Cybertron empty handed. However, Razorbeast's Maximals and many Predacons (led by Ravage, resurrected in a transmetal II body) were left on Earth, opening the way for future series.</p>
<p>The series is important in that it wraps up many of the loose ends that the show did not address – most importantly, what happened to the various protoforms that the Maximals jettisoned. Also the presence of both <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Prime_3575.html" title="Leo Prime">Leo Prime</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Convoy_52d6.html" title="Big Convoy">Big Convoy</a> in flashback sequences implies that the Japanese <i>Beast Wars II</i> and <i>Beast Wars Neo</i> take place in the same continuity.</p>
<p>IDW editor-in-chief Chris Ryall recently confirmed the second <i>Beast Wars</i> series, titled <i>The Ascending</i>, as well as a series of character profile books, will be due in August <a href="http://forums.idwpublishing.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=87e9e0df7b91b33235216dfacd50d587;act=ST;f=21;t=3636;st=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.idwpublishing.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=87e9e0df7b91b33235216dfacd50d587;act=ST;f=21;t=3636;st=20" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://forums.idwpublishing.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=87e9e0df7b91b33235216dfacd50d587;act=ST;f=21;t=3636;st=80" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.idwpublishing.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=87e9e0df7b91b33235216dfacd50d587;act=ST;f=21;t=3636;st=80" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Beast Wars</i> is known for its frequent fan references. Transformers fan and proprietor of www.bwtf.com Ben Yee had been called on many times to provide insight into the Transformers mythos to Mainframe so they could properly incorporate content from the original series into the show. As thanks for his help, Ben Yee is given a commendation within an episode of the show as an in-joke. When Rhinox was reprogrammed as a Predacon, he sabotaged various aspects of the base, and even Waspinator's personality. When Blackarachnia referred to him as "wacko," Waspinator replied "<i>Wacko? No, Wonko! Wonko the Sane!</i>" before saluting the screen. This is a reference to a character from <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Adams_4bdd.html" title="Douglas Adams">Douglas Adams</a>' <a href="../../../s/o/_/So_Long%2C_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish_8996.html" title="So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</a>, and was the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen_name.html" title="Screen name">screen name</a> of Ben Yee at the time. In addition to Ben Yee, other fan references were spread throughout the series. Notable fan references include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Episode 24</b> <i>Before The Storm</i> - "Code A.T.T.," spoken by Megatron, in reference to fan forum alt.toys.transformers, and "...it is beyond imagination!", again spoken by Megatron, in reference to James Hooks' website "Beyond Imagination," which at the time included interviews with the writers and spoilers for upcoming episodes, and was itself a reference to the tagline of <i>[[The Transformers: The Movie]</i> - "Beyond Good, Beyond Evil, Beyond Your Wildest Imagination."</li>
<li><b>Episode 35</b> <i>Code of Hero</i> - "Got a blue plate sighting in Tengu Sector," spoken by Cheetor, in reference to fan Tengu.</li>
<li><b>Episode 37</b> <i>The Agenda Part One</i> - "Rampage, position yourself in Subsector Hooks", spoken by Megatron, another reference to Hooks.</li>
<li><b>Episode 39</b> <i>The Agenda Part Three</i> - Referring to the Ark, Optimus Primal remarks on it's design by saying: "Die-cast construction - it's a lost art." This is a reference to how the original Transformers toys used die-cast metal in their construction, but this practice had ceased by <i>Beast Wars</i>, hence it being a "lost art."</li>
<li><b>Episode 44</b> <i>Feral Scream Part One</i> - "Sector Tallories", spoken by Optimus Primal, in reference to fan Tallories.</li>
<li><b>Episode 47</b> <i>Go with the Flow</i> - "Quarry detected - Grid Joona", in reference to a Finnish Transformers fan. However, the name is mispronounced as "jeu-nah", while the original Finnish pronunciation is "yaw-nah".</li>
<li><b>Episode 51</b> <i>Nemesis Part One</i> - "This is Optimus, encoding transmission M Sipher" in reference to the screen name of fan Greg Spelak.</li>
<li><b>Episode 51</b> <i>Nemesis Part One</i> - "Like you had no time for Starbase Rugby? You had friends there, as I recall... Tasty ones too!" Rampage mentions Starbase Rugby; the name reversed is Rugby's Starbase, a small internet store that had taken many TF toys and created a somewhat official TF continuity. This is also where the name Omicron comes from.</li>
<li><b>Episode 52</b> <i>Nemesis Part Two</i> - "Targeting grid 3H, full power to weapons, Fire!" Megatron mentions 3H which was the name of the group who was in control of the <a href="../../../b/o/t/BotCon_1902.html" title="BotCon">BotCon</a> convention at the time: Jon and Carl Hartman, and Glen Hallit.</li>
</ul>
<p>While not as common, Beast Wars also makes a few entertaining pop culture references. One of them appeared in the episode "Victory" when the Axalon's engines were failing. The crash was avoided thanks to Optimus, who guided the ship to a landing position using his Prime Jets and incredible strength. To add further comic relief, the Maximals suggest that it could be "a bird" or "a plane" until they realize that it is Optimus flying to their rescue. This is a clear reference to the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> hero, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>.</p>
<p>At another point, Silverbolt points out Venus to Blackarachnia, saying it reminds him of her; this is a subtle reference to Venus Terzo, who provides the voice of Blackarachnia. In the show, Rattrap referred to his vehicle form as "<i>Knievel mode</i>" which likens his driving form to the daredevil <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evel_Knievel_06fd.html" title="Evel Knievel">Evel Knievel</a>. After Rattrap complains about Silverbolt's attitude, Cheetor tells him to forget it, and says: "You and I can go to the <i>Six Lasers Over Cybertron</i> amusement park." The name is a nod to the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Flags_1bbd.html" title="Six Flags">Six Flags</a> amusement park chain.</p>
<p>Cheetor also makes a reference to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> in the episode where Rhinox was reprogrammed. When the Maximals storm the Predacon base, Cheetor says 'how about we punt your butt a hundred yards down the field?' An American football field is 100 yards long, and since the show was made in North America, it is safe to assume that 'punting' is a reference to American football (as opposed to other kinds of football).</p>
<p>In the episode Victory, when the Maximals are inspecting the deserted <i>Darkside</i>, Cheetor waves some of Tarantulas' legs at Dinobot. Dinobot takes them and says <i>"Alas, poor Tarantulas. I knew him, Cheetor."</i> This is a direct reference to the play <i>Hamlet</i> when Hamlet holds a skull and says <i>"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio."</i> Dinobot also quoted Hamlet in <i>Coming of the Fuzors pt. 1</i> when he said <i>"to be, or not to be, that is the question"</i> (this quote was the start of a speech referring to the Golden Disks).</p>
<p>In the episode "Proving Grounds" Rattrap is seen playing video games on the Maximal computer. The games are similar to <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_888c.html" title="Street Fighter">Street Fighter</a></i>, with Megatron and Optimus Prime fighting, and a second that is similar to <i><a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a></i>, with Rattrap's gun and enemies that look like Waspinator. In the episode "Power Surge", Rattrap is seen playing a game of cards against a pair of holographic hands. The cards themselves are holographic and have the Maximal logo on the back.</p>
<p>One of the most comical references appeared in "<a href="../../../p/o/s/Possession_%28Beast_Wars%29_32d3.html" title="Possession (Beast Wars)">Possession</a>", when Optimus defeated Starscream, saying <i>"hasta la vista Starscream"</i> referring to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Terminator_9e8e.html" title="The Terminator">Terminator</a></i>. Sunglasses also appeared over his eyes briefly.</p>
<p>In one episode, Rhinox and Inferno fight each other in the style of '<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%27Em_Sock_%27Em_Robots_a1a4.html" title="Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots">Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots</a>'. Rhinox wins causing Inferno's head to come up; Megatron shoots Rhinox and shoves Inferno's head back down.</p>
<p>After the Quantum Surge, Blackarachnia exits the <i>Axalon</i> and views the newly altered Earth and claims how things have changed. Then Airazor states <i>"The more things change, the more they stay the same,"</i> a famous American proverb.</p>
<p>In the episode <i>Feral Scream pt 1</i>, when Megatron and Waspinator are creating a Transmetal II clone of Dinobot, the twisted experiment is a parody of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>. Also, when the Predacons hold Depth Charge captive there is a dual reference to Warner Brothers Cartoons. When Megatron is hit by a direct charge from Transmetal II Cheetor, he is spun away in a manner reminiscent of Taz the Tasmanian Devil. He then falls off a cliff, looking up for a few seconds then falling like Wile E Coyote.</p>
<p>In 'Coming of the Fuzors pt. 1', Inferno is attacking Silverbolt and Quickstrike. When Megatron saves them by knocking Inferno out, he says 'goodbye bad cop, hello good cop'. The good cop/bad cop interrogation technique has become well-known throughout pop-culture (thanks to movies and TV shows) and the phrase 'good cop, bad cop' is a pop-culture reference in itself (and is sometimes used in reference to other situations besides interrogations).</p>
<p>Optimus Primal's Gorilla form and Megatron's T-Rex forms are also an homage to King Kong where the gorilla, Kong, fights a Tyrannosaurus Rex. In the episode 'Beast Wars Part 2', Optimus and Megatron do fight in their beast modes.</p>
<p>In the first two episodes, Optimus frequently rode on Rhinox's back when both were in beast mode. This may have been an obscure reference to the videogame <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_Kong_Country_f6a8.html" title="Donkey Kong Country">Donkey Kong Country</a></i>, where Donkey Kong is able to ride a rhino called Rambi.</p>
<p>Time is constantly refered to in terms of 'cycles' with prefixes attached to delineate units of tens or more. In 'Code of Hero', Rhinox mentions that the temporal wavefront of the transwarp explosion will reach cybertronian space in 'approximately 2.218 decacycles.' which suggests that they might use a few other metric prefixes for time that are never mentioned explicitly in the episodes. Of note, most half-hour TV shows are about 22.18 minutes long to allow time for commercials, but since there is a second episode between 'Code of Hero' and 'The Agenda (Part 1)' where the wave actually enters cybertron's space, this may be simple coincidence, or it could mean that a single decacycle is about a day long.</p>
<p><i>Beast Wars</i> even made references to itself in certain episodes. When Rhinox was reprogrammed, Optimus said 'yesss', which was Megatron's catchphrase (this may have been a subtle play on the fact that Garry Chalk, who voiced Optimus, originally auditioned for Megatron). When Optimus wanted to fly at maximum speed, he said <i>"maximum burn"</i> but in 'Coming of the Fuzors Part 1', Rattrap (in vehicle mode) said <i>"maximum rubber burn!"</i> This also works as a pop-culture reference: burning rubber is a slang term for driving really fast, since tires are made of rubber and will melt if spun too fast (due to the friction against the road). The show was also very self-aware and referred to everyday things in more 'robotic' terms (such as 'metal violin' and 'cyber puberty' and calling male Transformers “bots” and females ones “fem-bots”).</p>

<ul>
<li>Originally, the series was going to be set in the present, with certain characters from the original cartoon series reborn in new bodies. This was very much evident in the Tech Specs of the first line of toys. The writers of the series, however, knew next to nothing about the original series at first, and since they were given free reign to do what they wanted with a series whose purpose was to promote what was, at the time, a dying franchise, they rewrote the premise so that it had apparently no connection to the original series outside of a few recycled names. When Bob Forward and Larry Ditillio discovered an online Transformers chat forum and learned more about the original series however, they began to work in elements from it, placing the series in the same universe.</li>
<li>While the toy line was lauded for its innovative joint construction and the show mostly liked by fans, some Transformer purists extremists decried the entire series as a mistake, having gone as far as to devise slogans like <i>"TRUKK NOT MUNKY"</i> to show their resentment over the use of animals instead of vehicles for the line's alternate forms. This quickly died out, especially in light of the fact that some Transformers from the original series (such as the <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinobots.html" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insecticons.html" title="Insecticons">Insecticons</a>) had possess beast-like modes.</li>
<li>The third season of the TV show was originally supposed to include an episode called "Dark Glass", written by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christy_Marx_3fb7.html" title="Christy Marx">Christy Marx</a>. The script of the episode depicted an encounter between Rattrap and the Dinobot Clone, where Rattrap finds that the datatracks of the original Dinobot in the ship's computer, and goes on a suicide mission to install it into the transmetal II clone in a desperate bid to bring his old friend/foe back. However, the script was seen as "too dark" for little children to watch, and so the episode was never produced. A considerably lighter and more jocular episode called "Go with the Flow" was created in its place. Transcripts of the episode survived, however, and it is now considered part of the <i>Beast Wars</i> continuity, mainly for its explanation on how the Dinobot Clone regained the original's personality after Rampage was destroyed at the end of Season Three. This was also made in a fancomic <a href="http://www.genomestudios.com/thoughtcrimeinc/Dark%20Glass/Dark_Glass.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.genomestudios.com/thoughtcrimeinc/Dark%20Glass/Dark_Glass.htm" rel="nofollow">1</a> This is disputed by the Madman DVD release of Season Three. One of the FAQs on the final disk asks about "Dark Glass". The response indicates that it had nothing to do with the Dinobot Clone and that it was originally pitched for Season Two, not Three. However the writing staff felt that the script was not up to the standard required, so it was abandoned.</li>
<li>Actor <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_McNeil_a00d.html" title="Scott McNeil">Scott McNeil</a> voiced five characters in the series; Rattrap, Silverbolt, Waspinator, and the two incarnations of Dinobot.</li>
<li>While the <i>Beast Wars</i> and <i>Beast Machines</i> series officially exist as the future of the original cartoon series, it also incorporated bits and pieces of the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_comics.html" title="Marvel comics">Marvel comics</a> as well, while introducing new elements into the Transformer mythos, such as sparks and protoforms (however, it should be noted that beyond use of the comic-only term, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ark_%28Transformers%29_0996.html" title="The Ark (Transformers)">The Ark</a>", and the comic book entity, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primus_%28Transformers%29_7a0f.html" title="Primus (Transformers)">Primus</a>, all of the show's references are based on the original cartoon). This would be carried on into the Dreamwave comics, which seemed to integrate elements from both lines while working towards maintaining continuity with <i>Beast Wars</i>.</li>
<li>Despite living all the way to the series finale, Waspinator is either shot, fallen on, framed, or somehow blown-up in almost every episode.</li>
<li>The toyline of the <i>Beast Wars</i> included "Mutant Heads". They were going to include the heads in the television series, but the graphic designers weren't that up to date on graphics to put them in and it was decided that they served no real purpose either.</li>
<li>The show was originally going to feature a much larger cast of characters, but limitations on CGI at the time meant that the animators had to shorten the cast to five members on both sides, adding new characters sparingly. Bob Forward has credited this as being part of the reason why the show was so successful, because a smaller cast meant he could focus on character development and personality for every character, as opposed to the ungainly task of writing for an entire army's worth of characters.</li>
<li>Initially, Waspinator, not Terrorsaur, was to die at the beginning of Season Two. Because people enjoyed Waspinator as comic relief for the series, the creators decided to kill off Terrorsaur instead. Waspinator went on to be the only Predacon to survive both <i>Beast Wars</i> and <i>Beast Machines</i> (not counting Blackarachnia, who defected in season three of <i>Beast Wars</i>). Terrorsaur made a reappearance in his transmetal state in a removed episode in the original Japanese broadcasting, looking identical to the toy, furthering the evidence of Terrorsaur's concept of surviving.</li>
<li>Also, instead of Tigatron, the toy-only character <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfang.html" title="Wolfang">Wolfang</a> was supposed to be in the show, but was replaced at the last moment to conserve money, as Tigatron was a repaint of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheetor.html" title="Cheetor">Cheetor</a> in the toy line, and thus would be easy to tweak the existing Cheetor CGI figure to look like the white tiger Maximal. This reuse of character CGI figures to introduce new characters is a fairly common money-saving tactic for most CGI-based television shows, and was used in <i>Beast Wars</i> to make Blackarachnia (a slight remodel and remap of Tarantulas) and Ravage whose head was a repainted version of Tigatron's head, mounted on a robot body which was a remodel of Transmetal Cheetor's body.</li>
<li>Out of all the characters introduced in the show, only the Vok were never made into toy form. Ravage was released in Japan as a remolded version of transmetal Cheetor, an exclusive in Japan's Metals toy line, while a black recolored version of transmetal II Cheetor was sold as a Wal-Mart exclusive under the name of "Tripredicus Agent." The Japanese Metal Ravage mould was, interestingly enough, reused for the [Botcon] exclusive transmetal Tigatron figure. Hasbro has expressed great interest in making a Predacon Ravage figure for their <i>Beast Wars 10th Anniversary</i> line, but claimed to be unable to locate the mold. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmutate.html" title="Transmutate">Transmutate</a>, a character featured in the episode of the same name and which never had a figure as part of the original, was made into a multi-part figure for the initial phase of the 10th Anniversary line.</li>
<li>There have been two <i>Beast Wars</i> video games, both for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3f6f.html" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_64.html" title="Nintendo 64">Nintendo 64</a> home systems, though one (the first one) was released for the <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_PC_compatible_c159.html" title="IBM PC compatible">PC</a>, as well. The first, based on the first season of the show, is a <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_person_shooter.html" title="Third person shooter">third person shooter</a> in which you can control either the Maximals or the Predacons in a series of missions to undermine the other faction's attempts at gaining enough resources to win the war between them and escape the planet. This one was released in 1998 by <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro_Interactive_98a7.html" title="Hasbro Interactive">Hasbro Interactive</a>. The other, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Transformers%7E_Beast_Wars_Transmetals_1ac8.html" title="Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals">Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals</a>, is a <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighting_Vipers_991b.html" title="Fighting Vipers">Fighting Vipers</a>-style fighting game based on the second season and was also released by Hasbro Interactive, though only the Playstation version; the Nintendo 64 version was released by bam! Entertainment. Neither of these games did well, commercially, and were overall panned by critics and fans alike, although the second game was memorable for having most of the voice actors from the show itself reprise their roles as the characters. The PC version of the first game also has a multiplayer feature (removed from the console releases) that allowed up to 8 players to play over <a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_1d59.html" title="LAN">LAN</a>, and had its own play rooms in the <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSN_Gaming_Zone_adf2.html" title="MSN Gaming Zone">MSN Gaming Zone</a>, though it's been subsequently removed. A third game was in the works for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_2.html" title="Playstation 2">Playstation 2</a>, but was scrapped in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-production.html" title="Pre-production">pre-production</a>, without any official word as to why, or how far the project was before the plug was pulled.<a href="http://www.tv.com/aftermath/episode/45417/trivia.html#Notes" class="external text" title="http://www.tv.com/aftermath/episode/45417/trivia.html#Notes" rel="nofollow">2</a> *Due to the influence from Hasbro, the term "<a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzor.html" title="Fuzor">Fuzor</a>" was also integrated into the fourth Zoids anime series, "<a href="../../../f/u/z/Zoids%7E_Fuzors_1257.html" title="Zoids: Fuzors">Zoids: Fuzors</a>".</li>
<li>In the North American opening credits, we see the words "Beast Wars: Transformers" on the screen and we hear the words "Beast Wars!" chanted repeatedly. In the Mexican version, the entire phrase "Beast Wars: Transformers" is translated and chanted. Thus, instead of a two syllable "Beast Wars" we hear an eight syllable "Guerra de Bestias Transformers," or "War of Beasts Transformers" if translated literally back into English, seeing as "Transformers" was used as a name, and therefore a noun.</li>
<li>The name "Beast Wars" did not go over well with Canadian authorities (<a href="../../../c/r/t/CRTC_0c5d.html" title="CRTC">CRTC</a>), "war" being the offending word. The show was renamed "Beasties" for broadcast in Canada. The opening song has the name "Beasties" chanted instead of "Beast Wars".</li>
<li>According to Bob Forward, the beast modes of the characters in the show were 'fully functional', as evidenced by their oft-shown ability to eat organic materials, 'bleed' from wounds, and the fact that they had actual animal instincts that they could utilize in this mode (though it could influence their mind under certain circumstances). A minor article of debate with fans is exactly <i>how</i> functional their beast modes would be, and the purpose and consequences of making these forms so detailed.</li>
<li>The characters Terrorsaur and Starscream have a lot of (deliberate) similarities: both were treacherous (and were often slagged for it), their voices were similar (in the episode 'Possession', in fact, the same voice actor voiced both parts . . . Terrorsaur was given limited dialogue in the episode to disguise the similarity), and both had alternate modes which consisted of big-winged flyers. Both also died in their series.</li>
<li>In the first season finale, the Vok that speaks to Optimus Primal takes on the form of the head of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicron.html" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>, the only remaining piece of him after his destruction in <i>Transformers: The Movie.</i></li>
<li><a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Blu_4bbc.html" title="Susan Blu">Susan Blu</a>, who provided the voice of Arcee in the original Transformers series, was the voice director for the <i>Beast Wars</i> series, as well as the voice of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmutate.html" title="Transmutate">Transmutate</a> in the episode of the same name.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_West_178c.html" title="Leslie West">Leslie West</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lynn_Turner_da61.html" title="Joe Lynn Turner">Joe Lynn Turner</a> provided the voices that said <i>Beast Wars</i> during episodes of the show.</li>
