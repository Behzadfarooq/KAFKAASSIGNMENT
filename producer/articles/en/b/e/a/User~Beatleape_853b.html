	    <p>April Holmes, more commonly known as "Apes," was born on May 11, 1985 in Glendale, California. For the first four years of her life, April lived with her parents, Mark and Sally, and their cat, Mazy, in a small apartment in the city of her birth. Very few important incidents occured during this period besides an earthquake when April was two and being potty trained. April can remember as far back as when she was about nine months old, back to her first Christmas in Dedham, Massachusetts. That particular memory was of April and her FSB (Friend Since Birth), Teri Volante (who was about the same age as April) munching on leaves at the Community House playground in their snowsuits. That was the last peaceful meeting the two young girls would have for many years. April's fear of heights and inability to climb stem back to the day when she was two and attempted to climb a tree, causing her to scrape her knee. Her mother applied some sort of prehistoric cleanser to the scrape, causing excrutiating pain. April's sister, Melody, was born in March of 1989, right around the time when April began having a more interesting life.</p>
<p>The announcement that April would have a new sister sent her into a temper tantrum. April recalls sitting at the table eating grapes when her parents told her that she would have a new brother or sister... upon hearing the news, April chucked the grapes in her parents' direction. Right before the birth of the child, Sally asked April whether she thought the baby would be a boy or a girl. April answered, "I don't know, I think it'll be a weirdo." April refused to call Melody by her name for several weeks, referring to the baby as "her" or "she" until April accepted that Melody would not be going anywhere anytime soon. Although Melody kept April up all night from her incessant screaming (even causing April to lose several precious hours of beauty sleep the night before her preschool pictures), she was allowed into the family.</p>
<p>Elementary school was an interesting experience. April attended John Marshall Elementary and had many great friends and teachers. April was very talkative and was kept after school several times for her friendly nature. She also got in trouble for continuing to jump rope after the "freeze bell" rang, although she denies it to this day. Her teacher, Mrs. Malcolm, sarcastically remarked that it must not have been April, "just some other blonde girl on the playground," which was impossible, since April was the only light haired/skinned girl in the entire school.</p>
<p>John Marshall even had its own haunted house that April and her friends would hang out next to at recess. There was a very creepy couple that lived in the house and would occassionally come out all toothless and dirty and scare the children. April and one of her friends also dug up an "adult" magazine near the haunted house when playing in the dirt. Once, while playing near the haunted house, a gang jumped the fence and the kids had to go inside while the janitor went to talk to them... it was a very strange place to go to school. The children were required to run a mile every few weeks starting in third grade. There was no grass anywhere on the playground and no shade anywhere, which is really horrible since the school was on a year-round schedule, meaning the kids were in school during the summer. They were also not allowed to bring water bottles, candy, or plastic eating utensils to school. If you didn't buy school lunch, you had to eat outside; you weren't allowed in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>April's experience at John Marshall ended during 5th grade, when she moved with her family and her dog, Geena, to Dedham, MA to take care of her sick grandmother. April and her sister began school at Riverdale Elementary School, where her grandfather had also gone as a child. It was a great experience where April met a few lifelong friends. Although her teacher walked around with chalk handprints on the butt of her black pants from erasing the board with her hands and then wiping them on her pants, April enjoyed her experience there. After her grandmother passed, April's parents made the decision to stay in Dedham indefinitely to help her grandfather adjust to his new life. From Riverdale, she went to Dedham Middle School, which was even more of a death camp than John Marshall. They revoked the kids' rights to use the bathrooms during the school day because someone had written on the bathroom wall in the cafeteria bathroom. So the kids couldn't use the bathrooms. Ever. They were also never allowed to go outside during the day, but the school bus dropped the kids off about 90 minutes before school started so they froze all winter waiting for them to open the doors of the school while they watched the teachers drink coffee from their cozy classroom windows.</p>
<p>The experience April had in Dedham was lifechanging. Not only did she decide that she would definitely live in Massachusetts as an adult, she also found her life's obsession. THE BEATLES. At the tender young age of ten, April began reading books about the Beatles like it was her job. For a while, she even planned on becoming a Beatles Historian. Her obsession began one day when she was home sick with the flu, so her dad popped in their tape of the Beatles Anthology that had been aired on ABC a few weeks before. April soon knew everything about the Beatles and even surrounded herself with friends who were also Beatle Nuts, but not quite as crazy as she was. She even had herself convinced she was reincarnated from John Lennon for a few days. Okay maybe it was a few months.</p>
<p>April loved living in Dedham. She had two friends who lived across the street who were her age and her sister's age, so they would all play together. They'd ride bikes in the cemetery, look for frogs in the marsh, and protect their houses from their neighbor Frank, who was obsessed with the military and always threatened to attack their houses with waterguns and other weapons of mass destruction. Once, the street flooded and April's neighbor let the kids borrow his canoe to row around in. The news showed up, and it was a grand old time. April also spent most afternoons rollerblading around the neighborhood or playing in the snow, depending on the season.</p>
<p>After she finished sixth grade, April and her family moved back to California, which sucked. Although she was disappointed to leave her friends and family in Dedham, the move back to California made April a tough chick. She began middle school at Rosemont Middle School in La Crescenta, California. April's middle/high school experience in California has so many weird stories that her current roommates in college wonder how she turned out so normal living in such a strange environment for six years.</p>
<p>April's first year at Rosemont was challeging since she was a huge geek. On Valentine's Day, April received three Valentine-grams in her history class and was very excited. A popular girl who sat next to April said, "Looks like someone sent those to herself." This comment has scarred April for life. Actually, not really, but it was sad. When April fell in love with Graham (who looked like Leonardo DiCaprio), who she never even talked to, the whole school found out about it and a rumor was spread that April hid in his shower drain and followed his mom around the grocery store in her free time. Obviously, it was impossible to hide in the shower drain, otherwise, she probably would have been there. Another popular girl found out that April liked Graham, so she lied and told April that he wanted to go to a dance with her. When April went to talk to him about it, he said he'd never said that, and the popular girl thought it was hilarious. Boo.</p>
<p>Eighth grade was much better than seventh. April became best friends with Lauren Newborg, who still is one of April's best friends to this day. Although they hung out with some weirdos to begin with, they branched out and made some great friends later in the year. They decided to stop hanging out with their old friends when one of the girls would constantly steal presents for them from different stores in the mall.</p>
<p>High school was excellent, April attended Crescenta Valley High and became good friends with Natalie Degnan and Amy Schuck, among others. Nothing of great significance happened in high school, just lots of good times such as Club April, Backstreet Boy Parties, Homecomings, Prom, and finally GRADUATION which didn't make April sad at all because...</p>
<p>SHE WENT TO UMASS AMHERST.</p>
<p>That was the best decision she ever made in her LIFE. Staying true to her original childhood goal, April immediately moved back to Massachusetts as soon as she possibly could and hasn't looked back. Freshman year, April met some awesome girls (Cate Wojtkowski, Meggi Connor, and Liz Beamer) who she is roommates with to this day. Sophomore year brought more great friends: D Dog Con, Alex, BoBo, Crotty, Chaucer, etc etc. and also her wonderful boyfriend, Joe Muraco, who seriously kicks butt. Her junior year, April moved away from the 4th floor James (*tear*) and got her current apartment where there were many parties that brought all their friends together and make them love each other even more. April and Joe go on many adventures together and have a grand old time both with and without their homies.</p>
