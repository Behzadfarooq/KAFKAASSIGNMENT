<p><b>Bethlehem Central High School</b> is a high school in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delmar%2C_New_York_0042.html" title="Delmar, New York">Delmar</a>, NY, just south of Albany. The school serves students in grades 9-12 from the towns of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem%2C_New_York_e95c.html" title="Bethlehem, New York">Bethlehem</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scotland%2C_New_York_e3fe.html" title="New Scotland, New York">New Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>Construction on the original school was finished in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, but in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> its original premises were deemed too small and it moved to its current location in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. The former building now serves as the town's Middle School. Unfortunately, the words "Bethlehem Central High School" were permanently carved into rock on the original building, leading to confusion for out-of-towners trying to locate the school. This original building is located at 332 Kenwood Avenue in Delmar, New York. Currently, Bethlehem Central High School is located on 700 Delaware Avenue in Delmar. Bethlehem Central is ranked 776 on Newsweek's "1200 Top US High Schools."</p>

<p>In 2006, the school has added a new no hat policy (which includes no hoods). This policy was met with considerable student protest, culminating in a petition circulated by students that accumulated, over the course of a day, over 800 signatures, more than one half of the student body. The issue has attracted much local media coverage in both the Times Union and local TV news formats. Hats have been banned because of relation to suspected gang symbols. School has also banned handkerchiefs, bandanas and other things commonly associated with gangs.</p>
<p>The school is still under construction after several months. Several additions are currently underway by contractor Sano-Rubin Construction Services. A new <a href="../../../g/y/m/Gym.html" title="Gym">gymnasium</a> has been added, as will be several new wings on both the second and first floors of the building. Sano-Rubin is also responsible for adding 3 new science labs, relocating the Pupil Personnel Services, expanding the Counseling Center, expanding and relocating existing art rooms, expanding the cafeteria, and relocating the fitness center.</p>
<p>As the district's budget for 2006-2007 was rejected by voters, many budget cuts were made and a revised budget passed on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p>The school's <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Bowl_fa15.html" title="Science Bowl">Science Bowl</a> team finished first in their regional competition in the 2005-2006 school year, earning them a trip to the national competition in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>.</p>
<p>Bethlehem High School has a history of producing excellent <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masterminds.html" title="Masterminds">Masterminds</a> teams, having won several championships in their league.</p>
<p>Recently, controversy has surrounded the school due to underage drinking and over-consumption of alcohol by its students, specifically at school dances and sporting events. Due to heavy student drinking at the unofficially-titled "Mardi Gras" dance on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, the district adopted a new policy on school dances. The major changes included the use of passive alcohol screening devices and increased chaperone presence. The move drew applause from some but ire from others, especially students. Many seniors, including the Student Senate President, encouraged a boycott of the popular "70s 80s" dance, which was next on the schedule. The boycott seemed to be effective, with only approximately 300 students attending the dance (in previous years, attendance had been more than double that total). Theft has also been a problem in the 2006-2007 school year. A series of thefts, affecting dozens of students, has resulted in the loss of many electronics, including <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPods</a> and calculators.</p>

<p>Bethlehem Central believes that participation in sports provides a wealth of opportunities and experiences that assist students in their education. Accordingly, the district offers students opportunities to participate in more than 20 sports across three seasons. The district is a member of the New York State Athletic Association, competing as a Class AA school in Section II. BC's league affiliation is with the Suburban Scholastic Council, competing in the Council's gold division.</p>
<p>The Eagles compete in the following sports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseball</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Baseketball</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Bowling</li>
<li>Cheerleading</li>
<li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
<li>Field Hockey</li>
<li>Football</li>
<li>Men's Golf</li>
<li>Gymnastics</li>

<p>After budget cuts on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, 3 major School sports, Ice Hockey, Cheerleading,and Gymnastics, were cut from the budget. There were multiple fund rasiers for all the teams, allowing all of them to play their sports by the season.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Men's Soccer Team made the Final 4 in the state championship. The 4 members of the Girl's Swim Team made the state championship as well, placing 3rd in the 200 yard Medley Relay.</p>
<p>The Girls Lacrosse Team is recognized as one of the best lacrosse teams in the country.</p>
<p>In 2006, prior to the Men's Soccer Team's rise into the Final 4, the BC Hooligans were formed, growing from 40 students, mostly upperclassmen, to hundreds including a full band, with bass and drums. The students made up their own songs to go along with the team, playing favorites as well. Hundreds of fans consistently attended games after word spread through the school. The largest attendance of fans was probably at the Section 2 Championship against Saratoga High School, where there were approximatley 400 members of the student body present, and most ran onto the field after the Eagles defeated the Blue Streaks.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem_Central_High_School_4dd8.html" title="Edit section: Lab School">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lab School</span></h2>
<p>Founded by James Nehring, the Lab School of Bethlehem Central High School was headed by Jane King until the 2005-06 school year, when she chose to take a job in <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifton_Park_1a14.html" title="Clifton Park">Clifton Park, NY</a> overseeing the creation of a biomedical curriculum. Its current head is Stephen Smith, who also oversees the school's newspaper, <i>The Talon</i>, which releases about 4 or 5 issues per year. It is a school-within-a-school and has a total of around 111 students in all four grades (9-12). It is focused more on hands-on projects and has an overall passing average of an 80 or above per year, instead of the regular 65.</p>
<p>Field trips:</p>
<p>Annual field trips are held, including one to Camp Chingachgook (located in Katskill Bay, New York) in September, and one to the Silver Bay Association in Silver Bay, New York. These field trips are held overnight and require strict adherence to school rules as though everyone present were in school instead of elsewhere.</p>
<p>Important projects:</p>
<p>Presentations are also held at least twice per year (with the exception of freshman year, in which only one is required). At least three visual aides must be used throughout each presentation. A panel of evaluators grades the presentation as it is being shown to a crowd of anywhere between 25 persons and the whole student body. There are 20-week and 40-week projects, and, more recently, 10-week projects. These projects result in a research paper on a debatable topic (e.g. "Does alternative medicine work better than regular medicine?") and a 5-minute presentation on an aspect of that topic, not the one written in the research paper. A health-related presentation must also be done in senior year. This presentation can be either informational or debatable. Topics in the past have included prosthetic eyes, blepharoptosis, and humor therapy. The most important presentation in the lab school student's career is the internship presentation. This one consists of a 35-minute presentation on an aspect of a semester-long internship anywhere the student chooses.</p>
<p>The senior year internship:</p>
<p>This internship must meet various guidelines as set forth by the school in order to meet various educational requirements. Throughout this internship, the participating student must keep a journal of their hours and experiences and hand it in at the end of the year for a grade.</p>
<p>The end-of-the-year banquet:</p>
<p>At the end of each year, a banquet open to all lab school students (or "lab rats" as they are sometimes referred to) is held. Stephen Smith, the present head of lab school, gives the farewells to the graduating seniors, but is not the emcee. The emcee (or emcees) of the banquets are students voted by their peers beforehand. Banquets are regularly held in late June at the Desmond Hotel in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany%2C_New_York_1b4f.html" title="Albany, New York">Albany, NY.</a></p>
