<p><i><b>Between Two Worlds</b></i> is a 1944 film set during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, featuring <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Garfield_d88e.html" title="John Garfield">John Garfield</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Henreid_ea9c.html" title="Paul Henreid">Paul Henreid</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Greenstreet_c84a.html" title="Sydney Greenstreet">Sydney Greenstreet</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Parker_a76b.html" title="Eleanor Parker">Eleanor Parker</a>. It is a remake of the 1930 film, <i>Outward Bound</i>, itself based on the 1924 play of the same name. It is not a remake of <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Lang_4ddb.html" title="Fritz Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s <i>Destiny</i> (original title <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_m%C3%BCde_Tod_485f.html" title="Der müde Tod">Der müde Tod</a></i>).</p>

<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, a diverse group of people in war-ravaged <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> books passage for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, but Austrian pianist-turned-soldier Henry Bergner (Henreid) is unable to join them for want of an exit permit. Searching the streets for him during a German <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_raid.html" title="Air raid">air raid</a>, his wife Ann (<a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Parker_a76b.html" title="Eleanor Parker">Eleanor Parker</a>) witnesses the obliteration by an aerial bomb of the car full of passengers on their way to the docks. She returns to their apartment to find he has turned on the gas in a <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> attempt.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the pair find themselves on board a fog-shrouded cruise ship together with the other passengers. The steward, Scrubby (<a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Gwenn_5cd7.html" title="Edmund Gwenn">Edmund Gwenn</a>), asks Henry and Ann not to tell the others that they are dead; they will have to come to the realization on their own.</p>
<p>As first, the couple is delighted to be together eternally and to have Henry's piano-playing ability restored to him, but they soon find their situation unbearable, particularly at dinner, where various of the travelers reveal their hopes and aspirations. Timid priest Reverend William Duke (<a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_King_%28actor%29_b348.html" title="Dennis King (actor)">Dennis King</a>) yearns to more actively help his fellow man, while American merchant sailor Pete Musick (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Tobias_1b91.html" title="George Tobias">George Tobias</a>), who has survived three ship sinkings, looks forward to seeing his infant son for the first time. Only the kind-hearted old housemaid, Mrs. Midget (<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sara_Allgood_ad68.html" title="Sara Allgood">Sara Allgood</a>), declines to reveal her motivations.</p>
<p>Thomas Prior (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Garfield_d88e.html" title="John Garfield">John Garfield</a>), the cynical, wisecracking ex-newspaperman is the first to learn the truth when he eavesdrops on Henry and Ann, and, spurned by his stardom-seeking actress companion, Maxine Russell (<a href="../../../f/a/y/Faye_Emerson_65fa.html" title="Faye Emerson">Faye Emerson</a>) for unscrupulous <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_profiteer.html" title="War profiteer">war profiteer</a> Mr. Lingley (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Coulouris_a036.html" title="George Coulouris">George Coulouris</a>), reveals all to the other passengers in a "magic show" in which he burns Lingley's cash and shoots him in the chest with Lingley's gun, the latter to no effect.</p>
<p>The jig up, Scrubby reveals that they are to be judged by the Examiner and consigned to their various fates. When the Examiner arrives, he is revealed to be the deceased Reverend Tim Thompson (<a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Greenstreet_c103.html" title="Sidney Greenstreet">Sidney Greenstreet</a>), someone Duke had known well in life. Too timid to go meet people and do the good he so desperately wanted to, Duke is given another opportunity in Heaven, as an Examiner-in-training. Though Henry and Ann's only wish was not to be separated in the afterlife, the Examiner takes Henry away to watch the rest of the examinations. One by one, the other passengers are judged and taken ashore to their respective fates.</p>
<p>Wealthy Mr. Langley discovers he can neither bribe nor browbeat his way into Heaven, and must pay for the suffering he inflicted on others.</p>
<p>Genevieve and Benjamin Cliveden-Banks (Isobel Elsom and <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_Emery_7bb2.html" title="Gilbert Emery">Gilbert Emery</a>) are a mismatched couple. She is a shallow, mercenary social climber, who married him only for his wealth and position and was unfaithful. She is at first delighted to learn that she will reside in a fabulous castle, but then the Examiner tells her she must live there alone forever. Her husband patiently put up with his wife's infidelities because he truly loved her, but his love finally wore out and he refuses to join her in her solitary afterlife. Instead, he is to be reunited with his old college chums.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/u/c/Muckraker.html" title="Muckraker">Muckraker</a> Prior wants only permanent oblivion and is too full of stubborn pride to accept a chance at redemption. However, Russell is more regretful of her choices in life and gladly accepts her second chance.</p>
<p>Musick the sailor bemoans not being able to see his family again, but is consoled when told he will be reunited with them eventually.</p>
<p>Prior tries to gamble his way into Heaven by rigging a deck of cards, but his <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleight_of_hand.html" title="Sleight of hand">sleight of hand</a> is trumped by the Examiner's powers. He is told that his afterlife will be identical to his life, but that he will no longer be able to hide behind his deceptions; all he meets will be able to see through them. Mrs. Midget offers to accompany Prior on his journey, giving up her cottage and garden in Heaven to do so. The somewhat bewildered and suspicious Prior agrees. The Examiner privately reveals to Scrubby that she is Prior's mother. She had given him up at birth and had been guilt-ridden over it; being reunited with him is her Heaven.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the special case of Henry Bergner. Because he committed suicide and, the Examiner believes, persuaded his wife Ann to join him, he is doomed to remain on the ship for all eternity, just like Scrubby, while Ann goes to Heaven. Ann protests that her suicide was voluntary and that nothing will separate her from Henry. Ann refuses to go ashore with the Examiner. Not wanting her to suffer the suicide's fate of ship steward, Scrubby pleads the matter with the Examiner, to no avail, and the ship sets off on its return trip with Henry, Ann, and Scrubby aboard.</p>
<p>Then Henry begins to hear breaking glass and wanders off to investigate. Ann searches for him, but he is nowhere to be found. Scrubby tells her that he has gone back to Earth. Back in his apartment, Henry finds a window shattered and his suicide attempt was thwarted. He revives Ann and they rejoice at being given back the gift of life.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Between_Two_Worlds_668e.html" title="Edit section: Differences between versions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Differences between versions</span></h2>
<p>Neither the original play, <i>Outward Bound</i>, nor the 1930 film version have a war setting. There are fewer characters and no one is killed by a bomb, but the plot is essentially the same, as is much of the dialogue. The play and earlier film also share a number of other differences from the 1944 version. Henry and Ann are lovers and Ann cannot obtain a divorce from her husband. When they board the ship, the audience is led to believe that they are running away to be together. It is not until the end that it is revealed that they tried to commit suicide and that the vessel is a ship of the dead, in contrast to the later film.</p>
