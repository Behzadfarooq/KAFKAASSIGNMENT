<p>It's Better Know <b>A</b> District. See: <a href="http://img161.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bkad6li.png" class="external free" title="http://img161.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bkad6li.png" rel="nofollow">http://img161.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bkad6li.png</a> (small caps, uppercase 'A'). 'Better Know a District' follows neither existing naming conventions nor is it accurate. I think it should be corrected to 'Better Know A District' to reflect the title used in the show or maybe changed to 'Better know a district'. What do other people think? If it's corrected sooner rather than later there will probably be less broken links to fix from anyone else referencing this article. <a href="../../../a/l/0/User%7EAl001_0795.html" title="User:Al001">Al001</a> 13:38, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now, If I remember correctly, Colbert addressed this issue after someone incorrectly published the detail that the 50th was dead to him. It wasn't because of the congressman himself, but the PEOPLE of that district who had betrayed the congressman. Unfortunately I'm not 100% confident about this detail, but I'm almost sure it's true.

<p>The map showing the districts that have been covered is incorrect. According to the list, Colbert covered Nebraska's 2nd, but on the map, Kansas' 2nd is highlighted.--Mr T 14:44, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but if there are 435 voting members of the House of Representatives, and the non-voting District of Columbia member was profiled on Better Know A District, wouldn't that make it a 435-part series again (excluding California's 50th but not Texas' 22nd)? He has been calling it a 434 part series since the "Exclusive Fake Interview" with Tom Delay, and he called the DC interview part 28 of the 434 part series. --Jmhill87 06:52, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's clearly some vital tidbit missing from my pool of eclectic knowledge. The "Better Know A ____" name appears to be reffing <i>something</i>, but what? Was there an original "Better Know A ...", and if so, what was it -- a mnemonic a la Roy G Biv? A book series? A kids' TV show? A Google search doesn't help, as the results are heavily polluted by the Colbert meme; no particularly telling results in Amazon, IMDB, or my local library's online card catalog.</p>
<p>So, like, what's with the name? If there's an answer, it should probably go in the article, unless it turns out I'm the only person on the planet who doesn't know this. --<a href="../../../n/a/p/User%7ENapoliRoma_0d04.html" title="User:NapoliRoma">NapoliRoma</a> 20:47, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I won't speculate if certain representatives are now afraid to accept an appearance in BKAD. (Okay, maybe I just did right there.) However, it seems clear that with Paul Aronsohn's appearance tonight, this is now a recurring segment. It shouldn't be moved to the list with the other spinofffs, as it uses the same big board as BKAD. (The segment essentially starts and ends as BKAD, and remember - it's Better Know a DISTRICT, not a representative.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Lake_Effect_493c.html" title="User:The Lake Effect">The Lake Effect</a> 03:54, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As Colbert himself is proud of (from the Indecision 2006 coverage), ALL of the INTERVIEWED incumbent representatives (that were running for re-election) were re-elected. We're not counting Tom DeLay's "context-flexible" footage or Mark Foley's "text message." Perhaps if the other challengers had joined Colbert in a duet, like with John Hall, they would have all won. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Lake_Effect_493c.html" title="User:The Lake Effect">The Lake Effect</a> 22:17, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>During Stephen Colbert's non-character interview with NPR in late 2005, he explained that this segment was created because politicians feared being interviewed. A producer suggested House reps and the segment was born. This is a poor explanation but should be included in someway about why this segment got started. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdeviant_a7b1.html" title="User:Jdeviant">Jdeviant</a> 21:44, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently, an edit was made that changed the sections from seasons to individual Congresses. I have reverted this edit for now to discuss this first. My concern with this edit is that as it was set up, the large block of Representatives that Colbert met at Harvard who were Representatives-elect to the 110th Congress were listed under the 109th Congress. Also, if the switch is made from season to Congress, the year would have to be included on the installment date, since two years run together under the 109th Congress. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValadius_948b.html" title="User:Valadius">Valadius</a> 19:25, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
