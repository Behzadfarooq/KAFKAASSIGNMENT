While I might agree that the hot water faucets is an insignificant fact (I don't realy agree since if/when you see it you can't but wonder about it), I do disagree about the faucets that don't require ones hand to activate them, as it is very noticable when you have a washing room with more than 20 faucets and none of those allow you to use your hands to operate them. --<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmaltz_0793.html" title="User:Shmaltz">Shmaltz</a> 00:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I like this name because it is so widespread and it in no way detracts from its greatness. When was the last time anyone heard of a yeshiva bochur saying he was learning in the "Beth Medrash Govoha." In any case, these kind of votes can swing in both directions at any time, and since the editors who have worked on this article so far have given the article the "Lakewood yeshiva" name it should be left alone for now. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 01:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Don't have a strong view on the merits either way, but agree that when in doubt, principle that editors should not be interfered with too unduly should control. Also, the Yeshiva is almost certainly much more notable in the English-speaking world by its English colloquial name than by its Hebrew one, especially since this Yeshiva has spawned a whole approach. The "Lakewood point of view" is a well-known term, and I've never in my life heard of the "Medrash Govoha point of view." I imaging many notable yeshivas in the English-speaking world are more notable by their colloquial English names. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 06:15, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>More well-known name. Who ever heard of Beth Medrash Govoha? Aside from that, that name is a pretty inaccurate version (it's British-style) of the name. I always oppose that. When did you hear any mention 'beth medrash'? It's 'beis', not 'beth'. Anyway, that's not the issue here, since 'beth' is their official name I guess. In any case, I vote for '<a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakewood_yeshiva.html" title="Lakewood yeshiva">Lakewood yeshiva</a>'. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> 07:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Shmaltz, you should be aware that even if you know something to be the truth, it does not mean that it can be included in wikipedia. I am sure you are not the only beginning editor who feels frustrated by this. However, bear in mind that if anyone could edit articles based on personal witness or whim, wikipedia would be a wasteland of chaos.</dd>
<dd>P.S. By the way, I studied in BMG for many years, in fact I dormed in the facility on Clifton. Regardless of what you say it is called, wikipedia prohibits inclusion of Original Research.68.198.236.57 19:50, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Shmaltz has agreed with me privately (offwiki) that it's OR.

<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tumult" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tumult" rel="nofollow">Tumult</a> means "The noise as made by a crowd." or "A riot or uprising.". Though I can believe that the discussions are noisy, I assume the day is not named after the noise generated therein, but by the <i>tumel</i> created by <i>tumelers</i>. And due to the lack of mention of riots in the article, I'll also assume that that sense of tumult is not meant either.</p>
<p>In short, I think that the day is probably known as "<i>Tumel</i> day" - using the Yiddish word, not "Tumult day". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.168.67.112_badb.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.168.67.112">168.168.67.112</a> (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.168.67.112.html" title="User talk:168.168.67.112">talk</a>) 18:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>As far as I know, the word <i>tumel</i> from yiddish is just the translation of the english <i>tumult</i>.--<a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmaltz_0793.html" title="User:Shmaltz">Shmaltz</a> 00:12, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not an expert, but my impression was that the connotation of "<i>tumel</i>" is more like a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hullabaloo" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hullabaloo" rel="nofollow">hullabaloo</a> "An uproar or fuss" (the usage example given in Wiktionary would fit: <i>They made such a</i> tumel <i>about the change that the authorities were forced to change it back.</i>). That is somewhat less serious than a "tumult" which has an connotation of being, well, more tumultuous.<br />
Any other thoughts out there?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Actually, you are correct in the sense that it is called "The Tummel" and not the Tumult. However after checking around, it seems clear that the Yiddish Tummel is merely a yiddishised version of the english word tumult.. I will edit the article to reflect this. 38.117.213.19 03:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both <i>tumul</i> and <i>tumult</i> are correct forms of Yiddish. <i>Tumul</i> is a verb, as in "<i>er macht a tumul</i>" ("he is 'noisy/yelling'") and <i>tumult</i> is a noun, as in "<i>genug mit dem tumult</i>" ("enough with the 'noise'"). But sometimes they are used loosely and interchangeably, as in some of the examples above that are confusing people here. The English word "tumult" could have been taken from the Yiddish or is just a shortened version of "tumultuous" as one finds many words that English may share with other languages. At any rate, the <i>yeshiva bochurim</i> at Lakewood are not Yiddish professors and they apparently do refer to that day as "<i>tumult day</i>" so let's leave it at that and not <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make_a_mountain_out_of_a_molehill" class="extiw" title="wikt:make_a_mountain_out_of_a_molehill">make a mountain out of a molehill</a>, or a <i>tumult</i> out of a <i>tumul</i>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:05, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am a bit confused by your erudite comment. You seem to imply that the "bochurim"- not being professors- are incorrectly using the word "tumult" when it should be "tumul". However, if indeed "tumult" is the noun form, then surely it is the bochurim who are displaying encouraging signs of future tenure, and you who are incorrect? 38.117.213.19 18:29, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
