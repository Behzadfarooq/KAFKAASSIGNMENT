<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Betfair.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Since Betfair was launched in <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2000.html" title="June 2000">June 2000</a> it has become the largest online betting company in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> and the largest <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bet_exchange.html" title="Bet exchange">bet exchange</a> in the world. Betfair currently has over 1,000,000 <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer.html" title="Consumer">clients</a> and a turnover in excess of £50m/week.</p>
<p>A bet exchange allows <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punter.html" title="Punter">punters</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gamblers</a>) to bet at <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odds.html" title="Odds">odds</a> set and requested by other punters rather than by a <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookmaker.html" title="Bookmaker">bookmaker</a>. Members can make both 'Back' bets (normal bets on a selection to win) and 'Lay' bets (bets on the opposite side of the Back, against the selection), thereby eliminating the traditional bookmaker.</p>
<p>Betfair uses <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-odds_gambling.html" title="Fixed-odds gambling">decimal odds</a>, which are easier to calculate with than <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-odds_gambling.html" title="Fixed-odds gambling">fractional odds</a>. Its <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookmaking.html" title="Bookmaking">bookmaking</a> model brings together two counterparties with opposing views, and thus removes the need for a bookmaker's markup or <i>overround</i>. As a result, the odds are up to 20% better than bookmakers' odds, according to the site's operators.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Betfair punters are able to offer odds based on their own opinion rather than on a set bookmakers' margin. Betfair charges a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commission_%28remuneration%29.html" title="Commission (remuneration)">commission</a> on all winning bets, which is set at 5% of the net winnings for most markets, although according to how much a client wagers on the site, it is possible to reduce the amount of commission paid to as low as 2%.</p>
<p>The company has attracted much comment in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/News.html" title="News">press</a>. Its co-founders, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Black_%28gambling_entrepreneur%29_c6fd.html" title="Andrew Black (gambling entrepreneur)">Andrew Black</a> and Edward Wray, won the <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_and_Young_7c90.html" title="Ernst and Young">Ernst and Young</a> Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award. More recently the company was recognised by the Department of Trade &amp; Industry when it was given a <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Award_ef25.html" title="Queen's Award">Queen's Award</a>, the most prestigious business award in the UK.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2005.html" title="October 2005">October 2005</a> chief executive Stephen Hill announced his resignation when the board decided not to proceed with plans for a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stock_market.html" title="Stock market">stock market</a> flotation, the investors holding out for a higher valuation <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,1592667,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,1592667,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2005.html" title="November 2005">November 2005</a> the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Tasmania_166a.html" title="Government of Tasmania">Tasmanian government</a> announced a deal to licence Betfair in the state. The deal will see Tasmania receive <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_dollar.html" title="Australian dollar">AU$</a>5 million up front and is projected to pay Tasmania about $40 million per year. Now that it has been approved by the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Tasmania_8b0b.html" title="Parliament of Tasmania">Tasmanian Parliament</a>, it will be the second licence Betfair has received outside the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> - the first being in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a>. The deal has infuriated the established monopolistic totalisers and bookmakers (due to loss of revenue) and governments (due to loss of taxes) in the other <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_state.html" title="Australian state">Australian states</a>. A ban on the use of betting exchanges took effect in Western Australia on the <a href="../../../2/9/t/29th_January_f5f3.html" title="29th January">29th January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> and possibly South Australia in the future. Betfair claims this new law violates the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Australia_c872.html" title="Constitution of Australia">Constitution of Australia</a> and filed a legal challenge which remains before the courts. <a href="http://www.virtualformguide.com/cgi-bin/tvf/displaynewsitem.pl?20070129zbetfair.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.virtualformguide.com/cgi-bin/tvf/displaynewsitem.pl?20070129zbetfair.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

Within two days the 'Xpress' idea was also adopted by <a href="../../../b/e/t/BETDAQ_aa8b.html" title="BETDAQ">BETDAQ</a>. The changes were criticised on the Betfair forums by many members who disliked the smaller fonts and the right-aligned columns, which displayed a large amount of whitespace. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a> these display issues were addressed, although many users still felt the site had been dumbed down in order to attract new punters to the exchanges. The gambit worked, however, with a significant increase in membership and deposits during the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheltenham_Festival_5002.html" title="Cheltenham Festival">Cheltenham Festival</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Betfair.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>The fact that gamblers can now lay outcomes on the exchanges has caused tremendous criticism from traditional bookmakers with much of the anger coming from the UK's "Big Three" - <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gala_Group_299a.html" title="Gala Group">Gala Coral Group</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladbrokes.html" title="Ladbrokes">Ladbrokes</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hill_plc_ce27.html" title="William Hill plc">William Hill</a>. These firms argue that granting who they consider to be anonymous punters the ability to bet that an outcome will not happen is causing <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">corruption</a> in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">sports</a> such as <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_racing.html" title="Horse racing">horse racing</a> (since it is much easier to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_fixing.html" title="Race fixing">ensure a horse will lose a race</a>, the bookmakers reason).</p>
<p>Betfair has led their defence by countering that while corruption is possible on any gambling platform, the bookies' arguments are motivated not by concern for the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrity.html" title="Integrity">integrity</a> of sport but by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce.html" title="Commerce">commercial</a> interests. Betfair also asserts that unlike the high street brokers, who all accept anonymous cash bets, Betfair is well aware of who their customers are. Customers are required to create personal accounts, and Betfair keeps records of each customer's betting history. Betfair in particular has noted that they have signed numerous agreements with <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport_governing_bodies.html" title="Sport governing bodies">governing bodies</a> of sport including the <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jockey_Club_3029.html" title="Jockey Club">Jockey Club</a>, with whom they insist they will co-operate fully if the latter suspects corruption to have taken place.</p>

<p>Although the bulk of its customer base is in the UK, Betfair offers its services in a number of countries. Betfair has never accepted customers and/or credit card numbers from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, where online gambling is legally proscribed. Being the leading betting exchange, Betfair has been reluctant to entangle itself in legal trouble and has thus turned away business from countries where its services are likely prohibited. As a result, unlike some other online gambling operations Betfair was not seriously affected when the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Congress_7589.html" title="U.S. Congress">U.S. Congress</a> passed strict prohibitions affecting Internet gambling in late 2006.</p>
<p>Betfair has several thousand customers in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> but its marketing activities are currently restricted to Tasmania, where it is licensed. Betfair is well known in Australia because of negative publicity from the racing industry and the totalizators. However, Betfair signed a landmark agreement with Racing Victoria in July 2006 which saw Betfair begin covering Victorian racing and left the exchange on decent terms with two of Australia's six states. Betfair also has agreements in place with several major sports in Australia including the Australian Football League, Cricket Australia and the PGA Tour of Australasia.</p>

<p>In late autumn of 2005, Betfair finalised a deal that began in early summer, to purchase the <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_poker.html" title="Online poker">online poker</a> site <i>PokerChamps.com</i>, which the company will integrate into its network, replacing a poker arm that previously used gaming technology <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software.html" title="Software">software</a> from <a href="../../../c/r/y/CryptoLogic_Inc_b71c.html" title="CryptoLogic Inc">CryptoLogic Inc</a>. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">30 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Betfair Poker left the Cryptologic network to move to its new platform.</p>
<p>In a press release the company's poker head, Ben Fried, stated: "Having our own poker software puts us in command of our own destiny. It means we can react quickly to customer feedback and continue to develop an innovative, community-focused product. We are confident that we are laying the foundations of a market leading poker room." <a href="http://prweb.com/releases/2006/10/prweb450531.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://prweb.com/releases/2006/10/prweb450531.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p><a name="Zero_lounge" id="Zero_lounge"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Betfair.html" title="Edit section: Zero lounge">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Zero lounge</span></h2>
<p>In 2006 Betfair Casino introduced its "Zero lounge - where the house has no edge". According to Betfair, perfect play should result in the player having an equal chance of winning or losing. For example, the roulette wheel has no zero. This means that someone playing red-black, odd-even, or high-low has an exactly 50% chance of winning, (as opposed to a 48.65% chance on a normal roulette wheel with a zero). However, in some games, such as blackjack, it is necessary to learn perfect play in order to match the house. Players who draw a card when they have 17 or more are likely to lose money to the house. The zero blackjack rules have been slightly modified (re-written) compared to normal European blackjack. For example natural suited blackjacks pay 2 to 1 instead of 1.5 to 1, Any five card 21 automatically pays 2-1, pairs of aces cannot be split, all other pairs can be split, including 4s, 5s, and 10s, only one split is allowed, doubling is allowed on 8, 9, 10 and 11, including "soft" 18s, 19s, 20s and 21s, and insurance can be taken any time the dealer shows an ace, no matter what cards the player holds.</p>
<p>The games offered in the Zero lounge are <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackjack.html" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/u/Roulette.html" title="Roulette">roulette</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/c/Baccarat.html" title="Baccarat">baccarat</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_poker.html" title="Video poker">Jacks or better</a>.</p>
