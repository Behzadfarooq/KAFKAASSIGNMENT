My contributions since 2004 when I joined Wikipedia have been constructive if not 100% flawless.

<p>Hi, thanks for adding me to the userlist for VP. You sent me a second message later on to tell me that you'd fixed the bug that stopped version 1.3.5 from acknowledging I was approved; but I still get the 'You are not on the user list' error message.

<p>I'm a little surprised by this reversal. I strongly urge you to reconsider your initial judgement. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">Jossi</a> is, indeed, close to the issue at hand. In the opinion of myself and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Talk%7EPrem_Rawat_f4e1.html#Suggestion_to_improve_this_article" title="Talk:Prem Rawat">other users</a>, Jossi may in fact be too close to the subject at hand, and too close to Momento to be objective. I would hope that, after a month of review, it would take more than some casual hand-waving on the part of an admin who is plainly allied with the subject of the review to reverse an unfavorable finding. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMael-Num_eb75.html" title="User:Mael-Num">Mael-Num</a> 03:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Momento provided no real evidence, and as has been exhibited here, your trust is likely misplaced or misguided.

<p>Is there a way to get the bot to place new project banners below existing ones on a page? It's more politie. And the bot's current habit of placing a new banner at the top has bumped some notes that remind editors to discuss the article not the topic downward.

<p>I'm concerned about some of your recent deletions. Can you explain why you deleted <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caitlin_Murphy_7681.html" title="Caitlin Murphy">Caitlin Murphy</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_MacLurcan_3be0.html" title="James MacLurcan">James MacLurcan</a> for no context? The content said they were actors, and what country they were from, and gave one significant role. Surely this is enough to identify the person in question? I realize they were too short to be proper articles, and if this is all the content we have they're better off with a one-sentence mention in the main article. But lack of context? I don't see it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also wondering about <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoken_%28band%29.html" title="Spoken (band)">Spoken (band)</a>.

<dd>the one liners were poorly written one liners at best, Ryulong ended up re-writing the one liners to make more sense and the actors in question were mentioned in other articles. In regard to the band I glanced over the article and there were some phrases that stood out that read just like a advert. <i>Spoken frequently returns to Arkansas for concerts, even though most bands overlook it.</i> &amp; <i>Arkansas maintains a large Spoken fanbase</i> are a few. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 16:16, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I noticed that you are removing the self-links that someone used to make the name of the page bold in the introduction text. This is not the usual way, but the text should be bold for the page title and you can do that by using three ' marks before and after the words you want to make bold.

<p>Looking at the way the bots are handling things when you report a bunch of users from your /Log page to AIV, I had a thought - would you be willing/able to simply remove all of the entries yourself from your page whenever you report them to AIV? That way the bots will only have to remove them from one place, instead of doing double-work. It would mean you'd have to look at the page history for AIV or rely in people specifically letting you know about any that don't get blocked, but it would help reduce the load that the bots are putting on the server quite a bit, I think, and allow them to focus their work on removing the blocked entries from AIV faster. —<a href="../../../k/r/e/User%7EKrellis_efff.html" title="User:Krellis">Krellis</a> <small>(<a href="../../../k/r/e/User_talk%7EKrellis_922e.html" title="User talk:Krellis">Talk</a>)</small> 15:54, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

His sockpuppets are leaving a wake of anoyed people where ever he edits. But he now does it all anon. Can you block 83.78.*.* and 83.79.*.* and take him out.

<p>I'm concerned about some of your recent deletions. Can you explain why you deleted <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caitlin_Murphy_7681.html" title="Caitlin Murphy">Caitlin Murphy</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_MacLurcan_3be0.html" title="James MacLurcan">James MacLurcan</a> for no context? The content said they were actors, and what country they were from, and gave one significant role. Surely this is enough to identify the person in question? I realize they were too short to be proper articles, and if this is all the content we have they're better off with a one-sentence mention in the main article. But lack of context? I don't see it. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the one liners were poorly written one liners at best, Ryulong ended up re-writing the one liners to make more sense and the actors in question were mentioned in other articles. In regard to the band I glanced over the article and there were some phrases that stood out that read just like a advert. <i>Spoken frequently returns to Arkansas for concerts, even though most bands overlook it.</i> &amp; <i>Arkansas maintains a large Spoken fanbase</i> are a few. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 16:16, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I was also wondering about the deletions, especially of WikiProject categories (i.e. <a href="../../../f/a/-/Category%7EFA-class_carnivorous_plant_articles_2859.html" title="Category:FA-class carnivorous plant articles">Category:FA-class carnivorous plant articles</a>). The list looks up-to-date as of 5 March, but I don't think it's necessarily a good idea to go around deleting them using an automated function (AWB? I don't know what Voice of All was using). In the interim of the list being generated and the empty cats being deleted, you might find some like the example above where someone is mid-edit, or in my case where I was instructed to create the cats at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Using_the_bot_049e.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Using the bot">Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Using the bot</a> and then go ahead with assessment. Should we propose a change to those instructions or somehow tag the WikiProject cats as not to be deleted? Has this method been discussed anywhere?

<p>Quite a few categories related to WikiProjects and maintenance categories were deleted - I've restored at least 4.

<p>Hi, I have had vandal proof for a while now and I have had to keep un-installing and re-installing it several times now as at first it goes really fast then after a little while when you click rollback it takes about 5 seconds, nearly always more, however when I re-install it it wipeds my vandalism counter back to zero and I display it on my userpage so I have to keep explaining about it, can you help with this to make it go fast permanently. After asking questions on a sub-page the first time the user was very helpful and informative, however when AmiDaniel and another user replied when I asked about two months later, they seemed unwilling to help.

<p>Please stop removing links to this web site. I know we had a spam problem with the owner of the site yesterday, but that has already been addressed. The links you are removing are legitimate references to a reliable source for figure skating information, that were originally added by me and other people when writing the articles in question. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.frog_7088.html" title="User:Dr.frog">Dr.frog</a> 02:37, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I see that on the infoboxneeded page. My question is <i>why</i>. It seems like people wouldn't see it there. It just makes no sense to me.

<p>Hello, I noticed that you wikified the avalanche-center.org and snowman-jim.org links I added to <a href="../../../4/2E/2/User_talk%7E4.242.3.161.html" title="User talk:4.242.3.161">User talk:4.242.3.161</a>. The reason I made those live external links was to leave bread-crumbs that would pop up in a LinkSearch. Wikifying them hides them from LinkSearch. Maybe a good compromise would be to make the external link point to something like http://SPAM.avalanche-center.org, that way it is an obvious spam link that doesn't go anywhere and it also shows up with a wildcarded link search. What are your thoughts? (<a href="../../../r/e/q/User%7ERequestion_f172.html" title="User:Requestion">Requestion</a> 18:11, 9 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Wow, that is really cool. Does your bot automatically collect links from the project page that are added to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_LinkSearch_List_edd6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkSearch/List">Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkSearch/List</a>? It would be useful if <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_Report_cb33.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/Report">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spam/Report</a> listed the link search counts from both the "all" and the "(Main)" namespaces. For example; I've been watching tinyurl.com usage and keeping it clean, there are many search hits in the User and Talk spaces that I'm not allowed to change but none in the (Main) space. So a report string of something like "xyzzy.com has 456,0 links on wikipedia" would be very informative to me (the zero being the main space counts). Another thing that would be really great is if you added a live external link to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_LinkSearch_avalanche-center.org_67b8.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkSearch/avalanche-center.org">Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkSearch/avalanche-center.org</a>, maybe with a prefix like spam.xyzzy.com, so that a standard LinkSearch would find it. You could even add a sentence that mentions WikiProject_Spam and the significance of this LinkSearch hit.

<dd>I look forward to the new feature. You know, another thing that would be extremely useful is if your bot system would add the diff, user account, or article page of the spam revert that is done with the linksearch. Or maybe just log the wiki article names where the link is found. The reason is I'm watching this avalanche spammer closely and if someone else does the revert on an article that I'm not watching then I miss it. This guy is one spam away from blacklisting which is why I want to catch him in the act.

<p>It seems like you removed the specific part of an ebay link leaving an amazon link intact. I don't understand "(Removed extraneous links as per WP:EL using AWB)". I <i>think</i> maybe what you were doing was chopping a second link for the same thing in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> section. I originally included both because I didn't want to favor one commercial website over another. I don't see clearly the particular relevance of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> that made you edit this way.

<p>Dear Betacommand, I strongly believe Wikipedia should make an exception and allow the Touregypt web link here [http://touregypt.net/featurestories/shepseskaf.htm] on king <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepseskaf.html" title="Shepseskaf">Shepseskaf</a> to appear.

<p>I had a link in my personal information page that was deleted by yourself. I understand the need for keeping articles "clean" from links that are not of a direct nature to the topic. This was a link on my personal information page that was very valid, and pointing to something that people who are interested in finding out more about the subjects to which I contribute can find out more information.</p>
<p>It just happens to be on a MySpace blog.</p>
<p>Is there somewhere to appeal policies such as this one, or do the reviewers have Carte Blanche to make the corrections without recourse because the correction made falls within "the policies"? Who reviews these policies? Like I said, I understand about not putting links to "social networking" websites in the topics, but why not on the personal information pages as well?</p>

<p>Dear Betacommand, I notice today that you did not bother to respond--<b>and justify</b>--to your own WikiMedia blacklist discussion regarding TourEgypt.net here.<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist#touregypt.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist#touregypt.net" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> You never informed your own official Wikipedia editors on <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptology.html" title="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> such as Thanatosimi<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Thanatosimii" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Thanatosimii" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, Captmondo<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Captmondo" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Captmondo" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> or Llywrich that you were about to blacklist TourEgypt.net even though they have carried the burden of wikiproofing Egyptology on Wikipedia. The impression I have of you is someone who doesn't value or care about archaeology or our world's ancient history like so many members of the Egyptological Wikipedia community do. You never commented on the fact that TourEgypt.net was contracted by the Egyptian government to run the Egyptian Department of Antiquities and Tourism web pages in the past. TourEgypt is not a spammer who uses Wikipedia to sell their wares when any search on Google can turn up an Egypt-related article by this firm. You just decided suddenly to ban this invaluable web site WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING OR DISCUSSION and undermine the efforts of good people like Thanataosmi, Llywrych and Captmondo whose article on king <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmose_I_3a5d.html" title="Ahmose I">Ahmose I</a>, the founder of Egypt's New Kingdom, was so good in terms of quality, that it was featured ond day on the front pages of Wikipedia this January or February. When there is an attempt to remove an article on Wikipedia, a talk forum is first created so that contributors can weigh the pros or cons of removing a particular article <i>but you did not try to do this</i>.</p>
<p><b>How can you be so crass and insensitive towards people who have worked to improve Egyptological articles on Wikipedia for years--especially when they are your own Wikipedia editors.</b> Is it your goal to undermine the reliability of Wikipedia more than the editors of Encyclopaedia Brittanica who despise us? Because if that is your goal, you are close to achieving it by angering so many people who care about Ancient Egypt and Ancient history on Wikipedia with your <b>arbitary</b> decision here.

The real problem is that you ARBITRARILY removed a site without prior discussion or made any attempt to hear the views of your own Wikipedia editors (or contributors) who care about ancient Egypt.</b> I include this excerpt from the WikiMedia discussion<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist#touregypt.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist#touregypt.net" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>:</p>
<p>"<i>Also – where is the record of this [TourEgypt.net] site being nominated for blacklisting? 86.147.114.128 16:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</i> There isn't one. Suggesting that a page may be spam is one thing, but what's really got Llywrch, Leoboudv, and myself irate is the fact that an administrator on IRC talked it over there without any realy wiki-discussion whatosever, and somehow the burden of proof falls on us to argue that it isn't spam. Thanatosimii This site seems to have been blocked for one reason - spamming wikipedia (which it wasn't), and now is not unblocked for another. THis strikes me as someone making a mistake and then not being able admit they were wrong. So much for this being a community. <i>86.147.114.128 22:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)"</i></p>
<p>What kind of a community is Wikipedia if you--or someone else--can basically go behind the backs of Wikipedia's own registered <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptology.html" title="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> editors and delete a major resource like TourEgypt.net. This smacks of plain elitism--the kind you expect at Brittanica, not at open Wikipedia where you discuss things OPENLY before making a final decision! You placed the onus on the rest of the Wikipedia Egyptology community to advocate for for the continued use of TourEgypt which IS just PLAIN WRONG. I'm happy that you are close to Mr. Wales and happy you are part of the Wikipedia board. But please don't put bans on certain web sites without consulting your own registered Wikipedia editors! TourEgypt has some ads but 1)they are not full or even part time spammers at all and 2) they have lots of valuable information that one cannot access anywhere else. Did you check Wikipedia's current article on <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepseskaf.html" title="Shepseskaf">Shepseskaf</a> and the one by the touregypt.net linked article! The difference is night and day; TourEgypt has pictures, graphs and a clear reliabe Bibliography. Here is the link--before it was removed.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shepseskaf&amp;diff=115455702&amp;oldid=115454159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shepseskaf&amp;diff=115455702&amp;oldid=115454159" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>The Touregypt link is clearly placed in the External links section of the article--as it should be, not hidden somewhere in the article on Shepseskaf. Basically all I'm saying is that the information on the TourEgypt site increases people's interest in Egypt's great past--on its pharaohs, pyramids, temples, mummies, etc and helps prod people to do more research and contribution into Wikipedia's articles on these topics. Is that wrong. <b>As long as the TourEgypt articles are placed in the External links section, it should be kosher</b>. I've checked the TourEgypt articles and their information is basically trustworthy unlike some articles on Wikipedia which I have had to competely rewrite and then give the footnotes. Can you please reconsider the ban on TourEgypt because you have just angered a lot of people with this totally out of the blue decision; the fact you refuse to admit that maybe the decision making process here contains serious flaws only aggravates the Wikipedia community (no pun intended!) further.

<p>Ok, so now I feel better. However, surely the stub ict-company-stub is all about listing KEY elements of companies? If you go to that stub and see all the companies listed I would say they ALL should be deleted. But does that really make sense? Surely the ict-company-stub is about companies that exist, their history and what they do. Ok, we don't need full sales pitches, I understand that, but surely key information is fine? Surely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Devices" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Devices" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Devices</a> is also the same and should be deleted or is it because they are perhaps more well known?</p>

<dd>(In response to betacommond) Well, this isn't the first time I've restored a link to an IAL site - they are nearly as a rule created by volunteers and I've very rarely seen anybody make money of an IAL so that means that most of their sites are hosted on free servers somewhere. Considering the extreme lack of content for a number of them, often the Yahoo Group will contain a large portion / most of the content available in the language. AFAIK the spirit behind the policies on spam is to counter the addition of a large number of useless links, but only the top three IALs (<a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/o/Ido.html" title="Ido">Ido</a>, and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlingua.html" title="Interlingua">Interlingua</a>) have enough content that that would ever be a problem. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMithridates_47c8.html" title="User:Mithridates">Mithridates</a> 18:29, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's completely inappropriate to remove cites and links like that with a bot, and would be even if that section of RS were policy. Even the firmest policy is meant to be applied in the hands of humans, not bots. For example, the article <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hessian_matrix.html" title="Hessian matrix">Hessian matrix</a> (a classical mathematics topic) is completely unsourced, so blind application of verifiability policy would say to delete the article or remove most of the assertions in it. Yet that would clearly be nuts. The RS guideline about Usenet posts (and indeed most of the RS guideline and even the verifiability/attribution policy) is to say what to do when there is an issue that someone is contesting on some type of considered grounds. E.g., Usenet posts (unless cited by reliable secondary sources, which does sometimes happen) aren't suitable for advancing contentious claims. That happens the most in areas like politics and history. In areas like mathematics, there's less contentiousness and more implicit consensus: any edit to a math article will be usually reviewed by people who know the subject, so if they leave it alone you should generally assume that it's valid by consensus, unless you have reason to think otherwise. Explaining a questioned edit as "See (policy cite)" is not enough, especially when automated edits are involved. Each edit has to be the result of considered editorial judgement or consensus, and not the mechanical application of policy. 64.160.39.153 21:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could you please stop being so abrupt with users. I have no view about whether ADERANT was speedyable or not, but your tone with Nelson Ricardo above is in my view uncivil. Likewise your automated removals of many Usenet links (some legitimate, some probably not) gave reason to believe you weren't actually looking at them. I'm glad to see you're self-reverting some of the removals. I won't get into some semantic quibble about whether VP is a bot or not but I think it would be better for everyone involved if you were to lay off these automatic tools for a while. Removing spam is certainly a good and desirable thing and all editing results in mistakes once in a while, but your accuracy with this big automated batch was so poor, that I think each removal you did that you don't revert yourself should be reviewed by someone else. I'd urge you to do any further removals in the near future by hand, with an edit summary for each one written specifically to explain the reason for that edit, not a boilerplate summary pasted from one edit to the next. 64.160.39.153 19:50, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough. I was reacting to the "get you no where" comment, and several others higher up the page that are even more uncivil, but don't actually relate to the ADERANT case.

<dd>PS: I'm not bashing Betacommand or raising some kind of "Betacommand is being a bad admin, so call out the lynch mob" alarm. Just to be clear on that.

<p>Wikipedia is a human-edited encyclopedia with a few functions occasionally delegated to maintenance bots. While there's a lot of crappy links and sourcing in the encyclopedia that should undoubtedly be cleaned up, each and every one of them is a matter of editorial judgement. You are doing massive amounts of editing with some kind of automated script or bot, that is apparently not applying any judgement to the individual edits. Numerous people are asking you in various ways to stop this. PLEASE STOP. I'm about to file an incident report at ANI about this. 64.160.39.153 19:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Betacommand. Your 17:12, 21 March 2007 edit to the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_folk_dancing.html" title="Israeli folk dancing">Israeli folk dancing</a> article raised an issue or two for me that I don't think I've seen mentioned by others discussing your recent "bot removals"; I'd like to discuss them. However, being so new to WP editing, I first have a preliminary question.</p>
<p>I learned of your edit when I saw on my watchlist the entry for a <i>subsequent</i> edit (00:40, 22 March 2007 Arichnad) to that same article. Even though my watchlist is set to show all edits, I don't see an entry there for your edit. Is that because Arichnad "undid" your edit, or was your edit done in such a way that it doesn't show on my watchlist?</p>

<dd>I have to agree with Ehheh, here. If, when all is said and done, your removals turn out to be 85% useful, and 15% vandalism, you'll be considered a vandal. You can't just go around deleting useful article content and use the fact that you also delete useless content as an excuse. You really do need to be responsible for each and every one of your edits. This isn't an emergency where the encyclopedia will break down if you don't so something right now and damn the consequences. You can afford to take the time to look carefully; and, if in doubt <i>don't</i> delete.. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:53, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! I see you have been removing a lot of links to newsgroups from articles. While <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says that newsgroup posts shouldn't be used as <i>sources</i> for referencing article content, in many cases they are appropriate in an external link section, directing readers to more information about a subject, for example on computing topics like <a href="../../../j/s/o/JSON_0ecd.html" title="JSON">JSON</a>. I do not believe that this is in conflict with the rule in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that says newsgroups can't be used as sources, since here it is not used as a source.</p>
<p>Also, I note that you are using the same edit summary for all your link removals ("removing inappropriate link per WP:EL, WP:SPAM, WP:RS, and WP:NOT") even in cases where those policies do not apply - e.g. links to newsgroups are not in violation of WP:SPAM. Please consider using more informative edit summaries, to specify which part of policy is applicable in each case. For example, an informative edit summary would be "removing link to commercial site", "removing this reference as ... is not considered a reliable source per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>", etc.</p>
<p>It appears that many users have been questioning your link removals lately. Maybe you should consider stopping removing these links until all the issues raised have been settled? <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandoman_6a71.html" title="User:Gandoman">Gandoman</a> 16:04, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My fault on mistaking it for a news group. However, I still believe that this is a relevant link, since it offers more information on the topic, does not sell merchandise, and does not require registration to read the messages on the group. The same applies to the "Lojban word-a-day group" you removed from the <a href="../../../l/o/j/Lojban.html" title="Lojban">Lojban</a> article. These are not used as sources, but as links to offer more information on a topic. Please note that I agree with some of your link removals, such as in <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cycle_polo.html" title="Cycle polo">Cycle polo</a> where you removed a dead link, but I do think that clearer edit summaries (e.g. "removing dead link") would help, instead of using the same policy listing for all cases. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandoman_6a71.html" title="User:Gandoman">Gandoman</a> 16:28, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to question why my link was removed and labeled as "spam". I created the Ultimate Jillian Barberie Club as a fan club on yahoo 6 years ago. I am the current owner of the group and the site along with the LiveJournal group has been linked on wikipedia for quite some time. I would like to please have an explanation for the removal, as I question why a fan club cannot have a link on wikipedia as it provides information about Jillian Reynolds' career such as news and a community based message board which is moderated.</p>

<p>I have to admit, your threat of blocking anyone for removing the notability tag was a serious provocation. In the future, please familiarize yourself with the issue before issuing such a threat and thereby risking an accusation of abuse of admin powers. The tag is frivolous and a clear attempt at edit-warring by certain editors. I'm not going to feed some kind of wheel-war by defying your threat. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 12:56, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A reasonable suggestion, but at least wait to see how this turns out.

<dd>Ah, the emollient Kelly Martin; I wonder why she fell out of favour with so many editors and admins? Could it have been uncalled-for waspishness coupled with ludicrous over-dramatisation? No, couldn't be. Probably just a lot of drama queens branding her "Satan".</dd>

<p>Hi Betacommand,</p>
<p>Why did you speedy delete <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Martin_8e82.html" title="Larry Martin">Larry Martin</a>? The article clearly stated his importance or notability (curator of the Natural History Museum); he's a published paleontologist, as stated in the article, and the external links provided easy verification. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28academics%29_2568.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a> states: "If an academic/professor meets any one of the following conditions, as substantiated through reliable sources, they are definitely notable. If an academic/professor meets none of these conditions, they may still be notable, and the merits of an article on the academic/professor will depend largely on attributability.</p>
<p>The person is regarded as a significant expert in his or her area by independent sources. The person is regarded as an important figure by independent academics in the same field. The person has published a significant and well-known academic work. An academic work may be significant or well known if, for example, it is the basis for a textbook or course, if it is itself the subject of multiple, independent works, if it is widely cited by other authors in the academic literature[1]. The person's collective body of work is significant and well-known. The person is known for originating an important new concept, theory or idea which is the subject of multiple, independent, non-trivial reviews or studies in works meeting our standards for reliable sources. The person has received a notable award or honor, or has been often nominated for them. "</p>

<dd>AnonEMouse is partially correct. It popped up as a new page on my watchlist, taking a quick glance at the article the only hint of notability that I saw was "curator of the Natural History Museum and Biodiversity Research Center at the University of Kansas", this doesn't show importance a college museum curator? so I when a head and re-deleted the page assuming it was the same thing I deleted before. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 20:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>This concerns your repeated speedy deletion of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Ludwig_03a8.html" title="Allan Ludwig">Allan Ludwig</a>. You deleted this article as lacking an assertion of notability but the article did contain an assertion that this was an artist of national reputation and at least some references were provided. Moreover, the article was created by a new contributor only this morning. In response to the speedy nomination, the creator placed a hang-on tag, indicating that he would expand the article later today, but you deleted it again without giving him a chance to do so. You also deleted the creator's inquiry about the reason for deletion from your talkpage and responded on his page with just a one-sentence quotation from the deletion policy. I would urge that you consider restoring this article to give the creator a couple of days to finish it before making the final deletion decision. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 18:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
