Betty Kane as Bat-Girl</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The original <b><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batgirl.html" title="Batgirl">Bat-Girl</a></b> was <b>Betty Kane</b> (first appearance: <i>Batman</i> #139, 1961), the niece of Kathy Kane, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batwoman.html" title="Batwoman">Batwoman</a>.</p>
<p>Batwoman and Bat-Girl were created to be romantic interests for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a>, respectively, as well as wannabe crime-fighting associates. Bat-Girl wore a red-and-green costume to "flatter" Robin. Bat-Girl appeared seven times between 1961 and 1964, but then disappeared in 1964 (along with Batwoman, <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_the_Bat-Hound_2c16.html" title="Ace the Bat-Hound">Ace the Bat-Hound</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat-Mite_ab72.html" title="Bat-Mite">Bat-Mite</a>) when new Batman editor <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Schwartz_95ec.html" title="Julius Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a> decided she and other characters were too silly. It has been suggested by scholars that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and Bat-Girl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html#Homosexual_interpretations" title="Batman">allegations of homosexuality</a> in <i>Batman</i> comics; specifically, the enduring claim that Batman and Robin were <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexuals</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Batwoman and Bat-Girl were later revived in the late 1970s. Bat-Girl became a member of the Teen Titans West. However, she only appeared four times in this era.</p>
<p><a name="Post-Crisis" id="Post-Crisis"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Kane_7f88.html" title="Edit section: Post-Crisis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Crisis</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-Crisis_b03f.html" title="Post-Crisis">Post-Crisis</a> <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a>, the character known as Batwoman was erased from existence (although her alter ego, Kathy Kane, is still murdered as Batwoman was); Batwoman's niece, Betty Kane, disappeared as well. Unlike her aunt, Betty's removal from history would not last long.</p>
<p>For a brief moment in the 1970s, Betty had joined the west coast version of the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titans_%28comics%29.html" title="Titans (comics)">Teen Titans</a> under her Bat-Girl moniker. Though 'Bat-Girl' did not exist, her team did; therefore, a new version of the character was necessary. In the <i>Teen Titans Secret Files and Origins Annual,</i> the official post-crisis history of Titans West was revealed. Instead of Betty Kane's Bat-Girl, fans were introduced to a similar character: <b>Mary Elizabeth "Bette" Kane</b>, aka <b>Flamebird</b>.</p>
<p>Bette was now a very driven and somewhat spoiled <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> debutante who achieved professional-level proficiency at tennis at an early age. After witnessing the dashing young Robin on the news, Bette vowed that she would gain his attention and favor by becoming a masked adventurer herself. Training to Olympic-levels in gymnastics and some martial arts, she created the identity of Flamebird (and a costume that resembled her Pre-Crisis Bat-Girl identity) and joined Titans West in hopes of catching Robin's eye. While flattered, the driven young hero was not sure how to deal with her obsession and avoided her, much to her dismay.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After briefly giving up her heroic persona, Bette found that neither winning tennis tournaments nor achieving perfect grades in school matched the rooftop thrills of the hero biz. She attempted several times to reunite the Titans West team, most notably after a journey into the afterlife with <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawk_and_Dove_d17a.html" title="Hawk and Dove">Hawk and Dove</a> II, but was unsuccessful. Dove II (always perceptive about such things) noted that Bette was essentially a very lonely person, basically desperate for company and contact with others. Bette again gave up her obsession with the Titans until malfunctioning former Titan <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyborg_%28comics%29.html" title="Cyborg (comics)">Victor Stone</a> collected her, along with all former Titans everywhere, in an attempt to protect his soul from the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a>. Hoping this would lead to a formal invitation to rejoin the team, Bette was crushed to learn they did not need (or want) her assistance.</p>
<p>A short time later, Gar "<a href="../../../b/e/a/Beast_Boy_e5f8.html" title="Beast Boy">Beast Boy</a>" Logan found himself alone in Los Angeles after the team neglected to ask him back. Landing himself in a bit of trouble by <a href="../../../g/e/m/Gemini_%28DC_Comics%29_b1c4.html" title="Gemini (DC Comics)">an impostor</a> framing him for various crimes, Gar asked former teammate Bette for help. Having been recently chastised for her dedication (or lack thereof) to crime-fighting by Robin (now in his adult <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightwing.html" title="Nightwing">Nightwing</a> identity), Flamebird seized the opportunity to better herself and her reputation, becoming more level-headed and boosting her crime-fighting arsenal. However, it's more than a little ironic therefor that her "adult" outfit has a LOT of similarities to Dick Graysons's current Nightwing outfit with a red tunic and gold V running across her chest.</p>
<p>After Bette helped Gar clear his name, his cousin Matt attempted one last recruitment drive for Titans West (dubbing the ill-fated team Titans L.A.). None of the recruits took the event seriously except for insane and uninvited former Titan <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlequin_%28comics%29.html" title="Harlequin (comics)">Duela Dent</a>, who crashed the party and was subdued by Bette. Content to remain a heroine on her own, Bette was unheard from until she was captured by a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_%28comics%29.html" title="Brainiac (comics)">Brainiac</a>-worshipping cult leader in <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon.html" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> and eventually rescued by <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_%28comics%29.html" title="Oracle (comics)">Oracle's</a> covert team of female operatives in <i><a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_of_Prey_%28comics%29_dc53.html" title="Birds of Prey (comics)">Birds of Prey</a></i>. She fought <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Light_%28DC_Comics_supervillain%29_dfc3.html" title="Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)">Doctor Light</a> alongside the majority of heroes who had once been members of the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titans_%28comics%29.html" title="Titans (comics)">Teen Titans</a>.</p>
<p>Flamebird appeared again in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a> #4 to fight <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy-Prime_c14b.html" title="Superboy-Prime">Superboy-Prime</a>. In this storyline, it was indicated that Flamebird had originally been the Earth-Two counterpart to Bat-Girl, and that after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Flamebird had replaced Bat-Girl on the sole remaining Earth. In issue 4 of Infinite Crisis, Flamebird, along with most of the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Society_61a5.html" title="Justice Society">Justice Society</a>, disappeared when Earth-Two was reborn.</p>
<p>In the <i><a href="../../../v/i/l/Villains_United_e689.html" title="Villains United">Villains United</a></i> special, Flamebird (and the other heroes who vanished to Earth-Two) had made it back to "New Earth" at some point after <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a></i> #6. She was among the many heroes gathered to fight off the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Metropolis_fa17.html" title="Battle of Metropolis">invasion of Metropolis</a> by <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Society_of_Super_Villains_6508.html" title="Secret Society of Super Villains">the Society</a>. <i>Teen Titans</i> #38 reveals that Flamebird briefly served on the Titans during the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Year_Later_fa46.html" title="One Year Later">year-long gap</a>.</p>

<p>Flamebird is an exceptional athlete, trained for strength and endurance. She has also trained in several forms of martial arts, with kick-boxing as her specialty.</p>
<p>Like Robin, Flamebird has a utility belt containing the following: grappling hook with line, gas grenades, gas mask, flares, flashlight, radio/transmitter, handcuffs, bird-shaped throwing blades (Bird-A-Rangs), and an emergency medical kit. She increased her arsenal by equipping her mask with lenses capable of emitting powerful bursts of blinding light, and created bird-like <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolas.html" title="Bolas">bolas</a> that can electrocute anyone tangled in them.</p>
<p>The future Batwoman presumably had all these abilities and paraphernalia; in addition, her cape was shown to attach to her costume's gloves and boots and serve as a short-range parachute/glider.</p>
