<p>Beta Command... You clearly did NOT read my notes. You simply voted as a team against a non admin. IF you had.. You would have read the UPDATE and CORRECTED link going ONLY to the article to bypass the page that was only partly similar to a DMOZ site, in that it is directory of only actual companies and not internet spam companies- but it has articles. It is NOT an advertising site. My argument wasn't for the site, it was that DMOZ not have exclusivity since it is not really open. My corrections were not read- IF you HAD checked the CORRECTED link- you would have seen that. If anyone reads this they may be more carefull to see if you are truly objective and not acting in a pack manor with other admins which will put YOU in a bad light. I am not an admin. What is your excuse for not reading the corrected link and simply closing rank to discourage users from getting a fair opionion? Wiki is meant to grow not close off to existing admins.--162.83.180.170 17:39, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you were blocked for spamming, and you did not present an apology, you presented a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a> against the admin who blocked you. Unless you were looking for a longer block, that was not wise. As is, if the block is not indefinite, then wait it out and just edit afterwards. Otherwise, I suggest an apology and appeal to the admin you attacked, and to Beta for your unfounded allegations.

<dd>Personal attacks are a bad thing and User:162.83.180.170 clearly should appologize for them. However I cheched his edits and I do not think that what he added was spam. It was a link to a directory of companies, providing described service. While the source might not have been sufficiently good for Wikipedia and its inclusion is a matter of oppinion, it was not spam. User:162.83.180.170 might have been blocked for revert waring, but per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> calling him spammer and blocking him was too strict.

<p>Wizardry Dragon, Thank you also for NOT READING. This pack mentality of admins makes you appear desperate to please the adins so you may remain part of their group. If you would have CHECKED the history and the last LINK UPDATE- you would have seen the correction went only directly to an article. As for debating the merits, it is clear you do not appreciate that Wiki itself was once criticised by existing encyclopedias for it's new approach. This was merely a non-DMOZ information site specifically on the topic. But it was improved by my updating directly to the article that was relevant, instead of leaving the viewer to go to the original index page. You still are arguing over an updated link that has no directory part of the page, and a block WAS issued without checking. Gwernol and any person so hopeful of adminiship will be a deterrent to Wiki's growth if they do not take time to read, verify what is said, and correct. The apology should be GWENRNOL's and BetaCommands, and Wizardry Dragon's to me. Because they are failing to check the updated link that would NOT have resulted in a block. The scaries thing to read is Wizardry Dragon sad comment that my protest of their error, was "a good way to increase block time". This is not a communist site where free opinion on the talk page should warrant punishment.</p>
<p>Any admin reviewing this should see the changed link, see the block was given without checking within less than what appeared to be ten seconds. The admin was POUNCING and the additional reviewers were simply repeating the error by not reading or fearing dissent. It is just ludicrous and silly to see the ignorance of facts and checking on the change made.</p>
<p>Wiki should not be a popularity contest amongst admins and wannabee admins. It should be <b>accurate</b>. In my opinion if Gwernol and the two added opionion's (who FAILED to read and follow the updated link of the last edit change) determined the entire opion of Wiki, far fewer would be here today. Wiki does not want you to alientate the attempts of others and rush to rash decisions without READING.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading Jan, and for giving an opinion that appears rational, unbiased and considerate. Especially the part where you aptly indicated the inclusion of the source was more a matter of opionion, even though you did not think it was needed. Regarding the "personal attack", I assure you it was me, a contributor who felt attacked when IN GOOD FAITH, I changed and improved the link to an article only. By not having it read, and having a BLOCK put on me, so that I could not even communicate, I take the highest offense. It was the thwarting of my ability to communicate. I have written for this complaint to be viewed on the backlog of complaints because it was so frustrating to be part of such behavior.</p>
<p>Gwernol in my opinion is like a good prosecutor, who in hurry for speed would accidently convict only a few wrong people. But on is too many. Hence the complaint stands and the tip to not go into law enforcement! LOL --162.83.180.170 14:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You deleted [[Image:Alex garden.jpg]] with the reason "speedy deletion under I7". I'm inquiring as to how the tag used in the description was a "clearly invalid fair-use tag". The only dispute, to my knowledge, was over whether it was a replaceable fair use item, not whether the tag itself was invalid. The pending deletion was disputed, yet you deleted it without discussion or justification.</p>
<p>At the very least, a note on the talk page or the disputer's talk page seems appropriate. â€” <a href="../../../c/e/e/User%7ECeejayoz_4da3.html" title="User:Ceejayoz">ceejayoz</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/e/User_talk%7ECeejayoz_e391.html" title="User talk:Ceejayoz"><font color="darkred">talk</font></a></sup> 21:37, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>CJay, this is actually an ongoing debate coming after <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> said that most fair use images should be replaced with public domain images. Beta just deleted this and several others that were tagged because of this a few days ago. If they were improperly tagged, he can undelete it for you. if it was fair use, it may help to clarify to Beta how it was a fair use image that was not replaceable.

<dd>I listed a rationale (duplicated on the talk page) after receiving <a href="../../../c/e/e/User_talk%7ECeejayoz_e391.html#Image:Alex_garden.jpg" title="User talk:Ceejayoz">the notice</a> that it could be deleted, which was apparently ignored as the image wound up speedy deleted anyways. I was under the impression that disputing the pending deletion in the manner laid out in the deletion notice would at least put it on hold until a discussion could take place. â€” <a href="../../../c/e/e/User%7ECeejayoz_4da3.html" title="User:Ceejayoz">ceejayoz</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/e/User_talk%7ECeejayoz_e391.html" title="User talk:Ceejayoz"><font color="darkred">talk</font></a></sup> 18:42, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Beta probably just missed the tag, CJay. Beta went through the entire backlog that day, so there was bound to be one or two things he missed. If you could provide a summation of the rationale here, Beta can probably have it undeleted if the rationale is reasonable.

<dd>Coolcat claims he is gathering such evidence. This whole thing just stinks, it really does. The exact same people are AfDing articles on the same subject and have brought up four of them to AfD in just over a week and then, in two cases where they were kept, launched into a deletion review. There is also the matter that <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Security_d296.html" title="Starfleet Security">Starfleet Security</a> was nominated for deletion just a few minutes after I had finished a rewrite to make it better. Almost as if they saw me doing that and then said "Lets piss him off now by AfDing after he did all that work". A fourth article was nominated for deletion <i>in the middle</i> of the debate about Starfleet Security, by the same person, almost as if it was a tactic to try and get Coolcat to say something uncivil. I'm not saying that every single person who is voting Delete is in on some kind of thing, but a blind man could see that there appears to be certain people who, for whatever reasons, are trying thier damnest to get these articles off of Wikipedia. I have to wonder, I have to ask: are they doing this because they don't like the articles or are they doing this becuase they don't like the editors involoved with them. After all, no talk page discussions on user Pages, indeed comments seem to be heavily sarcastic, calling articles "crap", edits "hogwash", and making statements that the sources provided are either distorted or flat out untrue. You, yourself, are throwing things in like telling me to go visit an unencyclopedic website after I indicated I would like to start working on a new article. Why would you say that? As well as childish comments on the JAG AfD page when Coolcat and I are trying to explain ourselves and make these articles better? And, yes, we've had some personal attacks with me being called "contempable"; I am waiting to see if more name calling does not occur. Something stinks here and I don't like it.

<dd>I understand your desire to avoid original research, however you know how it goes, you have to start the ball rolling before you have an article that is acceptable - the articles that people call "stubs". While I think it may have been best for Beta to abstain from articles where he has strong personal feelings, as I feel this is a conflict of interest situation, I also don't see any lasting harm coming to Wikipedia from two articles staying, out of 1,500,000+. A couple extra pages really isn't going to hurt that much. I believe it is probably much more useful to point out where the problems are to the editors working on the article than it is to simply delete it. This satisfies both parties - you will have an article with no original research, and they will not have their article deleted. I think that would be the best outcome in this matter.

<p>Beta Command... You clearly did NOT read my notes. You simply voted as a team against a non admin. IF you had.. You would have read the UPDATE and CORRECTED link going ONLY to the article to bypass the page that was only partly similar to a DMOZ site, in that it is directory of only actual companies and not internet spam companies- but it has articles. It is NOT an advertising site. My argument wasn't for the site, it was that DMOZ not have exclusivity since it is not really open. My corrections were not read- IF you HAD checked the CORRECTED link- you would have seen that. If anyone reads this they may be more carefull to see if you are truly objective and not acting in a pack manor with other admins which will put YOU in a bad light. I am not an admin. What is your excuse for not reading the corrected link and simply closing rank to discourage users from getting a fair opionion?

Unless you were looking for a longer block, that was not wise. As is, if the block is not indefinite, then wait it out and just edit afterwards. Otherwise, I suggest an apology and appeal to the admin you attacked, and to Beta for your unfounded allegations.

<dd>Personal attacks are a bad thing and User:162.83.180.170 clearly should appologize for them. However I cheched his edits and I do not think that what he added was spam. It was a link to a directory of companies, providing described service. While the source might not have been sufficiently good for Wikipedia and its inclusion is a matter of oppinion, it was not spam. User:162.83.180.170 might have been blocked for revert waring, but per <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> calling him spammer and blocking him was too strict.

<p>Wizardry Dragon, Thank you also for NOT READING. This pack mentality of admins makes you appear desperate to please the adins so you may remain part of their group. If you would have CHECKED the history and the last LINK UPDATE- you would have seen the correction went only directly to an article. As for debating the merits, it is clear you do not appreciate that Wiki itself was once criticised by existing encyclopedias for it's new approach. This was merely a non-DMOZ information site specifically on the topic. But it was improved by my updating directly to the article that was relevant, instead of leaving the viewer to go to the original index page. You still are arguing over an updated link that has no directory part of the page, and a block WAS issued without checking. Gwernol and any person so hopeful of adminiship will be a deterrent to Wiki's growth if they do not take time to read, verify what is said, and correct. The apology should be GWENRNOL's and BetaCommands, and Wizardry Dragon's to me. Because they are failing to check the updated link that would NOT have resulted in a block. The scaries thing to read is Wizardry Dragon sad comment that my protest of their error, was "a good way to increase block time". This is not a communist site where free opinion on the talk page should warrant punishment.</p>
<p>Any admin reviewing this should see the changed link, see the block was given without checking within less than what appeared to be ten seconds. The admin was POUNCING and the additional reviewers were simply repeating the error by not reading or fearing dissent. It is just ludicrous and silly to see the ignorance of facts and checking on the change made.</p>
<p>Wiki should not be a popularity contest amongst admins and wannabee admins. It should be <b>accurate</b>. In my opinion if Gwernol and the two added opionion's (who FAILED to read and follow the updated link of the last edit change) determined the entire opion of Wiki, far fewer would be here today. Wiki does not want you to alientate the attempts of others and rush to rash decisions without READING.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading Jan, and for giving an opinion that appears rational, unbiased and considerate. Especially the part where you aptly indicated the inclusion of the source was more a matter of opionion, even though you did not think it was needed. Regarding the "personal attack", I assure you it was me, a contributor who felt attacked when IN GOOD FAITH, I changed and improved the link to an article only. By not having it read, and having a BLOCK put on me, so that I could not even communicate, I take the highest offense. It was the thwarting of my ability to communicate. I have written for this complaint to be viewed on the backlog of complaints because it was so frustrating to be part of such behavior.</p>
<p>Gwernol in my opinion is like a good prosecutor, who in hurry for speed would accidently convict only a few wrong people. But on is too many. Hence the complaint stands and the tip to not go into law enforcement! LOL --162.83.180.170 14:01, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You deleted [[Image:Alex garden.jpg]] with the reason "speedy deletion under I7". I'm inquiring as to how the tag used in the description was a "clearly invalid fair-use tag". The only dispute, to my knowledge, was over whether it was a replaceable fair use item, not whether the tag itself was invalid. The pending deletion was disputed, yet you deleted it without discussion or justification.</p>
<p>At the very least, a note on the talk page or the disputer's talk page seems appropriate. â€” <a href="../../../c/e/e/User%7ECeejayoz_4da3.html" title="User:Ceejayoz">ceejayoz</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/e/User_talk%7ECeejayoz_e391.html" title="User talk:Ceejayoz"><font color="darkred">talk</font></a></sup> 21:37, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CJay, this is actually an ongoing debate coming after <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> said that most fair use images should be replaced with public domain images. Beta just deleted this and several others that were tagged because of this a few days ago. If they were improperly tagged, he can undelete it for you. if it was fair use, it may help to clarify to Beta how it was a fair use image that was not replaceable.

<dd>Beta probably just missed the tag, CJay. Beta went through the entire backlog that day, so there was bound to be one or two things he missed. If you could provide a summation of the rationale here, Beta can probably have it undeleted if the rationale is reasonable.

<dd>Coolcat claims he is gathering such evidence. This whole thing just stinks, it really does. The exact same people are AfDing articles on the same subject and have brought up four of them to AfD in just over a week and then, in two cases where they were kept, launched into a deletion review. There is also the matter that <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Security_d296.html" title="Starfleet Security">Starfleet Security</a> was nominated for deletion just a few minutes after I had finished a rewrite to make it better. Almost as if they saw me doing that and then said "Lets piss him off now by AfDing after he did all that work". A fourth article was nominated for deletion <i>in the middle</i> of the debate about Starfleet Security, by the same person, almost as if it was a tactic to try and get Coolcat to say something uncivil. I'm not saying that every single person who is voting Delete is in on some kind of thing, but a blind man could see that there appears to be certain people who, for whatever reasons, are trying thier damnest to get these articles off of Wikipedia. I have to wonder, I have to ask: are they doing this because they don't like the articles or are they doing this becuase they don't like the editors involoved with them. After all, no talk page discussions on user Pages, indeed comments seem to be heavily sarcastic, calling articles "crap", edits "hogwash", and making statements that the sources provided are either distorted or flat out untrue. You, yourself, are throwing things in like telling me to go visit an unencyclopedic website after I indicated I would like to start working on a new article. Why would you say that? As well as childish comments on the JAG AfD page when Coolcat and I are trying to explain ourselves and make these articles better? And, yes, we've had some personal attacks with me being called "contempable"; I am waiting to see if more name calling does not occur. Something stinks here and I don't like it.

<p>Let me know as soon as your bot has finished replacing CopyrightFreeUse. I'm going to delete that template and remove any references to it in the pedia. It looks like we're close - only about 1000+ to go! Thanks for your work on this. I'm determined to get the licensing template situation cleaned up.

Hey Betacommand, were you still planning on finishing the template switch? It looks like there are less than 1,000 left.

<dd>"The primary contributor has no understanding of what constitutes original research"- rather insulting since we bent over backwords to find an established outside source to add it to the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_in_Star_Trek_ac9b.html" title="Law in Star Trek">Law in Star Trek</a> article.

<dd>It's not about finding an "established outside source", it's about <b>not filling in the gaps</b>.

<dd>If a person is not "allowed" to write an article before they find a referenece, then why have stubs? In the above case, we found a reference, its in the article and the article is now sourced. The AfD is over, people should just let this go. Beta thanks again for letting us use your talk page. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 15:16, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I understand your desire to avoid original research, however you know how it goes, you have to start the ball rolling before you have an article that is acceptable - the articles that people call "stubs". While I think it may have been best for Beta to abstain from articles where he has strong personal feelings, as I feel this is a conflict of interest situation, I also don't see any lasting harm coming to Wikipedia from two articles staying, out of 1,500,000+. A couple extra pages really isn't going to hurt that much. I believe it is probably much more useful to point out where the problems are to the editors working on the article than it is to simply delete it. This satisfies both parties - you will have an article with no original research, and they will not have their article deleted. I think that would be the best outcome in this matter.

<p>Hello.. I found your name from the requests for Bots page, I would like to put the WikiProject tag to a number of categories, most probably nearly all the articles listed under Cat:Turkey and its subcategories, minus a few. How does that work? Do I use the bot myself after filling some sort of form or does someone have to it for me, and if so how will it happen? I tried especially to put a WPTR tag on provinces, cities, history but there were simply too many!&#160;:) Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 18:27, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm (manually! no spamming!&#160;:-P ) contacting the bot operators and admins who commented on the bot's RFA to find out what their position would be to running the bot obeying the new <a href="../../../n/o/b/Template%7ENobots_fa26.html" title="Template:Nobots">nobots template</a> but not using opt-in. Would this be acceptable to you or not? I think the nobots template is a great idea and I wish it had been introduced years ago and was more widespread. The only problem I can see running the bot this way is that there's going to be a whole lot of people out there who haven't heard of the nobots template and a few of those more violently opposed to bots adding a message to their tlak page will doubtless get irate just like last time.

<p>Hi, there. I must admit I'm a tad concerned over your block of Irpen. I'm normally not one to wikilawyer, but while his comments were inappropriate on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>, he wasn't given any warning (nor a block message after the block), so I think it might be a good idea to bring this up on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> as it seems to be a controversial block. Thanks. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 00:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Endorse Cowman's concern. Are you planning to leave Irpen a block message any time soon? <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 00:02, 22 December 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I think this whole thing is quickly blowing up a lot more than it has to, and I feel responsible. Could someone leave a block message on his page, and let him cool down for however long the block is? I would myself, but I fear that'd just escalate the situation. I think the whole matter, at this point, could use some disengagement and cooling down.

<dd>Thanks for your input, Cowman, and I won't if it's inappropriate, but the thing is, nobody knows about this block except people who happened to see the note on WP:PAIN--Betacommand hasn't posted the block anywhere, which is exactly the trouble. How do you figure I'm involved with Irpen? I don't know him. Do you mean I'm involved because I've posted on <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a>, in the same thread as he did?

<dd>I think he drew that implication from the statement <i>"I'll take a shot, Piotrus"</i>. I'm not saying it's correct, but I think that's where they got it. Can we just try to calm down a bit, all of us? All of this started over what I suppose was an overreaction on my part - let's not continue it with further overreactions, okay?

<dd>"Take a shot" at reviewing the warning of Ghirlandajo, yes. I didn't see that as anything to do with Irpen. And Cowman talks about "the past". Cowman, you were the one I asked, I'd appreciate an answer. Peter, frankly, to me you're the only one here that doesn't seem calm. What exactly is it you're urging us to do/not do?

I don't believe that such comments warranted a block, especially without warning, but I do agree his comments were unnecessarily inflammatory as he seemed to put too much emphasis, in my opinion, explaining how he believed the user who issued the warning to Ghirlandajo was inexperienced and foolish, while this matter could have gone so much more smoothly if it was simply mentioned that he believed such a warning was inappropriate without all the comments about user behavior. This is really being blown out of proportion. <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 00:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I feel a block in this case is definitely a knife's edge borderline case. I would have felt a lot more comfortable with it, however, if there was at least a warning on their talk page. As this was not the case, I noted the block on the PAIN report. I dont want this blown out proportion any more than it has, so if they request an unblock and are not going to bother me or further aggrivate PAIN, I'm okay with it.

<p>I agree with Cowman that Irpen's criticism of IRC was misplaced and unnecessary inflammatory. I also agree with Bishonen and Cowman that the matter does not warrant a block.

<dd>I think he knows that he's been blocked by now, Heligoland. It would have been good if Betacommand had given specific reasons and preferably some example of a personal attackâ€”this both for the information of the user, and to make the block reviewable by other admins without fumbling in the dark. Anyway, I've posted a request for review on WP:ANI. Not an "overreaction" to a 48-hour hit-and-run block for unspecified personal attacks, in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:04, 22 December 2006 (UTC).

<dd>The user now being unblocked, I don't see there being any positive outcome from dragging the issue on further. He was (in our conjecture) blocked over, as Bryant put it, "sustained attacks on the integrity of Peter". I'm not complaining any further. I don't have an issue. I just want this done with.

<dd>Desysopping is grossly excessive. There's no evidence that Betacommand acted in anything other than good faith in blocking a user he believed was being uncivil towards another user. I'm a regular on IRC and all the admins I know won't block just because a friend asks them for a block, they are always conscious about following the rules, whether it be warnings for vandalism, warnings for spam or ensuring there is truth to any allegation made of any other user. If a totally unknown user posted a complaint about Irpen on IRC or on Wikipedia and Betacommand was about, I know Betacommand would act in the same manner. I also think the block was justified but can accept that a lack of prior warnings over Irpens conduct is a concern here. --<font color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><b>Heligoland</b></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><b>Talk</b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><b>Contribs</b></a></font> 08:31, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry for not placing a notice, but not sorry for the block? Recalcitrance, lack of conferring with others, deciding "there is zero tolerance" and then, and here's the sneaky part, deciding that a personal attack has taken place, and all without any conferring with anyone! Amazingly bad behavior, there. That you then went offline and only explained anything, to anyone, here, on your own talk page, a day later only makes the offense worse. How about this: there is zero tolerance for unilateralism. Confer, confer, confer, and do it on Wikipedia. Go to AN/I and ask. Go to AN/I and announce (second choice) as you explain. By all means, though, <i>seek resolution long before you reach for the block button.</i> Warn. Plead. Wheedle, if necessary. Count to ten. Count to a hundred. While you count, ask other people what they think. Doing none of those is abusive. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:18, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

And that another disadvantage of IRC is the impossibility of anyone else going back and reviewing the record, then attaching to it clarifications like this?

<p>Hello I am currently having a problem with a Vandal I believe to be RevolverOcelotX. He deleted my attempts at a check user on a Apocalyptic Destroyer.

I will appreciate an enlightenment. Thank you. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinay06_eb44.html" title="User:Pinay06">Pinay</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/n/User_talk%7EPinay06_208f.html" title="User talk:Pinay06">talk</a>â€¢<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pinay06_4662.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pinay06">email</a>) 07:28, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had a similar problem as well. I downloaded Vandalproof, but when I pressed on the verify button it told me that I wasn't on the list. I think that I have a dynamic IP, might that be the reason?

<p>Hey Betacommand, were you planning on finishing the template migration from CopyrightedFreeUse to PD-release? If you don't have time to finish it, I can repost the request for another bot to pick up. It looks like there are only about 1000 transclusions left to switch, then we can finally delete that template (which people are still inexplicably adding on a daily basis, even though it says <i>in the template</i> that it's deprecated). <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 06:47, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey there. A user put a "this reads like an advertisement" tag on a page I wrote, and doesn't seem to want to discuss the issue or remove the tag, and I don't know how to go about removing it without someone else's help. I don't know too much about this stuff, but I'm pretty sure I can't remove a tag from a page I wrote. Discussion at the Electric Mirror talk page. Any help would be appreciated! thanks <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquidge37_0a09.html" title="User:Squidge37">Squidge37</a> 01:35, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
