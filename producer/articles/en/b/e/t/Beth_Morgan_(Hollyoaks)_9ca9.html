<p>Beth arrived in Hollyoaks as part of the Morgan family and is the sister of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Morgan_%28Hollyoaks%29_6113.html" title="Adam Morgan (Hollyoaks)">Adam</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Morgan_a429.html" title="Luke Morgan">Luke</a>. She caused a stir in the village after receiving male attention from <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Richardson_%28Hollyoaks%29_cebd.html" title="Lewis Richardson (Hollyoaks)">Lewis Richardson</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Hutchinson_bcac.html" title="Tony Hutchinson">Tony Hutchinson</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rory_Finnigan_247b.html" title="Rory Finnigan">Rory Finnigan</a>. Beth had an unlucky love life when she started dating Lewis, which lasted a month, after Lewis realised that Beth was too young for him and split up with her.</p>
<p>Beth then picked another wrong guy, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Hawthorne_%28Hollyoaks%29_e094.html" title="Rob Hawthorne (Hollyoaks)">Rob Hawthorne</a>. But Beth’s father, Andy, got warnings about Rob and forbid Beth from seeing him. Beth soon overheard <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_Benson_8a70.html" title="Lucy Benson">Lucy Benson</a> arguing with Rob about what he had done to Lucy’s family, and Beth broke up with him. Beth then found out about her brother, Luke's, rape so she went went on holiday to <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> with and Luke her mother, Sue. Beth decided not to return after meeting a guy who she got engaged to, called Pierre.</p>
<p>After more than two years, Beth returned from <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> after splitting from her fiancé Pierre. Beth was featured in Hollyoaks video <b>Hollyoaks: Indecent Behaviour</b>, where Beth was raped by footballer <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Anderson_%28Hollyoaks%29_5da8.html" title="Scott Anderson (Hollyoaks)">Scott Anderson</a>. At first, Beth chose not to tell anyone, but soon confided with her brother Luke who was going off to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> for work. Luke told Beth that he could stay in Hollyoaks, but Beth insisted that she could cope. Beth enlisted the help of journalist Alyson to help her incriminate Scott for her rape.</p>
<p>After going to the press with her story, Beth had no choice but to break the news to her parents. It was the last thing Andy and Sue needed, but they said they would stand by Beth. Beth’s case finally got to court, and after a tense day, Scott was found not guilty of rape after the judge learned that Beth had coaching for her trial. Scott was found innocent until proven guilty, and Beth was determined to exact revenge on him,. However, a self-destructive Beth found herself turning to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam__O.B.__O%27Brien_a638.html" title="Sam &quot;O.B.&quot; O'Brien">Sam "O.B." O'Brien</a> for support, but they ended up sleeping together. The morning after, Beth told OB that she did not want him any more because she was still angry at Scott. She then decided to take matters into her own hands and visited Scott at the football training grounds. She ended up spitting at him and was arrested.</p>
<p>However, Beth’s obsession with Scott went from bad to worse, when Beth came to <a href="../../../i/z/z/Izzy_Cornwell_8bb5.html" title="Izzy Cornwell">Izzy Cornwell</a>'s rescue after she saw Izzy being physically harassed by Scott Anderson. Beth tried to scare Scott, and drove towards him, unwittingly knocking him down. Beth was arrested, charged with attempted murder, and was held in custody. The residents of the village turned against Beth for injuring Scott and ruining his chances of playing in the World Cup, whist in prison Beth was attacked by a fellow inmate. During Beth’s court case, Scott admitted to raping Beth; however, Beth was still sentenced for two months for dangerous driving and Scott was let off free again. After returning from prison, Beth found it hard to cope with life in Hollyoaks, and moved back to France with her mother and father.</p>
