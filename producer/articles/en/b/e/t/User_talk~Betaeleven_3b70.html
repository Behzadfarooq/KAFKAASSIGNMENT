<p>Here's some extra tips to help you get around in the 'pedia!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to play around with your new Wiki skills the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Sandbox</a> is for you.</li>
<li>You can sign your name using three tildes (~). If you use four, you can add a datestamp too. Five will get you the datestamp only.</li>
<li>You may want to add yourself to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_user_log_052c.html" title="Wikipedia:New user log">new user log</a>.</li>
<li>If you ever think a page or image should be deleted, please list it at the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">votes for deletion</a> page. There is also a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">votes for undeletion</a> page if you want to retrieve something that you think should not have been deleted.</li>
<li>If you're still entirely confused, or would like to get a better grasp of your wikipedia skills, and you have an <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a> client (or don't mind getting one), check out the <a href="../../../b/c/_/WP%7EBC_a86f.html" title="WP:BC">Bootcamp</a>. It's not what it sounds like, but it is fun and can help you with your editing skills.</li>
<li>If you're bored and want to find something to do, try the <i>Random page</i> button in the sidebar, or check out the <i>Open Task</i> message in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Wikipedia%7ECommunity_Portal_6a3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Community Portal">Community Portal</a>.</li>

<p>I notice you placed the otheruses template at a lot of pages concerning "rock." This is mostly unnecessary. The reason for that is that nobody is going to end up at the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%28geology%29.html" title="Rock (geology)">Rock (geology)</a> page by accident, when they're looking for another type of rock. It's not really <i>wrong</i> to have the notice there, but it's kind of useless. -<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreekee_9c28.html" title="User:Freekee">Freekee</a> 01:14, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In regards to your comments, as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“I'm not quite sure why you reverted the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truman_State_University_f9a4.html" title="Truman State University">Truman State University</a> page other than I "don't need to wiki-link every single word", which was clearly not the case. I believe the wiki-links that I added fall into the category of <a href="../../../o/n/l/Wikipedia%7EOnly_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context_c7de.html" title="Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context">links that make sense</a> and is not a case of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html#Overlinking" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">overlinking</a>. However, I do believe you were too quick to revert, and could possibly refresh yourself on <a href="../../../r/e/v/Help%7EReverting_1fd5.html#When_to_revert" title="Help:Reverting">when and when not to revert a page</a>. If you still feel that I'm wrong, please enlighten me as to why. --<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetaeleven_593e.html" title="User:Betaeleven">Betaeleven</a> 18:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)”</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>and subsequent revert, I must stand by my initial action. Linking to situated, cardinal directions, policy, alcohol, exceptions, food service, memorial, library, volumes, museum, welded, haunted, chewing gum, sidewalk, potato, rituals, superstitions, knife, midnight, grades, pregnant, garden, weddings, cellar, myth, plaque, peach tree, euphonium and trombone is certainly <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html#Overlinking" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">overlinking</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/l/Wikipedia%7EOnly_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context_c7de.html" title="Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context">does not contribute to the context</a> of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truman_State_University_f9a4.html" title="Truman State University">Truman State University</a> article. In particular, these guidelines back my case:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century.”</dd>
<dd>“In general, do not create links to: Plain English words.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Certainly the average reader should be able to understand how a superstition works, north from south, and what food service is. This is an article about a university, not a dictionary.</p>
<p>I would invite you to refresh yourself on those guidelines as well. If we're still having problems over this, I am open to asking an arbiter to sort this out. --<a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKHill-LTown_961e.html" title="User:KHill-LTown">KHill-LTown</a> 06:28, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Wes Craven was born with two nostrils, and they are still functioning well, as of last report." I just deleted that line, which seems quite "unhelpful and non-constructive" as you said.

<p>The article Porpellerhead Software that you marked for speedy deletion was then deleted within seconds or minutes. I wrote it, because I wanted it to exist, and there were already links to it.

<dd>My problem is similar to HelgeStenstrom's. You wrote, regarding the Laurence Scott page, "follow proper procedures".</dd>
<dd>But what ARE "the proper procedures" at this point? Once you policemen win a speedy delete argument, IS there ANY procedure that ANYONE can follow to create a Laurence H. Scott page, assuming evidence has been found that would satisfy you of his Wikipedia worthiness? If so, please let me know what it is.</dd>
<dd>It appears to me (and, from their talk pages, to others whose work you have deleted) that by killing an entry via Speedy Delete you make it very difficult for anyone ever to attempt to create a one in the future.</dd>
<dd>Are we missing something? Please point me to "proper procedures" for creating an entry when a previous entry of the same name has been Speedy Deleted.--<a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocJan_4ca9.html" title="User:SocJan">SocJan</a> 01:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there. I saw that you put the ribbon images in the list of awards and medals. I thought they might look better in a table than in a bulleted list -- and may make sense for other articles as well. Take a look and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Hi Betaeleven, my dictionary defines "award" as "to grant as merited or due". I think "received" makes it sound like it showed up on a UPS truck. Crandall's story on the main page at <a href="http://www.cmohs.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.cmohs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmohs.org/</a> uses "award", so I would think that's the better way to go. FWIW (not much in this case, but sometimes it can be interesting), in Google "awarded the congressional" beats "received the congressional" 54,900 to 19,200. --<a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7ECliffC_df72.html" title="User:CliffC">CliffC</a> 21:33, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You make a valid point. If you change it back to "awarded", I won't change it back. I guess, the more I think about it, I don't mind "awarded" so much. I just hate it when people say someone "won the Medal of Honor". The two MOH recipients that I've met made it very clear that it wasn't a contest. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetaeleven_593e.html" title="User:Betaeleven">Betaeleven</a> 02:17, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's no reason to delete this information. Scott was an interesting man who did interesting things &amp; had friendships w/ many interesting people. The article on Guy Davenport already links to him, since they, together, published the first edition of Ezra Pound's last separately published Canto. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 18:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Before deleting, shouldn't you examine the situation? Why did you delete this small article? Is Wikispace really that tight that a man who published Pound &amp; Davenport, who influenced many students through a teaching career at University of Michigan, who translated Propp can't be given two paragraphs? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 17:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I saw no discussion. I saw one remark from you in which I had no part although I had written the article. Please show me the discussion. Thanks.</p>
<p>Also, how does one become a deleter &amp; discusser of article's worthiness?<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 17:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I read the "log", Beta, thanks. It held a comment from you and one from Deor, who is angry w/ me for explaining the use of a comma but not agreeing w/ his insistence that the comma had been misused. There was no justification for non-notability excepting insufficient secondary sources. Considering that Propp's <i>Morphology</i> is seminal in the study of folktales &amp; fairytales in the English-speaking world, Scott is a notable figure. W/out his translation--cited all over the place--, this field would look quite different. Tell you what: Give me two weeks to slap some more citations on the article. If it has no more then than it does now, then you can delete it, and those looking into the articles about Guy Davenport or Ezra Pound (to name two) will just have to look into Laurence Scott at other sites. Whaddaya say? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 00:38, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Umm, Betaeleven, did you mean to put the message you just posted on my Talk page on James Nicol's Talk page? It seems to be addressed to him, and I doubt that he'll see it on my page. <a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeor_c4ac.html" title="User:Deor">Deor</a> 22:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Yes, Betaeleven, it is ridiculous that you set yourself up as the arbiter of what passes muster at Wikipedia. Again: Scott translated into English a very influential text. Scott published the work of several important poets &amp; writers. Scott was friends w/ some of them, and he had a long career teaching. Where is the problem w/ three paragraphs of wiki-space? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 18:26, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Beta, I did the "hangon" thing the very first time you proposed to delete it. Naturally, I continued to post it, as it bothered almost nobody, and as no one answered my question about the harm caused by giving Laurence Scott three or four paragraphs while others, who know more about him than I, supply more info. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Nicol_0b84.html" title="User:James Nicol">James Nicol</a> 21:06, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I clicked on "hangon" the first time that you threatened the article on Scott. I followed where "hangon" led me. I appreciate DGG's work on this, but the kind of puffery required to make something "notable" is rather embarrassing.

<p>In the context of the radio show, it was constructive and useful. I don't appreciate the word vandalism being used. It seems like being a "deletionist" is quite unconstructive. What does having more information in more articles on more topics hurt?67.167.248.128 22:38, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
