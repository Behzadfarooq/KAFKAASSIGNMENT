<p>I think <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">User:Violetriga</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">t</a>)'s page move of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_%28letter%29.html" title="Beth (letter)">Beth (letter)</a> to <a href="../../../%D7%91/_/_/%D7%91.html" title="ב">ב</a> was a bad idea. For one thing, it can be perceived as even more ethnocentric than IZAK's ideas, given that that's the Unicode glyph for the <i>Hebrew</i> letter, and the article is about the letter in multiple alphabets (in many of which it looks different). For another, it breaks the existing Wikipedia tradition of putting articles at their English names (<a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleph_%28letter%29.html" title="Aleph (letter)">Aleph (letter)</a>, for example), and tries to set up a new precedent of putting articles at the nearest applicable Unicode glyph. <a href="../../../e/x/c/Exclamation_mark.html" title="Exclamation mark">Exclamation mark</a> isn't located at <a href="../../../%21/_/_/%21.html" title="!">!</a>, and for good reason. Let's keep things simple. I repeat my firm conviction that to maintain symmetry, NPOV, and general nice-to-English-speakers-ness, the article on Beth (the letter) should be located at <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_%28letter%29.html" title="Beth (letter)">Beth (letter)</a>. --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 07:20, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Support</b>. This should be moved back to "<i>Beth (letter)</i>" ASAP, in keeping with English Wikipedia tradition. Calling it "<i>ב</i>" seems very POV to me. – <a href="../../../a/x/s/User%7EAxSkov_dc6f.html" title="User:AxSkov">AxSkov</a> (<small><a href="../../../a/x/s/User_talk%7EAxSkov_04ac.html" title="User talk:AxSkov">T</a></small>) <small>14:14, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I was the one who first suggested moving it to <a href="../../../%D7%91/_/_/%D7%91.html" title="ב">ב</a>, because I thought it was a good NPOV solution to the controversy over whether it should be called <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_%28letter%29.html" title="Beth (letter)">Beth (letter)</a> or <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bet_%28letter%29.html" title="Bet (letter)">Bet (letter)</a>. That said, the suggestion was sort of tongue-in-cheek; I never expected it would actually happen. And I certainly didn't expect it to happen without every other Hebrew letter <i>also</i> being moved to its symbol rather than its name! If we do move <a href="../../../%D7%91/_/_/%D7%91.html" title="ב">ב</a> to something, we'll be right back to the argument above about whether to use "Beth" (the traditional English spelling) or "Bet" (the spelling that better reflects Modern Israeli Hebrew pronunciation). If we do vote to move it somewhere, I vote for <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_%28letter%29.html" title="Beth (letter)">Beth (letter)</a>, and traditional English names for the other letters too, on the grounds that the precedent is already set for the Greek alphabet. The article on the second letter of the Greek alphabet is at <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta_%28letter%29.html" title="Beta (letter)">Beta (letter)</a>, not <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_%28letter%29.html" title="Vita (letter)">Vita (letter)</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 20:50, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Notice that the effect of that change was to replace the existing vote on a move to <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_%28letter%29.html" title="Beth (letter)">Beth (letter)</a> with a fraudulent (intentionally or not) vote on Angr's "tongue-in-cheek" proposed move to <a href="../../../%D7%91/_/_/%D7%91.html" title="ב">ב</a>. In other words, <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse">BlankVerse</a> is presumably operating on the false premise that a bunch of people <i>supported</i> Violetriga's move, when in fact the original vote <i>opposed</i> the move, preferring to move the page back to <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_%28letter%29.html" title="Beth (letter)">Beth (letter)</a>.

<p>I am going to revert the article back to an earlier stage. Stating "that is used as a living language by the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> people that live in [[Israel]" is both inaccurate (in that Hebrew is spoken outside Israel and by non-Jewish people, it is also a written language with a very long period of use and an ancient language spoken by people now called Jews) and does not have a place here which is about a letter of an alphabet. The letter Beth has been in use in Europe and worldwide for a long time before the modern state of Israel came to exist.</p>
<p>Stating that Phoenician is a dead language is also unnecessarily tendentious.</p>
<p>Please discuss any further changes here.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a> seems to be on a crusade to turn the article <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bet_%28letter%29.html" title="Bet (letter)">Bet (letter)</a> into an Israeli POV nightmare. While his latest revisions introduce some worthwhile content (the <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagesh.html" title="Dagesh">dagesh</a>, for example), it's very hard to separate the signal from the noise. I propose reverting large portions to their pre-IZAK state, and while we're at it moving the article back to <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_%28letter%29.html" title="Beth (letter)">Beth (letter)</a>, which is where it ought to be for consistency with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleph.html" title="Aleph">aleph</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heth.html" title="Heth">heth</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kaph.html" title="Kaph">kaph</a>, etc. — not to mention <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_number.html" title="Beth number">Beth number</a> and the like.

<dd>Quux: This article is not about Israel, it's about a letter in the Hebrew ALPHABET belonging to the Hebrew language which happens to be the native language of Israel, or is that something you dispute? Your reaction is very strange, to say the least. What kind of crazy thing is it to say that this article is becoming an "Israeli POV nightmare"? If this article were written about a letter in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_alphabet.html" title="Russian alphabet">Russian alphabet</a> and an editor would focus on ensuring how that letter is pronounced in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian language</a>, would that then be a "Russian POV nightmare"? Kindly tell me which <i>fact</i> in the article you disagree with and why, which would make more sense. Do you question whether <i>Bet</i> is part of the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> as the most comprehensive source for the last three thousand years? Instead of griping from the sidelines, kindly put forth actual arguments rather than projecting an air of anti-Israel POV that has nothing to do with anything. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 05:34, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Move</b> , but point Bet to the Beth article. Academic, beth is more accurate, and seems to be consistant with classical transliteration into English. Granted, most Israelis (and other Hebrew speakers) would say Bet. A smaller number of Hebrew speakers today say Beis, and only a tiny number (tends to be older Sefardim) actually say what sounds like Beth. Incidently, Beth is also incorrect, as the Th in Hebrew is a much softer sound than the english Th, which is how it became S in the Ashkenazi communities. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeage_95b6.html" title="User:Mikeage">Mikeage</a> 07:06, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's also interesting to note that the Israeli government is now reconsider their transliterations, so people will no longer see a mix of transliterations (Bene Berak vs. Bnei Brak, Avraham Lincoln, LaGardia, etc). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeage_95b6.html" title="User:Mikeage">Mikeage</a> 07:06, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

In Late Modern English, the name of the 2nd letter of the Hebrew alphabet is, as I've said numerous times, is "beth". <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 06:59, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Doops, the point is that the spelling determines the sound, and the sound and the spelling should as close as possible especially in Hebrew which is a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonology.html" title="Phonology">phonetical</a> language -- <i>unlike</i> English. So for the sake of accuaracy it makes sense that letters and sounds should be aligned and congruent to the highest degree possible to attain accuracy, and in this case it's easily done, especially for the benefit of those who don't know, and read this for the first time. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 08:28, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? No, in English spelling does not necessarily determine the sound. See (for instance) <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucester.html" title="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>. English is not a phonetic language. Hence there is no "right" or "wrong" way to transliterate into English; merely "standard" and "non-standard" ways. Standards do sometimes change; Peking is now <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> — so if you think that the standard way of transliterating Beth is bad, by all means, start a movement to get it changed.

<dd>Doops, what "reality" am I creating exactly? Start a movement? Then obviously you are not aware that Hebrew is the official language of the people of modern Israel (Jews and Arabs), and this letter is pronounced as <i>bet</i> (essentialy following the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardi.html" title="Sephardi">Sephardi</a> tradition), regardless of what you or I or the rest of the world thinks. Don't you think that this article should reflect that? Israeli Hebrew is the most widely used by most <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> outside of Israel too. To the extent that the "th" sound does not exist in Hebrew at all today! Did you know that? So the article needs to make clear if it is conveying information about an imaginary dead language (such as the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenician_languages.html" title="Phoenician languages">Phoenician languages</a>) or if it's focused on a modern-day living language. Anyone who sees <i>that</i> as some kind of "Zionist plot" should recuse themselves from input here, becaus ebeing <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a> is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 22:59, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I was unclear. We all know and respect the fact that Hebrew is a living language, and as somebody who doesn't speak Hebrew, I completely trust you when it comes to that language. But this is the English wikipedia; so we spell words here the English way. <b>And English spelling does not necessarily determine pronunciation.</b> As I've pointed out many times, we spell the city <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucester.html" title="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> even though we pronounce it Gloster. It's perfectly possible, therfore, to title the article "Beth" but pronounce it "bet." Indeed, that should be mentioned in the very first paragraph! But we should title it by the most common spelling; and for good or ill, most English-speakers spell it "beth." <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 00:10, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Doops, don't get quarky on me, but I must object to your attitude of "ignorance is bliss" approach! You may not care, but consider a new reader of Wikipedia trying to learn what the letter is and the sound it makes in Hebrew, and then is told about dead Phoenicians and archaic "Beths", like "thees and thous" in English, has the Wikipedia encyclopedia helped that person, or fuzzied up their brains with dusty arcania rather than real-world knowledge? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 05:53, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Three things: 1) I'm sorry if I was unclear again; of course I don't believe that ignorance is bliss. As somebody interested in linguistics, I'm of course always happy to learn about whether modern Hebrew is phonetic or not. But that, strictly speaking, is irrelevant to our arguments about the pronunciation of an English word; all I'm trying to point out is that, whether Hebrew is or not, <i>English</i> is not phonetic. 2) I totally agree with you that the wikipedia should aim not to confuse newcomers; indeed, one of my prime obsessions here is making articles clear and accessible. So yes, of course, information about pronunciation belongs in the intro § along with basic information about the letter's history; while of course 'dusty arcana' belong further down in the article. You're absolutely right about that. 3) This one's not an argument, just an observation: I hope that with all this argument about the title we don't lose sight of the article's purpose: although the letter <b>בּ</b> when treated as a <i>word</i> has a pronunciation ("beit", often; or "beis"; or suchlike), the letter <b>בּ</b> when treated as a <i>letter</i> is just a consonant and is pronounced like a "b" (or "v") — and isn't that the main point? <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 28 June 2005 05:30 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Doops, I appreciate the thought you are giving to this matter. This is not just about this letter, it's about the entire Hebrew alphabet as evinced through the individual articles devoted to each of the letters. They may make sense to some advanced <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">Linguistics</a> scholars (for Hebrew or whatever language to be written up in funny non-common English), but most people coming to an encyclopedia appreciate not being (overly) confused. Much I suppose depends on what we view as the "starting point" for presenting information. Wikipedia is not bound by stodgy conventions as you well know, it's constantly breaking new ground because it's a fresh <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> medium responsive to the world we live in. If one were to have an interest in Arabic, why would it matter what an Arabic letter was like a thousand years ago (a little focused historical info is fine), or how it was used in the English universities two hundred years ago and formulated (for English university "consumers") by professors of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classics.html" title="Classics">Classics</a>? It is very amusing to see some editors stand up for the "traditions" of English usage here, when at the same time they may apply modern critiques, such as the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Documentary_hypothesis.html" title="Documentary hypothesis">Documentary hypothesis</a> to attack the validity of the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and even question the timing of its Hebrew language usages in an attempt to "update" understanding of it. It seems like a true double standard: English is a "holy untouchable" while the Hebrew language (and the Hebrew Bible) can be "adjusted" and redefined (and finally distorted) at will by any new group of scholars as they see fit. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 28 June 2005 05:55 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for taking my comments seriously. (May I suggest that you should read Tomer's more seriously as well?) As you say, English is not unchangeable; it can grow and evolve. So of course we shouldn't spell the letter "beth" simply because we're in love with history and "stodgy conventions" — but we likewise shouldn't rule out "beth" in a knee-jerk reaction against anything old; that also wouldn't be fair. No, we should look at it objectively; which leaves us wondering <i>what is the main English spelling nowdays</i>? Alas, I suspect that your musings above are probably the exact <i>reverse</i> of the true situation: I would bet that many "advanced Linguistics scholars" try to show off their knowledge of modern Hebrew and spell it "bet"; while on the other hand ordinary English speakers coming to the wikipedia are more likely to have seen it spelled as "beth" — and they're the ones we're really catering to. If I understand the situation correctly, it's a simple fact that, for good or ill, "beth" is the most common spelling if we look at the whole of English-language literature. So think about it this way: for some reason we English-speakers refer to the German city of <a href="../../../k/%C3%B6/l/K%C3%B6ln.html" title="Köln">Köln</a> by its French name <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cologne.html" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>. Is this logical? Not really. But that's just the way things are. I suppose we could all make an effort to change — but is it really worth getting all worked up about? English (like most languages) can be quirky and illogical sometimes; I don't think it's necessarily our job to go around "fixing" it. (And again, even if you decide that you do want to "fix" English, that's a task for the real world, not our online wikipedia.) <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 28 June 2005 06:44 (UTC)</dd>

<li>My vote had nothing to do with how a language should/n't be pronounced, but rather what the name of the article should be.

<li>Tomer, I am not "promoting" or "demanding" anything here. I am just following common usage. What other editors should or shouldn't do is not my focus.

<li>I submit to you that the place to do this is in the articles themselves, not in their names. The pronunciation "beth" is unarguably "archaic", but "false" is nothing but your POV. As for whether or not there's anything wrong with what you're doing, it's quickly beginning to look like a violation of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>.

If you're going to insist on this as you've indicated you want to, for every letter of the álefbet, you're going to get to Taw→Tav, and then someone else is going to come along and do the same thing with the Greek alfavíta, and Tau→Tav and bleh. Why not insist on Jerusalem→Yerushalayim, Nablus→Shkhem, Nazareth→Natzrat, Bethlehem→Beit Lechem, and Bethel→Beit El (or even Beit Qel)? Where do you envision this "correction" of this "false" system ending?

<li>Tomer, there is no easy solution. Wikipedia, and the world it depicts, is not so black-and-white. Again, I cannot speak for issues outside of Hebrew, Israel, and Judaism. The fact of the matter about Wikipedia, and life, is that naming conventions alternate, there is no "absolute rule". In our case, sometimes Hebrew names are given in their Hebrew form, and sometimes in their English. For example, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabbat.html" title="Shabbat">Shabbat</a> is not listed as "Jewish Sabbath", <a href="../../../y/o/m/Yom_Kippur_c0e4.html" title="Yom Kippur">Yom Kippur</a> is not "Day of Atonement", <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a> is not "Israeli secret service", <a href="../../../k/n/e/Knesset.html" title="Knesset">Knesset</a> is not "Parliament of Israel", and see the hundreds of articles based on purely Hebrew names in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Category%7EHebrew_words_43bf.html" title="Category:Hebrew words">Category:Hebrew words</a>. Furthermore I am very suprised by your reaction/s here, because it was you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_phonology&amp;diff=12309773&amp;oldid=12155638" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebrew_phonology&amp;diff=12309773&amp;oldid=12155638" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> who contributed the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_phonology.html" title="Hebrew phonology">Hebrew phonology</a> article and you clearly say in it "בּ bet /b/" and "ב vet /v/, /b/ (among Egyptian Jews)" -- without the "th" ending. So let me ask you, why over there do you have the form as <i>bet</i> but here you cry for it to be <i>beth</i>? Using your own argument here I will say to you, "this is the 'English' Wikipedia...blah blah blah..." Let's stay focused and deal with the subject at hand, we are not sitting here as the global editors-in-chief of all Wikipedia articles, because I bet you in any case that most of the other articles about languages mostly do NOT distort and decompose the way the languages are pronounced or spoken. Maybe when Hebrew was not in common daily use as a spoken language, the arm-chair academicians of Oxford <i>et al</i> could pontificate about this-and-that, but now that Hebrew <i>is</i> a spoken language once again, it should be treated like all the other LIVING languages are treated on Wikipedia, and not share the fate of old Latin and Greek that have been picked apart by the academics over the crusty centuries, who think they know better when in fact they don't. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 22:41, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Bleh. You're still confusing the issue. I put bet/vet in Hebrew phonology because that's the way they're pronounced in MIH. You'll notice I also included /θ/ in Sefardic pronunciation of thav. That has nothing to do with the name by which the letter is known in English, namely, BETH: aleph, beth, gimmel, daleth, he, waw, zain, (c)heth, teth, yodh, ... Can you provide any relevant peer-reviewed literature in support of your POV that the English names of the Hebrew letters need to be "fixed"? I agree with your invitation: let's treat it like all the other LIVING languages on Wikipedia. This is what I've been attempting to do by pointing out to you the fact that what you're proposing, for consistency, would have to be applied to the letters of the Greek alphabet as well. Greek, in case you're unaware, is also a living language, with twice as many native speakers as Hebrew, and with far more uniform pronunciation of the names of ALL of its letters across dialects. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 22:53, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tomer, I cannot speak for the Greeks and their lingo, that's beyond my scope. But for anyone who does know and speak Hebrew today, this is an important question. I think that <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">User:Ross Burgess</a> was inconsiderate when he acted arbitrarily on his own and went ahead and planted the articles about the Hebrew letters the way <i>he</i> saw them, see his first entry for <i>Beth</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bet_%28letter%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12670353" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bet_%28letter%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12670353" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> when in fact it should have been discussed with editors familiar with Hebrew to create at least a <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synergy.html" title="Synergy">synergy</a> between the past and the present and not create the impression that Hebrew is some stodgy old academic dead language when it is in fact alive.

<li>This has long since devolved from a discussion into a session where you take potshots at the intelligence and motivations of those who happen to disagree with you. You have long since forfeited your right to complain about anyone's inconsideration or arbitrary actions on this matter. As for not being able to speak for the Greeks and their "lingo", you've completely missed the point. To wit, how the Greeks pronounce the letters of their alphabet is <i>irrelevant</i> to their names in English, in exactly the same way as the pronunciation of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet in MIH is irrelevant. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 06:59, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Tomer, if you haven't noticed, a number of very respectable editors here have agreed with me, so quit making out that I am on some "solo mission" here. I fear that the "English" you speak of is totally not the fairly common language I am talking about. You seem to not realize that you are talking about an English that is way above people's heads. But there is no escaping the fact that English can and <i>does</i> write of the letter <i>Bet</i> quite often as <i>Bet</i> particularly since we are talking of Hebrew as transliterated from modern Israel Hebrew, which many people consider to be the preferred way of pronouncing, and <b>learning</b>, the language. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 11:45, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Retain</b>. Why am I not surprised that anti-Zionists want to make Hebrew into a language of no relevance to Israel?

<ul>
<li>None of your points are even remotely relevant to this discussion. Whom are you calling anti-Zionist? Who has claimed that Hebrew is irrelevant wrt Israel? What does this have to do with Norwegian? This is not a discussion about the Hebrew pronunciation of the letter, as much as IZAK keeps trying to cast it to be, this is a discussion about what the ENGLISH name of the letter is, and following therefrom, what the name of the article should be in the ENGLISH wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 18:04, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Hebrew pronouncation of the letter is either the "b" sound or the "v" sound. The Hebrew alphabet (or rather Alef-Bet) is Hebrew; it is not English. It is relevant because the undercurrent here is that the Israeli version is discounted in favor of an academic interpretation of Hebrew as a dead language, like Latin. And the vote is split along party lines. The comparison with Norwegian is apt, because both demonstrate how individuals who are profoundly ignorant about a living language nevertheless try to establish a point of view that is completely at odds with any available facts. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 23:46, Jun 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>This dispute, incidentally, in case you're not following it very closely, Leifern, has nothing to do with the pronunciation of the letter ב, rather it is about what the name of the article describing it should be in the English Wikipedia.

<li>Tomer, some things <i>do</i> change with time, you should know that, after all many in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> movement argue that <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakhah.html" title="Halakhah">Halakhah</a> also "changes" with time, so why can't the measly <i>Beth</i> finally be seen for the <i>Bet</i> that it has now fully become? It's perfectly "kosher" to say this you know (about <i>Beth</i> --&gt; <i>Bet</i>), and there is no "mitzva" of clinging to archaic English language words.

<li>There are dialects of English spoken in the West Midlands which would beg to differ with your sweeping assertion that the third person singular indicative is now uniformly in -s rather than in -th. There are other dialects of English which do not retain /θ/ or /ð/ in <i>any</i> position (whence Maggie Thatcher's bizarre sounding "Sank you, Mr. President" speech). Apparently if you spoke such a dialect, you would regard the use of /θ/ and /ð/ as "clinging to archaic English". If your English is non-rhotic, you probably regard pronouncing the "r" in "car" as "clinging to archaic English" as well. Just because <i>your</i> English doesn't include the pronunciation of ב as "beth" doesn't mean that that pronunciation and name are archaistic. This is now nothing more than your unsupportable personal battle to change English because in your view it is "false". As Doops said, if you don't like it, start a movement to get it changed.

<li>Tomer, the sources you cite matter zero, because we are all already aware of that archaic position, what we are talking about here is the <i>other</i> more modern position, that does not require "sources" in this instance because it is based on the reality of present-day spoken Hebrew of Israel (and supported by the most common <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardi.html" title="Sephardi">Sephardi</a> usage of Hebrew), as well as the <i>fact</i> that Wikipedia is NOT a "purist repository and guardian of all things English" which is, for example, why we have English articles based on Hebrew names -- and even these do <i>not</i> end with a "th" either -- such as <a href="../../../t/z/i/Tzitzit.html" title="Tzitzit">Tzitzit</a> (and not "Fringes"), <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallit.html" title="Tallit">Tallit</a> (and not "Prayer shawl"), <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charoset.html" title="Charoset">Charoset</a> (and not "Passover paste"), <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">Kashrut</a> (and not "Dietary laws"), <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitniyot.html" title="Kitniyot">Kitniyot</a> (and not "Legumes on Passover"), <a href="../../../p/a/y/Payot.html" title="Payot">Payot</a> (and not "Sidelocks of Jews") , and on-and-on, and not just in the Judaism and Hebrew sections but all over Wikipedia whenever unique cultures and foreign languages are under the microscope it's perfectly legit on Wikipedia to use the natural unadulturated "native" terms (that are actually more accurate and helpful to the novice wanting to learn), and there is NO need to suddenly become an "English purist" because Wikipedia is NOT merely a glorious repository of English usage -- it's far, far, far more than that, and if you haven't discovered that by now, then you don't really know Wikipedia well-enough yet.

According to Pierre Swiggers, "Transmission of the "Phoenician Script to the West" in Daniels and Bright, <i>The World's Writing Systems</i> (OUP), "The deriviation of the Greek alphabet from the Phoenician script is evident from the shapes of the letters, ... Herodotus speaks of the Greek letters as "Phoenician characters", ... the word φοινικια is attested in a fifth-century inscription from Teos ... as the designation of characters." One might also add that the Phoenicians, unlike the ancient Hebrews, were a seafaring and trading people, and thus much more likely to have come into contact with the Greeks.

<p>They came from the Phoenicians perhaps, but there is no evidence that the characters were themselves an invention of the Phoenicians.

<dd>Bet is how it is pronounced in Israeli Hebrew, but the last letter Tau is given two different pronounciations by the Massoretic scholars (as for that matter is Beth itself). In a final position the Massoretic rule was to omit the daghes forte and to pronounce Tau roughly as /th/</dd>

<dd>Me too. After all this is an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> wikipedia and the usages given above are far more common in English.

<p>Francis, by now your argument is useless on <b>Wikipedia</b> which goes far beyond what happens "historically in common English" because Wikipedia also deals with the <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a> of things as they are and not just "as they were" once upon a time, or "should be" due to ignorance of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/True.html" title="True">truth</a> and denial of the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">facts</a>. Thus, for example the word "Koran" was always "historically in common English" written as "Koran" (perhaps some academic egg-heads familiar with Arabic had other versions, because Arabic is a very fluid language). "Koran", spelled "Koran", is still used that way by most people in the English speaking world, <b>but now</b> <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Koran&amp;redirect=no" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Koran&amp;redirect=no" rel="nofollow">redirects</a> to <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> on Wikipedia. Actually, the average person has never heard of and will never use "Qur'an", but it is the "official" version on Wikipedia to align it with the <b><a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a></b> (and not with English!) "Qur'an" has <i>no</i> similarity to the traditional spelling in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> of the word "<b>Koran</b>" (the two words only have a lonely final "<a href="../../../n/_/_/N.html" title="N">n</a>" in common here.) The basic question we must ask ourselves is do we want to convey the way the letter is pronounced as an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicisation.html" title="Anglicisation">Anglicisation</a> only, or do we <i>also</i> seek to give the correct information about the true sound this letter makes in its original true home within the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew language</a> as well? <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:01, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the point is this: the "original" true home of the letter is probably in Ancient Hebrew, where there appears to have been a different way of pronouncing final Tau, which has been merged in later usage, which is reflected in Israeli Hebrew. Neither is "wrong", but the usage in Israel is more modern and, until the last 200 years or so, by no means the only usage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The word Beth occurs widely in English, Bet not so, and we reflect English usage. It is right that (say) Koran is frequently written Qur'an now, but that is a widespread change in English usage not a Wikipedic alteration. The difference, in that case, is mostly in the spelling, English spoken usage (at least where I live) is to pronounce the two spellings the same. Very few English speakers can manage ejectives or glottalised stops (if that is how Qoph is pronounced, I'm not sure how modern Arabic renders it). The Beth/Bet dichotomy reflects a difference in pronounciation. I am unhappy with an entry title that is different from widespread English usage (very few non-Jews use /bet/) and from all historical European and Ancient Near-Eastern usages. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 08:32, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IZAK, it's actually just "some" Sefardim who say "bet". Prior to the advent of MIH, the most common pronunciation among Sefardim was beth, not bet. Since it was primarily used only liturgically, although this is not so widespread anymore since the growth of Hebrew as a vernacular, in which tav and thav are no longer distinguished in the pronunciation of most speakers. The use of "beth" is not restricted to just a few pedantic academicians, incidentally. That said, I'd prefer that you diminish your tone, which is beginning to sound insulting, at least to me, since I say "beth" not infrequently, and don't generally consider myself a pedantic academician.

<p>I'm sorry to let you down here, IZAK, but I think the original version was better than your version. It also matches all the other Hebrew letter articles, so the issue (if it exists) is much more widespread.

<p>Thanks for the feed-back guys, but my intention was to start with "Beth" and then work on the other letters, which I still hope to do. The question of <i>beth</i> vs. <i>bet</i> depends on whether the goal is to convey the letter as it's used in the actual Hebrew language or how it "developed" according to the academics. How are the letters of other languages treated on Wikipedia by the way? Do they also focus on long-defunct forms, or is it the common (modern) usage that counts. And how did an article about the Hebrew language get lumped with "<a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenician.html" title="Phoenician">Phoenician</a>"? This discussion will probably unfold in good time.

<dd>"Beth" is regarded as the "purest" original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter (notice: not beta). Why? Because that's how it was pronounced in Hebrew the good old days. I see your point, but perhaps this is something that should be brought up at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Linguistics_3f25.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Linguistics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Linguistics</a>, or more specifically at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Writing_systems_a400.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Writing systems">Wikipedia:WikiProject Writing systems</a>, as I'm sure there are a few people there whose guidance and input would be very helpful for the development of such an article.

<dd>Question: How do they know "Beth" is the "purest" if the Phoenicians have been dead and gone for over two or three thousand years? So maybe that's what they said, what's it got to do with the Hebrew language as a fully functional and functioning language TODAY. "Beth" as it's used by some today is nothing more than an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicisation.html" title="Anglicisation">Anglicisation</a>. The bottom line for this letter today is that <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardi.html" title="Sephardi">Sephardim</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israelis</a> say <i>bet</i> and the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi.html" title="Ashkenazi">Ashkenazim</a> say <i>beis</i> or <i>bays</i> (and many <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasidic_Judaism_a5c0.html" title="Hasidic Judaism">Hasidim</a> say <i>buys</i> -- as in "bye bye".)

<dd>Its not an Anglicisation: the distinction is one made long before English became a recognisable language. The Massoretic scholars chose to distinguish between the Tau in 'Tau' and that in 'Beth' when the pointed the text of the Hebrew Bible. This reflected a difference in pronounciation between the two letters that had been made in Hebrew spoken as a living language of the day. Many modern non-Israeli pronounciations also make the distinction. This is why it is written with two different graphs in English t and th, a distinction made by much earlier Rabbinic scholars when rendering Massoretic texts into the Latin alphabet. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 08:32, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Beth is the name, in English, for the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, just as beta is the name, again in English, for the second letter of the Greek alphabet. Both are now wrong pronounciations in terms of the way those words are used by most living speakers of the languages using those alphabets, however the letters became English words some considerable time ago. English usage is not "wrong" just different. That is the way language is. For example we pronounce Paris with an /s/, which is wrong, certainly in modern standard French, but correct when we borrowed it some considerable time ago. We have a name for Paris related to the French word for the same place, but our word is right for us. See: Welsh and English names for places. Both correct, but in the English wikipedia we use the English not the Welsh name for a place (or we should...). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 13:06, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Francis, I get your point, stop repeating it like a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantra.html" title="Mantra">Mantra</a> please. Are you aware that Wikipedia has a rich collection of Hebrew titled articles see <a href="../../../h/e/b/Category%7EHebrew_words_43bf.html" title="Category:Hebrew words">Category:Hebrew words</a>. Similarly, see <a href="../../../a/r/a/Category%7EArabic_words_1e3c.html" title="Category:Arabic words">Category:Arabic words</a> or Category:Russian terminology (and many others like them). Almost all these words could be "forced" to appear as English-only articles, but the fact is that they do not because the people who write these articles are not interested in "policing" articles on Wikipedia to ensure that all articles are "English on the English wikipedia". I think that you are seeking to impose a standard that does not exist. The article is not about "How Hebrew letters are pronounced in English" , but rather about the raw reality and existence of the letter in its natural state. You are implying a process that is not true. The article is not "hurting" the English language or Wikipedia. On the contrary, the article is using English to desscribe and explain the letter <i>Bet</i> ' s true nature by means of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> and comparison. This is actually a process of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_method.html" title="Comparative method">Comparative method</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_linguistics.html" title="Historical linguistics">Historical linguistics</a> in languages and much more. Wikipedia is not just a court-house protecting the rights of English speakers, it is a repository of <i>all</i> legitimate human knowledge in <i>all</i> its forms and varieties. If you haven't noticed that yet, then you haven't explored the vast scope and <b>inclusivity</b> of Wikipedia, particularly when dealing with languages and phenomena other than English. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 14:04, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clearly a difference in philosophy and approach. It seems to me that it would be useful to have a consensus view on how to approach names for letters in foreign alphabets and similar entities, since this is an issue that has wider implications than just for this particular letter and goes beyond (I think) merely the approach to Hebrew -- perhaps this should be discussed in a larger forum and that might ease the conflict? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Davey_cdfc.html" title="User:Francis Davey">Francis Davey</a> 17:27, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Francis I agree with you now. It is "a difference in philosophy and approach". But I don't think it really calls for any major "larger forum and that might ease the conflict?" (as you claim) simply because we are <i>not</i>, in essence, "at war" here! I think that on Wikipedia ALL the views and approaches get reflected. So when, for example, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a> is being written about and discussed on Wikipedia, and it does actually start like this: "The <b>Chinese language</b> (汉语/漢語, 华语/華語, or 中文; <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a>: Hànyǔ, Huáyǔ, or Zhōngwén) is a <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tone_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Tone (linguistics)">tonal language</a> and a member of the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino-Tibetan_languages_8b82.html" title="Sino-Tibetan languages">Sino-Tibetan</a> <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_families_and_languages.html" title="Language families and languages">family of languages</a>," it would then be very foolish for another editor to jump in and say well, we don't pronounce this-and-that in such-and-such a way because this is the English Wikipedia. Or to say that we prefer to use <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Tse_Tung_ead6.html" title="Mao Tse Tung">Mao Tse Tung</a> (its accepted form in English for most of modern history) because we don't like the way <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_China_0705.html" title="Communist China">Communist China</a> turned it into "<a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Zedong_ee10.html" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>". This is just an example of the reality of accomodation that we all can and do adapt to here, and not jump to just artificially impose tight "English" "demands and standards" at all times. Wikipedia is far too broad and far too open a medium for a narrow view of things, because it's by definition infiitely broad and inclusive. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 05:57, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I personally find IZAK's nationalist-soapbox approach to the Hebrew alphabet unsalvageably ridiculous, but in case anyone's looking for evidence of Wikipedia semi-policy one way or the other: Wikipedia has articles on <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tai_Chi_Chuan_3944.html" title="Tai Chi Chuan">Tai Chi Chuan</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/_/Fu_Hsi_aa35.html" title="Fu Hsi">Fu Hsi</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucius.html" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> whose titles don't conform to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanyu_pinyin.html" title="Hanyu pinyin">Hanyu pinyin</a> (IZAK's "Communist China" transliteration system), but rather to accepted English usage (three based on <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade-Giles_c2d6.html" title="Wade-Giles">Wade-Giles</a> and the last on a Latinized honorific). (Contrariwise, the article on Lao Tzu is at <a href="../../../l/a/o/Lao_Zi_675e.html" title="Lao Zi">Lao Zi</a>.) Finally: Just because IZAK doesn't know Mandarin is no reason for him to assume some kind of Communist plot going on in Category:Mandarin terms.&#160;:-/ Those are all real words and names. --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 02:07, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Quux, I am not concerned in the least with "communist plots" (they ALWAYS fail in the end in any case!) I am saying that there is plenty of evidence that Wikipedia panders to the Chinese way of writing things, even though some names may remain as they were in "English" at the same time (is that a double standard?) Furthermore it is truly laughable that you think I have a "nationalist-soapbox approach to the Hebrew alphabet unsalvageably ridiculous" when all I am doing is describing and explaining to you the most common form of this letter in Hebrew in the most accurate fashion. To follow your argument: The spelling <i>Bet</i> (and not "Beth") is a "real word/s and name/s" in the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew language</a> AND for many who use it in English for the Hebrew letter <b>בּ</b> <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 05:33, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a plot, it's destiny. But the Chinese Communist Party is on your side now (though, maybe not transliteration-wise!); we'll turn them around, too. No, I have nothing else to add to this conversation. Well, except that I now see that there will be objections to my planned move. Regarding it, I think it's problematic to opt for a philological rather than modern linguistics approach for the transliteration of the letter along the line of how it is being used today by million of people, as opposed to the realm of archeology (which is to day, highlighting a component non existent in and archaic to modern Hebrew). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 06:26, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article has now been much expanded in respect of pronunciation. I would suggest that rather than going to such lengths, it should merely acknowledge that the dagesh makes a difference in some versions, and then cross-refer to the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_alphabet.html" title="Hebrew alphabet">Hebrew alphabet</a> article which gives considerable more detail for the various types of Hebrew pronunciation over the centuries, for this and for the other Hebrew letters. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 13:18, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>You say this this article is "going to such lengths"? So then why was it listed before as a "stub" needing more input? You are not making sense. I think that the article is now well-focused on the letter "Bet/Beth" to which it is devoted whereas the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_alphabet.html" title="Hebrew alphabet">Hebrew alphabet</a> article is far too broad and too confusing. The reference in this article to the <i>dagesh</i> is needed here, insofar as it relates to the Bet/Vet split and nothing else, so I fail to see your gripe/s. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 13:36, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The last sentence of the article states: "In discrete mathematics, beth represents the beth numbers that stand for the power of infinite sets."</p>
<p>Although this not completely false, it is highly misleading from a mathematical point of view:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reference to discrete mathematics is weird. The number beth-1 signifies the cardinality of the continuum, the continuum being what discrete math does <i>not</i> deal with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Beth numbers indicate the cardinality of the <i>power sets</i> of infinite sets. "The power of infinite sets" is not quite correct and has a somewhat mystical touch to it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suggest this improved version:</p>
<p>"In set theory, the letter beth is used to symbolize the beth numbers. The number beth-0 is the size of any denumerably infinite set, like the set of integers. The number beth-1 is the size of the power set of any set of size beth-0. The number beth-2 is the size of the power set of any set of the size beth-1, and so on. In mathematics it is customary to write "beth" instead of "bet"."</p>
<p>If there are no objections I shall replace the present last sentence with the above suggestion for an improved sentence, OK? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_132.199.142.122_0a54.html" title="Special:Contributions/132.199.142.122">132.199.142.122</a> (<a href="../../../1/3/2/User_talk%7E132.199.142.122.html" title="User talk:132.199.142.122">talk</a>) 19:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>First, when discussing bits of the article text, please cut-and-paste the relevant text, instead of trying to memorize the passage and reproduce it from memory here. Your "quote" is totally misquoted, and that misquotation affects the validity of the rest of your comments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, points of fact: <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">Set theory</a> is traditionally considered one of the branches of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrete_mathematics.html" title="Discrete mathematics">discrete mathematics</a>. While changing the sentence to mention "<a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">set theory</a>" might be a good idea, it's obviously not incorrect to say that the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_number.html" title="Beth number">beth numbers</a> are part of "discrete mathematics". Second, the article text does say "<i>powers of</i>", not "<i>the power of</i>", as you'd have noticed if you cut-and-pasted instead of trying to memorize the passage. Third, your summary of the significance of the beth numbers is okay, but it doesn't belong here. It would belong at <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_number.html" title="Beth number">Beth number</a>, if <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_number.html" title="Beth number">Beth number</a> didn't have a more detailed and far superior article already. --<a href="../../../q/u/u/User%7EQuuxplusone_9b50.html" title="User:Quuxplusone">Quuxplusone</a> 05:35, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
