<p>The relevant research has been comprehensively undertaken by Count Nikolai Tolstoy-Miloslavksy, a descendant of Count Lev Tolstoy, the famous writer.</p>
<p>Count Tolstoy's research is painstaking and meticulous and cites all sources very extensively and fully, taking them from government files in the West and now from the Soviet Union files. No-one has written a satisfactory rebuttal of his research nor, indeed, any rebuttal at all.</p>
<p>The Libel action brought by Lord Aldington in 1989 against Count Tolstoy and Mr Watts concerned a pamphlet circulated by Mr Watts and did not relate to any of Count Tolstoy's books which have never - repeat never - been challenged in the courts.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that the Cossacks were, indeed, betrayed and that largely by officials of the British government, particularly some in the Foreign Office. It is also quite clear that the Foreign Office illegally ordered the return to the Soviet Union of a very large number of Cossack and other emigres, knowing that they would be shot or imprisoned but also knowing that this would partially appease Stalin. British Special Forces units were tasked with the hand-over and witnessed many Cossacks and emigres being shot by the NKVD.</p>
<p>It is probable that this may have been a secret arrangement concluded at or after Yalta by Soviet-friendly officials in the British government, since British officialdom was, at that time, heavily infiltrated by fellow-travellers and others sympathetic to the Soviet Union, like the spies and traitors, Burgess, Philby and McLean. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.71.45.151 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.71.45.151_a53b.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.71.45.151">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Although to me a cossack, this is a touching piece, I must urge for it to be NPOVed. You must remember that at the same time hunderds of thousands of ethnic Cossacks fought for the Red Army against the nazis whether being in Cossack regiments or in others, and the tone that this article sets for how our motherland is portrayed is unacceptable and if I was more skeptical I would have given this article a thorough filtering. However since it is unfinished, I shall wait for a while and urge the author to NPOV and expand the section... The whole of my family fought for my motherland in Cossack regiments. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban kazak</a> 16:23, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that this article needs some more NPOVing but am finding it difficult to do myself because of my personal feelings towards these events. It definetly needs a new title but I can't think of one. It could be merged with Operation Keelhaul as they are essentially the same thing but from different POV (one from a British, the other from a Soviet refugee). I thought of adding something about the Red Army but didn't think it should be added to this article because it was dealing solely with those Cossacks that fought for the White Army, as they were the ones that were handed over. --<a href="../../../j/k/l/User%7EJklin_cce3.html" title="User:Jklin">Jklin</a> 05:27, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>White army and Red army in sense of the Russian civil war? Then that is rather irrelevant, except for those people who fought twice against the Soviet Union. Now I am talking about those Cossacks who, once their land has been occupied made the choice of collaborating. This article should clearly mention that they only compromised a minority, that most Cossacks fought for the Red Army (athough the majority did not fight in Cossack regiments, that is true). Finally it should also mention the 1950s pardon of the Soviet Govenment.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> 09:50, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having read <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Krasnov_0453.html" title="Pyotr Krasnov">Pyotr Krasnov</a> I suggest the assertion here that he was never a Soviet citizen is incorrect. He was taken prisoner during the Kerensky-Junker plot and was then released after promising "never to do it again". A promise he broke almost immediately.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Shkuro case is different. As I suppose will be the case with many others.</p>
<p>Many of these people committed heinous war crimes, not necessarily in the Soviet Union (Yugoslavia comes to mind, and the Warsaw Uprising). Which does not mean that one crime deserves another, but puts things into perspective. --pgp 12:23, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pretty POV. Still, it covers an interesting aspect of the policy of forced soviet repatriation in the aftermath of the second world war. I'd recomend deleting the sensationlist parts, citing sources carefully, and using hard numbers rather than generalizations. I'll try to launch into a little bit of cleanup, but I suspect the big cleanup guns are going to have to come from our cyrillic reading wikipedians who have more plentiful access to specific sources.</p>

<dd>It deserves the highest respect to fight for your fatherland. But the Cossacks who were fighting in two wars for their freedom to live in peace in a free Cosakia without oppression and persecution are deserving the same respect. They have not left their homeland to fight for the Third Reich or Hitler. No, they were looking for freedom to lieve in peace in their home country. That they have chosen twice the loser side is the most tragic episode of the Cossack history. --Bargen 11:33, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If over one million people of Soviet nationality served with or in the German army one can't speak of a minority. In March 1943 they were numbering already apprx. 430.000 men which joined the German army voluntary. A great part of them were Cossacks. To be read in "Cossacks in the German army" 1991 by Samuel J. Newland, U.S. Army War College:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"When the German 14th Panzer Corps moved into the vicinity of the River Mius, during mid-October 1941, they were surprised to find an engagement in progress behind the Red Army's front line. They found not German troops but a Russian militia unit had attacked the Soviet Army from the rear. The militia group was commanded by 1st Lietenant Nicholas Nazarenko, a Don Cossack..(p.90). On August 22, 1941, with the war only two month old, the entire 436 Soviet Regiment defected to the Germans. The defection was led by Major Ivan Nikitch Kononov, a Don Cossack...(p.92). Kononow was later commanding as Colonel the Plastunbrigade in the XV.-Cossack-Cavallery-Korps in the Wehrmacht. Not to forget about General Vlassov with his Army of Liberation. All this facts needs to be considered when as suggested the article needs "thourough filtering" and NPOV.--Bargen 12:28, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Voluntary</i>...well the bulk of the collaborators were Vlasovites, Soviet POWs faced with either to die (since Holocaust was not really limited to the Jews, and Soviet POWs were not treated any more humane then they were) or to join the ROA, or wait and be faced with a question: "Why are you not dead?" by the NKVD. Cossacks read the article 50,000. ... As for the 436th regiment...well if you follow the Soviet order of battle then a regiment can number between 500 up 2000 men depending on what the regiment is. Still quite far away from 430 000. Then if you include Ukrainian, Estonian, Latvian and other nationalist collaborators, those did join voluntary then that is a believable figure... until then please do not feed BS by some random author who lived on a different continet.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 14:53, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wrong, the bulk were Soviet origin. In the "XV. Cossack Cavalery Corps" apprx. 25.000 Cossacks were serving. Wlassow's so called Army of Liberation only came in action in February 1945 and changed side again already beginning of May in Praque.
<dl>
<dd>Prague not Praque, and 25 000 is nowhere near 430 000... Which preatty matches the Soviet figures and our Cossack ones. You are forgetting however about the nearlly millions of Cossack descendents who took arms for their motherland and fought in ALL military branches of the Worker Peasent Red Army and Red Fleet. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 14:48, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since it seems to be agreed that this article needs a new title, how about <i>Cossacks after WWII</i>. Most of this information could be transferred there and more information about cossacks that fought for the allies could be added. This would also get rid of the POV title and give an opportunity to further NPOV the article in the move.--<font color="#FF6633"><font face="comic sans MS">Joe <a href="../../../j/k/l/User%7EJklin_cce3.html" title="User:Jklin"><small>Jklin</small></a> <b>(</b><small><a href="../../../j/k/l/User_talk%7EJklin_57b9.html" title="User talk:Jklin">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jklin_3e70.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jklin">C</a></small><b>)</b></font></font> 04:07, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strong oppose. Cossacks after WWII is a direct insult to millions of Cossack descendents who fought in the Red Army ranks. This article deals with a single group of those people and should be mentioned. I propose that it be moved to Lienz Cossacks, as that is directely relevant title and has been applied several times in English--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 09:42, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe this should be moved to operation keelhaul, just under the sub title of "Cossacks."</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Strong Oppose</b> as the Cossack story is far greater than the story of Operation Keelhaul. Also this article is still fairly POV on what is a very sensitive subject.

<p>While this event is often viewed as occurring only on European soil, it also occurred across the Atlantic Ocean at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Dix_e489.html" title="Fort Dix">Fort Dix</a>, New Jersey. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrey_Vlasov_f499.html" title="Andrey Vlasov">Andrey Vlasov</a>, a man who repeatedly voiced objections against Nazism and communism, was one of the men captured by American forces. His conversation with his American captor was described by Sven Steenberg in his book <i>"Wlassow - Verräter oder Patriot?"</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He began to speak, at first slowly and dispassionately, but then with growing intensity. For one last time, he spoke of all the prospects, hopes, and disappointments of his countrymen. He summed up everything for which countless Russians had fought and suffered. It was no longer really to the American that he was addressing himself — this was rather a confession, a review of his life, a last protest against the destiny that had brought him to a wretched end.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Vlasov stated that the leaders of the ROA were ready to appear before an international court, but that it would be a monumental injustice to turn them over to the Soviets and thereby to certain death. It was not a question of volunteers who had served the Germans, but of a political organization, of a broad opposition movement which, in any event, should not be dealt with under military law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrey Vlasov was hanged <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> for "treason as well as active espionage and terrorist activity against the Soviet Union."<sup id="_ref-multiple_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-multiple" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p><br />
The reference at the end of the section states - Some of this dirty work even took place on American soil. Epstein describes what happened to Russian POWs who were imprisoned at Fort Dix, New Jersey:</p>
<pre>
   First, they refused to leave their barracks when ordered to do so...
</pre>
<p>Andrey Vlasov — the man who hated communism — the man who hated Nazism — carefully explained his position and reasoning to the American generals.</p>
<p>So it seems as though he might have been there, I do not know personally. However, Russian POWs were held at Fort Dix, New Jersey so the section should stay (which I'll add back) the Vlasov issue should be looked further into though.--<font color="#228B22"><font face="comic sans MS">Iosef <sup><b><a href="../../../i/o/s/User%7EIosef_d462.html" title="User:Iosef"><small>U</small></a> <small><a href="../../../i/o/s/User_talk%7EIosef_4c07.html" title="User talk:Iosef">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Iosef_dd62.html" title="Special:Contributions/Iosef">C</a></small></b></sup></font></font> 14:57, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
