<p>Hi - I came here because this article has been nominated for review as a good article. I think a few more wikilinks are in order - particularly for dates, but also for places such as Bantry Bay. The reference links can be called on more than once using &lt;ref name="???"/&gt; ; that might be useful in this case as there seem to be a few more statements crying out for references. Regards--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 00:19, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>AY. Thankyou for your comments. I have expanded the wikilinks and referencing. As an aside, I have drawn on my own personal memories of the incident in writing this article. I joined <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Oil_cc08.html" title="Gulf Oil">Gulf Oil</a> shortly after the incident (see photographic evidence on the Gulf Oil Discussion page) and made several site visits between 1980 and 1985.

<p>To be quite honest I have never heard to it being referred to as an 'incident'. In this country (Ireland),it has always been referred to as either the 'Betelgeuse Disaster' or the 'Whiddy Island Disaster'. Indeed the Report of the tribunal of inquiry is entitled 'Report on the Disaster at Whiddy Island, Banty, Co. Cork on 8th January, 1979'. Perhaps we could agree to a change?!</p>

<p><i>Thankyou for the anonymous contribution. All I can say is that while I was working for <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Oil_cc08.html" title="Gulf Oil">Gulf Oil</a> and later for the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioners_of_Irish_Lights_77d0.html" title="Commissioners of Irish Lights">Commissioners of Irish Lights</a>, it was known as "the Betelgeuse incident". Indeed, that term was used in pubs in Bantry. The term was a common usage. Feel free to e-mail me direct (my address is on my talk page) if you wish to discuss the matter.

<p><i>ps&#160;: there is a reference to "the Betelgeuse incident" in a speech by TD Mr Eamon Ryan to the Dáil on 14 October 2003, see para 5</i> <a href="http://www.eamonryan.ie/Speeches%20-%20Oil%20Pollution%20at%20Sea%20Bill.shtm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eamonryan.ie/Speeches%20-%20Oil%20Pollution%20at%20Sea%20Bill.shtm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <i>I am sure I could find many similar references.</i></p>

<dd>Sorry, I didn't realise I was logged as anonymous - I'm new to Wikipedia contributions!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid I have to differ. I'm from Bantry, and as I said, 'incident' is not the word that we use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you care to check the following terms at the Oireachtas website see that:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'Betelgeuse Incident' returns 3 documents (among which is Eamon Ryans T.D. speech)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'Betelgeuse Disaster' returns 18 documents</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>'Whiddy Island Disaster' returns 29 documents</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think you will find that the majority of irish publications would use these terms over 'incident'</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore...and please don't think I'm having a go, but the article does contain a glaring inaccuracy in the first paragraph - the tanker was ballasting not discharging oil at the time of the explosion.(User:Clodius 20:40, 18 June 2006 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Clodius. Thanks for your comments. "The Betelgeuse incident" is the term that was widely used at the time. That was by people from Gulf, Total, CIL, and various Irish authorities. I haven't been to Bantry since 1985, so maybe things have moved on since my day?. Unloading 120,000 tonnes of cargo from a vessel is a tricky business. You have to maintain the evenness of the hull's buoyancy and this is usually done by filling ballast tanks as cargo is taken off. The unloading and ballasting are part of the same exercise, and usually go on simultaneously. But, unloading is the active part of the exercise and everyone knows what that means. So, can we live with the article as it is?. Bob</i> <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBScar23625_55b6.html" title="User:BScar23625">BScar23625</a> 21:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>ps&#160;: I have had some further feedback on this. The term "incident" is widely used in martime affairs to refer to any event likely to give rise to an insurance claim or court case. This is so because the word incident is entirely neutral - it carries no implication of extent or blame. For example - see <a href="../../../e/x/x/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill_513d.html" title="Exxon Valdez oil spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> , where there is reference to the Exxon Valdez incident under the heading The Ship. Also see reference to the Exxon Valdez incident in para 2 of the USEPA report to the President (summary)</i> <a href="http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/valdez/04.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/valdez/04.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <i>Be assured that the term "Betelgeuse incident" was widely used in the early 1980s, and I think we should adhere to that and not move to modern (2006) usages. Bob</i> <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBScar23625_55b6.html" title="User:BScar23625">BScar23625</a> 08:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thank you for your succinct yet unnecessary explanation of the ballasting process.</li>

<p>The issue of ‘unloading’ or to use correct parlance ‘discharging’ was central to the cause of disaster. The fact (which I assume you are aware) that it was not discharging, evidenced the finding that the fire did not begin on the central platform of the jetty, which in turn alludes to the finding that it was the tankers owners, Total, and not Gulf Oil being held accountable for the accident as per the Costello Report. I feel that leaving the description as it is would be misleading. Unloading gives the impression that something was being removed from the vessel. The discharge of crude oil had ceased some time earlier to the commencement of ballasting. The ballasting programme was crucial to the hull failure on the Betelgeuse. (The initial explosion occurred in the permanent ballast tanks.)</p>
<p>Regarding usage of ‘incident’:</p>
<p>I have numerous contemporaneous newspaper clippings from the time of the accident, all of which describe the accident as either the ‘Betelgeuse Disaster or ‘Whiddy Island Disaster’. (Which if you wish I can scan and send to you?)</p>
<p>Moreover, if you had taken the time to search the Oireachtas website, you would see that the Dail Eireann debate records (which I hope you would agree are authoritative and indicative of contemporary usage) of the 6 February 1979 <a href="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0311/D.0311.197902060014.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0311/D.0311.197902060014.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>; the 7 February 1979 <a href="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0311/D.0311.197902070014.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0311/D.0311.197902070014.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> used the term ‘Whiddy Island Disaster’, as did the written questions of 21 February 1980 <a href="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0318/D.0318.198002210044.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0318/D.0318.198002210044.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>; the debate of 26 November 1980<a href="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0324/D.0324.198011260010.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0324/D.0324.198011260010.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Over the next few days (time permitting), I will make some more corrections/revisions to the text. Please feel free to correct me!</p>
<p>With reference to the 'special service' - I think some part of the ceremony was ecumenical. Perhaps the phrase 'commemorative mass and graveside ceremony' could be used?</p>
<p>Actually the following sentence &amp; photo contains an error: <i>A memorial sculpture, incorporating the ship's bell which was recovered from the wreck, has been erected in the hillside graveyard overlooking the terminal.</i> - The graveyard is orientated to look over Bantry harbour, not Whiddy Island (Its on an east/west axis as it was the site of a Franciscan Abbey).Clodius 14:28, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Clodius. As regards the article title - I have no problem with you referring the matter to the "requested move" procedure. You and I come to this from different perspectives.

<p>I have removed the Gulf Oil logo (<a href="../../../g/u/l/Image%7EGulf.png_1c61.html" title="Image:Gulf.png">Image:Gulf.png</a>) twice from this article, and it has been restored both times. I have been asked on my talk page not to remove this image again without discussion on this talk page. So here is my reasoning for removing the logo.</p>
<p>I uploaded this logo to Wikipedia to replace an old ugly JPEG version which has since been deleted. By doing so, I had to make a claim that the use of this logo on Wikipedia qualifies as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> under United States copyright law. I am willing to make this claim for the use of the logo in the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Oil_cc08.html" title="Gulf Oil">Gulf Oil</a> article, but in this article it adds absolutely nothing and is being used purely for decoration. As such it fails point 8 of the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia fair-use policy</a>, does not qualify as fair use in this article, and should be removed.</p>
<p>Those who want the logo to remain in this article need to make a good argument explaining why this logo actually adds anything significant to the article, rather than simply being a pretty picture to break up the flow of the text. —<a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> (<a href="../../../b/k/e/User_talk%7EBkell_38f8.html" title="User talk:Bkell">talk</a>) 18:51, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The subject of this article is not Gulf Oil; the subject of this article is the Betelgeuse incident. Gulf Oil is the subject of the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Oil_cc08.html" title="Gulf Oil">Gulf Oil</a> article. Specifically, what information is conveyed by the Gulf Oil logo in this article that is not conveyed by the text?

<p>This article is about Gulf Oil as owner and operator of the facility, the corporation who decided that vessels of this size where be used for crude. Gulf oil was also the owner of the crude and their staff where responsible for the discharging of the vessel and some of the casualties where Gulf Oil employees. Gulf Oil was held partly responsible due to the lack of fire fighting facilities. By having the Logo in the section about the background it clearly identifies and associates the global corporation to the incident, which is disinctly necessary as the facilities where handed over to Irish governement who are readily recognised as the facilities owners. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 05:36, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Brian. You seem to be adopting an extremely narrow interpretation of the manner in which an image can "convey information" about the subject of an article. Applied across Wikipedia, about 90% of Fair Use illustrations would fail the test that you have adopted. Please have a think about this point for a few days before taking the matter any further.</i></p>
<p><i>As an aside, thankyou for loading the improved version of the logo. I will take a look at the matter of .png image formats soon. Bob</i> <a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBScar23625_55b6.html" title="User:BScar23625">BScar23625</a> 06:10, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I do think that many images used on Wikipedia under a claim of "fair use" are basically copyright violations. But the issue at hand is <i>this</i> image in <i>this</i> article, so my views on other images are irrelevant.</dd>
<dd>Point 8 of the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia fair-use policy</a> says this:
<dl>
<dd>The material must contribute <b>significantly</b> to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text) and must not serve a purely decorative purpose.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Now, this image is not identifying the subject of this article, because the subject of this article is the Betelgeuse incident, not Gulf Oil. This image is not illustrating relevant points or sections within the text; it adds nothing that is not already conveyed by the text. (Note that "illustrate" here means "to clarify; to make clear by giving or by serving as an example or instance" and not simply "to decorate".) So what significant contribution is this image making? I see none. Therefore, I claim that the use of this image in this article violates point 8 of the Wikipedia fair-use policy, and hence should be removed.</dd>
<dd>Part of the reason I am so adamant about this particular instance is that, by uploading <a href="../../../g/u/l/Image%7EGulf.png_1c61.html" title="Image:Gulf.png">Image:Gulf.png</a> and tagging it with the {{<a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogo_3c38.html" title="Template:Logo">logo</a>}} tag, I asserted my opinion that the use of the image in the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Oil_cc08.html" title="Gulf Oil">Gulf Oil</a> article met the criteria for fair use. I consider this to be a legal claim on my part, for which I accept legal responsibility, and I take it seriously. I was hesitant to make such a claim, because I am generally against the proliferation of "fair-use" images on Wikipedia, but I made it in this case partly to prove a point to another Wikipedian that a PNG version of the Gulf logo would be smaller and crisper than a JPEG version.</dd>
<dd>I am unwilling to make such a fair-use claim for the use of this logo in this article, but currently, as the logo is used in this article and as I am the one who made the fair-use claim on the image description page for <a href="../../../g/u/l/Image%7EGulf.png_1c61.html" title="Image:Gulf.png">Image:Gulf.png</a>, it appears that I am making such a claim. I do not want to bear the responsibility for this claim. So if you or other editors feel that the use of this logo in this article qualifies as fair use, then please add a fair-use rationale to the image description page yourself, so that it is clear that I am not the one making the claim. —<a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> (<a href="../../../b/k/e/User_talk%7EBkell_38f8.html" title="User talk:Bkell">talk</a>) 06:30, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
