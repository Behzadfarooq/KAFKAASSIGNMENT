<p>For many years, college students all over San Diego have been seeking a fraternal organization which could meet the needs of Asian American students. During the spring semester of 1989, this idea began taking on a physical shape . While discussing the possibility of forming a more unified Asian community, Todd Tanaka convinced Gary Quizon to create a fraternity. They began having meetings every Sunday night in front of Montezuma Hall. Curtis Chiu, Maurice Hagio, Ryan Kam, Ken Kawaguchi, Dean Okamura, Bill Theurer, and Kevin Wong were the first to join this new organization. When the semester ended, many of the founding fathers went home for the summer. To keep the group together, they held two meetings during the summer time. Their goal during this period was to find a fraternity which possessed the ideals that they held. Beta Omega Phi not only expressed the same beliefs, but was interested in expanding to San Diego. The first meeting between the two groups was held in Los Angeles after a Beta party. Communication continued for the rest of the summer. On August 20, 1989, the group voted to accept the invitation from Los Angeles to become the Gamma Chapter of Beta Omega Phi. The next meeting between the Alpha and Gamma Chaters was held five weeks later in Los Angeles. The Gamma Chapter was invited to an exchange with Sigma Phi Omega of University of Southern California. This was the first opportunity to become acquainted with a sorority of the Asian Greek Council. The next day they were given the General Fraternity Facts and the Constitution.</p>

<p>When the founding fathers returned to San Diego, they began to prepare for a pledge class in the 1990 spring semester . The next few months became the most important and difficult period of the Gamma Chapter. Long and intense meetings regarding the purpose and the directions of the fraternity were common. To make matters worse, at one point several members left because of their inability to agree on certain issues. It was at this point the future of the fraternity seem most grim. The situation however, did turnaround with the addition of Dean Fujimoto, Manny Deleon, and Dennis Takeda. These three men were also looking for a fraternal organization that possessed the same beliefs Beta Omega Phi stood for. Finally with the addition of three more members, the Purpose (written by Gary Quizon) and the Opening Pledge (written by Gary Quizon and Ken Kawaguchi) were approved by the fraternity. In November, Beta Omega Phi was recognized as an on-campus organization at San Diego State University. Many events soon took place that academic year, including the addition of the Alpha Class of Beta Omega Phi. This class included Dante Bautista, Erik Garcia, Mike Kosaka, Frank Liu, Bob Lumahan, Ferdie Mazon, Andy Morita, and Steve Yamamoto. Also, at this same time, The Little Sister program was initiated. As many as thirty-three individuals applied to be a little sister. Of the thirty-three, twenty-two were accepted. The fraternity was also pursuing to acheive the goals laid out by the Purpose. The actives volunteered at the Annual Chinese New Year Festival in Del Mar. The group was communicating with the Japanese Tea Graden about the future community service work. Professor Riz Oadas and Professor Kenji Ima were asked to give lectures to the group on different issues facing the Asian American community. As illustrated through our Purpose, the brothers of Beta Omega Phi made it a priority to raise Asian awareness and slowly acheived this through community work. With an end of the semester dinner held at El Torito in the Sheraton Harbor Island, speeches were given, hugs were exchanged, and memories where shared. The brothers of Beta Omega Phi reviewed the exicting events of the past year and were pleased to know that their hard work, sweat and tears had paid off. Thus, the foundation of the fraternity had been laid, and to this day our brotherhood remains as strong as ever...</p>
