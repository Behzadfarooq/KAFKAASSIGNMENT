<p>Beth Raines arrived in Springfield in 1983, a victim of an abusive stepfather, Bradley. Beth used art (painting &amp; drawing) as a means of self-expression. When Bradley caught her drawing a portrait of her natural father, he became so enraged that he threw her down a flight of stairs. During her stay in the hospital, she roomed with Mindy Lewis and drew quite a bit of attention from orderlies, Rick Bauer and Phillip Spaulding. Though she initially chose Rick, she and Phillip found themselves drawn to one another. Though both tried to deny their feelings out of respect for Rick, fate kept throwing them together--such as when they were named King of Queen at the Senior Prom. Finally the night of Mindy's eighteenth birthday party the two shared their feelings for one another. During their confession, they were interrupted by Bradley, who had shocking news for Phillip (that he wasn't a Spaulding). Afterwards he became even more abusive towards Beth finally raping her one night after Beth came home after a date with Phillip. Ashamed of what happened Beth told no one and rejected Phillip. Afraid, she then moved into a boarding house after a talk with her teacher, Annabelle Reardon, but was ordered by the court to return home.</p>

<p>But when Beth returned home Phillip was waiting for her, and they jumped out of a window and ran away to New York. After they had been running for a while they found themselves near Central Park and nearly out of any money, Beth was working on some artistic sketches when both of them came upon a sidewalk Santa Claus (who preferred to be called Nick) who asked them if they needed help. At first Phillip warned Beth to not to trust Nick or anyone else who was a stranger in New York City and perhaps at any other time that might have been the correct advice. But then Nick pressed further whether they needed help, the lessons Phillip learned from his adoptive father, Alan Spaulding surfaced and he actually yelled at the man. Beth started hitting Phillip and then yelling at him that it was very rude of him to yell at Nick and Phillip backed down, knowing how much Beth might have appreciated having someone like Nick being so attentive to wanting to help them than hurt Beth as her stepfather had. After Phillip apologized to Nick, Beth told the man that they were nearly broke and had no where to stay and perhaps could not afford a hotel. Nick being the Good Samaritan he was and is, took pity on the young teenage couple and urged them to follow him through Central Park. Phillip at first was hestitant, but eventually the love of his life (at that point), Beth persuaded him to follow Nick and that's what they did. Nick safely led them out of Central Park to the Delacorte Theatre in Manhattan. When they got safely to the Theatre, Phillip and Beth found that Nick had led them to a place where he had led many people who were lost and homeless or poor or down on their luck. Apparently, Nick had turned, one of the wings of, the Delacorte Theatre into a half-way house. Nick turned them over to the others that were staying there and asked them to watch over Beth and Phillip. But, instead Beth and Phillip helped many of them and they helped Beth and Phillip in a mutually beneficial manner. Eventually with Nick (Santa’s) helped Beth tell Phillip about the rape. Phillip promised to protect her and they pledged to never let anything come in between them again. A couple of days after New Year's Day, Phillip and Beth ran into Nick again and thanked him profusely for helping them, but all Nick had to say was, "Well that is my job." He then smiled at Phillip and Beth and after they turned around, he was gone (and in his stead were their friends from Springfield, Mindy and Rick.) Mindy and Rick had followed them to New York and they bonded as they finally found Phillip and Beth. The four friends took odd jobs in order to survive and they enjoyed the sights and sounds of New York.</p>

<p>In January 1984, Bradley tracked them down and, in order to evade him, Phillip and Beth dressed up as clowns and engaged in a mime act in the park. But he eventually saw through their disguise and got in a violent struggle with Phillip in Central Park that ended when Bradley almost fell off of a cliff. Beth and Phillip saved him though and warned him to back off. Not long after, Phillip's father, Alan, hired Bradley at Spaulding in the hopes of transferring the lower class Raines out of town and getting Beth away from his son. However, Alan's sister, Alex was a great supporter of the couple and when she learned what Bradley had done, she helped Beth charge him with rape. Bradley maintained his innocence, but at the trial he finally confessed saying that he had to mark her so no one else would want her, because no one else could love her like he did. Bradley was sent to a psychiatric hospital and Lillian divorced him. Beth then became engaged to marry Phillip. At the same time, Mindy was pregnant and told everyone that Rick ws the father. Then the day of Beth's wedding, Mindy's father, Billy, went to the church where Beth and Phillip were about to be married and confronted Mindy. He wanted to know if it was true that the father of her baby was really Phillip! Unfortunately, Beth overheard everything. The wedding started and Beth met Phillip at the altar. There, she slapped Phillip and called off the wedding. Beth left Phillip at the altar but she still loved him and wanted to marry him, while Billy thought Mindy ruined her whole life. Beth then even considered adopting Mindy's baby. Phillip wanted to be part of the baby anyway but Mindy only wanted to allow this if he would marry her. And since even Billy approved of a marriage, Phillip finally reluctantly agreed despite his love for Beth. So Phillip married Mindy and they spent their honeymoon at Cross Creek.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Raines_1dd6.html" title="Edit section: LuJack">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">LuJack</span></h3>
<p>About this time, Beth was hired to tutor Lujack, a member of the gang, the Galahads, who trying to turn his life around. (Beth was teaching him how to read, in exchange for him teaching her how to drive) Soon she fell in love with him and eventually convinced him to accept Alex as his mother and to leave the Galahads, to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend Darcy who then lead the Gang with her friends Martin "I.Q." Wilson and Gina Daniels. When Darcy terrorized Springfield's citizens, Lujack went undercover to spy on her while he let Beth believe that he returned to the gang. Finally, Darcy discovered Lujack's motives and in a rage, she entered Cedars on the opening day of the new Spaulding wing, tied up Katie Parker and stole her uniform, shot Lujack, kidnapped Alex and Beth, pushed a burning crash cart into Cedars Head Admin Warren Andrews Warren and turned Cedars into a general war zone. Luckily, Lujack was able to convince her to give up the fight and Darcy was arrested while I.Q. and Gina were proud of Lujack and decided to give up their criminal lives when Lujack gave them jobs at Spaulding. Meanwhile, Mindy had since miscarried and Phillip was free to return to Beth. Unfortunately Beth was happy with Lujack and refused to go back to him. Feeling very rejected and angry, Phillip discovered that Lujack and Floyd Parker were turning the Galahads' old garage into a Night Club and hired a crooked tradesman named Andy Ferris to sabotage the construction of the club. But Andy went too far, and when the building blew up Beth was injured and blinded. Phillip felt very guilty but he could not bring himself to admit his wrongdoing so he enrolled Beth in a school for the blind where she befriended Andy's blind sister, Nancy Ferris and rejected Lujack. Suspicious of Andy, Lujack went undercover as a blind man named Lenny to find out the truth and to be near Beth. Beth eventually regained her sight and was thrilled to discover her friend Lenny was actually Lujack. When Andy saw Lujack with Nancy, he tried to shoot him but was arrested. However, Alex got him released since she wanted him to keep quiet about the club plot. After India, now Phillip's wife, noticed that Phillip and Beth were renewing their friendship, she told Beth how Phillip had caused her blindness. Beth angrily rejected Phillip, but she did not tell him that she knew the truth because she did not want to cause any more bad blood between him and Lujack. Lujack was suspicious though and, in February 1985, got Andy to attend Alex's Valentines Day party with the intent on exposing Phillip. But once Andy got to the party with a copy of the tape he began to have second thoughts. Suddenly the lights went out and a shot was heard. When the lights returned Lujack was standing there over the dead body of Andy with a gun in his hand. Lujack stood trial and was found guilty of murder. In prison he found an unlikely ally in Bradley, who befriended Lujack at Lillian's request. When Lujack escaped prison during a benefit party, Beth helped him but both were stopped by Bradley who begged for forgiveness for what he had done to Beth. Beth forgave him and hid with Lujack on Kyle Samson's yacht. She eventually convinced Phillip to come clean about his deal with Andy and they became friends once again. Ironically the police did not believe Phillip's story but by now plenty of people shared the suspicion the India had murdered Andy. But the real culprit was holding India in a cabin where he forced her to sign a false confession. It was Floyd Parker, who had killed Andy out of his secret love for Beth. Lujack and Beth eventually tracked them down and convinced Floyd to give himself up.</p>
<p>Now cleared of all charges with Floyd in jail, Lujack decided to become a rock star with the help of promoter Suzette Saxon. But Suzette wanted Beth out of Lujack's career and so she brought the rock promoter Jackson Freemont to town for help, and Jackson immediately fell in love with Beth. Although Beth only had eyes for Lujack, they often argued over Suzette and Jackson. Unfortunately Lujack's music career also unknowingly brought Beth and Lujack into the schemes of the nefarious Largo Organization, which was trying to take over Sampson Industries. Their logo was ironically the same as the logo Beth and Jackson had just created for Lujack’s music video, a double ring that merge into one another. Then Beth accidentally identified Bea Reardon’s Company guest, Darryl, as Largo and was kidnapped by the organization onto their tanker. Lujack made plans to rescue her and Jackson wanted to help him but then he was also kidnapped. He and Beth wanted to escape from the tanker but Largo stopped them and shot Jackson who fell over the tanker leaving Beth to believe he was dead. Finally the tanker exploded after Kyle, Kurt and Lujack rescued Beth. Unfortunately the explosion not only killed Largo, but also mortally injured Lujack, who died in Beth and Alex's arms in Cedars. After Lujack’s death, Jackson turned up alive and comforted Beth and they kept Billy Lewis from going to jail for murder by testifying to Largo's plot. Brokenhearted, Beth sought comfort with Phillip in 1986 and the pair became engaged again. Tragically their happiness wouldn't last long when Beth began to work at a museum for Professor Blackburn. Blackburn had gotten his hands on the cornerstone of the von Halkein estate in Andorra. India knew that it contained gold and she tried to steal it from him. But the Professor was desperate to hold on to the cornerstone. He knocked India unconscious, shot Phillip, and held Beth hostage on a boat in Stony Lake. Sometime later Blackburn’s dead body turned up, Beth's shoe and some fabric from her dress was found but she was nowhere to be seen. Phillip was devastated and vowed to find her, but Alan, who had always looked down on Beth, fabricated some evidence to make it look like Beth was really dead.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Raines_1dd6.html" title="Edit section: Beyond th grave">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beyond th grave</span></h3>
<p>A mute and amnesiac Beth reappeared in Springfield in 1989 along with Neil Everest who became Spaulding Enterprises' new employee.As Beth looked around Springfield, places and people began to appear even more familiar to her. Trying to piece together her memories, Beth went (without Neil) to the Springfield Country Club stables, where she encountered just released from prison, Bradley! overcome with emotion upon seeing his former stepdaughter alive, Bradley apologized for the horrible things he'd done to her Phillip. Beth had a memory flash of Bradley beating her, and she clubbed him with a shovel and ran out. Not long after, Phillip's wife, Blake, stumbled upon Beth and Neil but kept this revelation secret for fear of losing Phillip. Afterwards, Neil decided to tell Beth about her past and accompanied her to Lillian's house. (it can be assumed he learned about this from Gary Swanson who learned from Blake) But Beth seeing her childhood home and remembering Bradley refused to go in and then ran away when she saw Bradley, yet again. Beth ran away to Clayton where the Willow Hills Sanitarium was and with her aphasia checked herself her in to the sanitarium! Then came several miracles, first Phillip showed a fellow patient of his, Ethan, a picture of Beth and Ethan having spotted Beth got Phillip to go to her room. Unfortunately this first miracle hit a snag when Beth was turned around and Phillip didn't see her face. Although not a miracle, Blake was about to find out how much her plans were unraveling, when she coerced Springfield police officer Rusty Shayne to follow her to Neil's trailer and Blake and Rusty were to discover from Neil that Beth had disappeared. Later a bus operator told Rusty that Beth had been on his bus to Clayton! When Blake heard this from Rusty she went into panic and very well she should have. Because as Rusty was telling Blake this news from the bus operator, Beth was being taken to the infirmary at Willow Hills and when Phillip heard the intercom that Beth was going to the infirmary he rushed there to see for himself that Beth was indeed alive! Later Blake and Phillip's aunt, Alexandra Spaulding visited him at Willow Hills and were astonished to find that Phillip wanted to voluntarily stay in Willow Hills, not realizing that Phillip knew about Beth and Blake's deception. Then one day, Rusty told Blake that Bradley Raines had also seen Beth alive and then Rick visiting his friend, Phillip, saw Beth alive as well! The next day would even be a bigger shock (but happy one), for another Springfield resident when Lillian also saw her daughter alive! Later the police and Blake went to go see Neil and to admit he had Beth with him, but Neil denied it. Meanwhile, Beth showed Phillip a picture of Neil, which Phillip, of course recognized. Beth attempted to tell Phillip about what happened to her back in 1986 that made her disappear, but couldn't and then she "escaped" Willow Hills; which made Blake upset when Phillip got violent to her when she came for a "visit." Beth had returned to Neil, feeling safe with him and Neil proposed to him. Blake tried to keep Phillip in Willow Hills, but Rick and Lillian both having seen Beth alive, told the court that Phillip was as sane as they were and he was released. But Blake still had his power of attorney, that is until Blake did one more really stupid thing in her plan to retain control. Phillip had the Spaulding mansion phones wired to monitor every call Blake took. Blake took a call from Neil about the upcoming marriage of him and Beth at the courthouse and Blake lied to Phillip that the phone call was not from Neil! On Christmas Eve 1989, Neil and Beth were about to marry, at the courthouse, with Blake in attendance, when Phillip and Rick on to Blake's plan crashed the ceremony and whisked Beth away! Although Beth tried to explain otherwise, Phillip was convinced that Neil had been involved in Beth's kidnapping and fired him from Spaulding Enterprises. Determined to prove his innocence, on January 11, 1990, Neil helped relive her kidnapping at the hands of Professor Blackburn. Beth recalled killing Blackburn when he tried to attack her, and she realized her aphasia stemmed from her lack of guilt over his death. Beth finally spoke, fully, and yelled at both Phillip and Neil to stop arguing and accusing each other of various misdeeds. Beth also forgave Bradley who helped her remember and Phillip would a little later find out from Alan Spaulding, his adoptive father who was in prison, with Bradley's prompting that Alan had hired Professor Blackburn to kidnap and hide Beth away from his adopted son. Grateful to Neil for helping Beth, Phillip voted for him to be reinstated. Anxious to have a future with Beth, Phillip ended his calamitous marriage to Blake however Blake vehemently refused when Beth asked her to give Phillip an amicable divorce. Phillip asked Beth to marry him anyway. Not wanting to rush into anything, Beth said no, but their feelings ran deep and on Valentine's Day 1990 they made love. Beth kept working on Blake to let Phillip go. One day in March, when Blake and Gary were rummaging through Neil's trailer to find away to force Beth to stay with Neil, Beth caught them and after having a major verbal fight with Blake over Blake destroying some of her art sketches, Beth collapsed. When Gary and Blake took Beth to Cedars, they were all shocked to learn from Rick that Beth was pregnant! Beth assumed the baby was Neil's and told Phillip, who suggested they pass the child off as his. Unaware the baby really was Phillip's, Beth decided to be honest with Neil, but Blake told Neil before Beth could when she stole Beth's file from Cedars OB-GYN, Dr. Margaret Sedgwick's office! A furious Neil refused to allow Phillip to raise his child. In April 1990, Beth was ecstatic when Dr. Sedgwick showed her a sonogram revealing her child had been conceived in February 1990, and not in December 1989, which meant the child was Phillip's! However, Neil's jealousy caused him to be dangerous when he cooperated with Gary and planned to kill Phillip with a bomb at the opening of the Waterview Towers. Gary, who learned that Neil killed his family with a bomb a few years ago, later set Neil up and rescued Phillip. During the rescue operation, he struggled with Neil whom he later left for dead when the bomb went off. Later, Phillip became the prime suspect when Neil s last words in Cedars were that Phillip had done this to him. Hoping to clear his name, Phillip faked his death with Rick's help and Beth married Rick to throw the police, especially A.C. Mallet, off track. When she had plans to follow Phillip to Mexico, Beth got pains and when she was rushed to Cedars by Mallet, she gave birth to a daughter, Lizzie. After Phillip returned to town with help of India, he was shocked to see Beth and Rick married. After Gary discovered Phillip was still alive he paid a killer to kill him but didn't succeed. Finally Gary was discovered by Mallet and Roger Thorpe to be Neil's accomplice and murderer. About this time Phillip officially turned up alive and he, Beth and Rick were sentenced to community service outside of Springfield. Beth and Phillip married in February 1991 and, along with Lizzie moved to Arizona to carry out their sentences.</p>
<p>In 1996, Phillip returned to Springfield, against Beth's wishes, to find the family member who had cooperated with Neil and tried to set him up for the Towers bombing five years earlier. Beth kept in touch with Phillip by phone and although she asked him to return very soon, Phillip refused and became obsessed with his search. So Beth had finally enough and after Phillip visited her in Arizona, she left him. At the end of the year, when Alan turned out to be the culprit, Beth sent Phillip divorce papers through Lillian and they divorced. In late 1997, Lillian told Beth about Phillip's new relationship with Harley Cooper and Beth hurried back to Springfield hoping that she could win him back. Although she confided in Phillip that her life wasn't the same without him, Phillip maintained that his life was with Harley now. Anxious to get Phillip back, Beth even used Lizzie by getting her hopes up and having her lie that she wanted to stay at home rather than go with Phillip for the night. That same evening, Lizzie held up the mistletoe for the pair to kiss; as Phillip leaned in to kiss Beth's cheek, Beth turned and kissed him passionately on the lips. Later, Beth warned Harley that she wanted Phillip back to which Harley responded that would never happen. While pining for Phillip, Beth became friends with attorney Ben Warren, who was far from reputable. When Phillip warned Beth about how unscrupulous Ben was, she told him to mind his own business. However, Ben soon realized that Beth was just using him to make Phillip jealous and offered to help. Later, to make Phillip jealous, Beth faked receiving a phone call from Ben, and made New Year's plans with him. Phillip made it known that he didn't want Ben in his house, but Beth said that she will go out somewhere with him anyway. She got herself into more trouble by saying that she has decided to stay in Springfield and accept a job. When Phillip kept pushing her as to what the job is, she wouldn't tell and later admitted to her friend Annie Dutton that it was all a lie. Although, in 1998, Phillip and Beth seemed to bond after looking at old photos, Phillip hurt Beth by telling her that their relationship was in the past. Heartbroken, Beth broke down front of Ben, who reacted by pulling her into a kiss. Beth then appealed to Ben for help in getting her a job to cover up the lie she told Phillip. Later, when Rick refused to help Beth convince Phillip that he loved her, Beth decided to call Harley's ex-husband, Mallet, to get him to get Harley away from Phillip. Unfortunately, Phillip found out which only alienated him from Beth. Later, after her failed seduction attempt, Phillip made it perfectly clear that he didn't love Beth. Shattered, Beth rushed out and attempted suicide by throwing herself in front of a moving vehicle. Guilt-ridden, Phillip offered to stay at the mansion to take care of a rattled Lizzie. In 1998, after overhearing Lizzie ask Phillip not to make her take care of her mommy alone, Harley got suspicious and starting investigating Beth's past in Arizona. In the process she learned that Beth had accidents before. She also discovered that Beth had a boyfriend in Arizona named Carl, Harley decided to find him in order to ask him about Beth. Learning that she was being investigated, Beth blasted Harley, who remained undeterred. Finally, Beth admitted to Harley about her abusive relationship with Carl but left insulted when Harley continued to interrogate her. Beth then told Phillip about Carl and Harley’s meddling before Harley got to tell him her side of it. When Harley finally got to Phillip, he knew the whole story and yelled at Harley for interfering and jumped to Beth’s defense. Not long after, Carl, upon learning that Harley was asking about him, arrived in town threatening Harley to stay out of his business. Although Carl denied hurting Beth, Harley is soon able to trick him into admitting it. Later, she convinced Beth to help her arrest Carl. Using Beth as bait, the plan was for Harley to tape record Carl admitting his abusiveness. Unfortunately, Harley, realizing that she forgot her gun, left the scene before Carl got there. When she returned, Carl was dead and Beth was the prime suspect. During the investigation, Beth learned that Lillian hired a hit man to scare Carl away and was frightened that he killed Carl. At the moment, Beth made the shocking announcement that she killed Carl. While Ben, now District Attorney, didn't want to prosecute her he had no choice, he told her that he'd help her. Meanwhile, Phillip and Harley were suspicious of Beth's confession and Phillip tried to get Beth to tell him the truth, while she coyly tried to get him to admit his feelings for her. Meanwhile, Beth and Ben's friendship deepened and she confessed to him the truth about what happened that night. Later, both lonely and in love with people who didn't love them, Beth and Ben made love. In the meantime, Phillip and Harley kept assuring Beth that she didn’t have to take the rap for Carl’s murder, which only rattled Beth who continued to insist that she murdered Carl, and yelled at them to stop ruining everything. Unfortunately, Phillip did just that when he learned about Beth and Ben's liaison. Angrily confronting Beth, their argument was overheard by attorney Griffin Williams who moved for Ben to be disbarred (since he was sleeping with a suspect and promising her leniency) By the time Phillip realized his mistake it was too late and Ben was thrown off the case. Realizing there was a very real possibility of her going to jail, Beth made plans to flee with Lizzie, however, Rick found out and notified Phillip to stop them. Later, Phillip and Harley got Lizzie to tell them about that night and she admitted that she was the one who killed Carl. The truth out, Lizzie was sent for psychiatrict treatment, while Phillip decided to stay with Beth in an effort to help Lizzie. While Beth had hopes that Phillip would return to her so they could rebuild their family, he made it clear that he was returning to Harley. While still chasing after Phillip, Beth made an effort to exonerate Ben (who was still in danger of disbarment) and defended him to the law board. Soon after, Beth was devastated when Phillip asked Harley to marry him. As Phillip reveled in their engagement, Beth sought comfort in Ben’s arms but he refused to make love to her because his heart is with Blake. Devastated Beth ended up on the Towers balcony, wondering if life was worth living without Phillip; luckily thoughts of Lizzie kept her from taking her life. Lonely and miserable, Beth became attracted to Matt Reardon, who unfortunately was married. Beth's attraction didn't go unnoticed by Matt's wife, Vanessa, though and she continually warned Beth to stay away from Matt. However, Matt himself liked Beth and they continued their relationship, which unnerved Lillian as well since she thought Matt was inadvertently encouraging Beth. Beth's closeness with Matt continued to upset Vanessa, who felt old in comparison. Finally, in 1999, Beth had enough and decided that If Vanessa wanted to worry about Beth coming onto her husband, then she'd give her something to really worry about..and with that she kissed Matt. But when Beth saw Vanessa's pain over her unstable daughter, Dinah, a sympathetic Beth decided to back off on Matt. However, things got complicated when Dinah was accused of murder and Vanessa hid her! When Beth and Matt saw Vanessa drive off with Dinah, Matt tried to cover for his wife while Beth maintained that she wouldn't lie for Vanessa. However, when Lizzie was kidnapped (and later found) a sympathetic Beth agreed to lie for Vanessa. Beth's willingness to protect Vanessa touched Matt and after confiding in Beth that his marriage was probably over, he kissed her. Matt, distraught when he believed that Vanessa stood him up at Towers, started drinking and flirting with a woman at the Towers bar and almost got in a fight with the woman's date before he was rescued by Beth. As they were leaving though, they were spotted by Vanessa, who was angry that Matt stood her up. Realizing that there was a mix-up, Beth tried to set the record straight but didn't when Vanessa suddenly lashed out at her. Although, Beth and Matt almost got passionate when she took him home, she couldn't go through with it and told him that there must have been a time mix-up; Vanessa didn't mean to stand him up. With that revelation, Matt went off to fix his marriage.</p>
<p>Alone again, Beth moved on to a relationship with Jim Lemay, the adopted father of Harley's daughter, Susan. Despite the problem of Phillip and Jim not liking each other, Beth and Jim got closer, with her even faking not knowing how to play tennis so that he could "teach" her. Although her relationship with Jim was going smoothly, Beth couldn't help but be jealous of Jim's friendship with Cassie Layne. Meanwhile, despite the fact that Susan initially bonded with Beth, that all changed when she learned Beth was dating Jim. Vehemently opposed to Beth seeing her father, Susan found out about Beth's lie about not being able to play tennis and told Jim, only to have him berate her for embarrassing Beth. After Beth got Jim to agree to speak to Susan about their relationship. Susan was upset when Jim asked her to accept his romance with Beth. Alone with Beth, Susan vowed that Jim wouldn't stay with Beth. Soon after, Susan learned that Beth and Jim were going away together and decided to derail their plans by spiking Beth's drink, Unfortunately for Susan, there was a mix-up and Susan accidentally drank the spiked beverage. Although Beth tried to get Jim to send Susan away to the therapy camp that Lizzie was sent to, Jim was hesitant and decided to handle Susan on his own. Beth's preoccupation with Jim and Susan put a wedge in her own relationship with Lizzie, who believing that Beth didn't care about her ran away with criminal Annie Dutton! Luckily Lizzie was found and Beth promised her that she'd never let her feel neglected again. Later, Susan picked up on Beth's jealousy of Cassie Layne and made a point of pointing out that Cassie and Jim were both out of town at the same time. Her fears seemed confirmed when Jim, after saying he was in a meeting at San Cristobel, called her and Beth heard Cassie in the background. Certain he and Cassie were on a romantic vacation, Beth booked a flight to San Cristobel, vowing that Cassie wouldn't steal Jim from her. After finding out that Cassie and Jim were registered as Mr. and Mrs. Lemay, Beth got drunk and confronted the couple at a party being attended by San Cristobel's prince, Richard Winslow. After accusing Cassie of trying to bed the prince, Beth was ushered out by Jim who silenced a raving Beth (who blasted him for running off with Cassie) with a kiss. The next day, an angry Jim reveals his real reason for being in San Cristobel with Cassie--to rescue Cassie's sister, Reva and he tells Beth to go home. Later, back in Springfield, Beth decides to go on the offensive and broke up with Jim before he had a chance to break up with her. However, to her surprise, instead he confessed his love for her. Later, the pair got engaged. However, Beth's life still wouldn't be perfect. While on the way to visit the Spaulding construction site in San Cristobel, the helicopter that Beth, Phillip, and Jim were on would crash. Stranding them on a snowy mountain. Believing they were going to die, Beth and Phillip prepared a videotape to be made for their daughter while Jim went away to search for help. Emotions high, they started reminiscing about the past and sought comfort in each other’s arms with the video still recording. After Phillip and Beth were rescued, both decided to keep their lovemaking a secret and go on with their separate lives. Then the unexpected happened: Beth found herself pregnant with Phillip's child in January 2000. Convinced that Phillip would leave Harley to marry her again, Beth told him about the child. When Phillip refused to marry her, she became afraid that Jim would leave her and threatened to have an abortion if Phillip told anyone the child was his. And so worried about Beth's state of mind (as well as his own marriage), Phillip reluctantly agreed to keep the child's true paternity a secret while Beth married Jim, with a reluctant Phillip giving the bride away. Unfortunately, their tryst wasn't a complete secret: the missing video was found by Prince Edmund Winslow who used it to blackmail Phillip. Not knowing that Edmund was blackmailing Phillip, Beth was surprised when Edmund told her that he found out her secret accidentally and promised to keep mum and support her and Lizzie. At the same time this was going on, Beth learned that her daughter was suffering from leukemia. Very scared over Lizzie's fate, Beth was touched by the sensitivity and compassion that Edmund showed her. In the months of Beth's pregnancy, Lizzie's condition continued to worsen, until finally her only chance of survival was a bone marrow transfusion from the child Beth was carrying. With Lizzie deteriorating fast and the baby still not due for weeks, Beth had to make a choice: wait until the baby is born and hope Lizzie survives, or induce labor and hope the baby survives. With doctors telling her the baby's chance of survival were good, Beth agreed to the procedure only for Jim to refuse! Though she and Phillip tried valiantly to change his mind, he was adamant and Phillip was forced to reveal the truth: he was the child's father; With Lizzie's life at stake, Beth was forced to admit the truth to Jim and soon after, with Jim by her side, Beth gave birth to a son, James Lemay. However, despite her pleas for them to be a family, Jim left Beth. However, later, he began to reconsider and told her that to reconcile, she must be willing to live on his terms…and move to Chicago with him and the kids. Wanting Jim to raise her child, Beth agreed to move and tried to kiss him, but Jim backed away, insisting that it will take time for things to heal. Although Beth was more than willing to leave, Susan's attempt to run off with her boyfriend, Max Nickerson, Phillip's objections, and Lizzie's faking a reoccurrence of her illness in order to get them to stay put a stop to their plans and they decided to stay in town. Later, Beth was touched when Jim told her he wanted to adopt her baby. Unfortunately, Phillip objected and, despite Beth's pleas, he refused to allow it and even tried to get custody of his son as well as Lizzie. Wanting to distract Phillip, Beth enlisted Edmund's help in getting Phillip and Harley reunited, not knowing that Edmund was having feelings for her. Meanwhile, Phillip and Jim finally reached a compromise when Phillip agreed to back off his custody suit and Jim agreed to drop his plans to adopt the baby for a trial period of six months. Later, Beth found herself grateful to Edmund again when he managed to locate and befriend Susan who had run away again. Tragically, Jim died on Christmas after rescuing Beth and James when their Christmas tree caught on fire. It was at this time that a lonely Beth started spending more and more time with Edmund, whom'd she already started to have feelings for while still married to Jim. Immediately following Jim's death, Beth found herself leaning on Edmund for emotional support and became enchanted by not only his compassion for her and her children, but also his lifestyle. In 2001, despite the disapproval of both Phillip and Lillian, Beth continued to support and befriend Edmund. With everyone against Edmund, Beth became his sole champion and encouraged him to secure the crown for himself when he discovered he was the true heir to the throne. Remaining fiercely loyal to Edmund, Beth stayed with him in San Cristobel while Phillip took their children home. With the knowledge of Richard's true parentage, an election was called to see who would lead the country. However, when Phillip told Beth that Edmund was fixing the election, she went to Edmund who immediately used the information to his advantage and went to the press himself, calling the election invalid and declaring himself ruler of San Cristobel! Not long after Edmund was coronated, he married Beth who became his princess. Unfortunately, mere weeks later, Beth would learn that everything people had been saying about Edmund was true when she learned that he was holding his sister-in-law, Cassie captive! Confronted by Beth, a desperate Edmund locked her away but Beth was able to escape to Springfield. Although Edmund arrived in town asking her for another chance, Beth refused to give him one unless he turned himself in to the police. Seeing that Edmund wouldn't do that, Beth told him she was getting a divorce, but assured him that she wouldn't testify against him. Not long after, Beth received word that Bradley had died and had left her a silver mine in Colorado. Immediately, she went to Mexico to get a quickie divorce. Unfortunately, Edmund caught up with her and again begged her to go back to him. But Beth refused and ran off. While trying to get away from Edmund, Beth was caught in a flash flood and presumed dead.</p>
<p>Miraculously, Beth survived and five months after being washed away, she found herself in Springfield in 2002. However, to her confusion, she was in prison! Having no memory of the past several months, she demanded to see the Spauldings and was horrified to learn that they didn't believe she was Beth Raines! Uncertain of how she ended up in jail with Edmund and why her family thought she was somebody else, Beth suddenly started to fluctuate between her own personality and Lorelei Hill's! Beth languished in prison for a few days until Alan let her out for Lizzie's sake. Soon after being released, Beth got sick and when being cared for by Lillian, asked her mother to sing their special song. When Beth started singing the song herself, Lillian realized that Beth and Lorelei were one and the same! Beth quickly recovered physically, but mentally was as damaged as ever. Apparently she created the Lorelei persona because she couldn't deal with the world so soon after the flashflood&#160;; Lorelei was strong, funny, and brassy - everything Beth had never been. Though Beth fought Lorelei for control, she lost and Lorelei escaped the Spaulding mansion to be with her beloved "Eddie." Trying to raise money to go to Beth's silver mine in New Mexico, they were almost arrested at a bust during a gambling night at Infierno. After lack of evidence led to no charges being filed, Edmund managed to raise enough money by singing and playing piano. Edmund and Lorelei arrived in New Mexico, but had to fill in for a psychic team to raise more money to pay the man who would take them through the mine. Phillip was hot on their heels, but got trapped in the mine. When Lorelei found out from the hotel owner that Phillip had gone to the mine hours earlier to search for her, Beth again battled her for dominance, and won. Beth raced to the mine to free Phillip, but the mine entrance shut while she was inside, trapping them. Edmund arrived, causing another split between Beth/Lorelei. Beth maintained control, and ordered Edmund out, saying he had destroyed her life and never would again. Edmund accidentally trapped them in the mine a second time, but Beth managed to free Phillip and they found another exit. Having declared their continued love for each other while in the mine, they reunited once returning to Springfield. Beth also had a tearful reunion with her mother and children. After some minimal therapy to deal with her trauma, Beth seemed to be in good mental health. She had retained some aspects of Lorelei's personality: a love of food, a brassiness, high spirits and less of a judgmental attitude. At a party to celebrate her return, Edmund taunted her with the fact that Lorelei was still in there, somewhere, and still loved him. Several days later, he asked for a huge settlement, since Lorelei had promised him such. When Beth said she was mentally ill then, Edmund retorted that she was also mentally ill when she signed the papers, so they were still legally married! Thanks to Ross, Beth learned that her divorce was still valid since she was on her way to getting a divorced when she was washed away. A single woman again, Beth continued her relationship with Phillip but continued to be troubled by thoughts of Lorelei and her friendship with Bill Lewis. While Beth and Phillip reunited was a good idea in concept, the reality was more difficult. Phillip was cold and distant, confused by Beth's changes in personality. Beth was skittish and irritated by Phillip's pompous and patriarchal attitude in taking his son Zach away from Harley. Meanwhile, Bill was always around, flirting with Beth and making her feel free, while Olivia Spencer was kissing Phillip and scheming to break him and Beth up. Then Beth had found a diary she'd written while in Lorelei mode. Olivia found the diary a few days later, and published it. Beth immediately suspected her, but Olivia had her publisher friend say Lorelei had done the deed. Lizzie, Phillip, everyone, including Beth herself, blamed Beth. Beth went to Alan's lake cottage to clear her head, and ran into Bill. In an attempt to remember the past, she kissed him, and their liplock grew passionate. Phillip walked in at just that moment, outraged, telling her off and then stranding her on the island. The final straw broke when Beth learned that Olivia and Phillip had been making out when Alan walked in on them and had a heart attack. Beth and Phillip finally realized they had both changed far too much to be together, and gracefully parted ways. Beth moved into Towers, but Lizzie, who blamed Beth for everything that went wrong, refused to move out of the mansion. Taking this opportunity to relish her independence, Beth invited Bill up to her room for a night of sweaty passion. They began dating in spite of the harsh criticism both received due to their age difference. On the positive front, Alex exposed Olivia’s lie about the diary at Thanksgiving, and Lizzie and Beth began to grow closer again. On the negative front, Beth's clinginess and constant insecurity resurfaced, as Bill's unwillingness to make a firm commitment and his strong bond with Michelle occupied her thoughts more and more. Finally both decided that the relationship wasn't working out and the two amicably parted ways.</p>
<p>In 2003, Beth felt the need to focus on life without leaning on a man for support. Instead she focused on being a good friend and confidant to those around her and being a good mother to her children. However, in early spring, Beth started to worry about Lizzie, who'd returned from boarding school following a fire. Though Beth refused to believe suspicions that Lizzie started the fire herself, soon she became worried. Concerned about Lizzie's reluctance to discuss her feelings and seeing her perkiness as forced, Beth became convinced that Lizzie was repressing her feelings and had her see her therapist, Felicia. Though Beth tried to tell the rest of the family about her concerns for Lizzie's emotional well being, others, namely Phillip and Alan, felt Beth was overreacting and claimed that nothing was wrong with Lizzie. Beth's fears would be confirmed later when Lillian told Beth of her fears that Lizzie caused a pregnant Olivia's fall. Though Beth was doubtful at first, Lillian convinced her that Lizzie was out of control and they needed to intervene on her behalf. Knowing the Spauldings would object, Beth and Lillian whisked Lizzie away to a cabin where Lillian confronted Lizzie with the same accusation. Cornered, Lizzie continually denied that she did anything wrong regarding Ben and Olivia and got exceedingly defensive. Finally, desperate she grabbed a broken shard of glass and threatened to kill herself (which Lillian thought was merely an act to gain sympathy). Luckily, Harley arrived to diffuse the situation and drove a highly defensive and agitated Lizzie back to Springfield. Back in town, she was essentially placed under house arrest by her family who were determined to break through Lizzie's hostility. Meanwhile, Beth finally came face to face with District Attorney, Jeffrey O'Neil, who became instantly attracted to her. Not long after, he went to the Spaulding mansion claiming to want to speak with Alan, however his true purpose was to see Beth. Though Beth tried to feign disinterest, it was obvious that she was attracted to him as well, especially when Jeffrey pulled her into a smoldering kiss. Agreeing to go on a date with Jeffrey, he treated to a dinner at a Japanese restaurant where they impulsively made love in a private room! Though this impulsiveness tended to scare Beth, Jeffrey encouraged her to let her hair down and let some spontaneity into her life. Meanwhile, things finally came to a head with Lizzie, the night of Olivia's baby shower when Lizzie snuck out of the house on the pretense of giving Olivia a gift. When a frightened Olivia refused the gift and asked Lizzie to leave, Lizzie continued to push the gift on Olivia and finally was escorted home by Christopher, her psychiatrist. That night, Olivia found something in her baby crib--a doll's head! Terrified, Olivia skipped town. Though Lizzie tried to deny it and pleaded with her family to believe her, she was unable to convince her family of her innocence. Distraught over her family's mistrust, Lizzie confided in Alan that she was only trying to be a good Spaulding by manipulating events to get what she wanted. She also finally admitted to Christopher that she needed help and she wanted to get back to being that happy girl she used to be. Shortly after Lizzie finally admitted she needed help, Beth's relationship with Jeffrey came to an end. Though she understood that she and Jeffrey weren't serious, Beth was hurt when she saw him leave his room with another woman. Though Jeffrey tried to laugh if off by saying that they weren't exclusive, Beth was hurt and angry and ended their affair. In 2004,Beth, supported Phillip when he was at Ravenwood Mental Hospital following a nervous breakdown. She also tried to help Lizzie restore her emotional health, a task made more complicated with the return of Olivia, who claimed to have lost her child. Although Lizzie's mistrust of Olivia was evident when she suspected her of wanting to kidnap Phillip, Beth and Alan tried to make her see that Olivia wasn't a threat. Unfortunately, Lizzie's mistrust of Olivia would be vindicated when Olivia hastily married a recovering Phillip at Ravenwood! Although she didn't trust Olivia's motives for marrying Phillip, Beth tried to convince Lizzie that they had to accept the situation. Weeks, later, Beth would be shocked when Olivia bursted into the Spaulding mansion demanding to know where Lizzie was. It was then that Olivia finally confessed that her baby was alive after all and she believed Lizzie kidnapped her! Though she defended her daughter, Beth was worried that if Lizzie had discovered Olivia's lie she might have taken that action. The next day, the Spauldings learned that Lizzie had gone to Ravenwood with a baby. At the same time that Olivia was at the hospital demanding her daughter and threatening to lock Lizzie away, the rest of the Spauldings arrived. As Olivia continued to rant about Lizzie, Phillip tried to get her to calm down to no avail. Finally, Phillip saved Lizzie by stating that he'd asked her to bring the baby to him. When Lizzie confirmed the story, Gus ruled it a domestic dispute since Phillip was the baby's father. However, it was clear to Olivia, and even to Beth, that Phillip was covering for Lizzie. Angry at Lizzie, Beth, alone with her daughter, warned her to control her impulses since her actions do have consequences. Days later, fearing that Olivia was going to leave town, Beth confronted Olivia and convinced her that Emma deserved to know her family, even if they are the Spauldings. Still living at the Spaulding mansion, Beth was sought out for advice from Gus (who was found to Alan's son) about how to handle the Spauldings. After admitting that it wasn't easy, and noting that the family will do whatever they want, no matter how much one tells them to do the right thing, she noted that they are fiercely loyal. And as a way of encouragement, she told him that once you're in; you're in. Meanwhile, Beth was shocked to see Phillip (now released from the hospital) hiring a drill sergeant to be Emma's nanny. Having noticed for weeks now that Phillip and Olivia's marriage was loveless, Beth called Phillip on the way he and Olivia were hurting Emma. When Phillip suggested that Beth take charge of Emma’s care. Beth reluctantly accepted the role for the baby’s sake, and was surprised when Olivia supported the idea.</p>
<p>Although Phillip's troubles appeared to be over when he finally granted Olivia her divorce, the Spauldings' troubles were just starting. For on the same day, Gus was set to marry Harley, the Coopers found evidence that Alexandra was involved in the Antimonious drug case, and Gus knew about it. In short order, Harley called off the wedding and Alex was arrested. While Beth tried to console Gus and urge him to fight for Harley, she was shocked by Phillip's decision to bulldoze Company--Harley's father's restaurant! Shocked that Phillip would destroy the Cooper's lives, plus tear down a place that held memories for them both, Beth confronted Phillip who remained cold and unrepentant, simply telling Beth it's only business. Put off by Phillip's new controlling, take-no-prisoners attitude, Beth tried to get through to him, even comparing him to Alan. Unfortunately, Beth's comments fell on deaf ears. Although she disagreed with Phillip's actions, though, she still refused to work against him when Bill suggested the idea. In the meantime, someone was leaking Spaulding information to the press and Beth realized that it was Gus. Although she was prepared to tell Phillip, she kept quiet when it appeared as if Phillip was beyond reason and offered to help Gus help the coopers. While talking to Gus about a way to save Company, Beth remembered that a rare bird lived in the woods behind the restaurant; hence the area was preserved due to environmental issues. Meanwhile, Beth continued to try to reason with Phillip, pointing out that he was setting a bad example for Lizzie, however Phillip refused to listen. Meanwhile, realizing that something was bothering Lizzie, Beth tried to get Lizzie to open up but to no avail. Though she tried to get the information from Phillip, whom she knew Lizzie had confided in, Phillip refused to tell her anything, insisting it'd be better if she didn't know. Finally, Lizzie herself confessed to an incredulous Beth that she'd used a date drug on her boyfriend, Joey. Later, Beth would learn something even more startling from Gus--Lizzie was responsible for a hit and run. Angry that Phillip had known about this, Beth was surprised when Phillip summoned her to the mansion. However, when she got there, it was just her, Harley, and Olivia. Finally, Phillip showed up and apologized to the women for all the pain he'd caused and stated that he was calling a truce. He then left, leaving the woman skeptical as to Phillip's sincerity. That same day, the women were shocked when they discovered that Phillip had made off with all of his children! Although she though Lizzie was with her father, Lizzie arrived at the mansion stating that she was supposed to leave town with Phillip but changed her man. Realizing how far gone Phillip was, Beth objected to Lizzie's plan to find out from Phillip where the children were, but was forced to relent when she saw there was no other choice. Unfortunately, Phillip saw through Lizzie's attempt and revealed nothing. After a few days, Phillip summoned Beth (and unbeknownst to her, others) to Company informing her that if she complied she'd get her son back. However, when she arrived, she was shocked to find Phillip bleeding to death from a gunshot wound! That night, Phillip died and a day later, Gus succeeded in locating the children. In the wake of Phillip's death, Beth and Rick bonded over their shared loss. Meanwhile, Phillip's murderer was found--his assistant Ruth Karloff, who apparently committed suicide by going off a bridge. However, despite Ruth's taped confession, Gus started asking questions about Phillip's death, leaving Beth unnerved. After urging him to let any doubts he had die with Ruth so that all their lives could return to normal, Beth became rattled and angry when she saw a photograph of Phillip. Not long after, it was discovered that Harley was in fact Ruth and had staged the suicide attempt. As a result, Harley was arrested for Phillip's murder. Although Rick was incredulous, in 2005, Beth confessed that she could understand how Phillip in his last days could drive someone to do something drastic. Despite her words though, Beth was still unsettled and was caught by Rick spying on Harley. Confronted, she revealed that she only wanted to understand what drove Harley to do what she did. Unfortunately, Harley caught her also and the two women argued over who was to blame for Phillip's death. Shaken from her encounter with Harley, Beth impulsively kissed Rick as Mel walked in. Mel later angrily confronted the pair. In the meantime, Beth was appearing guiltier to Gus when he overheard her order a maid to get rid of a red stained dress. Convinced the dress was evidence; Gus got Harley to recover it while he started to ask Beth questions about the night Phillip died. Although she stated that the dress was stained with wine, his questions left her rattled. Just as she was about to confess to something, Alan walked in and rescued her from Gus's questions. Days later, Beth, under stress, goes to a spa and is suddenly confronted by Harley. Harley then relentlessly pushed for the truth about what happened the night Phillip died. Beth finally confessed the secret she'd been hiding-- she didn’t kill Phillip but she was fully prepared to run away with him and to kidnap Harley’s children if it meant not losing James and Lizzie. Though shocked, Harley understood how desperate Beth was to keep her children. Though Harley was arrested for skipping bail, Beth paid her fine and neglected to tell anyone that Harley was with her out of the county. A few months later, Beth was horrified when at Harley's trial, Gus viciously cross-examined Lizzie to paint her as Phillip's murderer. At the same time, Beth finally revealed the truth of what she was going to do the night of Phillip's death to Rick, leading him to angrily berate her for her betrayal. In the end, Harley was convicted of murder and sent to prison. Later, Beth noticed the bond between Lizzie and Harley's brother, Coop. Knowing how much Alan hated the Coopers, Beth warned Coop that getting involved with Lizzie could ruin his life. Although both Coop and Lizzie initially balked at this, they soon realized that they were a bad idea and attempted to part ways. Despite their intentions, the couple couldn't deny their feelings and elected to stay together. That summer, the Spaulding family was shocked to learn that Alan was the one who killed Phillip. Disgusted by the kind of man Alan was, Lizzie reacted by moving out of the mansion and in with the Coopers. Not convinced that Lizzie was emotionally stable to be in mature relationship, Beth tried to persuade her to come back home. But Lizzie was adamant about being on her own, even refusing to live in another house with Beth. Deeply worried about Lizzie, Beth went to a jailed Alan for advice and he suggested that they cut off Lizzie financially--forcing her to return home. That same day, Alan made an amazing confession to Harley and Gus--he faked Phillip's death! However, no one, save Harley, believed Alan's story. Since everyone believed Alan was delusional, he was transferred to a mental institution. Before he left, he asked to see Beth and recanted his earlier statement. He told her that he simply made up the story about Phillip being alive in order to keep himself out of jail. Then playing on Beth's insecurities, he told her that he needed her help in protecting her children’s legacy from Gus and the Coopers. Beth was then thrown for a loop when Alan suggested that they marry in order to secure her children's fate. Realizing that the Spaulding power and Spaulding name have meaning for her, Beth decided to accept the proposal. Soon after, on the same day Gus and Harley married, Rick exhumed Phillip's grace and told everyone that Phillip was indeed dead. Beth then married Alan in a quick ceremony at the mental hospital. In retaliation, Lizzie decided to tell her family she was marrying Coop. Very concerned about Lizzie, Beth called Alan. Alan told Beth to get out of town and leave everything to him, leaving Beth to worry about how far Alan would go to stop Lizzie’s wedding to Coop. Her fears were justified when she learned that Alan arranged for Coop to have an accident in his garage when he was fixing his car--a stack of tires came down onto his head. When Coop tried to get his bearings, he accidentally knocked into a gas pipe and deadly gas began seeping into the enclosed garage. Luckily, Coop was rescued by Gus and Harley and no one suspected that Alan was involved—except for Beth and Lizzie. Horrified that Alan would go as far as to hurt Coop, Beth made it very clear that if anyone got hurt their deal was off. Soon after, Alan faked an illness to get himself into the hospital. He summoned Beth and revealed his plan to have her elected the new Spaulding CEO at the upcoming elections, over Gus. Unfortunately, the plan backfired thanks to Lizzie, who on the day of the election, arranged for Beth (who was out of town meeting with stockholders) to be delayed flying back to Springfield. Beth ended up missing the stockholders’ meeting and a surprising person was elected CEO—Harley! Although Beth was irate, Alan remained perfectly calm and assured her that everything would work out in their best interest. Beth wasn't so sure though and although she threatened him with divorce, it was clear it was an empty threat. To her chagrin, Harley was named CEO. Although Beth pretended to welcome Harley into the company it was clear to Harley that it was all a ruse. Later, when Blake published a thinly disguised romance novel focusing on Gus and Harley's romance, Beth, seeing the implications of Blake’s book as her road to becoming Spaulding CEO, fanned the flames of tension between Harley, Gus, and her ex. However, neither Harley nor Gus rose to the bait. Meanwhile, Beth told Alan of her fears that Harley was running Spaulding into the ground and her worry that they’re going to lose the company and their children’s legacy. So, Alan tried to get rid of Harley by setting her up for corporate fraud by having Beth give her fake files. However, that plan failed as well when Harley caught on that Beth was giving her faulty information. When Beth realized what happened she called Alan who put Plan B into action. At Alan’s request, Beth brought him a video he’d hidden at the house for just such an occasion--a security camera view of Harley and Mallet kissing passionately in his office at the prison. He then encouraged Beth to go to the Spaulding shareholders’ meeting and switch the promotional video with his video. Although she got cold feet, Gus unknowingly gave her the will to go through with it when he patronizingly suggested she let him help her get an annulment. However, Beth couldn’t go through with it when she learned Harley’s kids would be in attendance. Later, upon learning that Alan-Michael was back in town, a worried Beth visited Alan to secure her place of power in the family. Her fears were alleviated when she learned that Alan-Michael was an enemy to the family, rather than a threat to her position. Alan then enlisted Beth to win his son back to their side but Alan-Michael blew her off. Meanwhile, Beth overheard a few arguments between Gus and Harley at Spaulding and informed Alan. Believing they could lure Gus to their side, Alan told Beth to convince Gus that in order to save his marriage he had to give Harley and ultimatum-the company or him. Arranging for Gus to do it in front of all the stock holders at the company Christmas party, the plan backfired in a big way when Gus tape recorded their conversation and the entire room heard Beth conspire to oust Harley. Immediately after, Beth was fired. However it seemed like Alan was keeping a secret from her--they did have an ally: Alan-Michael! At the end of the year, Alan informed his family that he'd be released from the mental hospital very soon. Later, Beth - fresh off a very disturbing chat with Alan, told Gus that she was afraid Alan was going to hurt Harley. Gus confronted his father who confirmed Gus’s fears, without actually saying anything incriminating. Later, at Alan’s release hearing, Beth, Alex and Lizzie each make sane, reasonable argument for why Alan needed to remain in custody. However, at that moment, Gus (panicked beyond belief that Alan would hurt Harley) came barreling in, wild-eyed and spewing accusations. He made Alan look like a paragon of sanity in comparison, so Alan was set free. That same day he, and Gus mysteriously disappeared. In 2006, The limo they left in was found crashed by the river and after searching for several weeks, the police declared both men dead when Gus's bloody coat was found in the river.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to everyone in Springfield, the pair had been found and was being cared for, and drugged, in an old abandoned cottage. Their captor was none other than Beth! Seeing Gus behind the wheel of Alan's limo, on New Year's Eve, Beth was worried Gus would do something rash and followed. She witnessed their limo crashing and the two struggling for a gun. Worried what they might do to each other, Beth (unseen) clubbed Alan over the head and dragged him and an unconscious Gus to an old cottage. After securing pain killers from Rick (by claiming that she injured her back), Beth kept both men sedated for a month and told no one in Springfield of their whereabouts. Finally, in February, Gus and Alan both woke up to find themselves locked in a room with no clue how they got there. Finally, with Alan’s help, Gus escaped through the bedroom window and ended up in the kitchen where he found a cell phone. Although he was able to dial Harley's number, Zach answered the phone. Beth happened to be nearby and hearing Gus's voice on the line, intercepted the call, telling Harley it was a wrong number. She raced back to the cabin to find Gus (who'd had an injured leg since New Year's) collapsed outside. Beth carried him in, thus revealing herself to Gus and Alan. She informed them that she'd followed them out of concern about what Gus might to do Alan. She then explained that she found them unconscious and dragged them to this fully stocked cabin. She then lied that a huge snowstorm came and made the roads impassable. At that point, Alan tried to talk her into escaping with him and leaving Gus behind, leading Gus to think this had been a set up all along. But Beth stated that they were all trapped. Although she tried to get the men to set aside their differences and apologize for the harm they'd done to others, Alan refused to apology for anything, leaving Beth extremely upset. Several days later, Alan discovered a recently dated store receipt and realized that Beth has been out shopping - which meant her story was a lie. Alan confronted Beth about her lies and she admitted that she had been to town. Suddenly Beth asked if she and Alan were still partners and he enthusiastically agreed. When Gus came to, Beth tied him up to keep from escaping. But, when Alan started making plans for his triumphant return to Springfield, Beth suddenly clobbered him and informed the stunned duo that she was the one in charge. Suddenly, the two were face to face with a very angry Beth Raines. Although Alan suspected that Beth had reverted to her other personality, Lorelei, she immediately squashed that theory and proclaimed that this was the new Beth who was in control of her life. Later, although Beth drugged Alan into near-catatonia, he managed to untie Gus, who, limping on one leg, escaped. Unfortunately, he didn't get very far and Beth dragged him back in the cabin. Although Alan tried to manipulate Beth into letting them go, she didn't take the bait and informed him that he and Gus had been declared dead and Dinah Marler was now heading his company. Finally having enough of both men, Beth decided to leave them to perish. Filled with guilt, Beth spent a restless night at a motel before heading back to Springfield. There a visibly upset Beth aroused Harley's suspicions when she badmouthed Alan--insinuating that he deserved to die. Then suddenly Beth collapsed! She was rushed to Cedars. Realizing what she'd done and desperate to correct it, Beth was determined to go back to the cabin but was unable to leave the hospital until she convinced Lizzie to help her get out. Extremely conflicted, Beth went to Spaulding Enterprises to figure out what to do. At that point, Mallet arrived. Knowing that mallet and Harley had been investigating Alan and Gus's appearance, a guilty Beth seemed ready to confess but chickened out. She was taken back to the hospital where Rick shocked her by telling her she was pregnant! Apparently, before New Year's Eve, Beth found out that Alan planned on divorcing her. To change his mind and prove her loyalty, she let herself be seduced by him. Now pregnant with Alan's child, Beth realized she could use this to her advantage. She raced back to the cabin and told Alan the news. She then gave him a deal--she'd save his life and get him out of there if he covered for her. Alan agreed. Later, Harley and Mallet finally located the cabin but were told by Alan and Beth that Gus had died, however Mallet and Harley didn't really believe it. Days later, Harley tried to convince Beth to tell her what really happened to Gus, but Beth refused. At that moment, Alan entered the room and Harley was able to swipe his cell phone after overhearing him answer a call and quickly told the caller he'd call back. On a hunch, Harley had Marina trace the number which took her to a mental hospital. There she came face to face with Gus. Back in Springfield, Gus made a deal with Alan--if Alan left Harley alone; Gus wouldn't press charges against Beth for kidnapping. Although Alan could have pressed charges against Gus for kidnapping also, he realized they were at a stalemate and agreed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lizzie was devastated at the end of her and Coop's relationship. Knowing that Coop had already begun seeing Ava Peralta, Beth warned the girl to stay away from Coop. However, Ava refused to be threatened. Afterwards, Beth was shocked when Lizzie announced to everyone that she was pregnant with Coop's child. While Alan felt that Coop shouldn’t be involved in the child’s future, Beth knew Lizzie loved Coop and felt they should marry.. Although Alan urged Coop to step away from his unborn child for Lizzie’s sake, Coop refused and listened to Beth’s suggestion that he marry Lizzie so the child would have a family. Later, Beth blackmailed Alan: either he stayed out of Coop and Lizzie’s way, or she'd take their new baby away from him. Impressed with Beth's ability to stand up to him, Alan suddenly kissed her passionately and asked her to marry him again on a private island resort at San Gabriel. At the resort, Alan told her how impressed he was with her now and how he wanted a true marriage to redeem him. Alan told her that he realized his children abandoned him when he was locked away because he was selfish and ruthless. He realized that he had another chance to be a father and wanted to be respected and admired. Deeply touched by his words, Beth kissed him passionately. Just then Harley and Gus burst in demanding to know if Phillip was alive! Armed with a photo of Phillip, Harley told a shocked Beth that Ross knew Phillip was alive and wanted to bring him home. Attempting to get to Phillip, his plane went down. The truth finally out, Alan repeated the confession he'd given over a year ago--yes, Phillip was alive. But he hadn't heard from him since the doctors refused treatment. Also there was Jeffrey who explained that Phillip hired someone to make sure Ross didn't find him by tampering with Ross's plane and that person could be charged with accessory to murder. Alan maintained that it wasn't it. At this point, the revelation that Alan lied to her to get her to marry him became too much for Beth, and she collapsed. At this point, Alan tried to help her, but an hysterical Beth told him not to touch her. She was then shocked when Rick confessed that he’d known Phillip was alive for almost a year and kept it quiet at Phillip’s request. Rick tried to explain that Phillip was still unstable and he did what Phillip asked in order to protect his son. That same day, Alan visited a hospitalized Beth who angrily told him that she couldn't forgive him for lying to her about Phillip. She then cramped up and miscarried their baby. Meanwhile, Rick visited her and, calling upon their friendship, pleaded with her to forgive him. Beth refused to grant forgiveness and went one step further: she called Dr. Grant, telling him what Rick had done. Rick was then dismissed from the hospital. Later, Lizzie visited and even she tried to get Beth to see that everyone had lied to protect them. Beth’s response was they weren’t china dolls needing men to protect them. She then told Lizzie that all she can count on is herself because the price of counting on a man is too high. Alan was saddened to learn that the baby he'd lost had been a boy; he lost another son. An upset Beth maintained that he lost their son because of his lies and ordered him to leave. Alan tried to talk to Beth about their future and having another child but she angrily slapped him and told him it was over. Soon after, Alan was hospitalized after having a panic attack. Beth visited Alan and stated that although she was glad he wasn't dead, she intended for their marriage to go back to what it was – before any feelings developed. Afterwards, an upset Lizzie called Beth and asked her to meet her at Cedars. When Beth got there, she saw Lizzie talking to Rick and abruptly dragged Lizzie away. Lizzie tried to tell Beth how sorry she felt for Rick and asked why Beth couldn't have helped Rick avoid suspension. Although Beth tried to maintain there was nothing she could have done, she finally lied that she didn't help because she didn't want to. An unforgiving Beth felt that Rick got what he deserved for the lie. Meanwhile, Lizzie started ranting about Jonathan Randall trying to ruin her life and blurted out that he wasn’t the father of her baby—Jonathan was! Although Beth tried to convince Lizzie to tell the truth (since it would come up sooner or later), she agreed to keep the secret for Lizzie’s sake. Unfortunately, Reva overheard their conversation and wasted no time telling Jonathan the truth. Beth tried to remedy the situation by bribing Jonathan to leave town but Josh Lewis ended up tearing up the check and warned Beth to stay away from Jonathan. Meanwhile, Lizzie and Coop made plans to marry ASAP. Although Beth was happy for her daughter, Lillian wasn't and made her opinion known. Lillian tried to get through to Beth by comparing this situation with the time Phillip married Mindy--in both cases the groom did not love the bride. The stroll down memory lane only got Beth upset and she was adamant that Lizzie would get what she wanted--Coop. On the day of the wedding, Beth wanted to make sure that everything went without a hitch and arranged for Ava to be locked in a meat locker during the ceremony. Unfortunately things unraveled when Jonathan, himself, crashed the wedding by declaring that he was the baby's father. During the fracas, Beth accidentally let it slip that she knew about this all along, leading Alan to warn her never to keep secrets from him again. Despite Beth's efforts, Coop walked out of the ceremony and out of Lizzie's life. Beth became increasingly concerned when Lizzie's preoccupation with winning Coop back outweighed her concern for her baby. Later, Lizzie concocted a dangerous scheme to win back Coop--stage a suicide attempt! Though Lizzie almost lost her life in the attempt, she was rescued by Gus and came away with a greater appreciation for the child she was carrying. The next day, Lizzie and Beth concocted a plan to lure Coop back into her life by Beth “fretfully” telling Coop about Lizzie’s suicide attempt. Unfortunately, Alan ruined it by alerting Coop that the attempt was a ruse. A few days later, Alan upset Lizzie again when Jonathan savagely tore up the contract he’d signed reneging on his parental rights (after Alan told Reva she wouldn’t have anything to do with the baby) Later, Lizzie became convinced that Alan had an obsessive concern for her baby, however Beth disagreed. Later, Tammy visited Beth and appealed to her to stop the war between Jonathan and Alan since it would only end up hurting the baby. Unfortunately, Beth sided with Alan—she felt Jonathan was a cancer that had to be dispelled from her daughter’s life. In the next few weeks, things became more and more tense between Lizzie and Alan, especially when Alan hired a psychologist and kept Lizzie under lock and key. Finally, Lizzie had enough and announced she was moving in with Jonathan and Tammy! Though Alan was livid, Beth tried to calm him by stating that Lizzie was asserting her independence. When Alan happily gave Lizzie the keys to her penthouse so she and Tammy and Jonathan could move in, Beth was sure Alan had an ulterior motive. She was right--Alan had a bug on the keychain. A few weeks later, Beth was surprised when Lizzie agreed to go to Italy with her and Alan. Her surprise turned to shock when Alan announced that Lizzie's baby would have the best parents--them. Though Beth was appalled at the thought of taking away Lizzie's own child, Alan won her over by telling her that the baby was a chance at redemption; a chance for him to correct the mistakes he'd made with his other children and a gift to Beth as well. Beth kept quiet to Lizzie as the trio prepared to go to Italy. Unfortunately, Lizzie got the upper hand and set up Alan to be detained at the airport. (by placing a meat cleaver in his brief case) Beth then approached Alan-Michael about helping his father. Although Alan-Michael laughed at first, he relented and agreed to place some calls to get Alan released. After he was released, Alan cancelled Lizzie's credit cards. When Lizzie demanded her money back, Alan refused, and implied that she was unfit to raise her baby. Lizzie became hysterical right in front of Beth, Jonathan and Tammy. When he and Beth returned home, Alan pointed out to a worried Beth how Lizzie was just like Phillip at the end. Later, Alan called a family meeting and informed Beth, Alex, Alan-Michael and Lillian that Lizzie had lost touch with reality. Beth then went to Jonathan and Tammy and asked for help in protecting Lizzie from Alan. When Beth was gone, Lizzie showed up at the mansion and hysterically claimed that Alan wanted to steal her baby and threatened to kill Alan if he tried to take her baby away. That same evening, Alan supposedly went to see Lizzie at her place at the Beacon and she shot him! Though the gun she used was (unbeknownst to her) full of blanks, Alan apparently suffered a heart attack. When Beth went to see Alan, she was astonished to learn that he faked the entire thing--including the heart attack. Alan admitted to that he arranged for Lizzie to be given the gun filled with blanks and set it up so she would shoot him. Alan then, with twisted logic, informed Beth that Lizzie was not fit to be a mother, and he wanted Beth and himself to raise the baby as their own. Again Beth was horrified and tried to convince Alan that he could not replace the child they lost but he refused to listen. He was determined to have what he wanted-- Beth, Lizzie and the baby. Disturbed by what she heard, Beth returned to the bed of the man she'd been having an affair with for weeks--Rick! Apparently, after the Bauer Barbecue the two former friends ended up hooking up and commiserated over their bad marriages. After talking and drinking for hours, the two fell in to bed and began seeking each other out for comfort. Eventually, Beth had Rick's suspension overturned. Though at this point, Rick wanted to end the affair and work on his marriage. Later, when Rick announced that Mel finally felt the same way, Beth asked where she stood. Rick stated that they had to get together and talk. When Beth went to kiss Rick goodbye, he turned his cheek to her. However, when Rick found himself again on the outs with Mel, he sought comfort from Beth. Unfortunately for Beth, their kiss was caught by Jonathan who took pictures. As for Alan, he dropped charges of attempted murder against Lizzie only to take her to court for being an unfit parent. The day of the trial, Jonathan showed Beth the photos he’d taken of her and Rick and blackmailed her with them. Although she refused to testify against Alan, but she did give Jonathan proof of how Alan's been setting Lizzie up. When Alan confronted her about why she was speaking with Jonathan, Beth lied that she was just bribing him. However, Alan did buy it and locked Beth in a bathroom so she couldn't hurt his case. Later, Beth learned from Rick that Jonathan offered to marry Lizzie to ensure she kept the baby. When Beth finally spoke to Jonathan, she threatened to have the marriage annulled but Jonathan stated that wouldn’t be possible, implying that he and Lizzie had already consummated the marriage. He then threatened to expose Beth and Rick’s affair if she made trouble for him and Lizzie. In the meantime, someone did threaten to squeal about Rick and Beth’s affair—Rick. Beth accidentally let it slip that Jonathan was blackmailing her and had pictures. Tired of lying to his wife, and afraid that she would find out the truth from someone else, Rick told Beth he intended to tell her everything. Realizing that once Mel knew, Alan would find out, Beth begged him to keep their secret but Rick was adamant. Racing after Rick, Beth followed him to Main Street where he was ready to meet Mel. Luckily for Beth, she spotted Leah and brought her over to Rick and Mel before he had a chance to say anything. Not wanting to make the confession in front of his daughter, Rick kept mum. Several weeks later, things got tense during a family dinner with the Billy and Reva and finally erupted in a shouting match. It all became too much for Tammy and she ran out. Fueled by Tammy’s words, Jonathan decided to show everyone how “respectable” people behaved and produced a photo of Beth making love to Rick! The dinner at Towers erupted into chaos and Alan left with Beth quickly running after him. At home, a cold Alan reminded her that their relationship started for the sake of business, but he believed that it had grown into a real marriage over time. Though Beth tried to explain herself, saying that she was angry at him because he hadn’t told her that Philip was alive, he wasn’t interested and gave her a choice. She could either leave, taking nothing but the clothes on her back or she could stay and consider her marriage vows, especially “death to us part”. Days later, after a confrontation with Mel, Beth got drunk and then was approached by Alan. Alan announced to Beth that he was having her followed from now on and after intimidating her, enlisted her in getting rid of Ava for Olivia. Beth did what she was told and approached Ava. Beth was basically blunt and honest with her, but Ava refused to leave Olivia alone – especially when Alan-Michael arrived to diffuse the situation. Afterwards, Beth confessed to Alan-Michael that she loved being Mrs. Alan Spaulding and claimed that was enough, until a better option came along. In the meantime, Beth tried to lure Rick back but he insisted that he wanted to work on his marriage and offended Beth by stating that what they had was not "real". Believing that Rick didn't belong with Mel anyway, Beth pulled some strings and arranged for Rick to be transferred to the clinic in Clayton--with her as his boss. Meanwhile, weeks later, Lizzie finally had her baby--a girl. The day of the baby's birth, Alan served Jonathan with a legal document asking for custody again. Jonathan--fed up with fighting with Alan proposed, for the sake of Lizzie and the baby, to move his new family into the Spaulding Mansion. Unfortunately for Alan, Jonathan's offer was an empty one. While Alan's guard was down, Jonathan secretly whisked Lizzie and the baby (who was suffering from a heart murmur) out of town. With the pair out of town, Alan went to court to get custody of the baby. In court, Beth awkwardly admitted that Jonathan fled town because Alan threatened to sue for custody. (which she really didn't know) Unfortunately for Alan, the case was dismissed. Not long after, Lizzie and Jonathan returned with the baby, whom they named Sarah. Alone with Beth, Lizzie bemoaned the fact that Jonathan didn't love her but confessed that Sarah was the best trick she had to woo Jonathan away from Tammy. Weeks later, after Christmas, Beth found Jonathan's wedding wing at the Jessup farm and realized that he'd had a tryst with Tammy. Beth confronted Jonathan but decided to keep quiet for Lizzie's sake.</p>
