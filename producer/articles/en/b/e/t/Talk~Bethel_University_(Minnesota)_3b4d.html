<p>Where does this loathing come from? As I wage an internal war I wonder. I do not understand the idolisms of the Christians in this present age towards figure heads (musicians, pastors) whom (I am sure) wish only to honor God (through whatever medium best suits their abilities). As this is common, it begs the question; whose faith do you follow, and even more frightening, whose faith do I follow? Do we merely follow the lead of the pretty, innocent face on the huge poster outside these chapel walls? Or do we have our own, real faith?</p>
<p>As the song says, “this is my story.” This leads to my next question; what are we doing? Is this life really worth wasting on standing in row after row, swaying back and forth to music that does not mean anything to me? I wonder if I am truly the odd one, am I the only one who sees this as a mere ritual, a meaningless ritual. Why is this the standard for worship? Why are we looked upon as pagans if we do not partake in this ritualistic event? To confine worship to a sway and a power point presentation is to sell short the creativity of God’s creation. Do we not owe God more than a few cheap words sung in the key of C? Is it arrogance to wonder if you really have acceptable advice for me regarding my relationship with God? Too often an individual’s relationship to the ALMIGHTY CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE is reduced to a calculated equation</p>
<p>Go to Church on Sunday + Sing in Chapel – Sinning = Loving God?</p>
<p>Where did we go wrong? Are we so naive to think that my relationship with God is the same as yours? Do we know the same God? Is a relationship not dynamic? Does it not change with time and circumstance? So why follow the equation that our idols have given us? Security. We want to believe that if we do all the right things, all the things dictated to us through the culture of American Christianity, we can know that heaven will follow this life. Maybe it’s true. And it’s okay. Needing security is totally natural. So wanting to have security in our relationship with God is not only natural, it’s part of the package, but you would never know that as the human puppet to theological whims of the American Christian idols.</p>
<p>It’s not about you. It’s not about me. It’s not about what you think God wants you to do. It’s not about “stepping out of your comfort zone.” It’s not about all the things you have to do today. Ultimately, it’s about a man, a God, who, 2000 years ago, decided it was worth giving his body to brutal death, and allowing for the most horrific rape and ravaging a soul has ever known so that 2000 years later that students at Bethel, that I, would have a hand to hold, a way out of this hell.</p>
<p>So where does the loathing come from? It comes from a weary heart, sick of seeing hypocrisy. Weary from seeing more guilt and more punishment heaped upon the broken body of my rescuer by those who claim to be holding his hand. Weary from seeing those same people swaying back and forth in chapel later drunk or on their drug of choice, or slandering others, or outside of marriage, and the list goes on. What a mockery. Am I innocent? I wish I could say I am, but the truth is I am just as guilty, but the difference is in the heart. So wake up (Bethel), your days on this earth are numbered.</p>
<p>Response: ....for a person who is working so hard at questions like this.. "Are we so naive to think that my relationship with God is the same as yours? Do we know the same God?" ..you are doing a pretty good job of projecting your own assumptions on the actions of others. Just because these things have no meaning to you does not mean others are not finding real contact with a real God. In addition: "So wake up (Bethel), your days on this earth are numbered."....isn't this true of us all? And haven't people been saying this about the entire Christian religion since the days of Christ? To answer your own quaetion "am I the only one?"..no. You are not the only one to ask these questions. Neither are you the only one with insight or a real relationship with God, as you seem to think.</p>
