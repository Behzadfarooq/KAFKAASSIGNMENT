<p>Bethany was founded in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a> by the Reverend Joseph James Kendon as a Christian community for pupils to attain maximum potential by being treated as individuals.</p>
<p>In 1959 the school became a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_Trust_6985.html" title="Charitable Trust">Charitable Trust</a>.</p>
<p>The late 1970's saw the construction of Pengelly, a boarding house.</p>
<p>In 1985 the squash courts were officially declared open.</p>
<p>After over 120 years of being an all boys school, Bethany School started admitting the first girls in the 1990's.</p>

<p>The Bethany School entrance exam is used for determining admissions for prospective pupils aged 11-13. For entry by prospective pupils further up the school, especially in the Sixth Form the school may conduct interviews, examine reports or require references.</p>
<p>Entrance exams can be arranged specially, however normal scheduled exams are in November and March. As the school admits a large proportion of overseas students, admission can be arranged to take place at the pupils current school.</p>

<p>Bethany has a wide variety of sport. Rugby, football and cricket are among the most popular sports that the school offers. There are often matches between other schools, usually from the county of Kent.</p>
<p>Badminton and squash are played throughout the year, often by pupils not wishing or able to participate in the main team sports of the season. Such people usually choose the group called 'general activity'. Basketball is played occasionally, but this limited due to the use of the area being predominantly used by badminton.</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of clubs available to pupils. These range from Art &amp; Crafts, to range shooting, archery, table tennis and many more.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Duke_of_Edinburgh%27s_Award_6b4b.html" title="The Duke of Edinburgh's Award">The Duke of Edinburgh's Award</a> scheme is participated in by many students usually from year 9 upwards. This is a three stage award, from Bronze, Silver to Gold. The Gold Award if achieved is presented by the Duke of Edinburgh. The majority of pupils fail to attain the Gold Award, usually dropping out before achieving Bronze usually due not having signed off enough skills activities.</p>
<p>Business Studies pupils have the option in the Sixth Form of participating in <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Enterprise_70d2.html" title="Young Enterprise">Young Enterprise</a>, a charity scheme where pupils form a business and attempt to generate profits for shareholders.</p>

<p>From 1999 to 2005, Bethany School saw a major development of much needed new buildings.</p>
<p>The first in the series of buildings constructed under the recent development plan was the 6th form house, The Orchard. This was completed in 1999 and was able to provide a separate living area for Upper Sixth pupils who in previous years would have had to remain in houses Kendon and Pengelly. The development costs were a reported £1 million.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The very outdated and disrepairable changing rooms were replaced in 2001 with a far more modern and sizable sports complex in a more well placed location amongst the other sports facilities. This not only provided changing rooms but also a new 'weights room' and also a rock climbing wall.</p>
<p>A new library was completed in 2002 (replacing the old changing rooms), and the previous unsuitably small library was converted into a drama studio. The library has been very well received, especially by the Lower 6th who have a much more modern and resourceful library for private study.</p>
<p>A building to house Business Studies and Geography was completed in 2003. This was required as more subjects were sharing classrooms, creating time-slot conflicts and a less appropriate working environment.</p>
<p>In September 2005 the completely reconstructed and redesigned dining hall complex was completed, being the most recent addition to the schools development plan. This provides for a modern approach to catering repasts for the increasing number of students, and more formal occasions such as Old Bethanian society reunions.</p>

<p>Bethany has historically, and continues to put a strong emphasis on community<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>; extra-curricular activities are wide and numerous, however, contrary to the current prevailing thesis of increasing physical activity, Bethany has dramatically cut the amount of sport that pupils take part in. Saturday School has been abandoned in favour of a five day week. The Sports Department has been criticised by the Independent Schools Inspectorate because "A2-level results have been slightly below the national average and the school’s average" and also because "the acoustics in the sports hall are far too resonant".<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Head of Games as of 2007 is Philip G Marriott, <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certificate_in_Education_d611.html" title="Certificate in Education">CertED</a> (PE).</p>
<p>It is compulsory for all students (but not staff) to attend religious worship.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The school was respectably rated 52nd in Kent for GCSEs and 48th for A-Level results in the 2006 <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/performancetables/" class="external text" title="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/performancetables/" rel="nofollow">League Tables</a>. The headmaster, Nick Dorey, who does not endorse League Tables, commented on the results by saying "I only ever look at the league tables very briefly, because I know what our students have achieved and therefore it doesn't tell me anything I don't already know."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The mount is for boys from year nine - a handful of which stay on until the Lower Sixth. The mount previously consisted of two buildings when Paul Holmes was house master.

<p>This is the newest boarding house, originally intended for Upper Sixth pupils only it has been forced by space requirement to accept Lower Sixth pupils. It is widely viewed as the best house due to a wide range of facilities and generous proportions. Facilities include en suite rooms, a kitchen, snooker table room, sitting room and lounge. There is also a bar which opens in the evening on weekends and occasionally other days (usually if the following day is a holiday). The supply is limited, and pupils are not allowed to store drinks they purchase.</p>

<p>Bethany School was one of the first schools in Kent, if not England to begin requiring most pupils to purchase laptops for use in classrooms. In September 1999, Year 9 was the first year to adopt this principle and since then the whole school is now very focused on providing learning materials for laptops, and creating lesson plans with the use of laptops. Most of the classrooms have since 1999 been fitted with projection systems for computers, and are also capable of displaying video content. In this regard Bethany School is regarded as being at the forefront of technology for schools.</p>
<p>In 2001 the school got wireless Internet technology, revolutionary at the time. Although initially fairly localised to the main complex, this has since been extended to reach as far as Old Poplars and the Music School. This saw a great decline in <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_technology.html" title="Information technology">IT</a> room use as pupils were now able to access a world of information through the Internet from their own laptop computer.</p>
