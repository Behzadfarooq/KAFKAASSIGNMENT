<p>Murmuring. Murmuring is to air some sort of grievance with another person, either within the church or even worse, outside. The grievance itself could be something very minor, or some resentment about treatment by the ministry. It supposedly has the effect of poisoning the heart of the other person, which if they are an outsider is particularly bad since it could stumble them and thus prevent them receiving salvation. It is often preached against, and held up as one of the reasons the church does not reach its potential in the world. From a control point of view, those leaving the church have often eventually seen this teaching as a control mechanism. This alone is one of the main reasons many in the church do not see the depth of control being used. Those disciplined behind the scenes in harsh ways are often reluctant do discuss what has happened to them, seeing it as murmuring to do so.</p>
<p>Gods Perfect/Permissive Will. This is an important teaching in the church. Basically, God has a perfect will for a Christians life. The Devil constantly tries to hamper that plan. Each time a Christian commits sin, the Devil has an automatic right to contest Gods will for that persons life. God is absolutely just, so the Devil gets what he's after. This is where Gods permissive will comes in. God will turn the mistake around to something good in the end, but the result will never be as good as Gods original plan for that persons life. The same happens in the church as a whole. Each time a church member commits some sin, the Devil gains entrance into the church and is able to hamper what God wanted the church to do. The result is that the congregation will frequently be 'blasted' in a message from the platform. They will be told God wants to work miracles within the church, but he cannot until sin is removed. Murmuring (see above) will often be mentioned here, and held up as one of the reasons God cannot do what he wishes to do.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethel_Church_1cd4.html" title="Edit section: King's Chapel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">King's Chapel</span></h2>
<p>A sister church known as King's Chapel is located in Norwich, CT, USA. King's Chapel in Norwich, lead by Sam J. Wibberley, is a controversial organization that incites strong reactions from those affected by the church and those who are participants. While anyone is free to leave the church, many ex-members describe practices rampant with mental abuse, charlantry, and dominance. Detractors claim that those who leave the church spread lies out of revenge or misguidance.</p>

<p>December 19, 1987, Ronald Allen of Preston, CT committed suicide through carbon monoxide poisoning in his car. Allen had begun counseling shortly before his death but had been discouraged from seeking help with 'outsiders'. The church had been pressuring him to sell his home on Amos Lake in order to move closer to other church members and to donate profits from the sale to the church.</p>
<p>December, 1994, Martha Davis attempted to commit suicide by an overdose of painkillers. She had been forced by the church to take care of the McPhauls family, including providing shelter, food, and cleaning for them. Martha felt controlled and abused and as though she had no control over her life. Her son was sent on a trip to England to stay with members of the Bethel Church which eventually led her into a deep depression, coming to a head as an attempted suicide. After she was released from the hospital, she asked church elders and Sam Wibberly for time off of caring for the McPhauls and for her son to come home so she could be with him. Wibberley responded by saying that she should apologize to the McPhauls for scaring them and that her son could not come home as her suicide attempt had ruined much of what they had accomplished with him. In the year 2000, Martha successfully committed suicide.</p>
<p>September 14, 1996, Joshua K age 21, confessed to allegations of child abuse to local authorities, after an all night session of "counseling" by Sam Wibberly and other church elders. Josh recanted his story 48 hours later after two full days of constant pressuring and harassment from church members: he stated that brainwashing and suggestion had compelled him to tell such a story to the local police.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, James L of Mansfield Woodhouse confessed to allegations of child abuse to local authorities, also after numerous sessions of "counselling" by pastors of the Bethel Church. James, in his mid-teens at the time, had earlier been sent to stay with pastors of the Connecticut sister church for several months to receive "help" there. After his return to his home, the counselling intensified. Following one late-night phone call to say "the team" were again coming over to see James, he threw himself from an upstairs bedroom window in an attempt to escape. However the "counselling" continued, and he eventually broke. After his confession, James was placed into care with the social services for several years. The case against him was later dismissed after experts who had seen James testified in court that it was their opinion his confession had been the result of brainwashing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethel_Church_1cd4.html" title="Edit section: Wibberley Tire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wibberley Tire</span></h2>
<p>Sam J. Wibberley owns a tire shop in Danielson, CT, which has been accused of using forced labor of church members to support it. Church members from England are said to work there from time to time for no pay and without working visas. Local church members have been said to work there for either a stipend or no pay in order to attone for sins committed. Ex-members in the past have reported such abuses to the IRS but the only legal action that have ever really been taken was when an ex-member sued for back wages. Despite working for 3 years without pay, Glenn Bissonette only received 60 days of back pay because the statute of limitations had expired.</p>
