<p>The yeshiva is currently under the direction of a group of four <i><a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosh_yeshiva.html" title="Rosh yeshiva">roshei yeshiva</a></i>: Rabbis <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryeh_Malkiel_Kotler_3010.html" title="Aryeh Malkiel Kotler">Aryeh Malkiel Kotler</a>, Yeruchem Olshin, Dovid Shustal, and Yisroel Neuman. Rabbi Malkiel Kotler is a grandson of Rabbi <a href="../../../a/h/a/Aharon_Kotler_ee1f.html" title="Aharon Kotler">Aharon Kotler</a> and son of Rabbi <a href="../../../s/h/n/Shneur_Kotler_d878.html" title="Shneur Kotler">Shneur Kotler</a>, and the others are married to Rabbi Aharon Kotler's grandaughters. Rabbi <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matisyahu_Salomon_52db.html" title="Matisyahu Salomon">Matisyahu Salomon</a> serves as the <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Mashgiach_ruchani.html" title="Mashgiach ruchani">mashgiach ruchani</a></i> and is a well-known lecturer on topics relating to Jewish religious growth and communal issues in the yeshiva world. He has also authored many books on the topic of spiritual growth and development.</p>
<p>The financial and administration duties are under the leadership of Aaron Kotler, who is a grandson and carries the name of the founder of the yeshiva. He is also the brother of the Rosh Hayeshiva Rabbi <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryeh_Malkiel_Kotler_3010.html" title="Aryeh Malkiel Kotler">Aryeh Malkiel Kotler</a>.</p>

<p>The yeshiva studies are based on classical <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_study.html" title="Torah study">Torah study</a> traditions using the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulchan_Aruch_cbbe.html" title="Shulchan Aruch">Shulchan Aruch</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Responsa.html" title="Responsa">responsa</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbinic_literature.html" title="Rabbinic literature">rabbinic literature</a> as texts and sources.</p>
<p>The daily schedule consists of three <i>sedorim</i>, or study sessions, devoted to study, plus <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_prayers_and_blessings_39fa.html" title="List of Jewish prayers and blessings">daily prayers</a> and meals. In each session there is usually a main <i>limud'</i> (field/focus of study) based on the Talmud. However there also exists a system of <i>chaburahs</i> (group study) where 10-70 scholars form a <i>chaburah</i> (group) to study specific sub-texts within the Talmud and/or Shulchan Aruch. All of these take place in one of the over eight study halls available throughout the four study buildings of Beth Medrash Govoha.</p>
<p>The main <i>limud</i> is always a part of Talmud and is never part of Shulchan Aruch. However the way the Talmud is studied might include the relevant portion of the Shulchan Aruch as an adjunct and complimentary study. Each "chaburah" may differ in the amount of time spent studying the Shulchan Aruch.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each semester the first day is designated as the <i>tumult day</i> (implying a "rowdy/noisy/busy gathering"). On this day all the students of the yeshivah gather outside the main yeshivah building on 7th street and arrange their <i>chavruses</i> (study partners) for the coming semester, as well as what particular "limud" (subject matter) they will be studying, which is done through joining a <i>chaburah</i> (study group).</p>
<p>Every <i>chaburah</i> has a <i>Rosh Chaburah</i> (head/leader of the study group). It is the Rosh Chaburah's responsibility to arrange enough seats for the members of his <i>chaburah</i> and to decide the <i>limud</i> (subject of study) that will take place for the rest of the semester, as well as make sure that there is a lecture given on the subject studied at least once a week. Many "chaburos" also require members to prepare and give lectures on a rotating basis. This is always in addition to the Rosh Chaburah's weekly lecture.</p>
<p>After <i>tumult</i> day is over, the Rosh Chaburah submits his list of members to those responsible for arranging the seat layout in each study hall. When all lists from all the Rosh Chaburahs have been received, a map of each study hall is posted with highlighted areas designating the seats that belong to each Chaburah.</p>

<p>The registration and acceptance into Beth Medrash Govoha can be divided into two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Test and acceptance</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p><a name="Application" id="Application"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Medrash_Govoha_c664.html" title="Edit section: Application">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Application</span></h3>
<p>Applications to enroll into the yeshiva are accepted twice a year, in the summer for the winter semester, and in the winter for the summer semester. There are no enrollments for the fall semester. The deadlines vary, and they are generally close to the 1st of <a href="../../../e/l/u/Elul.html" title="Elul">Elul</a> for enrollment in the winter, and the 1st of <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adar.html" title="Adar">Adar</a> for enrollment in the summer.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Medrash_Govoha_c664.html" title="Edit section: Testing and acceptance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Testing and acceptance</span></h3>
<p>This is generally a four part process. Only applicants who have received a "bechina (entrance exam) card" authorizing them to advance will be able to proceed with these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The applicant completes a secondary registration application which asks for more detailed additional information that was not required on the original application.</li>
<li>The admissions officer, Rabbi Yaakov Pollak, holds a general interview with the applicant. With him are usually one or two other members of the faculty. The meeting will usually be short, allowing the admissions department an opportunity to evaluate the candidate's general potential for success in the institute.</li>
<li>A faculty member tests the candidate in general Talmudic knowledge. A grade is issued, on a scale of one to five, reflecting the applicant's possession of the requisite knowledge.</li>
<li>One of the four roshei yeshiva (deans) listens to a <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilpul.html" title="Pilpul">Pilpul</a>, or talmudic discourse, from the applicant. This part of the exam is to test the applicant's ability to engage in specialized Talmudic reasoning called Lomdus. Here too, a grade is issued on a scale of one to five.</li>
<li>After completing the two exams, the resultant grades are forwarded to Rabbi Yaakov Pollak with whom the decision of acceptance rests. The acceptance will depend on a combination of all the factors in the admissions process. Usually applicants are notified during <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chol_HaMoed_2121.html" title="Chol HaMoed">Chol HaMoed</a> about the decision. If the applicant is accepted, he and his parents are then required to set up a meeting with the tuition department to discuss tuition arrangements.</li>

<p>After acceptance, tuition is negotiated, and the accepted student must complete steps required by the State of New Jersey of all students entering dormitories and post-secondary schools in New Jersey. These steps include obtaining health insurance (either through their parents or through the Yeshiva's student insurance plan), and obtaining required vaccinations for measles, mumps, and rubella; a second measles shot; and the meningococcal vaccine. In the signed acceptance agreement, the matriculating student is required to agree to abide by the rules of the institution. These include agreeing to what is commonly known as the freezer (see below). An additional rule requires students not to access the internet in the dormitory, and limits internet use to business-related activities for married students.</p>

<p>Tumult day is a distinct feature of Beth Medrash Gevoha. The first three days of every semester all the students gather outside the main building on 7th street. It is at this time that <i>chavrusos</i> (study partners) must be arranged. Among other things, students discuss with potential study partners what <i>limud</i> they would like to study, and also make sure that the study partnership has the potential to succeed, both on a personal level and on an intellectual level. Additionally, it is at this time that students are required to arrange entry into a particular "chaburah", or study group. This intense and highly competitive method is unique to Beth Medrash Gevoha.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Beth_Medrash_Govoha_c664.html" title="Edit section: &quot;The Freezer&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"The Freezer"</span></h2>
<p>"The Freezer" is a term used in Beth Medrash Govoha to signify that a student at the institute is still within the first three month of matriculation into the yeshiva. Upon acceptance into the institute, every non-married student is required to agree in writing that he will not date for a <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shidduch.html" title="Shidduch">shidduch</a> during this time. Although on the most part the rule is followed, a large percentage of the students start dating after two to two-and-a-half months. According to the rules, if one gets engaged during those three months, he will be asked to leave the yeshiva. The exception to this would be if, when signing the paper above, he indicated that he was planning to or is in the process of dating a particular woman.
