<dd>It works. As you get more experienced with wikipedia, you can change the colors on the box.

<p><b>Thanks</b>--Hello, Thank you for your compliment on my User Page. The concept was mine, but believe me, I had to reach out for the technical help to make it happen. My work (in many ways, life) has been sitting across from flesh and blood people trying to help them untangle the emotional knots they have found themselves in. There I'm comfortable because it's familiar to me. It's taking me longer to be comfortable sitting across from a machine that is essentially 1s &amp; 0s. I am comfortable with the information within Wikipedia, where my task is to extract that information and, in my own way, I hope improve on it. I saw that message regarding Wiki e-mail &amp; wondered what it was wanting me to do &amp; why. The wetter my feet get at this, the more comfortable I feel with the structure, the more I will be able to contribute to the content. Right now I'm still learning.

<dd>By the way (in reference to your 12/13 blog post), the record is that he was seen to mouth a threat to the jurors after the verdict - or at least words that could be interpreted as a threat. It's at 13654-55 in the slip opinion you link to. I fully agree with you, though, that news reports of legal proceedings, particularly in emotional cases like this one, typically get the legal bits wrong. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 20:20, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm just a news junkie and I got interested in the story and then was drawn here and started workng on the story. I don't know how much time I'll have to stay with it though in the next few days (busy with the day job, etc.), other than possibly reverting a few vandals. Yes, Phelps is a freak. He doesn't even seem to have a point of view anymore, other than to protest at prominent funerals. I took the first stab at editing that down, because it was perhaps somewhat notable.

<p>Hi again Beth Wellington, More good work on the Sago mine story! I'm going through the whole article and cleaning it up and I have a few questions for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you think about moving and/or copying some of the detail on Randal McCloy's treatment to <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randal_McCloy_562e.html" title="Randal McCloy">Randal McCloy</a>. There's more info on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Sago_Mine_disaster_7928.html" title="2006 Sago Mine disaster">2006 Sago Mine disaster</a> about McCloy than there is on the McCloy page and maybe it should be the other way around. I'm sending this directly to you rather than posting it on the talk page because it seems you've been really involved in that particularly area, but I'll post it there as well.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>I noticed you're using lots of external links throughout your writing. I'm not exactly sure of the Wiki style for that, though you use a lot more than most editors. It could just be a matter of personal taste. But one thing I'm pretty sure of is that when you add an external link that displays as just a numbered superscipt you're supposed to also add the full reference at the bottom in the References list (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28links%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28links%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28links%29</a>).

<p>Lyndon LaRouche associate Paul Gallagher is mentioned in some lists of the convicted, but I can't recall where I saw the precise charge.

<p>Hi Beth, regarding the conviction of LaRouche associates, the book Railroad, available from the same people also includes FBI and other US government documentation. I know most people think they need other sources to confirm certain things and I fully agree in many respects. There are certain times, such as with a new discovery, one must study for one's self whether the discovery is real or a fraud. I like this method with everything, not only physical science. I have looked at the Railroad book. Its good. Have fun doing your research. I don't doubt that you do a much better job at journalism than the staff of the Wall Street Urinal.

<dd>Well, you can see what happened an to one idea at Legality of warrantless surveillance - that's the upshot of the all the fuss archived at <a href="../../../n/s/a/Talk%7ENSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy_Neutral_Point_Of_View_is_not_The_Truth_3523.html" title="Talk:NSA warrantless surveillance controversy/Neutral Point Of View is not The Truth">Talk:NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy/Neutral_Point_Of_View_is_not_The_Truth</a>. I decided to append the legal section to the fork but otherwise just leave it alone. Then came the drive from the other side to Rove the title. If the lefty daughter, at which the righties looked and laughed, were invaded with NPOV, then NSA warrantless would be counterattacked with POV I expect. No attacks means I've got time to scope out what Steve Ballmer is up to.

<dd>I think "the deliberate choice of a modern elite to foster hatred and fear to keep itself in power" (a quote from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/" class="external text" title="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/" rel="nofollow">Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda</a>) plays a key role - "masquerade of legitimacy" is another quote from the report. What to do about it? Expose it. Congress is inclined towards a bi-partisan effort to create judicial oversight of the Program. Poindexter's data mining concept (killed by Congress) funded DARPA contract F30602-03-C-0037 at <a href="http://www.parc.com/research/projects/privacyappliance/" class="external text" title="http://www.parc.com/research/projects/privacyappliance/" rel="nofollow">PARC</a>. This work could be applied to NSA, which would then have to convince a judge to order particular personal identity filters inactivated. Oversight created, 4th ammendment still kicking.

<p>Thanks for picking me up on the appropriate category. I was on New Pages patrol, focussing on getting uncategorised articles into cats. I wasn't quite sure where to put that one, but figured if I put it there, someone in-the-know would pick up on it. I figure it's best to put these things <i>somewhere</i> where they'll be noticed, rather than leave them to disappear into the quagmire. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 22:07, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Beth. I saw you added your name to the list at Organized Labour, so I thought I'd say hello. As I'm sure you noticed, it's still a pretty small project, so it's great to have another interested editor. Cheers.

<p>Hi there - for reasons beyond my control, the en.wikipedia database is no longer replicated to the toolserver. If this article is fairly new, it would be safe to assume that it is not in the database on the toolserver due to replication issues.

<p>Yes, there are many credible folks you'll meet in Wikipedia. Many academics, some wish to not disc;ose their expertise, preferring to edit articles unrelated to their training. I am in that category...I have ot made one edit tomy expertise, instead working on articles that take me back tomy past...land management. While working on the article <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850.html" title="Retreat of glaciers since 1850">Retreat of glaciers since 1850</a>, I had the pleasure of working with one of the foremost glaciologists in the U.S., a telescope engineer, a doctor of philosophy (and a computer whiz) and a number of other folks that made the article a featured article...I wouldn't have been able to do this without their help. There are a number of promenient persons that edit here and any expert is always welcome so long as they abide by the principle of NPOV...in some circumstances, some experts have very strong opinions about things so it hasn't always worked out well. Good work and hope you are also doing well.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:34, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope my newly added comment clears things up. I deleted the section, as I said, after a) no one but r3m0t objected, and b) after he let more than a day pass without re-objecting. As I stated in my comment on the talk page, if anyone objects they can revert and I won't get into a revert war, I'll go on arguing. To me it looked like only r3m0t thought the section was worth keeping, and even he'd given up on it. Obviously I was wrong about the latter, but since no one but him has complained about the deletion I suspect I'm right about the former. --<a href="../../../s/o/t/User%7ESotonohito_080c.html" title="User:Sotonohito">soto</a> 10:47, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is considered <i>highly inappropriate or unacceptable</i> to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated in order to attract users with known views and bias, in order to strengthen one side of a debate. It is also considered highly inappropriate to ask friends or family members to create accounts for the purpose of giving additional support. Advertising or soliciting meatpuppet activity is not an acceptable practice on Wikipedia.

<p>Thank you for your response. I am still troubled by someone editing my talk page by deletion, rather than by adding a comment. I agree that the tone on the query was problematic, and by the way, I haves seen worse, but I took that into account in my response on the AfD page.

<p>Hi.

<p>By the way, nice work on the <a href="../../../s/a/g/Sago_Mine_disaster_ce06.html" title="Sago Mine disaster">Sago Mine disaster</a> -- you put in a lot of effort!</p>
