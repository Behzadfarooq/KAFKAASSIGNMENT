<p>In mid-2005, O'Rourke won a seat on the <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Paso%2C_Texas_243a.html" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso city council</a> against seasoned city councilman Anthony Cobos. O'Rourke is one of the youngest representatives to have ever served the City of El Paso.</p>
<p>O'Rourke's short political career has been marked by various initiatives. Among the most publicized initiatives was a resolution drafted by council members Steve Ortega and Beto O'Rourke, calling on city officials to discourage anti-immigrant <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minuteman_Project_6ebf.html" title="Minuteman Project">Minutemen</a> from patrolling the local stretch of the Texas-Mexico border and "reject civilian attempts to enforce immigration law." Essentially, making the Minutemen officially unwelcome in El Paso. The resolution opted for "cooperation and goodwill" over further militarization of the border. Minutemen spokesman <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shannon_McGauley_f6da.html" title="Shannon McGauley">Shannon McGauley</a> says his group plans to go ahead with October operations in El Paso, despite the resolution. "It doesn't mean anything,to me or any American who wants secure borders." McGauley said. "It's just an opinion." The resolution was supported by seven of the eight city representatives. Articles on the subject arose in the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21_News_a481.html" title="Yahoo! News">Yahoo! News</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes.html" title="Forbes">Forbes</a>, as well as many <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> publications.</p>
<p>Most notably, the ongoing controversy over the El Paso Downtown Redevelopment plan has led to much publicity for Beto. Because of O'Rourke's involvement in and support of the controversial <a href="../../../p/a/s/Paso_Del_Norte_Group_a88c.html" title="Paso Del Norte Group">Downtown Revitalization Plan</a>, South Side activist Carmen Felix initiated a recall petition drive against him on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_3.html" title="May 3">May 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. Those calling for the recall election raised question as to whether O'Rourke's actions in promoting the plan are in the best interest of the community he represents. Despite the threat of being recalled O'Rourke continued to strongly advocate the use of <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminent_domain.html" title="Eminent domain">eminent domain</a> in conjunction with the plan to redevelop downtown El Paso. O'Rourke's emphasis on the matter seemed to change subtly as the recall drive deadline neared.</p>
<p>At the <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Paso%2C_Texas_243a.html" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso City Council</a> meeting of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>, 2005, East-Central El Paso city Rep. José Alexandro Lozano proposed a ban on the use of eminent domain for private redevelopment downtown. "If the property owners are not satisfied, we are not going to move forward, period", Lozano said to cheers from the audience. "We have to kill this plan unless the owners give us permission to continue." Boos greeted Mayor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cook_%28El_Paso%29_5bb6.html" title="John Cook (El Paso)">John Cook</a> when he said, "If you're finished with your soapbox, I would entertain a motion to postpone this until the first meeting in July." A vote was quickly called by O'Rourke without hearing from people who had signed up to speak. The vote ended in a 4-3 decision against the proposed ban.</p>
<p>At the El Paso city council meeting held on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">July 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, O'Rourke, still under threat of recall showed a distinct change in tone in pertinence to the El Paso Downtown Revitalization Plan. Rep. O'Rourke responded to a question posed by fellow city councilman Lozano with respect to whether residents displaced by new construction "could come back to the area." O'Rourke responded in assurance that the city would make "every effort" to ensure displaced residents were allowed to remain in their same neighborhoods. O'Rourke also fronted amendments adopting a portion of an alternate Downtown Plan offered by Lozano, to encourage utilities, large businesses and public sector agencies to move Downtown; as well as a value statement to "explore arena options" -- whether an arena is needed, and where to put it.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, 2006, The <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Paso_Times_6420.html" title="El Paso Times">El Paso Times</a> as well as local news stations reported that Felix et al had failed to file the recall petition with the city attorney's office by the legal deadline. Felix rebutted that the petition would be ready to hand in on Monday <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_27.html" title="July 27">July 27</a>. Critics speculate Felix failed to acquire all 978 signatures of registered voters in O'Rourke's district to call the election.</p>
<p>"Now that they actually decided not to follow through on their commitment to turn the petitions in, I feel it's really over", O'Rourke said. "To me, it was heartening that after ... all their claims of popular opposition to me and this plan, that they were unable on Friday or again on Monday to turn in a petition that validated any of their claims."</p>
<p>Opponents of O'Rourke deemed much of the petition's failure was largely due to the reluctance among lower-income people to challenge the powers that be.</p>
<p>Again on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">September 5</a>, 2006, O'Rourke was faced with another act against his political career. Lawyers for the <a href="http://www.landgrabopponents.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.landgrabopponents.org/" rel="nofollow">Land Grab Opponents of El Paso</a> filed an ethics complaint with the City of El Paso alleging that South-West Rep. Beto O'Rourke “violated his fiduciary duty to the citizens of El Paso.”<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> According to the complaint, O'Rourke stands to benefit from his relationship with the Paso del Norte Group because his firm does business with the group. It states that “O'Rourke is impermissibly entangled in the Paso del Norte Group's Downtown Revitalization Plan, through both family and business ties.”<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The complaint alleges that O'Rourke's company, Stanton Street Technology Group, provides Internet and Information Technology services to the Paso del Norte Group. Despite these ties, O'Rourke voted to extend the group's contract with the city last year and to accept the group's redevelopment proposal in March, according to the complaint. The El Paso municipal code demands that council members and city officials avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest. The city's Ethics Review Commission summarily dismissed the first ethics complaint on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a>, 2006. The second complaint was dismissed on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">October 18</a>, 2006. O'rourke issued the following statement: "These actions are not isolated events... They are part of a much larger process of character assassination and political intimidation that has involved recall petitions, public smear campaigns and not one but two formal ethics complaints."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Land Grab Opponents' lawyer Blaugrund said his intent in filing the ethics complaints was to make O'Rourke recuse himself from debating and voting on the Downtown plan because his father-in-law, William "Bill" Sanders, is a leader in the Paso del Norte Group<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> that advanced the plan. Blaugrund also cited the business relationship between Paso del Norte Group and O'Rourke's Stanton Street Technologies. In the second ethics complaint, Blaugrund pointed to evidence he said suggests that the chief financial officer of Sanders' company, The Verde Group, prepared O'Rourke's income tax return this year. O'Rourke abstained at Tuesday's City Council meeting from voting on the establishment of a Downtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, which is to be the city's mechanism for investing in the redevelopment plan, and he left council chambers during the discussion. O'Rourke said he abstained because his wife's employer, Clinica Familiar de Salud La Fe, owns property in the reinvestment zone and could benefit from new development. That advice came from the city attorney's office. Blaugrund said O'Rourke's decision "to finally recuse himself from voting on issues relating to Downtown redevelopment is a victory for advocates of open and transparent government."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Mayor John Cook voted for O'Rourkes in his absence. Blaugrund stated that "His ridiculous assertions show that he is perfectly capable of destroying his political career all by himself."</p>
<p>Although O'Rourke's political career has come under extensive scrutiny, his re-election campaign has silently commenced. Ironically, a prominently placed <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_%28advertising%29.html" title="Billboard (advertising)">billboard</a> featuring his campaign slogan "One Agenda. El Paso." was vandalized shortly after being erected. The vandal(s) used black <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spray_paint.html" title="Spray paint">spray paint</a> to write the word "OWN" between the words "agenda." and "El".</p>
