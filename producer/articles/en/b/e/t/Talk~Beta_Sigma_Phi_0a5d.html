Beta Sigma Phi is a social and cultural organization that incorporates service as a greater part of its activities. Service is done locally and internationally and is a tribute to the character of the members. The cultural programs are important in Beta Sigma Phi. They are the basic element of the organization. Through these programs each member is encouraged to grow personally, while at the same time participating in the growth of her sisters. They are designed to broaden personal knowledge and understanding of self, friends, and the world. As a member of Beta Sigma Phi it is in our nature not only to give the best that is in us to ourselves and our sorority, but to give the best that is in us to our world.</p>
<p>In April of 1932 Beta Sigma Phi was incorporated under a charter granted by the state of Missouri. Today, Beta Sigma Phi is a nonprofit corporation which maintains a contract with Walter W. Ross &amp; Company, PO Box 8550, Kansas City, MO 64114-0500, for complete business management of all its affairs. There is a membership fee which is established by the International Office. All chapters hold semimonthly meetings. In addition to the International Constitution each chapter composes its own set of bylaws. The Torch is the official magazine of Beta Sigma Phi and has grown from a four-page bulletin to a magazine of thirty-two pages which publishes stories and poems by members, personality sketches of its International Honorary Members and others, runs contests for short stories, poetry, and - perhaps the most popular of all - the Valentine Girl contest which is judged by a well-known film star each year. The Torch continues to provide a connecting link between active members, all of whom receive it as a part of their membership. It is an important source of information about the organization.</p>
<p>A brief history which follows is only a skeleton of our organization. No single volume could begin to contain all the beauty and color and glory that have been so much a part of its growth and success through the years.</p>
<p>"Once upon a time" is perhaps a strange way to start a history. Usually the phrase is reserved for children's stories. But the history of Beta Sigma Phi is something that began very definitely once upon a time and has continued in the same way over the years. It was "once" because the establishment of Beta Sigma Phi was aunique event, and we can say "upon a time" because 1931 was a very special time. It was a time of depression and general gloom which in many ways was particularly difficult for young women. From the very beginning Beta Sigma Phi offered young women something for themselves which was creative and productive and hopeful.</p>
<p>The history of the organization has continued in the same way. A unique response to every challenge and opportunity has permitted the organization to grow and change to answer the changing needs of its members through depression, inflation, recession, war and peace.</p>
<p>So it was "once upon a time" that a young man with a new dream established the first chapter of Beta Sigma Phi with seven members in the town of Abilene, Kansas. There in the Sunflower Hotel the very first chapter of what was to become a worldwide organization was founded. The richness of the idea and the quality of those original members can be appreciated when you realize that three of the original seven members, Helen Holmstrom, Helen Pepper, and Naomi Simpson, are still active in Beta Sigma Phi. Through depression, drought, dustbowl, all the bad years, and all the good years in between, that beginning survived so that Beta Sigma Phi is still an active organization.</p>
<p>The organization had started out with the unlikely name, "The National ‘What to Read’ Club." But when Walter Ross, the founder of Beta Sigma Phi, took his great dream to Vinita, Oklahoma, the first of many encounters with really great ladies took place. Mrs. Leona Schroers was the librarian in Vinita and she agreed to help with the establishment of a chapter in her town. She also gave Mr. Ross an introduction to Mrs. Sally Rogers McSpadden who, besides being Will Rogers’ sister, was an outstanding woman and a leader in women's organizations of the day. Mrs. McSpadden soon convinced Walter Ross that the organization should be changed from an association to its present form and that the name must really be changed. With her suggestions and Mrs. Schroers’ assistance, a new framework for the organization was developed and the Greek letter name grew out of the motto chosen for the sorority. The letters, "Beta," "Sigma," and "Phi" were the first letters of the Greek words for life, learning, and friendship.</p>
