<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is an online encyclopedia created by international volunteers who contribute, update, and revise articles in a collaborative process. It is the world's fastest-growing, most current, and largest encyclopedia, with more than 1.5 million articles under active development in over 150 languages. The English-language edition alone has more than 800,000 articles, and incorporates 25,000 edits each day.</li>

<li><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimania.html" title="Wikimania">Wikimania</a> is an international Wikimedia conference, where Wikipedians can meet and talk with people at the forefront of the Wikimedia communities and wiki software development. The program includes a range of presentations, workshops, and tutorials, to give newcomers and oldtimers alike an overview of the current state of research on wikis and free knowledge projects. "Hacking Days" gather developers to work on code and discuss the technical aspects of Wikimedia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The first Wikimania was held in Frankfurt am Main, Germany from 4 August 2005 to 8 August 2005. A primary goal was to help the various Wikimedia projects improve their understanding of one another. The objective was achieved; 380 participants from over 50 countries attended the conference. The majority of sessions and conversations were in English, although material from the conference is being translated into multiple languages. Keynote speakers included Jimmy Wales, Ross Mayfield, Ward Cunningham and Richard Stallman; event sponsors included Answers.com, SocialText, Sun Microsystems, DocCheck, and Logos Group.</li>

<li>Betsy, after I posted a comment on the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">Race_and_intelligence</a> "talk" page, linking to a study on the Ashkenazic Jews, I then took a look at the recent edits (specifically, on the "article" page), and saw where you removed an edit about this group of Jews. (Not that it matters, but I'm White and part Native American and British, Irish, and Scottish by decent; I have no "vested interest" in the race debate.) Anyhow, I figured you might think I was the one to have put in that edit, the one that you removed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=15621125" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Race_and_intelligence&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=15621125" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> I haven't followed that page.</li>

<li>Hi Gordon--I didn't speculate about who put in the remark I removed, something along the lines of "Jews are known to be smarter than other white people." It was unencyclopedic and unreferenced, so I removed it. I haven't even read the entire article very closely--it's not my area of expertise at all. I think I read it because someone had complained people were defacing it, and I was curious. The article as a whole looked pretty scholarly and NPOV--impressive for such a controversial subject. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 15:47, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

For example, the average height of most races is very similar, even though we have much variation <i>within</i> each race. Probably the same with intelligence, but who knows? Also, a person can increase his or her intelligence by practice, an environmental factor. It's a complex issue to be sure. Thank you for taking a look at my question.

<p>I have no objection to including Dkosopedia among the external links. Labeling it "The most complete site on the web on Jeff Gannon" is unencyclopedia-like and misleading. It is unencyclopedia-like because "The most complete" is puffery rather than description. It is misleading because it implies that Dkosopedia is a neutral source of information. I am changing the label to "A wiki-like compilation of the case against James Gannon". I also think we should arrange the External Links list to put news on top and opinion pieces or partisan material on the bottom.</p>

<p>"Relationship to the Public" material removed from <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Winer_e258.html" title="Dave Winer">Dave Winer article</a> on August 17, which I archived in <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDave_Winer_881e.html" title="Talk:Dave Winer">Talk:Dave Winer</a>:</p>
<p><i>Winer's detractors allege that he is overly blunt and thin-skinned. Indeed, many of his later career successes are colored by a trail of former friends and collaborators who claim to have found him unpredictable and difficult to work with. The degree of anger and abuse some direct toward Winer continues to amaze those who respect his accomplishments. He is frequently parodied through websites such as Eye on Winer.</i></p>
<p><i>Winer's admirers see him as a leader of clarity and purpose. One of the attendees at BloggerCon II, State Rep. Mark B. Cohen of Philadelphia, said "Winer is a constructive and innovative force in many overlapping worlds: blogging, journalism, software development, politics, business, and academia, among others. Without his intellectual and personal leadership, the Internet would look very different and have much less impact today."</i></p>
<p>(Posted on <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDave_Winer_881e.html" title="Talk:Dave Winer">Talk:Dave Winer</a>) Somebody else removed the "relationship to the public" bit, again, categorizing it at "editorializing." On reflection, I agree that the section is non-encyclopedic. Nevertheless, it represents a substantial effort by wiki contributors to find common ground. So I'm going to post the deleted paragraphs here in discussion instead. I hope this will be an acceptable compromise solution. betsythedevine</p>
<p>(Posted on <a href="../../../b/h/o/User_talk%7EBhouston_89a4.html" title="User talk:Bhouston">User_talk:Bhouston</a>) I've edited this article before without removing this section, but when somebody else took it out, it seemed to me like a very substantial improvement. This section represents "original research" and personal opinion. The article <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> handles controversy like this in a much more "encyclopedic" way. Would you agree that archiving this section in the article's Talk page, as I've done, would be a good compromise solution? <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 13:21, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My issue is that I feel it is true. I have been following his scripting.com for quite some time and he does often use aggression or disengenious methods (although they start to become pretty transparent after a while) to get his way or for personal egocentric agrandisement at the expense of others or proper evolution of standards. I think it is important to note this since I notice it even though I am in no way related or have personal interest in the relevant technologies (i.e. RSS, XML-RPC, OMPL, etc.) Maybe in September (when I get a bit more time) I'll try to craft a properly referenced version. I noticed the New York Times has refered to him as both "irascible" and "cranky", I can include those references as well as a few others.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How would you suggest I handle this? IS the only option to leave it on the talk page as was done with the Bill Gates article? If omission is the only option it feels like some type of censoring. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 17:41, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Well, you hit the nail on the head of what would make this section "encyclopedic" when you talk about a properly referenced version. From <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>: ".. an easy way to avoid making a statement that promotes a point of view is to find a reputable source for a fact and cite the source. This is an easy way to characterize a side of a debate without promoting a view. The trick is to find the best and most reputable source you can....The only other important consideration is that while a fact is not POV in and of itself, adding facts, no matter how well cited, from only one side of a debate is a POV problem. So work for balance. Find facts that aren't from one side or the other and cite the source."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That's what I was praising about the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> article -- its use of direct quotes from published or online sources. I suppose it is "some kind of censorship" to want to remove stuff that's unencyclopedic from a wikipedia article, but if we put the section into <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDave_Winer_881e.html" title="Talk:Dave Winer">Talk:Dave_Winer</a> then it's not lost.</li>

<dd>I am friends with Dave Winer, and with a lot of other people in the once-tiny blog-uniiverse. If you check out my <a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetsythedevine_d658.html" title="User talk:Betsythedevine">User talk:Betsythedevine</a>, you'll see something more relevant, however. I got involved in the Jeff Gannon/James Guckert article, trying to keep that entry NPOV--not because I know Jeff Gannon or agree with his politics (I don't!), but because I value Wikipedia's NPOV policy. I got pinged about my edit in Religion [Oops, actually in "Race and intelligence"]--I removed a sentence that said something like "Many sources have shown that Jews are more intelligent than other white people." I felt that such a controversial statement should have some actual source cited--without one, the statement is very un-encyclopedic. To the extent that I've been in any Wikipedia controversies--very rarely!--it's because I try to make articles NPOV and "encyclopedic", that is, based on printed or online sources rather than assertion or "original research." <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 14:30, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I have been finding authoritative quotes and adding them to this talk page incrementally -- I was not trying to sneak them in, also I did the work while properly logged in thus I wasn't trying to do it anonymously, and they were each and of themselves minor. I think that BetsyTheDevine needs to relax a little and accept that maybe I am following her advice and am slowing working towards creating a new rewrite of the section that was criticized for not being NPOV. If I was intent on being evil I like to think that I would be more competent about it -- I'm not an idiot. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 21:27, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ben--sorry, I didn't mean you were trying to be sneaky and failing. I meant that these additions should be read in the context of a major addition to this page, all made by one person in quite a short space of time.

I assume you have your own offline copy, but if you don't you can use Wikipedia's history feature to access your original collection.

<dd>This is a talk page, not the article. You're quoting of the Cadenhead blog but removing the non-A-list blog sources show a double standard in terms of what is quotable. I've added back a bunch of the quotes. Once I get the time to expand the article or someone else does I don't think it is unnecessary to censor this page. I would prefer to error on including more information in the Dave Winer article that less. --Ben Houston 22:13, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ben, being or not being an A-list blog source isn't the question here. Your justification for this quote collection was to gather source material about Dave Winer. But then you include stuff that isn't good source material. Good source material comes from 1) published, professional sources like the Wired article, or 2) personal statements including blog posts by people documenting their own interactions with Winer. Third-party hearsay, anonymous comments, value judgments by people whose knowledge and/or motivation we don't know--the material I removed all fell into those categories. betsythedevine 23:38, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BetsyTheDevine: Let's give this quote fight thing a rest -- it's fairly tangential and its all on the unconsequential talk page anyhow. My main issue was that you kept removing the original criticism paragraph saying that it was not supported. I have now done a fair bit of research to establish that some of that criticism is supported and have found numerous high quality quotes that could be incorporated. To be honest, I do not relish writing a new criticism section since I fear getting your approval in addition to my lack of confidence of treating such a touchy subject appropriately. In many ways, it would be appropriate for you to rewrite the criticism section that you originally objected too to incorporate the research I did (and it is research that I did in response to your suggestion). I would really like to change the dynamic here from adverserial to cooperative.

<dd>Ben, I too would like to change the dynamic. But your claim that I "kept removing the original criticism paragraph" isn't just adversarial, it's untrue. Look at the history of <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Winer_e258.html" title="Dave Winer">Dave Winer</a>--two different users (not me) removed it on August 11 and 14. You reinserted it on August 14 and 18. After seeing on the discussion page that the same fight occurred in 2004, I tried for a compromise, by archiving the disputed material as "discussion." And, 2 months later, everyone but you seems content with that compromise. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 22:08, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

However, my vote still stands and I still object to redoing the VfD; the community has looked at the article, found the subject notable, and that's all that needs to be said. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 19:56, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. What Sdedeo and HallMonitor said. Being eager to have a wikipedia article about you has zero bearing on the question of whether or not there should be a wikipedia article about you. The point of Wikipedia is to let people find information about stuff that has some reasonable notability.<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 11:39, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for adding the correct info, including stuff about the appeal! (we'll have to start formatting the external inline links possibly and make it a references section, though). I really appreciated that you blogged the trial ... outside of Josh's site, information about this just doesn't circulate nationally. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 00:01, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, Daniel. I have been trying to focus wider attention on this case, because I don't think that James Tobin acted in isolation. It's a huge embarassment for the RNC to get caught paying James Tobin's legal bills--it makes me wonder what Tobin knows that could embarass them more. I do try to maintain the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> required in the text of the article itself.

<p>I made the matching genericizing change to the RSS file format article. I think it is a real improvement to both articles. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 03:19, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good, let's continue to try to distinguish between things that are true of webfeeds in general, and those that are true of RSS or Atom in particular. I'd caution you, however, against changes like the one you made to the Feedster article, which originally said something like "Feedster started by indexing RSS feeds", but you changed to read "Feedster started by indexing RSS and Atom feeds." (Atom wasn't released until well after Feedster started indexing RSS.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Atom is a technology that many good people, some of them friends of mine, worked hard to create as a format of real value. I think they'd be embarrassed rather than pleased by having absurd and untrue claims made for their creation. Wikipedia articles should reflect the history of webfeed technology. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 19:03, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The result of my change was this sentence, not the misquotation above: "Feedster began as a weblog search tool, indexing and archiving individual blog posts based on a site's RSS or Atom feed." Even so I understand and I apologize for what was too hasty of an insertion of Atom. You change was a good one.

<p>Thanks for your recent edit to the page. I saw your AfD nomination, which seems slightly off, since it seems to be much closer to a POV concern than an actual AfD. But that's fine, it's not going to get consensus for delete, and the nomination has nudged it towards improvement.</p>
<p>I think Yeago is still a little overly hung up on this idea of stigmatizing so-called "interested" editors. He's a little naive about that concept being something other than completely fuzzy; and also about thinking WP is about assigning blame rather than just writing encyclopedic articles. His deleted category about this was an earlier wrinkle in that. Despite that, I think he clearly recognizes now that the mentioned article should grow into something more than wagging a finger at a couple editors. I think if you look at my comments on the talk page, and at some of the language I've added, you'll see a direction it could go to become a genuinely good and useful article. Pretty much the article was created by Yeago, and only enhanced by me so far... Yeago's intent is good, but he can slip back into a bit too informal, and moderately POV tone. So I'm certain that anything you improved would make it much better.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the kind words. I made the AfD nomination (my first) because IMO, Wikipedia articles are the wrong forum for personal crusades. (After making it, I discovered that you're supposed to notify ppl first on the article's talk page--sorry I didn't.) As you can see, I've now edited another of the one-sided personal attacks making up this article. I had no previous knowledge of Mr. Thompson's incident, and no particular sympathy with a Republican anti-porn crusader for censorship, but please compare the actual facts of the incident to the original allegations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_and_public_opinion&amp;diff=41421785&amp;oldid=41417518" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_and_public_opinion&amp;diff=41421785&amp;oldid=41417518" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> I know you're an experienced and hard-working Wikipedian, but I think that cataloguing and berating people for "interested" edits (the total list would be much longer than 4 events) is a bad idea. Are you coming to Wikimania? <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 05:55, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I quite agree that this notion of "interestedness" is just plain silly. I comment somewhat at this at the successful CfD: <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_February_16_45cd.html#Category:Articles_edited_by_interested_parties" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 February 16">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 February 16#Category:Articles edited by interested parties</a>. Part of the problem in Yeago's edits is that he keeps putting in such silly characterizations. But it's getting there. Nonetheless, the notion of public opinion being affected by the operation of WP seems interesting. For example, the Biden link that was recently added looks like good material... I'd like more stuff along that line.</dd>

<dd>FWIW, I haven't really followed the Thompson issue, but I did see it mentioned outside of Wikipedia before I ever saw anyone discuss it on WP. So for whatever reason, it got a little attention. Still, I'm more interested in how the incident shapes public opinion of Thompson (or of his critics, or of games, or whatever), that just what the public thinks of Wikipedia. That's the point of what the article <i>could</i> do, and would be notable. The language as it stands hints at this, but still focuses too much on finger wagging (but I think my edits are much more neutral: not pro- or anti-Thompson, just reporting what occurred, and how it was reported outside WP).</dd>

<dd>Wikimania is the big annual conference, coming to Cambridge this August: <a href="http://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> A bunch of us locally are working to get ready for it, and people who would like to give talks are applying right now. How about a talk on the impact of Wikipedia's increasing popularity on the behavior of some contributors? I do agree that your edits are improving the article. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetsythedevine_22fb.html" title="User:Betsythedevine">betsythedevine</a> 12:13, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
