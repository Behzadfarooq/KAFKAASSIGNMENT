<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_Than_Life_28ea.html" title="Edit section: In the TV series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In the TV series</span></h2>
<p>We are first introduced to the game in a Series Two episode titled <i>Better Than Life</i>. The game arrives among other fantastic packages in a post pod, which is encountered after <i>Red Dwarf</i> turns around to head for home. It is part of a series of '<a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_Reality_c0f8.html" title="Virtual Reality">VR</a> Total Immersion Video Games', which work by inserting electrodes into the user's frontal lobes and <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothalamus.html" title="Hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>. The user becomes completely immersed within the reality of the game.</p>
<p><i>Better Than Life</i> is a game which allows the user to live out all their fantasies and desires. When in the game, one has the ability to mentally command into existence any object, person or environment.</p>
<p>The problem with the game in the TV Series, however, is that it also detects <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subconscious.html" title="Subconscious">subconscious</a> desires: if the user subconsciously hates himself then the game will eventually detect this and subject him to specifically-tailored masochistic tortures.</p>
<p>Total Immersion Video Games - though not specifically <i>Better Than Life</i> - are later encountered in the Series 5 episode, '<a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_to_Reality_%28Red_Dwarf_episode%29_7919.html" title="Back to Reality (Red Dwarf episode)">Back to Reality</a>' in which a group <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallucination.html" title="Hallucination">hallucination</a> makes the <i>Dwarf</i> crew believe that the previous four years had been a video game fantasy. "Back to Reality" is often cited as being the best episode of <i>Red Dwarf</i>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Series 6 International Emmy Award-winning episode "Gunmen of the Apocalypse" featured a similar concept. "Artificial Reality" video games were used to allow the characters to combat personifications of a computer virus in a metaphorical Wild West showdown.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_Than_Life_28ea.html" title="Edit section: The novel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The novel</span></h2>
<p><i>Better Than Life</i> plays an important role in the two novels <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Red_Dwarf%7E_Infinity_Welcomes_Careful_Drivers_e908.html" title="Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers">Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers</a></i> and <i>Red Dwarf: Better Than Life</i>. The novel version of the game has far greater abilities and far greater <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_bug.html" title="Software bug">bugs</a>. Unlike the TV series, which is based on the original, unaddictive version, the novel version causes the user's imagination to develop semi-plausible explanations for certain events. For instance, in early versions of Better Than Life, the user could make a large, expensive car appear out of thin air. In the books, the user's imagination would create a scenario where they won the lottery, or created a successful business, so they could buy the car.</p>
<p>The danger of the game is that once the user starts to play, the game makes them forget they actually started to play, so they believe that they are still in reality. Their conscious mind only perceives the reality of the game, and all signals from their real body, except for those of extreme pain, are completely ignored.</p>
<p>Unless cared for in the real world, a user (or "Game Head") dies very quickly. While it is certainly possible for friends to forcibly remove the headset that contains the game, this results in instant death from shock. The only way to exit the game is to figure out that you're playing the game, develop the desire to leave it and then command an exit.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_Than_Life_28ea.html" title="Edit section: Alternate version">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alternate version</span></h3>
<p>When the two Red Dwarf novels were printed together as an omnibus, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor took the opportunity to alter the ending of <i>Better than Life</i> in order clear up confusion about the book's ending. It is presumed that all subsequent prints of <i>Better than Life</i> include this new ending.</p>

<p>After a drunken party, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Lister_33e5.html" title="Dave Lister">Lister</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Rimmer_0c45.html" title="Arnold Rimmer">Rimmer</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_%28Red_Dwarf%29_251d.html" title="Cat (Red Dwarf)">The Cat</a> discover a cache of illegal headbands in one of the sleeping quarters, and end up beginning to play. They imagine that they board the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_ships_c769.html#Nova_5" title="Red Dwarf ships">Nova 5</a> and use its Duality Jump drive to return to <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Lister settles down with a woman who looks exactly like <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristine_Kochanski_da8d.html" title="Kristine Kochanski">Kristine Kochanski</a> in Bedford Falls, which looks exactly like the Bedford Falls in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Capra_af99.html" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a>'s <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life_54b1.html" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>, Lister's favourite movie. He has two sons, Jim and Bexley, and opens a successful curry shop.</p>
<p>Rimmer becomes the head of a multi-national corporation, Rimmer Corp., and has a 50 billion dollarpound fortune. He's married to Juanita Chicata, the most beautiful model and actress in the world, with a massively fiery temper. He's also developed a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time machine</a>, which he uses to beat <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Patton_c84b.html" title="George Patton">George Patton</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Bonaparte_f92d.html" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> at <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk_%28game%29.html" title="Risk (game)">Risk</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Danish government</a> gives Cat an island, on which is built a giant golden castle, right out of a gothic fairy tale. The castle is surrounded by a moat of milk, and is staffed by eight-foot tall, scantily clad <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valkyrie.html" title="Valkyrie">Valkyrie</a> warriors. He likes to travel on firebreathing yaks and shoot dogs. When questioned about the plausibility of it, the Cat reckons he deserved it because he was so handsome.</p>
<p>Back in reality, <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryten.html" title="Kryten">Kryten</a> is cajoled by <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_%28Red_Dwarf%29_a25b.html" title="Holly (Red Dwarf)">Holly</a> to laser messages into Lister's arms. Lister feels the pain of this in Bedford Falls, and when he applies cold cream to the areas of pain, they spell two messages - 'U=BTL' on his left arm ('You are in Better Than Life') and 'DYING' on his right ('You are dying') These messages cause Lister to realise that it has been Christmas Eve in Bedford Falls every day since he got there, just as it was in the film. He realizes that he is in the game and confronts Rimmer in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Rimmer is dismissive, claiming Lister's lack of money disproves his theory. It's eventually discovered, however, that Lister's fantasy is much more mature than Rimmer's; he doesn't need money to be happy, just a family to love him. Rimmer's fantasy involved mega-riches because of his insecurities.</p>
<p>They travel to Denmark and meet with the Cat. While discussing how to get out. Kryten arrives and explains how they started playing. Because his <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanoid.html" title="Mechanoid">Mechanoid</a> brain is different from human brains, he remembers entering the game, making it easier for him to get out.</p>
<p>Kryten explains that, to leave the game, all they have to do is want to leave. Lister returns to Bedford Falls to say goodbye to Kochanski. However, he can't bear to leave her, so he stays in the game, as do the others - Kryten is lured in by an infinite supply of dishes to clean.</p>
<p>However, things change because of Rimmer's massive self-loathing, his subconscious belief that he doesn't deserve success, that he deserves to suffer. Consequently, <i>Better Than Life</i> causes him to lose his fortune, have his body repossessed, and end up in the body of a woman. Upon attempting to leave, he can't, and realizes that all four must leave together. He travels to Bedford Falls in a giant truck, wrecking the town square in the process, ruining Lister's fantasy. As they leave, a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_waste.html" title="Nuclear waste">nuclear waste</a> facility and a psychiatric prison for the criminally insane are being built. They travel to Denmark, to discover that Cat's Valkyries have gone on strike, the milk moat has curdled, and a <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcano.html" title="Volcano">volcano</a> has started to erupt. The four leave the game together.</p>
<p>They seemingly arrive back on Red Dwarf, but certain clues (the good quality towels, the sleeping quarters actually being clean, etc.) make them realize they're still in the game. At this point, the 14 year old creator of the game appears and congratulates them on overcoming the final obstacle, and offers them a replay. They decline, and finally return to reality. Due to their having not moved for such a long time, Lister and Cat's muscles have atrophied considerably, and they have to be placed in special suits for some time to re-hydrate and restore their muscles.</p>
<p>While Lister and the Cat recover, Kryten and Rimmer realize Holly has shut himself off and the ship's engines are dead. It turns out that he had gone computer senile. His companion, an obnoxious novelty appliance named <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talkie_Toaster_e85f.html" title="Talkie Toaster">Talkie Toaster</a>, convinced Holly to perform a dangerous repair operation: Holly will become brilliant again, but with a much shorter lifespan. The plan works too well: Holly now has a five digit IQ, but has less than two minutes of run time left. To make things worse, a rogue planet is on a crash course with the disabled <i>Dwarf.</i></p>
<p>In order to restart the engine, hundreds of mile-high <a href="../../../p/i/s/Piston.html" title="Piston">pistons</a> must be test fired. With only Kryten and the skutters to do the physical work, the task is grueling. Things are going well, however, until Rimmer accidentally crushes most of the skutters when he test fires the wrong pistons. They now have no choice, the crew must abandon ship.</p>
<p>Rimmer turns Holly on to warn him that <i>Red Dwarf</i> is doomed. In just a few seconds, Holly prints out a solution and shuts himself down again. <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Starbug.html" title="Starbug">Starbug</a></i> is to fire a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_missile.html" title="Nuclear missile">nuclear missile</a> into a nearby sun, causing a solar flare that will knock its planet out of orbit and in turn, knock the rogue planet away from the <i>Dwarf</i>.</p>
<p>It's the only chance, but Lister insists that he make the shot: he's a better <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billiards.html" title="Billiards">pool</a> player. The crew reluctantly agrees. Rimmer and Lister set off in <i>Starbug</i>. Lister fires the missile and seems to have missed, but in reality he'd preformed a trick shot. The planet is knocked out of the danger zone. Unfortunately, <i>Starbug</i> collides with the 'cue' planet's slip stream, knocking the ship into the icy rogue planet.</p>
<p>Rimmer and Lister are marooned on the planet for weeks, and Lister begins to starve. Rimmer is beginning to slow down for some reason. They figure his remote hologram until is malfunctioning. He'll soon shut down and be brought online back on <i>Red Dwarf</i>, where he can launch a rescue operation. When Rimmer returns, he realizes the truth: the Dwarf is being sucked into a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_hole.html" title="Black hole">black hole</a>, and the newly repaired ship cannot escape.</p>
<p>The toaster informs them that Holly told him how to escape a black hole. After force feeding everyone loaves of toast, he tells them that if they accelerate into the hole, they can zip through safely. The experience is damaging to the crew and the ship, but they survive to go looking for Lister.</p>
<p>Lister, meanwhile, is having problems of his own. The ice on the planet has melted, revealing a landscape of green glass bottles. <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_rain.html" title="Acid rain">Acid rain</a> begins destroying <i>Starbug</i>, and he makes a harrowing escape. When he escapes the acid rain, it begins raining oil. He feels like the planet is trying to kill him. When he sees the remains of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Rushmore_ebc9.html" title="Mount Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>, he realizes where he is. This is earth, it has been converted into a garbage dump for the solar system (it was blasted from orbit when a continent of sewage was accidentally ignited).</p>
<p>Lister, in a panic, promises the planet that he will try to clean up the mess. It begins to rain water, and Lister discovers a tiny olive tree. He also befriends some cow-sized <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockroach.html" title="Cockroach">cockroaches</a>. Together, they're going to save the world.</p>
<p>After the black hole experience, the Dwarfers finally go to rescue Lister; Rimmer and the Cat in one ship, Kryten and the Toaster in the other. Rimmer and the Cat are shocked to find a beautiful farm amidst the garbage, tended by an old man. It's only when the man does an impression of Rimmer, do they realize who he is: Lister. Because of the time dilation of the black hole, thirty years have passed on the planet.</p>
<p>Lister shows his guest around the farm, and explains how the cockroaches eat the garbage, slowly reclaiming the earth. Lister has gone a bit odd with isolation; he is still hung up on Kristine Kochanski and has plans to return the earth back to the solar system.</p>
<p>Kryten contacts the rest of the crew, telling them they've located Lister. The old Lister shuts off the com link, and sends a coded message that what they have found is really a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymorph.html" title="Polymorph">polymorph</a>, a mutant that can assume any shape and feeds off emotions. The Lister-polymorph attacks Kryten, but the Toaster disables it by firing red-hot ashtrays at it.</p>
<p>Lister insists the polymorph be shot out into space, however, it returns to <i>Red Dwarf</i> in the form of a beam of light. Using various trickery, it begins to steal emotions from the crew: It takes Lister's fear, The Cat's vanity, Kryten's guilt, and Rimmer's anger. Emotionally unstable, they are unable to form a plan for defeating the monster. When it attacks them, they are only saved when a freak accident slays the beast, which causes them to regain their emotions. The stress of the battle is too much for the elderly Lister, and he dies from a heart attack.</p>
<p>After Lister's funeral, Rimmer informs Holly of the loss. Holly prints out some instructions to rescue a canister from certain coordinates in space. They are then to fly back into the black hole and enter a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_dimension.html" title="Parallel dimension">parallel dimension</a>, where they are to bury Lister and the canister (which contains Kochanski's ashes).</p>
<p>Lister wakes up in a strange hospital in a weird world where time runs backwards. He recovers from his heart attack, regurgitates lunch, and is forced to take a wallet and watch from a mugger. A message from the Dwarf crew instructs Lister to meet them in thirty years (they can't stay with him or they would have gotten younger). Lister takes a taxi to his new home, and finds an elderly Kochanski waiting for him. They have their whole pasts in front of them.</p>
