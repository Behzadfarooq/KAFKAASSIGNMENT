Busterfield III, Walter and Clay Pigeon, Arty Smartypants, Heath the Thesaurus, Gus the Bunny, Dr. Ruth Wordheimer, and a variety of monkeys who visit the library.</p>
<p>Barnaby B. Busterfield III is a rock statue that talks to the pigeons, Walter and Clay, and they talk to (and annoy) him.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander Graham Nitwhite (often referred to as Dr. Nitwit by other characters) is a scientist who discovers new words with his assistant, Watson. He is a white bird who wears three pairs of <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pince-nez.html" title="Pince-nez">pince-nez</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Between_the_Lions_4730.html" title="Edit section: Educational content">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Educational content</span></h2>
<p>Between the Lions focuses on teaching reading and a love of books to young children in a fun, informative way.</p>
<p>Among the educational techniques used by Between the Lions are the following:</p>
<p>- <b>Featured Letters and Sounds:</b> Every episode has a feature letter or sound, such as 'h' or 'the long ee sound'. Throughout the show, the featured letter or sound is heard and seen in a variety of words.</p>
<p>- <b>Text on Screen:</b> Frequently, key words or entire sentences of dialog are shown on screen as the characters talk, with the featured letter or combination highlighted.</p>
<p>- <b>Stories:</b> Every episode contains one or more short stories in the form of books read by the Lion family. These stories tie in thematically with the rest of the episode and also serve as another way to present words with the featured sound in context. Sometimes the stories are real books (like "The Carrot Seed" by <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Krauss_77ed.html" title="Ruth Krauss">Ruth Krauss</a>) or well-known tales (like "<a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumplestiltskin.html" title="Rumplestiltskin">Rumplestiltskin</a>"); other times they are books that are made-up to fit the episode (like Lionel's favorite book, "Nothing but Lug Nuts").</p>
<p>- <b>Songs:</b> Silly but informative songs sum up the rules of English spelling and pronunciation in easy-to-remember ways, with lyrics like "When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking" or "Even the blues would be blue without an s" and many others. Often the text of the song is shown on screen.</p>
<p>- <b>Animations and skits:</b> A variety of animations and skits show how words are formed and how one word can be changed into another by adding or removing letters.</p>
<p>- <b>Definitions:</b> Whenever a long or unusual word is used in a dialog or story, a quick definition is given. Usually, it is subtly worked into the conversation, such as when one of the parents responds to a question from the children. Other times it may be provided in a humorous way, such as when Heath Thesaurus pokes his head in to define a word. Occasionally words may be defined by showing pictures or other artistic methods.</p>
<p>- <b>Repeated Vocabulary:</b> Various vocabulary words are introduced in each episode, ranging from simple, everyday concepts like "jump" and "read" to more complex words like "sequel", "dictionary", or "drought". After a word has been introduced, it usually used a number of times throughout the episode.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching basic reading, pronunciation, and grammar skills, Between the Lions also strives to promote a general love of reading in its viewers. It explores the many subjects that books can cover and shows how different people may enjoy reading different things. It also demonstrates the value of reference books and the importance of reading in other everyday activities like using a computer, cooking with a recipe, or finding your way with street signs.</p>
<p>Some Between the Lions episodes also deal with larger episodes related to literary matters: How to handle the scary parts of a story, for example, or the fact that it's okay to be a little sad if something bad happens to a character that you like in a book. It also shows how children can use books as jumping points for their own imagination.</p>
<p>Above all, every character on the show expresses a contagious enthusiasm for reading, with the underlying message being "Reading is cool".</p>

<p>Between the Lions often makes wild parodies of children's programming. The title itself is a twofold pun, first on the phrase "<a href="../../../b/e/t/Between_the_lines.html" title="Between the lines">between the lines</a>", the second is that many classic library buildings have two lions separated by the main entrance. Thus in order to enter the library, you must go "between the lions". Every so often, a wide-eyed child whose face is mostly obscured by TV set comments on the strange thing that has just happened, and an off-stage mother's voice responds with, "It's educational television. It's good for you" or "I'm sure it will help you in school... somehow." Recurring segments include:</p>

<p>Dr. <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Westheimer_9bb1.html" title="Ruth Westheimer">Ruth Westheimer</a> plays "Dr. Ruth Wordheimer," a therapist. Her two types of clients are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monkeys who need help reading or understanding long or difficult words (they are having a "long word freakout").</li>
<li>Words who are dissatisfied with their current meaning. (By replacing certain well-chosen letters, Dr. Wordheimer is able to give the word a new meaning and a new lease on life.)</li>

<p>A girl (a parody of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a> clichés) reads the misadventures found in Little Wendy Tales. In classic fashion, the big-eyed girl transforms herself into The Punctuator and saves Wendy by means of punctuation.</p>

<p>Fun with Chicken Jane is a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> of the famous <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_and_Jane_3bfe.html" title="Dick and Jane">Dick and Jane</a> books for children. In this, two naive children, Scot and Dot, place themselves in harm's way. An intelligent chicken named Chicken Jane spells out an obvious solution to the problem. At the last moment the children get out of the way and Chicken Jane gets hurt instead. The theme song is a parody of the old <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alka_Seltzer_5d58.html" title="Alka Seltzer">Alka Seltzer</a> jingle.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Between_the_Lions_4730.html" title="Edit section: Cliff Hanger">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cliff Hanger</span></h3>
<p>Cliff Hanger is a cartoon lantern-jawed outdoorsman usually featured hanging off the side of a cliff, hanging onto a branch. Each episode presents Cliff with a preposterous situation of some kind, which he attempts to use to his advantage by reaching into his backpack, pulling out what he calls his "trusty survival manual," and following the instructions provided therein. The instructions, though often highly unorthodox, usually prove successful, and Cliff briefly escapes from the cliff. But, inevitably, another highly unlikely incident occurs that leaves Cliff back where he started, hanging onto his branch once again. The cartoon then ends with Cliff's baleful catchphrase: "Can't -- hold -- on -- much -- longer!"</p>
<p>Each segment begins and ends with a theme song sung by a formally-dressed group of singers that flies by in a helicopter, singing "Cliff Hanger, hanging from a cliff! And that's why he's called Cliff Hanger!" Cliff attempts to attract their attention to his predicament by shouting "Excuse me!", but to no avail. Cliff Hanger once escaped the cliff in an online story on the Between the Lions website.</p>
<p>In the series, the character Lionel is a fan of Cliff Hanger books, which his sister Leona thinks are pointless.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne%27s_World_a596.html" title="Wayne's World">Wayne's World</a> spoof featuring two jousting knights charging at each other, each touting a speech balloon with half of a word which then became their respective names, then demonstrating the word. For example, one skit featured "Sir ch" and "Sir air". When Sir ch collided into Sir air, their speech balloons melded together to form the word "chair." Then they took advantage of the word, by sitting on chairs.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Between_the_Lions_4730.html" title="Edit section: Sam Spud">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sam Spud</span></h3>
<p>A spoof of the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Spade_b525.html" title="Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> detective stories, this segment portrays an anthropomorphic potato who types out the voice-over narration typical of film noir, making and correcting typographical errors that demonstrate word sounds. This segment makes heavy use of sight gags based on wordplay (such as the narrator referring to the entrance of a "tomato" -- 30s slang for an attractive woman -- who is revealed to be a real tomato wearing a costume; or a neon sign that blinks the words "Flicker Flicker" or "On" and "Off").</p>

<p>This <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a> is aimed at teaching kids their <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefix_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Prefix (linguistics)">prefixes</a>. For example, Monica Maxwell, the main character in this <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a> might have a bag full of menacing <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippo.html" title="Hippo">hippos</a>. All of a sudden, the evil Un-People come along and "un-zip" the bag, causing the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippo.html" title="Hippo">hippos</a> to run free and cause all sorts of destruction. But when the crime-fighting Re-People appear, they "re-zip" the bag and the destruction of the charging <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippo.html" title="Hippo">hippos</a> stops. This segment may be considered a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> of common <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a>-themed <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoons</a> such as the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League</a>.</p>

<p>In this segment, the soldiers, who are vowels (except the drill sergeant, who is an exclamation point), practice making their sounds and then go out to make words. The famous catchphrase is "This isn't ---; this is Vowel Boot Camp!"</p>
