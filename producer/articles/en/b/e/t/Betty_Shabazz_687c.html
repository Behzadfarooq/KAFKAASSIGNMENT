<p>There is an air of uncertainty about Betty Shabazz's background and early life. Shabazz was born in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a> as Betty Sanders. She is reportedly the daughter of Shelman Sandlin and a woman named Sanders. Shabazz was an illegitimate child and had a scattered childhood. Young Betty Shabazz was taken in by foster parents after her troubled childhood and grew up with them in a fairly sheltered, loving, middle-class household in Detroit. Throughout her life, Shabazz devoted her life to black community affairs in the areas of childcare, health and sexual education.</p>
<p><a name="Early_years" id="Early_years"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Shabazz_687c.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>After high school, Shabazz left the comfortable home of her adoptive parents in Detroit to study at the <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_University_4642.html" title="Tuskegee University">Tuskegee Institute</a> (now Tuskegee University), a well-known historically black college in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>. It was at Alabama that she encountered her first racial hostilities. She did not understand the causes for the racial issues, and her parents refused to acknowledge these issues. She mentioned this in an autobiographical essay she wrote in 1992, published in Essence Magazine: <i>"They thought [the problems] were my fault."'</i></p>
<p>Shabazz moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> to escape Southern racism, and enrolled as a nursing student at the Brooklyn State Hospital School of Nursing. While in New York, Shabazz's friend invited her to hear <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah_Muhammad_463d.html" title="Elijah Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation_of_Islam_86de.html" title="Nation of Islam">Nation of Islam</a> speak at an Islamic temple (Temple No. 7 in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlem.html" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>). According to the Essence essay, Shabazz's friend offered to introduce her to Malcolm X after his speech. Betty's initial reaction was <i>"big deal".</i> She continues: <i>"But then, I looked over and saw this man on the extreme right aisle sort of galloping to the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/podium" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:podium">podium</a>. He was tall, he was thin, and the way he was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium... Well, he got to the podium and I sat up straight. I was impressed with him."</i> They discussed the racism she encountered in Alabama, and she began to understand its causes, pervasiveness, and effects. Soon, Betty was attending all of Malcolm's lectures. By the time she graduated from nursing school in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, she was a member of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad bestowed of his followers the last name "X", representing the African family name they would never know. She changed her name to "Betty X" a result of her Nation of Islam influence.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Shabazz_687c.html" title="Edit section: Marriage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage</span></h3>
<p>In her autobiographical essay for Essence Magazine in 1992, Shabazz said, <i>"I never 'dated' Malcolm as we think of it because at the time single men and women in the Muslims did not 'fraternize' as they called it. Men and women always went out in groups."</i> In 1958, after she had completed nursing school, Malcolm X, who was traveling the country at the time, called her from Detroit and proposed marriage. Before the week was out, Betty aged 23 and Malcolm aged 32 were married.</p>
<p>After their split from The Nation of Islam in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, Malcolm and Betty X adopted the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> last name, Shabazz. Together, they had six daughters — Attallah (b. <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>), <a href="../../../q/u/b/Qubilah_Shabazz_f763.html" title="Qubilah Shabazz">Qubilah</a> (b. <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>), <a href="../../../i/l/y/Ilyasah_Shabazz_cddd.html" title="Ilyasah Shabazz">Ilyasah</a> (b. <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>), Gamilah (b. <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>) and twins Malaak and Malikah (b. <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, seven months after Malcolm X's death).</p>

<p>Betty Shabazz demonstrated her resiliency and determination as a single mother in raising and educating her six daughters, Attallah, Qubilah, Ilyasah, Gamilah, and twins Malikah and Malaak upon Malcolm X's assassination. Shabazz raised her family in the Islamic faith.</p>
<p>According to daughter Ilyasah Shabazz's autobiography, <i>Growing Up X</i> (2002), after Malcolm X's demise, Betty Shabazz got help from wealthy close friends and celebrities to acquire a large, beautiful home in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Vernon%2C_New_York_1f92.html" title="Mount Vernon, New York">Mount Vernon, New York</a> for her family. Malcolm and Betty had split from The Nation of Islam in 1964 and in turn, the Nation had recently evicted Malcolm and family from the small house it had provided during Malcolm X's ministry, just before the assassination. In her book, Ilyasah writes that Betty Shabazz worked very hard to ensure that her daughters were well provided for. They led sheltered, comfortable, upper middle-class lives, complete with the luxury of housekeepers, chauffeured cars, exclusive social clubs, and expensive, predominantly white private schools, private tutors and summer camps.</p>

<p>In 1976, Shabazz worked at New York's <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medgar_Evers_College_3a3c.html" title="Medgar Evers College">Medgar Evers College</a> as an assistant professor. She taught health sciences and then became head of public relations at Medgar Evers College. She traveled widely, speaking on topics such as <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> and racial tolerance. She became a great advocate for the goal of self-determination for African Americans. She also served on many boards, including the African-American Foundation, the Women's Service League and the Day Care Council of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westchester_County%2C_New_York_0dbc.html" title="Westchester County, New York">Westchester County, New York</a>.</p>

<p>In 1994, Shabazz spoke out for the first time against the Nation of Islam and linked its current leader, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Farrakhan_10e0.html" title="Louis Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>, to Malcolm X's assassination. Farrakhan denied the allegations. He blamed the turbulent and racially hostile atmosphere of the 1960s as the root causes for Malcolm's death.</p>
<p>In January 1995, Betty and Malcolm X's daughter Qubilah Shabazz was charged in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minneapolis.html" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> with trying to hire an assassin to murder Farrakhan in retaliation for the murder of her father. The assassin turned out to be a government informant. Farrakhan surprised everyone by defending Qubilah. He claimed that she had been manipulated by government agents who wanted to breed ill feelings within the Nation of Islam and throughout the African American community. In May 1995, Shabazz eventually reconciled with Farrakhan, shaking his hand on the stage of Harlem's <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Theater_0128.html" title="Apollo Theater">Apollo Theater</a> at a fundraiser for her daughter's defense. The fundraiser had been arranged by Farrakhan to help pay for Qubilah's legal fees. Betty Shabazz spoke at Farrakhan's <a href="../../../m/i/l/Million_Man_March_66f8.html" title="Million Man March">Million Man March</a> in October 1995.</p>
<p>Qubilah was not imprisoned for her plot to assassinate Farrakhan. However, she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse for a two-year period. During this period, Qubilah's 12-year-old son, Malcolm, was sent to live with Shabazz at her apartment in <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yonkers%2C_New_York_1f11.html" title="Yonkers, New York">Yonkers, New York</a>.</p>
