<p>Although there's some progress on the history side, this article lacks relevant and verifiable data in relation to other aspects and the present day. It also seems to lack rather a lot of references for the information provided so far.</p>
<p>On this basis, quite a lot needs to be done to improve this article. Click the link to the guide to see more details about what sort of things should be included in each action. I'm going to have a go at sorting out some bits and will be back! <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmopolitancats_48dc.html" title="User:Cosmopolitancats">Cosmopolitancats</a> 14:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And to give a flavour of the overall aim here's a quote from the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> page</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The London area is formed through countless urban villages and small towns, and each of these villages and towns has its own identity to be described and explained in the Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>The point of a <i>guideline</i> is it is just that, a guideline - not a rule. While I agree that the page could well do with revision, application of a guideline blindly is inappropriate. Let these districts' individuality shine out. Applicable elements of the guideline should, of course, be applied, but it's not a tick-box exercise. <a href="../../../k/b/t/User%7EKbthompson_3796.html" title="User:Kbthompson">Kbthompson</a> 14:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. It would be appreciated if positive intentions are assumed rather than negative ones - please! I've seen an awful lot of articles on my travels which let the individuality of their history shine out while tending to neglect the other and as important aspects of the present day reality of the place.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my experience, I've found that after doing the research for articles for other places of a similar size/context that most of the other aspects suggested by the guideline have content that both exists and is relevant. Let's focus on getting the article sorted and up to an assessed good standard shall we? <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmopolitancats_48dc.html" title="User:Cosmopolitancats">Cosmopolitancats</a> 15:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apart from the tube disaster it appears that citations need to be identified for virtually all the content. There are no ther references or links to external websites.</p>

<p>A new section is needed. Can we clarify what bounadaries seem appropriate. Some queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>I note that one of the places of interest suggests Globe Town is part of Bethnal Green. Should Globe Town have its own identity? (the current arrangement is that Globe Town reverts to Bethnral Green) What do people think?</li>
<li>Is <a href="http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/data/discover/data/spitalfields/index.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/data/discover/data/spitalfields/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">Spitalfields and Bangla Town</a> going to be part of or separate from <a href="http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/data/discover/data/bethnal-green/index.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/data/discover/data/bethnal-green/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">Bethnal Green</a>? I'm not sure that people living there would think of themselves as being part of Bethnal Green. It's also recognised as a separate area in terms of <a href="http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/data/in-your-ward/" class="external text" title="http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/data/in-your-ward/" rel="nofollow">Local Area Partnerships</a>. What do people think?</li>

<dd>That depends on the way you look at it, Globe Town was developed from 1790; it was an independent area, and became a parish in its own right - St James, or something. In the mid-90s, it was the name of a short lived neighbourhood, containing the core of Globe Town and the bits of Mile End that they couldn't lose elsewhere. Again, it's confounded with Bethnal Green due to being in E2.</dd>
<dd>In general, wiki is forgiving of indeterminacy with boundaries and areas; particularly within London where the boundaries tend to be fluid. If anyone finds anything interesting to say about the area, it should stay; if not it can be dealt with in BG.</dd>
<dd>There are several stages in the development of settlements in London, they are first 'arterial' along the major routes, with fields behind. Later someone buys a group of fields, throws up a few houses and calls it Globe Town. Soon these are all cheek-by-jowl with each other, and the most salient features are the tube stations. People have this schemata in their heads, and fair play to TfL, they do largely conform to the settlements. The council comes along and likes to draw neat lines on a map, that bifucturate communities because they like to draw their lines along the major arteries. So, as I say, depends on how you look at it. Do you take a long view, or the instant fix? <a href="../../../k/b/t/User%7EKbthompson_3796.html" title="User:Kbthompson">Kbthompson</a> 17:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You take the present day situation and you explain it - in an objective and neutral way and with reference to all available and relevant material.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My inclination is to say that, for now, it might be best to develop the article on the basis that there needs to be a clear section on Globe Town and then decide later on whether it should be given its own article. It's not unusual in articles re places for somewhere to appear in two articles as names of places can often mean areas of varying size.</dd>

<dd>BTW the council does <i>not</i> draw the boundaries so no use blaming them for how they're drawn or how often they change. I think we'd see a very interesting set of results at elections if councils were able to draw the boundaries! What actually happens is that The Boundary Committee for England reviews local government areas and wards and then makes recommendations to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Electoral_Commission_cf6f.html" title="The Electoral Commission">the Electoral Commission</a>. A similar named bod#y - but different - The Boundary Commission for England makes decisions in relation to parliamentary constituency boundaries in England. <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmopolitancats_48dc.html" title="User:Cosmopolitancats">Cosmopolitancats</a> 19:37, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
