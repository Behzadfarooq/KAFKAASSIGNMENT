<p>Judaism in Ethiopia undoubtedly goes back into very ancient times. In an Ethiopian book titled "<a href="../../../k/e/b/Kebra_Nagast_14db.html" title="Kebra Nagast">Kebra Nagast</a>", or "Book of the Glory of Kings," there are several references to Biblical verses about <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon.html" title="Solomon">Solomon</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheba.html" title="Sheba">Sheba</a>. The Hebrew Bible also has various references. (Tanakh [1 Kings 10:1-13 and 2 Chronicles 9:1-12]). Precisely what its early history was, however, remains obscure. The now dominant Coptic Ethiopian Church claims it originated from the visit of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_Sheba_2ba8.html" title="Queen of Sheba">Queen of Sheba</a> to King Solomon back in the Tenth Century B.C.E. This visit is mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures (I Kings 10:1). Moreover, the details of the queen's visit, including the alleged theft of the Holy Ark as well as Solomon getting her pregnant with a child who established the "Solomonic" lineage in Ethiopia, as given in Christian Ethiopian tradition, are not in the Bible. They instead developed in the Middle Ages, first written down in full in the 13th century <a href="../../../k/e/b/Kebra_Nagast_14db.html" title="Kebra Nagast">Kebra Nagast</a>, inspired partly to legitimize the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomonic_dynasty.html" title="Solomonic dynasty">Solomonic dynasty</a> as compared to the previous <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagwe_dynasty.html" title="Zagwe dynasty">Zagwe dynasty</a> of Agaw descent (Cushitic, not Semitic-speaking, though passionately Christian).</p>
<p>The chief Semitic languages of Ethiopia also suggest an antiquity of Judaism in Ethiopia. "There still remains the curious circumstance that a number of Abyssinian words connected with religion -- <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/o/Idol.html" title="Idol">idol</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purification.html" title="Purification">purification</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alms.html" title="Alms">alms</a> -- are of <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> origin. These words must have been derived directly from a Jewish source, for the Abyssinian Church knows the scriptures only in a Ge'ez version made from the Septuagint. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta_Israel_37b3.html" title="Edit section: Bete Israel tradition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bete Israel tradition</span></h3>
<p>Bete Israel traditions claim that the Ethiopian Jews are descended from the lineage of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> himself, some of whose children and relatives are said to have separated from the other Children of Israel after the Exodus and gone southwards, or, alternatively or together with this, that they are descended from the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe_of_Dan_bc3d.html" title="Tribe of Dan">tribe of Dan</a>, which fled southwards down the Arabian coastal lands from <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaea.html" title="Judaea">Judaea</a> at the time of the breakup of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Monarchy_02a1.html" title="United Monarchy">united Kingdom of Israel</a> into two kingdoms in the 10th century B.C.E. (precipitated by the oppressive demands of <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehoboam.html" title="Rehoboam">Rehoboam</a>, King Solomon's heir), or at the time of the destruction of the northern <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Israel_ab05.html" title="Kingdom of Israel">Kingdom of Israel</a> in the 8th century. Certainly there was trade as early as the time of King Solomon down along the Red Sea to the Yemen and even as far as <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, according to the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, and there would therefore have been Jewish settlements at various points along the trade routes. There is definite archaeological evidence of Jewish settlements and of their cultural influence on both sides of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Sea_ad2d.html" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> well at least 2,500 years ago, both along the Arabian coast and in the Yemen, on the eastern side, and along the southern Egyptian and Sudanese coastal regions.</p>
<p>According to Jacqueline Pirenne, the spread of <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabaeans.html" title="Sabaeans">Sabaeans</a> across the Red Sea to Ethiopia began in the 8th or 7th centuries BCE when considerable numbers of Sabeans crossed over to Ethiopia to escape from the Assyrians who had already devastated the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and were extending their raids further south. She further states that a second major wave of Sabeans crossed over in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE to escape <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebuchadnezzar.html" title="Nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</a>; this wave included Jews fleeing from the Babylonian takeover of Judah too.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> These theories of an early Jewish presence in Ethiopia are generally dismissed, however, for a later ethnogenesis of the Beta Israel and presence of Judaism among Ethiopians.</p>
<p>It also appears that there was a significant movement of Jews into the Sudanese and Ethiopian-Somali coastal areas, and the Arabian and Yemeni coastal areas, following the Roman repression of the various <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Messiah_claimants_8f99.html" title="Jewish Messiah claimants">messianic movements</a> that culminated in the destruction of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Commonwealth_0ab7.html" title="Second Commonwealth">Second Commonwealth</a> of Judaea in the first century C.E.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> There is also evidence from the second century C.E. of Jewish flight southwards from the <a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayyum.html" title="Fayyum">Fayyum</a> of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Survivors fled up the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a>, perhaps to the general region of the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>.</p>
<p>Though the 13th century <a href="../../../k/e/b/Kebra_Nagast_14db.html" title="Kebra Nagast">Kebra Nagast</a> and some traditional Ethiopian histories have stated that <a href="../../../g/u/d/Gudit.html" title="Gudit">Yodit</a> (or "Gudit"), a 10th century usurping queen, was Jewish, it's unlikely that this was the case and it's more likely that she was a pagan southerner<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> or a usurping Christian Aksumite Queen.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the Kebra Negast, the Jewish rulers traced their lineage back to Moses and the tribe of Dan, just as Beta Israel continue to do to this day.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The 9th century Jewish traveller <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldad_ha-Dani_5499.html" title="Eldad ha-Dani">Eldad ha-Dani</a> also claimed descent from this tribe and commented about Jewish Kingdoms around or in East Africa existing during his time. Some see his writings as the first mention of the Bete Israel, but his accuracy is uncertain, however, and others doubt his work, pointing to a lack of firsthand knowledge of Ethiopia's geography and any Ethiopian language, the area that he claims as his homeland.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The first relatively certain reference to the Beta Israel, however, comes only in the early 14th century during the reign of <a href="../../../a/m/d/Amda_Seyon_I_f4d7.html" title="Amda Seyon I">Amda Seyon</a> (r.1314-44). During his reign, probably in early 1332, he mentions campaigns in the northwest regions of Semien, Wegera, Tsellemt, and Tsegedé, where he sends troops to fight people "like Jews" (<a href="../../../g/e/27/Ge%27ez_alphabet.html" title="Ge'ez alphabet">Ge'ez</a> ከመ:አይሁድ <i>kama ayhūd</i>).<sup id="_ref-Encyc553_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc553" title="">[6]</a></sup> It is these regions that would later go on to be areas of frequent Beta Israel rebellion against the Solomonic dynasty for the next three centuries. During this time period, however, religion was less important to the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_of_Ethiopia_569a.html" title="Emperor of Ethiopia">Emperors</a> than loyalty, and rebellious Beta Israel leaders often formed alliances with other enemies of the Emperor despite differing faiths.<sup id="_ref-Encyc553_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc553" title="">[6]</a></sup> The late 14th century Christian monk Qozmos, for instance, copied the <i>Orit</i> (<a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>) for the Beta Israel communities and led them against local Christians before being defeated by Emperor <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawit_I_of_Ethiopia_857b.html" title="Dawit I of Ethiopia">Dawit I</a>.<sup id="_ref-Encyc553_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc553" title="">[6]</a></sup> Likewise, the governor of Tsellemt used both Jewish and Christian troops in a revolt of the 15th century. The first personal campaign against rebelling Beta Israel areas didn't come until the reign of Emperor <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshaq_I_of_Ethiopia_069b.html" title="Yeshaq I of Ethiopia">Yeshaq</a> (r.1414-29), however. It was with his defeat of the governors of Semien and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Dembiya.html" title="Dembiya">Dembiya</a> that religious pressure began, as well as the conferral of lower social status upon Jews.<sup id="_ref-Encyc553_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc553" title="">[6]</a></sup> Yeshaq forced them to convert or lose their land (which would be given away as <i>rist</i>, a type of land qualification that rendered it forever inheritable by the recipient and not transferrable by the Emperor), decreeing "He who is baptized in the Christian religion may inherit the land of his father, otherwise let him be a <i>Falāsī</i>," possibly the origin for the term "Falasha" (<i>falāšā</i>, "wanderer," or "landless person").<sup id="_ref-Encyc553_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc553" title="">[6]</a></sup> Some of the worst massacres, attacks and forced conversions of the Christian kingdom<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> occurred in the 1400s, under Emperor <a href="../../../z/a/r/Zara_Yaqob_4b04.html" title="Zara Yaqob">Zara Yaqob</a>, who even added the title "Exterminator of the Jews" to his name.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the 15th century, Abba Sabra, an archbishop of Coptic Christianity, chaplain of the court and tutor to the heir to the throne, converted to Judaism and fled with the heir and with his priestly disciples to the Jewish vassal kingdom of Gondar.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He and his followers were warmly received by Gondar's rulers and were allowed to continue their monastic life as Jews, settling near to Jewish villages and continuing to study sacred texts, so that they and those they won to their way of life became in subsequent generations learned celibate Jewish monks or hermits supported by local villagers, leading lives of prayer and study. Together with the priests who led ceremonies (who were not of any priestly lineage but were chosen for aptitude from village children), the monks maintained Jewish learning and traditions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/6/2/1624.html" title="1624">1624</a> marked the end of Beta Israel autonomy in Ethiopia, when Emperor <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susenyos_of_Ethiopia_d6dc.html" title="Susenyos of Ethiopia">Susenyos</a> confiscated their lands, selling many into slavery and forcibly <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptizing</a> others.<sup id="_ref-Encyc554_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc554" title="">[7]</a></sup> Their writings and religious books were burned and the practice of any form of Jewish <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> was forbidden in Ethiopia.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> A great deal of traditional Jewish culture and practice was lost or changed as a result of this period of oppression. Nevertheless, the Beta Israel appear to have flourished, during this period, due to the presence of the capital of Ethiopia, <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonder.html" title="Gonder">Gonder</a>, in <a href="../../../d/e/m/Dembiya.html" title="Dembiya">Dembiya</a>, surrounded by Beta Israel lands. They served as craftsmen, masons, and carpenters for the Emperors from the 16th century onwards, roles that were typically shunned as lowly and unhonorable as compared to farming.<sup id="_ref-Encyc554_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc554" title="">[7]</a></sup> According to accounts by European visitors of that time, Portuguese merchants and diplomats, French, British and other travellers, the Beta Israel even numbered about one million persons in the 17th century.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> These accounts also testify that some knowledge of Hebrew remained even in the 17th century. For example, Manoel de Almeida, a Portuguese diplomat and traveller of the day, writes that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The Falashas or Jews are ... of [Arabic] race [and speak] Hebrew, though it is very corrupt. They have their Hebrew Bibles and sing the psalms in their synagogues."</i><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>How far, however, de Almeida actually knew the Ethiopian Jews firsthand must remain speculative: certainly they are not predominantly of the Arabic race, but he could easily have meant the term loosely or meant that they also knew Arabic. The Beta Israel lost these economic advantages, however, during the <a href="../../../z/e/m/Zemene_Mesafint_c358.html" title="Zemene Mesafint">Zemene Mesafint</a>, a period of recurring civil strife, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Although the capital was still nominally in Gonder during this time period, the decentralization and dominance of regional capitals resulted in a decline and exploitation by local rulers, as there was no longer a strong central government that was interested in and capable of protecting them.<sup id="_ref-Encyc554_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc554" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Jewish religion was also lost for some forty years during this period, before being restored by <i>Abba</i> Widdaye, the preeminent monk of <a href="../../../q/w/a/Qwara.html" title="Qwara">Qwara</a>, in the 1840s.<sup id="_ref-Encyc554_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc554" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The earliest still surviving testimony to those hidden kingdoms comes down to us from the 9th century. In the last decades of that century a strange man visited the Jews of Kairowan in Tunisia, a man called Eldad son of Mahli, the Danite. <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldad_Ha-Dani_0c83.html" title="Eldad Ha-Dani">Eldad the Danite</a>, as he is often still referred to in Jewish histories, said he was the lone survivor of a shipwreck, escaped cannibals, and spoke of many other fabulous adventures he had had before arriving in Tunisia. He was of dark skin, spoke only a strange sort of Hebrew (and no Arabic), and claimed to be a Jew of a pastoralist tribe residing in the land of Havilah beyond the rivers of Ethiopia (the southern Sudan, most likely, but possibly <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>). This tribe was made up of the descendants of the tribe of Dan, which had emigrated from Judaea at the time of Jeroboam's accession, after the death of Solomon. He said there were three other tribes with his, <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naphtali.html" title="Naphtali">Naphtali</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/d/Gad.html" title="Gad">Gad</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/h/Asher.html" title="Asher">Asher</a>, who had joined them in the time of <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sennacherib.html" title="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> (who laid waste the northern kingdom of Israel around 722 B.C.E.). Opposite them lived the Children of Moses, Bnai Mosheh, sprung from those Levites who had mutilated the fingers of their right hands rather than sing the songs of Zion by the rivers of Babylon, and chose instead to flee to the south.</p>
<p>The Children of Moses lived beyond a river of grinding stones and so were impossible to visit, except on the sabbath day when the river ceased its grinding (strikingly similar to, if not a direct borrowing from the concept of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sambation.html" title="Sambation">Sambation</a>). The tribes were pastoralists and mighty warriors, and were ruled together by a king assisted by a learned Torah judge-prophet. They did not know of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>, but had their own traditions written down in Hebrew, which he displayed to the rabbis of Tunisia and Egypt. The rabbis corresponded even with a Gaon of Sura (in Babylon), and concluded that he was indeed a Jew and the differences of his practice from their own were legitimate forms of customary law for the Jews of Havilah. The variations from Rabbinic law that he practised and obeyed were still being cited by Rabbinic authorities as precedents in the early modern period. The use of Hebrew as his only medium of communication in the Muslim world and even a written sacred text in Hebrew giving details of ritual and other practices strengthen the likelihood that ancient Ethiopian Jewry knew Hebrew.</p>
<p>In the 16th century, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Rabbi_db97.html" title="Chief Rabbi">Chief Rabbi</a> of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Rabbi <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra_c0e2.html" title="David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra">David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra</a> (Radbaz) proclaimed that in terms of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a> (Jewish legal code), the Ethiopian community was certainly Jewish. Throughout the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, the majority of European Jewish authorities openly supported this assertion.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>, the chief rabbis of 45 countries made a joint statement officially declaring that Ethiopian Jews were indeed Jewish. This proclamation was in large part due to the work of Professor <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Faitlovitch_746a.html" title="Jacques Faitlovitch">Jacques Faitlovitch</a>, who studied <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amharic_language.html" title="Amharic language">Amharic</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigrinya_language.html" title="Tigrinya language">Tigrinya</a> at the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecole_des_Hautes_Etudes_10b7.html" title="Ecole des Hautes Etudes">Ecole des Hautes Etudes</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> under Professor <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Hal%C3%A9vy_ec77.html" title="Joseph Halévy">Joseph Halévy</a>. Halevy first visited the Ethiopian Jews in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>. Upon his return to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, he published a "Kol Korei," a cry to the world Jewish community to save the Ethiopian Jews. He also formed an organization called Kol Yisroel Chaverim ("All Israel are Friends"), which was to actively advocate on behalf of Ethiopian Jews for years to come.</p>

<p>One of the earliest dated references to the Beta Israel in Ethiopian literature is in the <i>Glorious Victories of <a href="../../../a/m/d/Amda_Seyon_I_f4d7.html" title="Amda Seyon I">Amda Seyon</a></i>, which mentions a revolt in the province of <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begemder.html" title="Begemder">Begemder</a> by "the renegades who are like Jews" in the year <a href="../../../1/3/3/1332.html" title="1332">1332</a>. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The isolation of the Beta Israel was reported by an explorer <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bruce_f292.html" title="James Bruce">James Bruce</a>, who published his <i>Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile</i> in <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1790.html" title="1790">1790</a>. But in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>, H.A. Stern, a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> convert to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> traveled to Ethiopia in order to attempt to convert the Beta Israel to Christianity. Popularly touted as a "lost" tribe, the Beta Israel at first found many cultural barriers to assimilating in Israel.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there are many descendants of Ethiopian Jews whose ancestors converted to Christianity who are now returning to the practice of Judaism. This group of people is known as the Falash Mura. They are admitted entrance to Israel, although not as Jews, thus enabling the Israeli government to set quotas to their immigration and make citizenship dependant on Orthodox conversion. Although nobody knows for certain what the exact population is of the Falash Mura in Ethiopia many say it is roughly 20,000-26,000 individuals. However, recently some reporters and other travelers in remote regions of Ethiopia have noted that they have found entire villages where people claim they are Jewish or are Falash Mura (Jews who have been practicing Christianity).</p>
<p>In the Achefar <a href="../../../w/o/r/Woreda.html" title="Woreda">woreda</a> of the <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirab_Gojjam_Zone_cf43.html" title="Mirab Gojjam Zone">Mirab Gojjam Zone</a>, roughly 1,000-2,000 families of Beta Israel were found. However, as of now, they have not petitioned to immigrate to the Jewish state. Yet there are estimates that there are other such regions in Ethiopia with significant Jewish enclaves, raising the total Jewish population to perhaps well over 50,000 people. Israel has approved the immigration of the Falash Mura at 300 a month although the Ethiopian Jewish community and its supporters have been petitioning to increase this to 600 a month in order to prevent the spread of disease and malnourishment amongst the Jews still waiting in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>The holiest work is the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah.html" title="Torah">Torah</a> — Orit (i.e., oraita, "Tora" in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>). All the holy writings, including the Torah, are handwritten on parchment pages that are assembled into a book rather than a scroll. The rest of the Prophets and the Hagiographa are of secondary importance. The language of the holy writings is Ge'ez, not Hebrew. It appears that following the conquest of the Kingdom of Gondar<sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisputed_statement_0636.html" title="Wikipedia:Disputed statement"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may not be factual or accurate." style="white-space: nowrap;">dubious</span></a> <font class="metadata">— see <a href="../../../b/e/t/Talk%7EBeta_Israel_b22c.html#Disputed" title="Talk:Beta Israel">talk page</a></font></i>]</sup> in the 17th century, all Jewish holy books were destroyed, and their study forbidden.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> If Hebrew writings were still extant, this is the time when they were definitively lost. However, the Jews persisted in reading what they could, including the "Old Testament" of the Christian scriptures written in the Christian holy tongue Ge'ez. The Jewish monks, in any case, had retained knowledge of Ge'ez from their ancient Christian antecedents. Great care was taken by these monks and priests to eliminate specifically Christian texts, practices and ideas. Thus, ironically, the Christian religious literature was used selectively to provide the continuing foundation for study of the Jewish sources. This helps to account for some of the texts (and practices) used by the Beta Israel that are not found elsewhere amongst Jews.</p>
<p>Outside the Biblical canon, a number of the external writings — the books of <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch.html" title="Enoch">Enoch</a>, Jubilees, Baruch and the books of Ezra — are held sacred as well. The basic wording of Beta Israel Biblical writings was passed down apparently through the ancient Greek translations like the Septuagint, which incorporates some of the Apocrypha as well.</p>
<p>The Beta Israel possess several other books, among these other books are the Arde'et, Acts of Moses, Apocalypse of Gorgorios, Meddrash Abba Elija (<a href="../../../m/i/d/Midrash.html" title="Midrash">Midrash</a> Eliyahu Rabbah}, and biographies of the nation's forebears: Gadla Adam, Gadla Avraham, Gadla Ishak, Gadla Ya'kov, Gadla Moshe, Gadla Aaron, Nagara Musye, Mota Musye.</p>

<p>A book of special importance for the leaders of the community is one dealing with the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabbat.html" title="Shabbat">Shabbat</a> and its precepts — Te'ezaza Sanbat (Precepts of the Sabbath). The leaders of the Beta Israel also read liturgical works including weekday services, Shabbat and Festival prayers, and the wordings of the various blessings: Sefer Cahen deals with priestly functions, while Sefer Sa'atat (Book of the Hours) applies to weekdays and Shabbat. The Beta Israel religious calendar is set according to a treastise known as the Abu Shaker, which was written around 1257 CE, and dealt with the computation of Jewish holidays and chronological matters. The Abu Shaker lists civil and lunar dates for Jewish feasts including Matqe' (New Year), Soma Ayhud or Badr (Yom Kippur), Masallat (Sucot), Fesh (Passover), and Soma Dehnat (Fast of Salvation) or Soma Aster (Fast of Esther).</p>
<p>The Beta Israel have an interesting holiday, known as Sigd on the 29th of Cheshvan, which is unique to them. Sigd or Seged is derived from the Semitic root meaning "to bow or prostrate oneself." In the past the day was called Mehella , and the acts of bowing and supplication are still known by that name. It celebrates the giving of the Torah and the days of the return from exile in Babylonia to Jerusalem under Ezra and Nehemiah. It is further stated in Beta Israel tradition that Sigd commemorates Ezra's proclamation against the Babylonian wives (Ezra 10:10-12). In Ethiopia the Sigd would take place on hilltops outside villages. The location was called by several names, including Ya'arego Dabr (Mountain for making prayers) and in Amharic Yalamana Tarrara (Mountain of Supplication). The Kessim draw a parallel between the choice of a mountain and Mount Sinai. Another source describes Sigd (calling it Amata Saww) as a new-moon holiday after which the Kessim withdrew for a period of isolation.</p>
<p>Social contact between the Beta Israel and other Ethiopians was limited, in part because of the laws of <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kashrut.html" title="Kashrut">Kashrut</a> that they followed. It was forbidden for Ethiopian Jews to eat the food of non-Jews and the Kessim were even more strict about the prohibition against eating food prepared by non-Kessim. In the past, Beta Israel who broke these taboos were ostracized and had to undergo a purification process, including fasting for one or more days and ritual purification in a <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikvah.html" title="Mikvah">mikvah</a> before entering the village. Unlike other Ethiopians, the Beta Israel do not eat raw meat dishes like <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitfo.html" title="Kitfo">kitfo</a> or <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gored_gored.html" title="Gored gored">gored gored</a>.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1984, Israeli-led <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Moses_a639.html" title="Operation Moses">Operation Moses</a> began transporting Ethiopian Jews to Israel. It came to an abrupt halt in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, though, leaving many of the Beta Israel still in Ethiopia. It was not until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> that the governments of Israel and Ethiopia came to an agreement that would allow the remaining Beta Israel a chance to migrate to Israel. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, however, the political and economic stability of Ethiopia deteriorated as rebels mounted attacks against and eventually won over the capital city of <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addis_Ababa_a075.html" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>.

<p>Just as interesting as the stories of the various Ethiopian Jews who made their way to Israel are some of the stories of Ethiopian Jewish life in Israel. Ethiopian Jews are gradually becoming part of the mainstream Israeli society in religious life, military service (with nearly all males doing national service), education, and politics. However, this transition has not been entirely smooth, and just as other groups of immigrant Jews who made aliyah to Israel, the Ethiopian Jews have faced obstacles in their integration to Israeli society. This has also been complicated by racist attitudes on the part of some elements of the Israeli population and official establishment. <sup id="_ref-Bookinfo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bookinfo" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, another study found that some of the problems with the absorption of the Beta Israel is due to the model of absorption chosen.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Planning for the absorption of Jewish immigrants to Israel has been dominated by a procedural approach, which has generally been insensitive to the particular circumstances and needs of minority ethnic groups. This approach has emphasised the `national interest’ as defined by the dominant group, namely Ashkenazi Jews who originated in Central Europe. The social and cultural traditions of other groups have been treated as `problems’ that need to be overcome, and minimal attention has been given to the processes of adaptation such groups undergo.</i> <sup id="_ref-EthnCit_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EthnCit" title="">[11]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Most of the 90,000 Ethiopian Jews now living in Israel arrived in two main waves, the first in 1984 (about 33,000 people) and the second in 1991 (about 20,000 people) in two airlifts known as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Moses_a639.html" title="Operation Moses">Operation Moses</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Solomon_a1d4.html" title="Operation Solomon">Operation Solomon</a>, respectively. (Although there had been individual Ethiopian Jews who lived in Eretz Yisrael prior to the establishment of the state, as well as a youth group that arrived in Israel in the 1950s to undergo training in Hebrew education and returned to Ethiopia to educate young Jews there. Also, Ethiopian Jews had been trickling into Israel prior to the 1970s, and the numbers grew larger after the Israeli government officially recognized them as Jews entitled to Israeli citizenship in 1973) These people arrived as a result of dramatic rescue operations prompted by civil war and famine in Ethiopia, within the context of Israel’ s national mission to gather Diaspora Jews from all over the world and bring them to the Jewish homeland. At the height of the rescue, 19,000 people arrived in Israel from Ethiopia in a period of just 24 hours. ).<sup id="_ref-EthnicCit_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EthnicCit" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The State of Israel prepared itself for the absorption of Ethiopian Jews by formulating two `Master Plans’ (Ministry of Absorption, 1985, 1991). The first was prepared in 1985, a year after the arrival of the first wave of immigrants; the second simply updated the first in response to the second wave of immigration from Ethiopia in 1991. The first Master Plan contained an elaborate and detailed program. It covered issues of housing, education, employment and practical organization, together with policy guidelines regarding specific groups including women, youths, and lone-parent families. Like earlier absorption policies, it adopted a procedural approach, assuming that the immigrants were broadly similar to the existing majority population of Israel. The Plans were, no doubt, formulated with the best of intentions and a firm belief in the underlying principles of absorption. However, as indicated in this section, the results have been disappointing and suggest that much greater attention needs to be paid to issues of ethnicity.<a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~tobiws/ethiopian.pdf#search='Ethiopian%20women%20in%20Israel'" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tau.ac.il/~tobiws/ethiopian.pdf#search='Ethiopian%20women%20in%20Israel'" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>According to a November 17th 1999 <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> article, a report commissioned by Israel's Ministry of Immigrant Absorption stated that 75% of the 70,000 Ethiopian Jews that were living in Israel in 1999 could not read or write Hebrew and over half of the population could not hold a simple conversation in the language. Unlike Russian immigrants, many of whom arrive with job skills, the Ethiopians came from a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsistence_economy.html" title="Subsistence economy">subsistence economy</a> and were ill-prepared to work in an industrialized country.

During the Italian occupation he went into hiding and worked as a farmer in Wolleka. After the war Yona Bogale worked for the Ethiopian Ministry of Education for twelve years and then for the Jewish Agency.</p>
<p>Yona Bogale was fluent in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> as well as <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amharic_language.html" title="Amharic language">Amharic</a>. He was also an author of an early Hebrew-Amharic dictionary. He left Ethiopia in late 1979 and immigrated to Israel. Yona was an early proponent of Ethiopian Jewish praying in Hebrew instead of Ge'ez since he felt that it was no longer appropriate for those seeking to be a part of the modern Jewish world. He did feel though that the Ethiopian Jews should set Hebrew prayers to the traditional Jewish melodies.</p>
<p><b>Rabbi Sharon Shalom</b> is a lecturer in Jewish ritual and tradition at Bar Ilan University in Israel and a counselor for the Ethiopian-Israeli community in the town of Kiryat Gat.

<p><b>Rabbi Yefet Alemu</b>, who was born in 1961 in a small village in Ethiopia. In 1980, he left his village seeking to go to Israel. He was arrested in Addis Ababa and escaped from prison. He arrived in the Gondar region and then set out walking to Sudan. There he met a Jewish Red Cross director who arranged for him to fly on one of the Israeli organized secret flights to Israel. In Israel he studied and became a nurse.</p>
<p>At the same time, while continuing to be a believing Jew, he became disillusioned with organized Judaism and with the Israeli religious establishment's insistence on a conversion ceremony for all Ethiopian Jews. Yefet helped organize an Ethiopian protest vigil opposite the Chief Rabbinate building in Jerusalem. At the vigil, he met students from the Schecter Institute of Jewish students who were studying to be Conservative rabbis. He was confused and surprised to see that they were without beards and without long black coats. The students replied that there was more than one type of rabbi, more than one way of being Jewish. Yefet excitingly embraced this pluralistic approach to Judaism. He was accepted by the Schecter Institute and after 6 years of hard work, he received a BA, MA, and his rabbinical ordination. <a href="http://www.partner.org.il/beitshemesh/news-0206-po.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.partner.org.il/beitshemesh/news-0206-po.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>Ethiopian-Israelis have also been participating more and more in Israeli political life. In 2006, the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shas.html" title="Shas">Shas</a>, the party representing <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra-Orthodox_Jews_59ef.html" title="Ultra-Orthodox Jews">ultra-Orthodox Jews</a> of Sephardic and Middle Eastern background, in its list for the <a href="../../../k/n/e/Knesset.html" title="Knesset">Knesset</a>, included an Ethiopian rabbi from <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beersheba.html" title="Beersheba">Beersheba</a>, in a conscious attempt to represent diverse geographic and ethnic groups. <b>Rabbi Mazor Bayana</b>, rabbi of an Ethiopian community of 10,000 in Beersheba, learned at Yeshivat Porat Yosef, one of the most prestigious Sephardi yeshivot in Israel . Rabbi Bayana, however, ultimately did not win a seat in the Knesset.</p>
<p>Shas was not the only party attempting to appeal to the Ethiopian vote. Herut and <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadima.html" title="Kadima">Kadima</a> both had Ethiopians on their lists. Shlomo Mula, head of the Jewish Agency's Ethiopian absorption department, was ranked 33 on Kadima's list and Avraham Nagosa is number three on Herut's list.</p>
<p>So far, only one Ethiopian Israeli has served in the Knesset, MK (Member of Knesset) <b>Addisu Masala</b>, of Labour.</p>
<p><b>Avraham Negussie</b> is one of Israel's most prominent Ethiopian Activist and a member of the South Wing to Zion. His struggle, with the support of many other Ethiopian Israelis has resulted in the Israeli governments continuing to bring the last 23,000 Ethiopian Jews from Ethiopia; though the Israeli government has set a quota of 300 Jews per month, half of what they agreed to under pressure from Negussie, NACOEJ and the United Jewish Communities.</p>
<p>Shas's spiritual mentor, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, enthusiastically embraced Ethiopians when they first began immigrating to Israel four decades ago. Despite Rabbi Ovadia's halachic ruling, some refuse to marry Ethiopians without a conversion in accordance with official Chief Rabbinate policy. Only in cities and towns with rabbis that accept Ovadia's ruling or the ruling of Rabbi Shlomo Goren are Ethiopians married without immersion in a ritual bath (mikva) or, for men, <i>hatafat dam</i>, הטפת דם, see <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_milah.html" title="Brit milah"><i>brit milah</i></a>), the symbolic cut to produce a drop of blood instead of circumcision.<a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1138622564484&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1138622564484&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>

<p>A museum highlighting the culture and heritage of the Ethiopian Jewish community is to be built in Rehovot. The museum, planned as a research, interpretive and spiritual center, is the brainchild of Tomer, an association whose members are veteran Ethiopian immigrants and former <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a> agents who took part in the first operations to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The Jews of Ethiopia have a rich cultural heritage, and are the only Jews who strictly kept their <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> although they were entirely cut off from the Jewish people," said Tomer chairman Moshe Bar-Yuda. "The museum will present Ethiopian Jewish culture to Israelis who are not familiar enough with it, and also to young Ethiopians who fall between the cracks - on one hand they are not connected to their parents' culture, and on the other, they sometimes find it hard to become part of the dynamic of life in Israel. When they see the ancient culture of their forbears, they will be filled with pride, and it will be easier for them to become part of veteran Israeli society,"</i> he says.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Plans for the museum, expected to cost some $4.5 million, include a model Ethiopian village, an herb garden, an artificial stream, an amphitheater, classrooms and a memorial to Ethiopian Jews who died in Sudan on their way to Israel and Ethiopian Zionist activists. "We view the conservation of the past as very important and believe the museum will attract young people and adults alike," <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehovot.html" title="Rehovot">Rehovot</a> Mayor Shuki Forer says.</p>
<p>A large number of Ethiopian Jews make their home in Rehovot and surrounding towns, the reason for its selection as the site of the museum. The city has set aside six dunams, 1.5 acres, of land for the museum complex.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"All 21 members of the Rehovot City Council, both coalition and opposition, voted for the establishment of the center,"</i> says Abai Zaudeh, a council member and a member of Tomer's board of directors. <i>"It's the first time they all agree and leave politics behind to focus on the reality that the establishment of the museum will assist the absorption of the Ethiopian community a great deal,"</i> he says.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One of the museum's founders was Baruch Tegegne, who pioneered escape routes from Ethiopia via Sudan and fought for the right of Jews to emigrate to Israel. Other founders include veteran Ethiopian rights activist Babu Yaakov, a former member of the Ramle City Council, and Shetu Barehon, who worked in the transit camps in Sudan to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel. A number of Ethiopian Jewish spiritual leaders and rabbis are also working to increase support for the project in the community and the Diaspora.</p>
<p>Bar-Yuda's long association with the Ethiopian Jewish community began in 1958, when the Jewish Agency asked him to go to Ethiopia to look for Jews, reaching remote villages. The report he prepared, along with a 16th Century ruling by Rabbi <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra_c0e2.html" title="David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra">David B. Zimra</a>, known as the Radbaz, was the basis for the 1973 ruling by then-chief Sephardic rabbi Ovadia Yosef that the Jews of Ethiopia were to be considered Jews according to halakha (Jewish religious law).<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Ethiopian legend described in the <a href="../../../k/e/b/Kebra_Negast_f629.html" title="Kebra Negast">Kebra Negast</a> relates that Ethiopians are descendants of Israelite tribes who came to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Ethiopia_8184.html" title="History of Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> with <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menelik_I_aa2c.html" title="Menelik I">Menelik I</a>, alleged to be the son of King <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon.html" title="Solomon">Solomon</a> and the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_Sheba_2ba8.html" title="Queen of Sheba">Queen of Sheba</a> (or Makeda, in the legend). The legend relates that Menelik, as an adult, returned to his father in Jerusalem, and then resettled in Ethiopia, and that he took with him the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Ark_of_the_Covenant_ce22.html" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>. In the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> there is no mention that the Queen of Sheba either married or had any sexual relations with King Solomon; rather, the narrative records that she was impressed with his wealth and wisdom, and they exchanged royal gifts, and then she returned to rule her people in <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kush.html" title="Kush">Kush</a>. However, the "royal gifts" are interpreted by some as sexual contact. The loss of the Ark is also not mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p>However, most of the Beta Israel consider the Kebra Negast legend to be a fabrication. Instead they believe, based on the <a href="../../../9/t/h/9th_century.html" title="9th century">9th century</a> stories of <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldad_ha-Dani_5499.html" title="Eldad ha-Dani">Eldad ha-Dani</a> (the Danite), that the tribe of Dan attempted to avoid the civil war in the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Israel_ab05.html" title="Kingdom of Israel">Kingdom of Israel</a> between Solomon's son <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehoboam.html" title="Rehoboam">Rehoboam</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeroboam.html" title="Jeroboam">Jeroboam</a> the son of Nebat, by resettling in Egypt. From there they moved southwards up the Nile into Ethiopia, and the Ethiopian Jews are descended from these Danites. This tradition was made known to Rabbi <a href="../../../o/b/a/Obadiah_ben_Abraham_49dc.html" title="Obadiah ben Abraham">Ovadiah Yare of Bertinoro</a> who wrote a letter from Jerusalem in 1488:</p>

<p>Some <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">legal</a> authorities have asserted that the Beta Israel are the descendants of the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe_of_Dan_bc3d.html" title="Tribe of Dan">tribe of Dan</a>, one of the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Lost_Tribes_6a89.html" title="Ten Lost Tribes">Ten Lost Tribes</a>. This is supported by the medieval traveller <a href="../../../e/l/d/Eldad_ha-Dani_5499.html" title="Eldad ha-Dani">Eldad ha-Dani</a>. In their view, these people established a Jewish kingdom that lasted for hundreds of years. With the rise of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and later <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, schisms arose and three kingdoms competed. Eventually, the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> Ethiopian kingdoms reduced the Jewish kingdom to a small impoverished section. The earliest authority to rule this way was the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radbaz.html" title="Radbaz">Radbaz</a> (Rabbi <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_ben_Zimra_a570.html" title="David ben Zimra">David ben Zimra</a>, 1479 – 1573). Radbaz explains in a responsum concerning the status of a Beta Israel slave:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>But those Jews who come from the land of Cush are without doubt from the tribe of Dan, and since they did not have in their midst sages who were masters of the tradition, they clung to the simple meaning of the Scriptures. If they had been taught, however, they would not be irreverent towards the words of our sages, so their status is comparable to a Jewish infant taken captive by non-Jews … And even if you say that the matter is in doubt, it is a commandment to redeem them.</i> <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[16]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>In 1973 Rabbi <a href="../../../o/v/a/Ovadia_Yosef_b421.html" title="Ovadia Yosef">Ovadia Yosef</a>, then the Chief Sephardic Rabbi, based on the Radbaz and other accounts ruled that the Beta Israel were Jews and should be brought to Israel. He was later joined by a number of other authorities including the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi who made similar rulings. Although Yosef's view appears more lenient, it leads to a tremendous stringency. Since the Beta Israel had no formal process of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29" rel="nofollow">get</a>], they must all be assumed to have the status of a <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamzer.html" title="Mamzer">Mamzer</a>, an illegitimately born Jew who cannot marry regular Jews.</p>
<p>Other legal authorities, primarily <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazim.html" title="Ashkenazim">Ashkenazim</a>, have maintained that the Jewishness of the Beta Israel is seriously suspect. Authorities who have also ruled this way include Rabbis <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moshe_Feinstein_7337.html" title="Moshe Feinstein">Moshe Feinstein</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosef_Shalom_Eliashiv_3709.html" title="Yosef Shalom Eliashiv">Yosef Shalom Eliashiv</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/l/Shlomo_Zalman_Auerbach_6ec5.html" title="Shlomo Zalman Auerbach">Shlomo Zalman Auerbach</a>.</p>
<p>In either case, some modern rabbinical authorities require the Beta Israel to undergo shortened conversions as a religious precaution. Among those who carry the latter opinion, however, conversion is no mere formality if an Ethiopian Jew wishes to be accepted within other Jewish communities.</p>

These Y-chromosome studies only speak to the paternal lineage (some ethnic groups are a product of one maternal lineage and a different paternal lineage, see <a href="../../../m/%C3%A9/t/M%C3%A9tis_people_%28Canada%29_c92c.html" title="Métis people (Canada)">Métis people (Canada)</a>), but a study of the <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitochondrial_DNA_a63c.html" title="Mitochondrial DNA">Mitochondrial DNA</a> <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=379128" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=379128" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> (which is passed only along the maternal lineage) shows that the most common mtDNA type found among the Ethiopian Jewish sample was present elsewhere only in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>, furthering the view of most that Ethiopian Jews are of local (Ethiopian) origin.</p>
<p>However, a study performed by the Department of Biological Sciences at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> did find a possible genetic similarity between 11 Ethiopian Jews and 4 <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemenite_Jews_b3bb.html" title="Yemenite Jews">Yemenite Jews</a> who took part in the testing. The differentiation statistic and genetic distances for the 11 Ethiopian Jews and 4 Yemenite Jews tested were quite low, among the smallest of comparisons that involved either of these populations. Ethiopian Jewish Y-Chromosomal haplotype are often present in Yemenite and other Jewish populations, but analysis of Y-Chromosomal haplotype frequencies does not indicate a close relationship between Ethiopian Jewish groups. It is possible that the 4 Yemenite Jews from this study may be descendants of reverse migrants of African origin, who crossed Ethiopia to <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>. The result from this study suggests that gene flow between Ethiopia and Yemen as a possible explanation. The study also suggests that the gene flow between Ethiopian and Yemenite Jewish populations may not have been direct, but instead could have been between Jewish and non-Jewish populations of both regions. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the past secular scholars were divided on the origins of the Beta Israel; whether they were the descendants of an Israelite tribe, or converted by Jews living in <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, or by the Jewish community in southern Egypt (<a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephantine.html" title="Elephantine">Elephantine</a>). Some have conjectured, based on references in the Bible, that they could be remnants of an ancient Jewish community in the region. For example in the Book of Isaiah the author prophesies that "the Lord will bring back a remnant of his people...returning them to the land of Israel from Assyria, Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, Ethiopia, Elam, Babylonia, Hamath, and all the distant coastlands" (Isaiah 11:11). In the Book of Zephaniah it is also prophesied that "from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering" (Zephaniah 3:10). Both books are believed to have been written during the 8th and 7th century B.C.E.</p>
<p>Modern scholars of Ethiopian history and Ethiopian Jews, such as James Quirin, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Kaplan_f040.html" title="Steve Kaplan">Steve Kaplan</a>, Kay Shelemay, and Harold Marcus, consider the Beta Israel to be a native group of Ethiopian Christians, who took on Biblical practices, and came to see themselves as Jews. As Paul B. Henze explains:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>These groups came into conflict with the military colonies and Christian missions which were the main instruments of the extension southward of the Ethiopian state. They may have been joined by dissidents or rebelling northern Christians who felt their interpretation of ritual, sacred texts and traditions of art represented a more ancient Israelite connection than Orthodox <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monophysite.html" title="Monophysite">Monophysite</a></i> [sic] <i>Christianity itself. The Beta Israel can thus be understood as a manifestation of the kind of rebellious archaism that has often come to the surface in Christianity -- e.g. <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Old_Believers_a429.html" title="Russian Old Believers">Russian Old Believers</a> and German Old Lutherans. Assertion of Jewish derivation, they felt, provided them with a stronger claim to legitimacy than their Christian enemies.</i> <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[18]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Operation Moses was the subject of an Israeli-French film titled <i>Va, Vis et Deviens</i> (<i><a href="../../../g/o/%2C/Go%2C_See%2C_and_Become_20dc.html" title="Go, See, and Become">Go, See, and Become</a></i>), directed by Romanian-born <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radu_Mih%C4%83ileanu_140b.html" title="Radu Mihăileanu">Radu Mihăileanu</a>. The film is based on an Ethiopian Christian child whose mother forces him to pass off as Jew so he can emigrate to Israel along with the Jews in order to escape famine that is looming in Ethiopia. The film went on to get the 2005 best film award at the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen_International_Film_Festival_8b0f.html" title="Copenhagen International Film Festival">Copenhagen International Film Festival</a>.</p>
