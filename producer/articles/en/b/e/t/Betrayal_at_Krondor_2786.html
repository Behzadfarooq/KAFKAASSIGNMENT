<p>The game uses 256-color 320x200 <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_Graphics_Array_4e20.html" title="Video Graphics Array">VGA mode</a>. The graphics engine uses <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texture_mapping.html" title="Texture mapping">textured</a> <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_graphics_b84f.html" title="3D graphics">3D graphics</a> to draw the terrain and uses <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprite_%28computer_graphics%29.html" title="Sprite (computer graphics)">sprites</a> for most of the detailed objects. The engine does not support multi-level terrain as such, but obstacles such as hills and mountains are supported. Most shops, inns, temples, special locations, and large cities are done as pictures usable through <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen_hotspot.html" title="Screen hotspot">hotspots</a>. Smaller towns have 3D buildings.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-player_character.html" title="Non-player character">NPC</a>, character and some monster art is based on photographs. Environments are a mix of captured images and hand-drawn. In combat and puzzle screens, all characters are animated, except for movement - characters do not appear to move their legs while walking.</p>
<p>The game models illumination to certain extent: In the overworld, day and night are modelled, and in the dark underground locations, the player needs to use a torch or a light spell to illuminate the surroundings.</p>

The main interface of <i>Betrayal at Krondor</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Most of the gameplay happens on the 3D view of the game world. Aside of the overworld, there are also various dungeons, caves and sewers to explore. Exploration occurs mainly from a first-person view but switches to a third-person view during combat.</p>
<p>The game has two possible views, the 3D view and the 2D top-down map view, where the player is represented with a triangular marker. In the original game, the map view rotated when the player turned, while the player was always facing north; in patch 1.02 and later, there's an option which allows the map view to stay put while the player direction marker turns around.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The overworld is automatically mapped, but other locations are not; they are <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automap.html" title="Automap">automatically mapped</a> in the top-down view. The player can also view the full map of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midkemia.html" title="Midkemia">Midkemia</a> and see their location.</p>
<p>The player is generally allowed to explore the world how they wish, however, only certain locations are accessible in certain chapters.</p>
<p>It's also possible to camp in the wilderness.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>One of the unique features of the game are the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moredhel.html" title="Moredhel">moredhel</a> riddle chests. These chests have <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combination_lock.html" title="Combination lock">combination locks</a> with letters on each dial, and a <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riddle.html" title="Riddle">riddle</a> written upon them whose answer will open the chest if spelled out on the lock. The chests typically hold valuable items, and sometimes hints in form of communiques between various NPCs. If no member of the player's party can read the moredhel language, the writing on the chest will appear as gibberish, although it can still be opened by trying each possible combination.</p>
<p>The players can also explore the world by digging up various graves, some of which are disguised equipment caches. There are also abandoned houses, pits, treasure chests, and some other caches of items that can be checked for loot.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Plot is usually advanced through literary cutscenes. Each chapter begins and ends with a cutscene, consisting of text and dialogue with animations, usually based on location and character artwork.</p>
<p>The player characters meet various NPCs over time. The dialogue is text-based (often with short voice clips as greetings), and each NPC the player can discuss with has their own picture as well. The dialogue is <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree_%28data_structure%29.html" title="Tree (data structure)">tree</a>-based: in certain cases, the player can choose between various dialogue keywords. This is often used to get information, training, and items, often for a price.</p>

<p>There are two or three characters in the adventuring party. While the player is able to meet various non-human characters over their journeys - dwarves, elves, and dragons - all but one of the available player characters are human (the exception being Gorath, a dark elf). There are only two classes of characters: Fighters and Magicians. The main difference is that Fighters are able to use <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">swords</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">crossbows</a>, while magicians can only use a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_%28stick%29.html" title="Staff (stick)">staff</a> as a weapon - the only long-range attacks magicians are capable of are various spells.</p>
<p>The character system is unique. Character statistics are based on numeric attributes. The two key attributes in combat are Health and Stamina. Speed tells how many combat grid squares the character can move. Strength influences the amount of damage the character inflicts in <a href="../../../m/%C3%AA/l/M%C3%AAl%C3%A9e.html" title="MÃªlÃ©e">mÃªlÃ©e</a> combat. Spellcasting, swinging one's weapon, and combat damage first use up stamina. Once stamina is depleted, health is used and as it decreases, the character's other abilities (such as weapon accuracy) are affected. When health reaches zero, the character is knocked out and near death, taking a long time to heal. If the entire party's health drops to zero, the party dies.</p>
<p>In addition to the attributes, each character has a set of skills, which are expressed as percentages. The skills can be emphasized, which means they will improve faster, while unemphasized skills improve slower. Skills are generally improved by using them; For example, fixing weapons will improve the Weaponcraft skill, which in turn will make the character more effective at fixing weapons in the future. Some of the skills include weapon accuracy, weapon and armor repair, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockpicking.html" title="Lockpicking">lockpicking</a>, haggling, barding, and spellcasting accuracy. There are also items which improve the skills permanently (i.e. books and practice lutes) or temporarily (i.e. redweed brew for melee accuracy or truesight tea for crossbow accuracy)</p>
<p>Characters can also acquire various statuses. Characters that are knocked out in combat acquire "Near Death" status, meaning they're extremely ineffective in combat and heal very slowly; if the wounds are properly cared for (using herbal packs or restoratives), they will start healing faster. Healing items are generally moderately effective. If the entire party is near death, the game will end. Improved rate of healing is handled as a status effect as well, as are things like poisonings and drunkenness.</p>

A battle scene showcasing the combat engine of <i>Betrayal at Krondor</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Combat takes place on a grid, similar to <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactical_role-playing_game.html" title="Tactical role-playing game">tactical role-playing games</a> such as <i><a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_Emblem_c2aa.html" title="Fire Emblem">Fire Emblem</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_50c2.html" title="Final Fantasy Tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i>.</p>
<p>In combat there are several options. The player can move to a different location on the grid. If the player can reach the enemy they can attack in the same move. Once next to the enemy the player can attack with their weapon. There are two options: a thrust and a swing. The swing does more damage but has less chance of hitting, depending on the character's melee skill, and uses up one point of health/stamina. If a <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a> is equipped the character can attack from a distance. Magicians may use spells. In combat, the player can also choose to defend, or rest, which regains health and stamina. Finally, it's possible to assess the enemy to get information on them.</p>
<p>The damaged enemies may try to run away, unless the player can cut them down in time or freeze them with a spell. After battle killed enemies remain on the ground in the map, and the player can loot their corpses.</p>
<p>The combat interface is also used in solving magical traps. These traps, which are small puzzles, involve various kinds of hazards, such as fireball throwers, and the player either has to defuse them somehow using the objects provided, or otherwise navigate through. The trap is solved if one character can make it through the trap alive.</p>

Gorath also has another reason: he is one of the "returned," a moredhel who has broken away from the Dark Path and attempts to journey to Elvandar to rejoin the eledhel, assuming he isn't killed by his brethren first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Seigneur James</dt>
<dd>(Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7) Once known as Jimmy the Hand, James is the son of the Upright Man, though he is unaware of his parentage.

<p>Nighthawks were responsible for killing the king's soldiers and left two clues behind: an enchanted spyglass and a silver spider. Following the trail of the spyglass and the spider leads the party north to Cavall Keep, home of Owyn's uncle, Count Geoffrey Corvalis, and the enigmatic merchant Navon du Sandau. James, Owyn, and Gorath learn that Navon is the illegitimate son of Corvalis' wife and the leader of the Nighthawks and are forced to kill him. They use his keys to enter the Nighthawks' hideout in the caverns beneath Cavall Keep. Finding Delekhan's plans to attack Northwarden, they realize that Nighthawks may have infiltrated the fortress and decide to split up. James heads north to Northwarden while Owyn and Gorath head south to warn Arutha. Before they can reach Arutha though, Owyn and Gorath are captured by Narab, another of Delekhan's advisers.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Gorath and Owyn are taken north to Sar-Sargoth, where Narab presents them to Delekhan, who is enraged at Narab for ruining their plans. Delekhan interrogates Gorath and Owyn, but is unable to find out anything. Later, Narab magically opens Owyn's cell, allowing Gorath and Owyn escape the city and head south.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Along the way, they rescue the moredhel chieftain Obkhar and, with the help of Gorath's ex-wife Cullich, obtain the passwords needed to safely pass south from Delekhan's son, Moraeulf. Gorath and Owyn eventually reach the Inclindel Gap and are escorted them to Arutha's camp by a Kingdom patrol. Arutha is hesitant, but Owyn convinces him they're telling the truth and Arutha readies his army to head to Northwarden. He sends Owyn and Gorath back to Krondor to inform Pug of what is happening in case magic is used during the attack.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>In Krondor, Makala visits Pug and tells him that the Assembly of Magicians considers Gamina to be an abomination and that he has imprisoned her until her fate can be decided. Pug is enraged and vows to find her, burning "The Book Of Macros" into the wall after Makala leaves. When Katala is unable to find him or their daughter, she discovers his message and tells Owyn and Gorath.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> Following clues about the Book of Macros from Sarth and the Abbaye Ishape in Malac's Cross, Owyn and Gorath head west to Elvandar. Once they arrive, Gorath pledges his allegiance to Queen Aglaranna, becoming one of the eledhel, and Tomas shows them the Book of Macros, a gift from Pug to find him if he ever left the message to do so. Recently injured by a poisoned arrow during a skirmish, Tomas cannot go and sends Owyn and Gorath in his stead. Owyn and Gorath read the book, which teleports them into the unknown.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>In Northwarden, the moredhel raiding leader is captured and reveals that they believe Murmandamus is alive and imprisoned at Sethanon. The moredhel have a rift machine that they plan to use to bypass Arutha's army and enter Sethanon. Realizing that the attack was a diversion engineered by Makala, Arutha readies his troops to head to Sethanon and instructs James, Locklear, and Patrus to find and destroy the rift machine.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> With the help of Duke Martin, Obkhar, and Squire Philip, they find the rift machine and destroy it using a device called a Waani. As the rift collapses, it pulls in everything nearby. James and Locklear grab onto trees, but Patrus is sucked in, killing him. The air flashes purple, signalling the arrival of Spellweavers...<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>Owyn and Gorath are teleported to Timirianya, where Owyn realizes that he cannot use his magical powers and neither would Pug.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> They find the ruins of the temple of Karzeen Mauk, where the god Dhatsavan tells Owyn that he enclosed Pug within a protective barrier since he was rendered powerless and asks Owyn to retrieve the Cup of Rlnn Skrr. Owyn and Gorath retrieve the cup and in exchange, Dhatsavan teleports them to Pug.</p>
<p>During his confinement, Pug has figured out that Makala has ascertained the existence of the Lifestone underneath Sethanon. Makala manipulated Delekhan into attacking to occupy Arutha's army and took Gamina to Timirianya to lure Pug away from Midkemia, leaving Makala free to enter Sethanon unopposed.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> Owyn uses the Cup of Rlnn Skrr to restore Pug's powers and together Pug, Owyn, and Gorath find Gamina encased in a crystal cage within the underground ruins of the Temple of Dhatsavan.

<p>Pug, Owyn, and Gorath appear before James and Locklear in the Dimwood. Pug instructs James and Locklear to wait for Arutha to arrive and inform him that the moredhel will not be using magic because Makala will be waiting for Pug.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> Pug, Owyn, and Gorath travel to the underground caverns beneath Sethanon and kill the six Tsurani Spellweavers (Great Ones) who magically sealed off the Lifestone Chamber. Makala has incapacitated the dragon guarding the Lifestone so Gorath remains behind to protect it while Pug and Owyn confront Makala. Makala believes that Pug was keeping the Lifestone hidden to use as a weapon and wants it destroyed, but Pug refuses because doing so would disturb the Valheru souls trapped inside. Pug and Owyn engage Makala in a spectacular magic battle and eventually defeat him. Immediately afterwards, Gorath and Delekhan enter the Lifestone chamber, locked in combat. Delekhan reaches for the Lifestone and Gorath tries to stop him. As they struggle over the Lifestone, Pug and Owyn are forced to kill them both with a blast of magic in order to prevent the Valheru trapped within the Lifestone from being released.</p>
<p>Returning above ground to the ruins of Sethanon, Pug creates illusions of Murmandamus and Delekhan, visible to the attacking moredhel. The two illusions are then destroyed by the dragon, showing the moredhel that both their leaders are dead. Moraeulf, who is leading the attack, is killed by Narab, who fulfills his plans to take over leadership of the moredhel now that Delekhan, Moraeulf, Nago, and Gorath are dead. The moredhel withdraw and Owyn is left with Pug, who reveals that since he now knows of the Lifestone's existence, Pug must ensure he stays silent. He suggests that Owyn become one of his students at Stardock and Owyn replies that he's never wanted anything else.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the game was based on a license of Raymond E. Feist's Midkemian universe, a long held myth was that the text and the story of the game were actually created by Feist himself. In point of fact, Feist was busy writing <i><a href="../../../k/r/o/Krondor%27s_Sons_ba82.html#The_King.27s_Buccaneer" title="Krondor's Sons">The King's Buccaneer</a></i> during the game's production, so the plot, text and new characters for were created by designers <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Hallford_82a1.html" title="Neal Hallford">Neal Hallford</a> and John Cutter (Hallford is listed first in the story credits of the game followed by Cutter and Feist).<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> Feist did have editorial final say on the game, but most of what Hallford and Cutter created was left as they created it.</p>

<p><i>Betrayal At Krondor</i> was originally released on 3Â½" disks in 1993. A special CD-ROM edition was later released, which includes Redbook CD-audio versions of the original game's <a href="../../../m/i/d/MIDI_46f1.html" title="MIDI">MIDI</a> music tracks, a 5-minute <a href="../../../a/v/i/AVI_e482.html" title="AVI">AVI</a> video interview with Raymond E. Feist, and a Windows hint program/package ("Multimedia Viewer" + Krondor hint file). Sierra then re-released the CD-ROM in its budget lineup in the mid-1990s. In the final chapter of the game's history, Sierra offered a free download of <i>Betrayal at Krondor</i> on its website in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_video_gaming.html" title="1997 in video gaming">1997</a> to promote the game <i><a href="../../../b/e/t/Betrayal_in_Antara_6dd2.html" title="Betrayal in Antara">Betrayal in Antara</a></i>. Contrary to popular belief, <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivendi_Universal_Games_e2aa.html" title="Vivendi Universal Games">Vivendi Universal Games</a> has stated that the game is not free to be redistributed by others.<sup id="_ref-vivendi_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vivendi" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>(However, the webmaster of the site Sierra Music Central has pointed out that Vivendi's statement is patchy at best [it mentions 'contracts with partners' that 'precludes it from being able to authorize' the download] and doesn't really repudiate the freeware release, given the game is not being sold, etc. Of course, a more cynical view could be taken about Vivendi and lawsuits and anyone trying to offer it as freeware on the Internet, but that's not relevant here.)</p>

<p>Feist later wrote <i><a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Feist_e72e.html#Riftwar_Legacy" title="Raymond E. Feist">Krondor: The Betrayal</a></i>, a novelization of the game and first in a series of new Midkemia books called <i><a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Feist_e72e.html#Riftwar_Legacy" title="Raymond E. Feist">The Riftwar Legacy</a></i>. Feist credited Hallford and Cutter as co-authors of the original story for <i>Krondor: the Betrayal</i>, and dedicated the book to both of them.</p>
<p>In regards to the Midkemia canon timeline, the book is set approximately halfway between <i><a href="../../../r/i/f/Riftwar.html#A_Darkness_at_Sethanon" title="Riftwar">Darkness at Sethanon</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../k/r/o/Krondor%27s_Sons_ba82.html#Prince_of_the_Blood" title="Krondor's Sons">Prince of Blood</a></i>. The novel, while adding some more twists of the plot, covers the main plot of the game accurately. It ignores most of the sidequests. There are also some very minor differences, such as Owyn's last name being "Belefote" rather than "Beleforte" as in game, and the small towns of Tanneurs and Eggley in game are Tannerus and Eggly in the book. The hardcover edition of the book includes a CD-ROM version of the game, albeit stripped of the CD-audio soundtrack, but still containing the video interview with Feist on his thoughts about the game.</p>
<p>The game is significant in the Midkemian canon in that it first introduced the existence of Lysle Rigger, Jimmy the Hand's long lost twin brother. It also introduced the characters of Abbot Graves and Kat (whose granddaughter would later become known as "Kitty" Graves in Feist's later <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_E._Feist_e72e.html#The_Serpentwar_Saga" title="Raymond E. Feist">Serpentwar</a> books.)</p>
