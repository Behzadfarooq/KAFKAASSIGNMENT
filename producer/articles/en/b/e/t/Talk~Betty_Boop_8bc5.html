<p>I have seen websites that assert Betty was Jewish. I was always under the impression, for reasons I am uncertain about, that she was Italian. With a nondescript last name, and a New York accented voice, it's a bit hard to tell what she really was, other than a generic 1920s "flapper" girl. However, there is one possible clue, in this old joke: Q - What's the difference between a Jewish girl and a Catholic girl? A - Catholic girls don't believe in sex before marriage, and Jewish girls don't believe in sex <i>after</i> marriage. Since Betty was apparently protective of her virginity, that would tilt the scales toward the Italian, <i>si?</i> <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:45, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>&lt;chuckle&gt; Unless we can find a cartoon or Fleischer memo or something that says Betty is Jewish or Italian or Hungarian or whatever, I think it's best to assert no particular ethnicity/religion for her in the article. However, if someone finds a published source that argues her ethnicity (there are lots of analyses of old cartoons these days), that might be worth mentioning. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 13:23, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In "Minnie the Moocher," her parents are portrayed as being outwardly Jewish. Her mother and father both speak <a href="../../../y/i/d/Yiddish.html" title="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> in the short.

<li>I'm thinking that even if she was initially portrayed as Jewish, unless something was made of that, it doesn't really belong in the article. It's like, Myron Cohen was a Jewish comedian, he told lots of ethnic Jewish stories and jokes. Arguably, Alan King was also. Fran Drescher also milks her ethnicity for her act. But Jerry Seinfeld does not rely a lot on Jewish ethnic humor, right? So is he still a "Jewish comedian"? I might make the same argument about George Burns, who was Jewish and married an Irish woman, Gracie Allen, but I don't think much of their act centered on ethnicity as such. Similarly, is there very much of Betty Boop's humor that centers on her being (maybe) Jewish? Or not? Of course, technically, Betty is not <i>anything</i> religious, because she's only a cartoon character. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:55, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's an article on this very question <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/american_jewish_history/v087/87.4holberg.pdf&amp;session=94013794" class="external text" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/american_jewish_history/v087/87.4holberg.pdf&amp;session=94013794" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Unfortunately, it's protected by "Project Muse", which stymies pretty much 75% of Google Scholar searches I do. At any rate, it's probably not out of line to mention this line of thinking in the article and to talk about "Minnie the Moocher". I'd just want to make sure the information was sourced. (As for sources for the rest of the article, I'll try to add them once I get my animation books out of storage.) <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 14:28, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>If someone says in "Minnie" the parents are specifically Yiddish rather than generic MittleEuropean, I'll provisionally take your word for it... but I don't see that this one cartoon makes Betty a "Jewish" character. In various other cartoons from the era she is portrayed as a cabaret dancer, a race-car driver, a Queen, a chess-piece, a Kansas farm-girl... "Minnie" may be a better than average Betty Boop cartoon, but I see no reason to assume that the Betty Boop in this cartoon is somehow more the "real Betty" than that in the other cartoons. Boop, -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 04:33, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Infrogmation. Trying to find "canon" in short-subject cartoons from this era is a losing proposal. It's the same mentality that periodically has someone add "Dumas" to the <a href="../../../d/a/f/Daffy_Duck_146b.html" title="Daffy Duck">Daffy Duck</a> page as his middle name, based simply on a one-off gag. That said, I haven't yet read the links mentioned above, and I have no problem with someone adding a line to the article saying that "In 'Minnie the Moocher', Betty is depicted as a Jewish immigrant" or whatever. Might even elaborate on the Fleischers being Jewish. But please don't change the first sentence to read, "Betty Boop is a Jewish cartoon character . . . . " etc. unless there's more than one cartoon to back it up. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 12:32, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Unless she is specifically and consistently playing an ethnic character, calling her a Jewish character is overstating things. It would be like calling Mickey Mouse a Christian just because he made a cartoon about Christmas. In any case, technically, <i>these are cartoon characters</i>, not human beings. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:41, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Giving Betty a 'fictional Jews' tag when her alleged Jewishness is not referred to in the article is rather misleading. I am prepared to keep an open mind on the issue but could we please discuss this here before sticking the tag back in in order to avert an edit war?

<dd>There seems to be a debate that Betty's Jewishness was confirmed by the 'Minnie the Moocher' short.

<dd>Yeah, rereading the discussion above, consensus seems to have been to <i>not</i> include the "Fictional Jews" category. We probably don't need your addendum about her family, either.

<p>I think it's fair to say that she was the first truly sexual cartoon character.</p>
<p>Feminine suggests that she was the first cartoon character that was noticably female, as opposed to androgynous. However, even not meaning female I'm opposed to feminine used here. Plenty of older cartoons have markedly girlish qualities, even though Betty Boop was created relatively early in the history of animation.</p>
<p>Disney had a long series that ran from 1923-1927 called "Alice in Cartoon Land". Alice is noticably female, she is neither masculine nor androgynous. This followed by Minne mouse in 1928, who is feminine by any definition, really.</p>
<p>In 1915 there was a film short called Women's styles produced by the Gaumont Company&#160;; animator, Harry S. Palmer Based on the newspaper comic strip by "Pop" Mormand, featuring a husband oppressed by his wife's obsession with high society and consumer fashion. In 1916 there were two shorts called The phable of a busted romance and The phable of the phat woman which had distinctly female characters.</p>
<p>Mary and Gretel in 1917 is a short that is all about the two title characters on a mystical weird journey.</p>

<li>I have been at a loss to understand what the author of that comment is getting at. I think that he's talking in euphemisms, that what he really means is that Betty is the first "sexy" cartoon character. There is little question that Betty is sexy, but maybe he can cite a source or two that assert that she is indeed the <i>first</i> sexy character, after actually researching it, instead of just "assuming it's true". <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 20:50, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sorry it's not clear what I'm talking about. The article says that "She is also the first truly feminine cartoon character." and frecklefairie removed that bit, because it isn't true. Someone reverted that edit, asking for justification in the talk page. This is that justification. She's not the first feminine cartoon character by any standard. frecklefairie poster was right, and it should go back to the way frecklefairie changed it to.
<dl>
<dd>Bingo. However, this still leaves the question open, as to whether Betty is the first truly "sexy" or "sexual" cartoon character, either verifiably or at least by consensus of those who have studied the matter at some obsessive depth.&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 21:26, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know whether or not Betty was the very first sexual cartoon character, although it's a simpler distinction to make than 'feminine'. There's nothing in the public domain databases that's remotely sexual, and that's stuff from before 1923. Maybe someone made a busty suggestive cartoon between 1923 and 1930, I've tried to look it up, and I've gotten nothing.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's where that "first feminine" bit probably comes: "In many ways, Betty was the first truly feminine animated character. Up to this point, cartoon females had essentially been males with long eyelashes, high-heeled shoes and a few dainty gestures. Ms. Boop had a decidedly female shape and, more importantly, a convincing feminine grace to her movements." It's from p. 74 of <i>The History of Animation: Enchanted Drawings</i> by Charles Solomon (1994). As for pre-Betty females listed above, Alice was played by a live-action little girl and doesn't count. Minnie was, as Solomon is suggesting, merely Mickey in drag. As for the other examples cited, I am unfamiliar with them. Can someone point to direct links to them rather than the main page of that site?</dd>
<dd>But assuming they disprove Betty's primacy, Betty became a star and those characters didn't. So perhaps Betty was the first truly feminine cartoon <i>star</i> whose design was not based on a more popular male character? I think there's something worth making of this (rather than just deleting it altogether as Frecklefairy did), but I'm unsure how best to word it. —<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 22:42, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Minnie has a feminine role in her cartoons, and a feminine voice. Betty was originally a female version of a male dog character. So the difference between her and minnie is that she's a busty female version of a male character while minnie is a flat or young version of a male character. So she's the first character with breasts and a specific girly wiggle that Solomon places above the aforementioned few dainty movements. But I prefer to use the most clear and straightforward definition of "feminine" which is that feminine means having qualities like a female. I don't think we can assume that veiwers saw Minnie as androgynous and Betty as female.
<dl>
<dd>Well, she wasn't based on a male character. In her earliest form, she was (according to an interview with Natwick quoted in Solomon) "a pair of pretty girl's legs [added] to a cute little dog" with "spit curls . . . inspired by the hairdo of the popular singer Helen Kane." From the beginning, it seems, she was intended to be sexy. The paragraph after the one I quoted above further defines Solomon's "feminine" statement by describing Betty's sex appeal; perhaps that's what he really means. Wahkeenah suggested as much above.</dd>
<dd>For his part, Jerry Beck, in <i>Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age</i>, is less forgiving of Boop. He calls her "a travesty of compliant femininity, with a very large head (its features babylike) atop a mature woman's body". He then calls her "not at all original" but only in reference to her similarity to Helen Kane, not to other cartoons.

<dd>I'd almost agree with that, I don't hate Betty Boop, but it might be kind of offensive to call her more feminine than minnie mouse because she's more compliant, busty and dumb. I think it's very important to note that she was a very early cartoon in mentioning her primacy in anything. It just wasn't that diverse a genre. It's more important to talk about her as a trend setter, perhaps for all the other anatomically female cartoon characters that sex up cartoons for adult audiences like Tinkerbell, or the girl the pirates try to capture in the Pirates of the Carribean cartoon and subsequent theme park animatronics. 160.94.27.144 21:13, 29 November 2005 (UTC)Lotusduck</dd>

It's also perhaps useful to keep in mind that Minnie was a <i>Mouse</i>, not a human... although, technically, no 'toon is an actual human, though some are "drawn that way". Maybe (assuming it' s true) it would be best to say that she's "the first cartoon character drawn to represent a sexy woman". Or something better than that phrasing. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:26, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be useful. I think the distinction could be made between her first 1930 appearance as a dog and her first appearance as a human. But while she wasn't pretty in 'Dizzy Dishes', she did have a cinched waist and large breasts. You can google for images of that, they're kind of scary- her human looking face grew a snout whenever she spoke. The Glasgow herald has an article saying she was modeled after Mae West, meaning Betty Boop was meant to be a sex symbol, being created after an Actress who at the time was best known for the Broadway play "Sex" and other similar plays. Although, perhaps I should track down the origin of the claim that betty is modeled after May West, it could have been made up by the creators during their dispute with Helen Kane on whether or not Betty was based on her.</dd>

<p>I have changed the article. Minnie Mouse consistently shows her panties in plane crazy and I don't think audiences saw her as masculine or androgynous. So even if she wasn't as incredibly busty or vulnerable, though exactly as squeeky and about as much of a tease, something basically had to be done. Exactly how relevant other character's naughty bits are to Betty Boop in this article, I do not know.

<p>Clara Bow and Betty Boop are both highly sexual. Clara Bow was, as far as I know, the first Cinematic Sex Symbol. I doubt that She would have been unknown to the creators of the Betty Boop character, from Max Fleischer on down. As far as I know, She created a huge impression on theatergoers of that time (the nineteen-twenties).</p>
<p>In 1927 Clara Bow appeared in ‘It’. Afterward She became known as the ‘It’ Girl. In this film She played a character named ‘Betty Lou’.</p>
<p>Against the argument:</p>
<p>The look of Clara Bow, Helen Kane and Betty Boop had a similar appearance. Dark hair, cut short, against a white face with eyebrows and lips penciled in to produce a high-contrast stenciled look.</p>
<p>The resemblance that I perceive between Clara Bow and Betty Boop may be due to a fashion among “flappers” at that time. It may be that, from 80 years distance, all Women adorned this way look alike.</p>
<p>If this is the case, it might be difficult for us to distinguish between a resemblance between Clara Bow and Betty Boop that was due to Clara Bow, and one that was simply the result of a style current in the age of “Flappers”</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that there's a resemblance and that it's difficult to say if it was a Betty-looks-like-Clara thing or a Betty-and-Clara-both-look-like-"flappers" thing.

<p>Betty boop was, if you like, a parody of the overtly sexual Marilyn Monroe; of course, since being censored back in the thirties she had lost her cartoon fame. But as soon as those wild fifties came in she was back on the saddle once again.</p>
<pre>
Seventy years after being created, Betty Boop is on most female shirts,nightgowns,even cups. Contary to popular belief she was not a disney character though. She was part of a film company, the spawn of the ever popular paramount pictures still around today.
Betty deserves to get one more shot at the big time. Shove her in a cameo film role, like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or even give her a telivison show. Millions of cartoons have come and gone. But Betty is here to stay; one whole century and she's still more well known worldwide than Tom and Jerry. So happy birthday for August 28th 1930, and kepp beautiful!

<p>Hmm... actually I don't believe in that story. It's possible that Special Frame has been removed before release of "Who framed Roger Rabbit" on video, but if it existed, somebody surely by would have gotten it from the film and placed it on the net or in some magazines. Also, I had heard before the same story but with Jessica Rabbit. It seems to me the mere fascination of the thought that such a drawing existed made some people claim it did. Maybe one should point out the "legendary" nature of this claim more clearly in the text, especially in the light of the Jessica Rabbit issue? <i>Edwing 01:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>I removed these two sentences from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the 1932 animated short <i>Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle</i>, you see a very brief flash of her <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vagina</a> while she's changing. This is hardly visible as it is in black and white and partly fuzzy.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know whether these statements are true or not; they may be. But they are awkardly placed and poorly worded. What, for instance does "fuzzy" refer to? The film, or Betty herself?</p>

<p>"she also had a 5 hour sex scene with her dog and her grampy. She is a sex addict." - just wondering if this is vandalism (it sure seems like it). Franz T. Speeling 10:16, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
