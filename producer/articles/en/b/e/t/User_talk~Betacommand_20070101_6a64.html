<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently signed up for VP approval and meet the requirements. However, it seems that I wasn't approved. Should I re-apply?</p>

<p><small>Hi Betacommand. I just went to block User:63.203.93.11 as an obvious vandal when I saw you'd got there first. Which is great, but I wasn't sure why you had asked an IP to change their username and indef blocked them? In general its not a good idea to indef block IP addresses unless their an open proxy. The change username request seems inappropriate. Thought you might want to revisit that one.

<p><small>Dear Betacommand,</small></p>
<p><small>Thank you for copying and pasting your customary instruction to any new user unfortunate enough to step on your toes. Perhaps if you had made your actual recommendation to me first, instead of burying it in what according to Wikipedia's policies is CRUFT, it would have been more apparent where my error lied. I do not see why you had to back out my entire addition if only a few words doth offended thee my lady. I have CC'ed this comment both to your talk page and to mine to help you find it.</small></p>

<dd><small>Answered. It's a little weird answering responses that didn't come from my original statement, but I tried. My response is a little off because <a href="../../../u/s/s/User%7EUSSTRATCOM_PAO_2235.html" title="User:USSTRATCOM PAO">User:USSTRATCOM PAO</a> isn't commercial, but he sounds like a legitimate user rather than a spammer. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 04:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>I'm surprised by the strength of your opposition on the basis of an area that I've neither dealt with in the past nor plan to in the future. As I said, I'd consult with the blocker to see if there was additional cause or to accept someone who seems like a good-faith contributor under an iffy name. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 05:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>Hey, thanks so much for supporting my recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Budgiekiller_df91.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Budgiekiller">RFA</a>. A number of editors considered that I wasn't ready for the mop yet and unfortunately the RFA did not succeed (69/26/11). There are a number of areas which I will be working on (including changing my username) in the next few months in order to allay the fears of those who opposed my election to administrator.</small></p>
<p><small>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you sincerely for your support over the past week. I've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike. I hope to bump into you again soon and look forward to serving you and Wikipedia in any way I can.

<p>You approved me for use of Vandal Proof v1.3 on October 23, 2006 (at least I think you did, whats with all this "Anaraug" stuff, see my talk page) and I finally got around to using it and it says I am not on the approved list. I tried to find out if this was true or not but I could only find the recently approved list. Do I have to get reapproved for v1.31, was this just a slip-up somewhere, or was I ever approved to begin with? Any assistance you could offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated. <a href="../../../c/p/u/User%7ECpuwhiz11_2558.html" title="User:Cpuwhiz11">Cpuwhiz11</a> 03:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC) <span id="63294115854"></span></p>

One of the quotes on my user page, from "K42", was from a vandal I began hunting after attacks on Bob Brown. That's one of the last things the user said before indef block.

<p><small>Sure, I'd like to hear it</small></p>
<p><small>I've never been told anything besides the note on the approval page of basically "at least 250 edits and a talk page not littered with vandalism warnings". What other criteria do you use? And what do you say to users who have 250 edits and have never vandalized, but don't fit any of your personal criteria? --<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFroth_72db.html" title="User:Froth">⁪froth</a><sup><b><a href="../../../f/r/o/User_talk%7EFroth_2eda.html" title="User talk:Froth"><small>T</small></a></b></sup> 20:28, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one I check there edits, where they were made to what kinds of pages, see if they have any <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> post, (to get a understanding of how much vandalfighting they do or where they edit).</li>
<li>I also check to see how long they have been on wikipedia less than 2 months I dont approve in general</li>
<li>Step 2: I check the block log where they ever blocked and why</li>
<li>Step 3: I check their talk page. (including history and archives)
<dl>
<dd>if they have questionable issues I dont approve.</dd>
<dd>if its borderline I might approve or ask them to come back.</dd>

</li>
</ul>
<p>I have denied access to users with over 500 mainspace edits for those reasons. But I have talked with other users on wiki and on IRC with less than 200 and approved them. I always caution on the side of not approving if it is questionable. But failing any one of these items doesnt automaticly reject the user.

Also it was quite a long time ago, and I was the only active mod, and it was a huge workload to run full checks on everyone requesting approval alone. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 20:01, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Essjay went on a multi-month wikibreak after that from the stress, and he is one of the most active editors. I personally tend to err towards approval, since I consider it an extension of assuming good faith. After all, the VP access can just as easily be removed. How inclusive does AmiDaniel want us to be? If he wants us to be strict, I can do that, but I have assumed he wanted more open approvals, rather then a more restricted program. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 20:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can see where you're coming from, but unless I'm still unclear on this, from your POV no exception needs to be made. The minimum is 250 edits; this user has that and has shown extraordinary competency and willingness to contribute- thus he's fit for approval, and we don't need to lower the standards to approve him. But I guess my personal "special criteria" is that especially new users probably aren't qualified to use VP. I'm not convinced that someone can learn the proper ins-and-outs of wikipedia in a month, though I have no doubt of his good faith. VP should be available for relatively-well-established users looking to be casual RC patrollers but it shouldn't be available to newbies who already have enough ropes to learn. --<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFroth_72db.html" title="User:Froth">⁪froth</a><sup><b><a href="../../../f/r/o/User_talk%7EFroth_2eda.html" title="User talk:Froth"><small>T</small></a></b></sup> 06:33, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These are excellent points, in fact, enough to win me over about Snowolf (In a month I would approve, however). But, some newbies spend less time in a month then others in a day looking at policies and learning the ropes. So unlike the pretty strict editcount requirement, any age requirement should be flexible. Froth, my view is <b>not</b> to approve all users with over 250 edits, but to approve any requesting user that can be reasonably trusted not to <i>deliberately</i> abuse the tool. Making a mistake on vandal patrol is just as likely to occur without VP then with it, and is easily fixed with a simple message to the user. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 16:17, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Prodego I agree in a month I welcome this user to come back. I just am not sure that 504 edits in 17 days the user hasn't had enough time and experience yet. if this was spent over a longer period then I would reconsider. But a majority of edits were made in about a two week period. I encourage Snowolf to come back in 3-4 four weeks and I dont see a issue approving the user. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommand_e660.html" title="User:Betacommand">Betacommand</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBetacommand_bfb0.html" title="User talk:Betacommand">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Betacommand_4a01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Betacommand">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBetacommandBot_3654.html" title="User:BetacommandBot">Bot</a>)</sup> 18:06, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Calm down Wizardry, the time at which I left the message, was just <i>before</i> Beta began clearing out the list. The reason I asked at all was that some people were saying that they had not received any messages about approval status from requests that were not on that day. And yes, that wasn't that much of a backlog, but backlogs do start to pile up if you don't get them at that stage. I know that from experience&#160;;-). I personally go through the list by hand, chose who to approve/deny, and open their talk pages. Then I click Update in VP, and leave decline messages where applicable. That saves update edits in VP, but it is a matter of personal preference.

No, instead I'll unprotect people's userpages - that'll help the encyclopedia!". What exactly was the use of mass unprotecting userpages, whether they're active users or socks or anything else?

<p>Hello,why did you remove remove protection from my pages without consulting me? My talk was only move protected.--<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakotaKahn_841e.html" title="User:DakotaKahn"><i><b>Dakota</b></i></a> 22:46, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't particularly care, but I would exercise caution when unprotecting userpages; mine was initially semi-protected for insertion of personal information by a determined vandal, and I imagine others would have their userpages protected against some banned user. Then again, I suppose I'd enjoy seeing mine used as a punching bag for frustrated users occasionally... <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="purple">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="red">ka</font></a> 13:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My page was protected because of a particular banned user trolling on site not to even mention the vast number of emails from the same user. My talk was move protection only. No one should be moving established user pages without a specific reason. I suppose it doesn't matter and yes caution would be best when unprotecting userpages.--<a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakotaKahn_841e.html" title="User:DakotaKahn"><i><b>Dakota</b></i></a> 00:23, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Betacommand, I was looking through recent changes and found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Alter&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103185043" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Alter&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103185043" rel="nofollow">this</a> while looking at a talk page. I'm not sure how much is boast or how much is truth but they seem to claim someone is interested in spreading a virus through the website. Just wanted to bring it to your attention.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 18:19, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't think of anyway to do that, except one. You could <b>link</b> to a site that would install a virus, but short of editing <a href="../../../c/o/m/MediaWiki%7ECommon.js_0fd2.html" title="MediaWiki:Common.js">Mediawiki:Common.js</a> (and adding some malicious javascript), you could not execute code by just editing a page. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 01:44, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just for the record, within hours of you unprotecting my user page without consulting me, it was vandalised. Please drop me a line to explain why it was unprotected and unless I am somehow violating a rule I'm unaware of, I'd appreciate being informed or consulted in future before a page I protect for good reason is unprotected.

<p>I wish to challenge your deletion of this article. There was certainly not a consensus for deletion, and I felt that I and other editors put forward strong arguments for retention of the article. If you obtained the 'delete' result by counting heads, then that is a violation of Wikipedia policy; if you decided it based on your own views, then you have made the wrong decision. Please explain why you deleted this article, preferably without just repeating the patronising comments made by other editors during the AfD, who noticeably declined to respond to the later points I made. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 21:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>With all due respect, Betacommand, we've been patient enough. I am going to resume moderation, and I am going to suggest Prodego and Froth that they continue as well, with of course the caveat that if he has any uncertainties, Froth should contact me.

<dd>I think you should go ahead Peter, Beta has already told me that I should resume moderating <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Prodego&amp;diff=103400558&amp;oldid=102617159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Prodego&amp;diff=103400558&amp;oldid=102617159" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></small>.

<dd>That's a shame. He was acting in good faith and just didn't have as much oversight as he should've as he was learning. I would fully support his reinstatement when and if he is reconsidered as a moderator.

<p>Hey, Betacommand. I noticed you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:RyanGerbil10&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:RyanGerbil10&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">removed</a> protection from my userpage. I know that policy states that user pages, and pages in general, should not be under protection for lengthy periods of time, but my administrator status on Wikipedia is well-known throughout both my rather large <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litchfield_Towers_b4c2.html" title="Litchfield Towers">dormitory</a> and also my <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Delta_Theta_3126.html" title="Phi Delta Theta">fraternity</a>, and is listed on <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebook.html" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, and I don't trust them not to vandalize my user page.

I know that <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> is a college student and protects his userpage as well.
