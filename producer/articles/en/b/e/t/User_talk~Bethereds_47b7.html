<p>You've done a good job of messing the articles up.

<dd>Alright then, why don't you be egalitarian about it and list all articles by the character's first name only, or just the ones that you feel don't deserve to have their full name? Whatever dude, if you want to continue Wikipedia's pro-Japan anti-Korea/China bias even down to videogames, go right ahead. Renaming an article doesn't mess anything up anyway if you have a redirect page.<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 21:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"pro-Japan anti-Korea/China bias"? Why just because I want all articles in a game series to match? If you read this - <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-12-21_Street_Fighter_character_articles_16cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-12-21 Street Fighter character articles">Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-12-21_Street_Fighter_character_articles</a> - you'll see why I've moved the articles. And it's nothing to do with Japan or Korea. I'll move them back by using yet another requested move - please don't move them back. Their full names are mentioned in bold in the first line of the article. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.bonus_7fef.html" title="User:Mr.bonus">Mr.bonus</a> 13:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well <i>duh</i> it was the only one in that format, I used it as a test run to demonstrate how foreign names can be handled. If consistency is the problem, then I can get around to doing the other handful of multiple foreign named characters (but not those with just a Japanese name), but it's annoying to be reverted before I even have time to do so (and by someone who supports it no less). Btw, the footnote solution was actually done to try to comprimise a debate that you stirred up but have yet to comment on, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Video_games_7880.html#Character_names_in_Katakana.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Video games">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Video games#Character names in Katakana?</a> Anyways, since you don't oppose it, could you revert yourself until the issue is settled?--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 05:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well thank you, but my position is that Japanese names shouldn't be mentioned for non-Japanese characters in English articles unless relevant for dealing with issues of translation errors (i.e. Castlevania's Sylvia Fernandez becoming Sypha Belnades). As video game articles are so many, I only focus on the 5 or 6 that I care about the most. I don't mind posting the foreign language name stuff elsewhere in the articles, but I'll still be adamantly against Katakana either way. Just like it wouldn't make sense to write Mitsurugi's name in Korean, it also doesn't make sense to write Hwang or Yunseong's name in Japanese.<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 10:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're completely ignoring the fact that those are Japanese characters first and fictional Korean characters second. Your Mitsurugi example is meaningless, as he is not a Korean character, and your edit of that article was a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe"><b>'</b></a> 23:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Whether they are or arent' Japanese in origin is irrelevant as the article is in ENGLISH!!!!! Thus the closest form of recognition as to how their name should be represented in English would be either the McCune Reischauer romanization or Korean standard romanization of their name, or in game spelling in English. Hangul should then be second. Hanja 3rd. Japanese has no place in this case because 1. In Japanese versions of the game, the name is represented in romanization, and in story modes also in English! Katakana doesn't belong because it's an ENGLISH article and provides no value whatsoever to English readers. Romanization of Katakana has even LESS place, as it is romanizing something that has altered the original sound to begin with. Since we are romanizing from the source (English title), showing the source(Hangul), and showing the meaning (hanja), why is there need to show how Japanese would best estimate how to pronounce the source in their own language? Maybe if the article was in JAPANESE it would make sense. Go write an article in Japanese and use all the frigging katakana you want. I won't stop you then...<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 00:10, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please try and understand. I know that you want to improve the quality of articles related to Korea, and this is a good thing. But the character's names are in Japanese, even if that Japanese corresponds to a name in Korean. The English (and Hangul, for that matter) is more akin to a translation of a translation than the "proper" name of the character. Surely we can imagine someone would want to know this, just as someone might want to know the original name of <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_White_9d83.html" title="Snow White">Snow White</a>. I think leaving the Hangul and the Katakana is a perfectly reasonable compromise. -- <a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExitmoose_4625.html" title="User:Exitmoose">Exitmoose</a> 01:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We're supposed to establish those characters in the real world. If the original context, including the language the character was created with, of the character is "irrelevant", what does that say about your assumed transliteration into Korean language because they're fictionally Korean? <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe"><b>'</b></a> 01:38, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that we have a disagreement. Don't ask ME to understand, those who should understand should realize that katakana is less relevant on these pages for various reasons, especially in cases where kanji exists. Hangul and Kanji are not translations of an original Japanese concept, rather katakana is an estimated phonetic pronunciation (with major shortcomings, I might add) of a Korean language concept, regardless of who concieved the idea.<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 01:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see how this relates to my point. You are taking what you believe the fiction implies (your transl<b>i</b>t<b>erat</b>ions) above the original source and context of those characters.

<dd>Dude, either way, in the game nowhere does katakana appear for the Asian characters' names. Your "source" then is Japanese language literature. This is why I keep saying that katakana is relevant in a Japanese article. If you really want him to be Fan Songyon, write an article about him in Japanese. Otherwise your points are all moot!<a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 19:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What's wrong with using Japanese language literature for an article about a Japanese topic? The <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe.html" title="Kobe">Kobe</a> article cites the Japanese version of the Kobe official website, because that information could not be found at another source. There are any number of other articles all throughout Wikipedia that do the same. As long as the source is verifiable and reliable, there's no reason to reject it simply because it's in another language, particularly if that language is the language of the topic's country of origin. -- <a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExitmoose_4625.html" title="User:Exitmoose">Exitmoose</a> 03:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your're missing the point. Katakana was used in the Japanese literature because the Japanese literature uses the Japanese language. Seeing as how this article is in English, katakana is irrelevant. I'd be up for saying that hangul and hanja are also irrelevant as well, and should be put in another section or a text box reserved for trivia or something rather than at the beginning of the page. But katakana doesn't even belong at all, and certainly romanization of katakana belongs even less than that. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethereds_5a92.html" title="User:Bethereds">Bethereds</a> 11:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If you continue to revert the articles without listening to fellow users, I will report you as a vandal to Wikipedia administrators.

<ul>
<li>There's no one else who agrees with what you are doing and you are going against what's already accepted on Wiki. You are reverting the page multiple times just to make yourself happy with the articles. And just to be clear, I'm not reverting the pages because I'm an "Otaku", I enjoy playing video games (espacially Japanese fighting games), but I can't stand anime. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.bonus_7fef.html" title="User:Mr.bonus">Mr.bonus</a> 15:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
