<p>The college was founded by <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Jesser_Reid_25db.html" title="Elizabeth Jesser Reid">Elizabeth Jesser Reid</a>, a social reformer and anti-slavery activist who had been left a private income by her late husband, Dr. John Reid, which she used to patronise various philanthropic causes. Mrs. Reid and her circle of well-educated friends were strong believers in the need for better education for women. In 1849, she leased a house at 47 Bedford Square in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomsbury.html" title="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> area of London, and opened the <b>Ladies College in Bedford Square</b>. The intention was to provide a liberal and non-sectarian education for women, something no other institution in the United Kingdom provided at the time. Reid placed £1,500 (<a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">GBP</a>) with three male <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trustee.html" title="Trustee">trustees</a>, and persuaded a number of her friends to serve on the management committees and act as teaching professors.</p>
<p>At the outset, the governance of the College was in the hands of the Ladies Committee (comprising some influential women), and the General Committee made up of the Ladies, the professors of the college and three trustees. The General Committee (later the Council) soon took over the running of the College, while the Ladies Committee directed the work of the Lady Visitors, who were responsible for the welfare and discipline of the students, and also acted as their chaperones. Initially the professors were shocked by the generally low educational standards of the women entering the college, who for the most part came in having had home-based, <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governess.html" title="Governess">governess</a> education. In response to this, Reid founded a school close to the college in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a>, in an attempt to provide a better standard of entry. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>, the college expanded into 48 Bedford Square, which enabled it to become a residential establishment. "The Residence" was under the charge of a matron, who introduced the practice of students helping towards the running of the house, and keeping their own accounts.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Reid died in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, and left the college in the hands of three female trustees. These three women defied the views of the Council that the existing funds should be invested in the running of the school (which was closed in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>), and instead ensured that the trust fund was used to improve conditions and teaching at the college, and establish it as a fully fledged institute of higher education. The trustees insisted upon a new constitution (as the college had no legal charter at the time). The Council was replaced by a Committee of Management, and the college was reconstituted as an Association under the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Trade_7507.html" title="Board of Trade">Board of Trade</a>, and officially became known as <b>Bedford College</b>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1874.html" title="1874">1874</a>, the Bedford Square lease expired and the college moved to 8 and 9 York Place, off <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baker_Street_6405.html" title="Baker Street">Baker Street</a>. The two houses acted as one, with the college using the downstairs rooms, and the upstairs being the Residence. As numbers began to rise, the college expanded with the addition of extensions housing science laboratories. In the late-<a href="../../../1/8/7/1870s.html" title="1870s">1870s</a>, an entrance examination was introduced, and a preparatory department set-up for those who did not meet the standards required for college-level entry.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>, degree examinations of the University of London were opened to women. Bedford College students began gaining University of London <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Science_1c0e.html" title="Bachelor of Science">Bachelor of Science</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">Masters</a> degrees from the early-<a href="../../../1/8/8/1880s.html" title="1880s">1880s</a>.</p>
<p>In 1900, when the University of London became a teaching university (where it had previously been only a degree-awarding body), Bedford College became one of the university's constituent colleges. The college applied to the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_09a3.html" title="Privy Council">Privy Council</a> for a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Charter_7e9a.html" title="Royal Charter">Royal Charter</a> to take the place of its Deed of Incorporation. Royal Assent for the new chartered body was received in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, and the College became officially recognised as <b>Bedford College for Women</b>.</p>
<p>Continued growth of the college led to a search for new premises, which culminated in the purchase of the lease of a site at <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent%27s_Park_0793.html" title="Regent's Park">Regent's Park</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>. A major fund-raising effort was undertaken to provide the new site with modern amenities. The new purpose-built buildings were designed by the architect <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Champneys_9bf1.html" title="Basil Champneys">Basil Champneys</a>, and were officially opened by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_of_Teck_b949.html" title="Mary of Teck">Queen Mary</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>. The buildings continued to be extended and rebuilt throughout the 70 years that the college spent at Regent's Park, especially following extensive damage caused by wartime bombing.</p>
<p>After a brief period of admitting a small number of male <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postgraduate.html" title="Postgraduate">postgraduate</a> students, the college became fully coeducational in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, and the name was changed back to <b>Bedford College</b>.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, Bedford College had approximately 1,700 students and 200 academic staff based in 20 departments.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedford_College_42fa.html" title="Edit section: Merger with Royal Holloway">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Merger with Royal Holloway</span></h2>
<p>In 1985, Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College, another college of the University of London which, like Bedford College, had been a college for women only when it was first founded. The merged institution took Royal Holloway College's premises in <a href="../../../e/g/h/Egham.html" title="Egham">Egham</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>, just outside London, as its main campus and took on the name of <b>Royal Holloway and Bedford New College</b> (RHBNC). This remains the merged college's official name, although in the early-1990s the College Council decided to simplify the name for day-to-day use to <b>Royal Holloway, University of London</b> (RHUL). This decision caused a fair degree of discontent among graduates of Bedford College, who felt that their old college had now essentially been taken over by Royal Holloway, and that Bedford College's name and history as a pioneering institution in the field of women's education were being forgotten. In an attempt to give more prominence to the Bedford name, the merged college named a large, newly-built library in the centre of its campus the "Bedford Library". However relations between RHUL and some of the Bedford College alumni today remain somewhat strained. Nevertheless, many Bedford College alumni maintain links with RHUL, supporting alumni events and other college work.</p>
<p>Bedford College's old premises at Regent's Park now accommodate a variety of further and higher education institutions, under the name of <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent%27s_College_9b26.html" title="Regent's College">Regent's College</a>.</p>
