<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedford_High_School_%28England%29_32d1.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The school was opened on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a>. It was built on the site of former <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpur_Trust_ce18.html" title="Harpur Trust">Harpur Trust</a> cottage <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almshouse.html" title="Almshouse">almshouses</a>. There were 43 girls on that first day: the young ones with hair in <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigtail.html" title="Pigtail">pigtails</a>, wearing <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinafore.html" title="Pinafore">pinafores</a>, the elder ones with their hair up, wearing <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirt.html" title="Skirt">skirts</a> down to the <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankle.html" title="Ankle">ankles</a>. It was not a uniform as such, but with the strict code of respectability they made a fairly uniform impression. <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boater.html" title="Boater">Boaters</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glove.html" title="Glove">gloves</a> were worn in town. They never spoke a word inside the building unless spoken to by staff.</p>
<p>It was the pioneering time of education for girls, and under the early headmistresses Miss Belcher, Miss Collier, Miss Tanner and Dr Westaway the school expanded enormously, encroaching more and more on houses of Adelaide Square and The Crescent, but this was never allowed to intrude on the view of the fine <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_architecture.html" title="Victorian architecture">Victorian architecture</a> of the main building which can still be admired from Bromham Road. The original school at first housed both the "High and Modern School for Girls". Each school had its own half of the building, but by the end of the century the Modern School moved to premises of its own in the centre of the town, and in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> to its present site near the river where, from <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, it became known as <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Alice_Harpur_School_733e.html" title="Dame Alice Harpur School">Dame Alice Harpur School</a>.</p>
<p>The High School has undergone many extensions and additions to its buildings. The Junior School acquired a new wing in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a> (where ICT and mathematics are now situated) and remained there until moving into the present building in Adelaide Square in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. In the 1890s the Main Hall was extended out towards the road so that it became T shaped. It also obtained a beautiful <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">organ</a> built by Norman and Beard of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwich.html" title="Norwich">Norwich</a> which is still in use for daily assemblies. Other notable changes include the gym built in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> which is now a theatre, the acquisition of the former Trinity Church which was converted into a dining hall with classrooms above in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> and, most recently, in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the new sports and performing arts complex with many facilities including a 25m x 13m swimming pool.</p>
<p>At first the morning register was called in the hall after assembly, but soon the numbers had exceeded 100 and so registers were taken in the form rooms. By the turn of the century the numbers were above 600, at which level they stabilised until the late seventies when again they grew, reaching around a thousand in the eighties. Now the numbers are kept stable at around 850.</p>
<p>Sport in the early years of the school consisted of drill given by a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">sergeant</a>. The gymnastic dress was made of heavy thick blue serge with a light blue sailor collar. Games only began when an <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphalt.html" title="Asphalt">asphalt</a> <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis_court.html" title="Tennis court">tennis court</a> was laid down in what is now the playground. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> the school acquired the field which is where the girls still go to play games. The flourishing of a lively PE department owed much to the vision of PE teacher Miss Stansfeld (BHS <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>). Today the school has not only 22 acres of games field but also a brand new spa centre, formally opened in 2005 by past pupil Dr <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Cook_d982.html" title="Stephanie Cook">Stephanie Cook</a> <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">OBE</a>, <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> gold champion and <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Champion_298e.html" title="World Champion">World Champion</a> <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_pentathlon.html" title="Modern pentathlon">modern pentathlon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">Music</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance.html" title="Dance">Dance</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">Drama</a> have always played a large part in school life. Miss Belcher was keen on music, and arranged for five <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pianoforte.html" title="Pianoforte">pianos</a> to be placed in a large room, each enclosed in as many glass cases, and just big enough for a pupil and a music teacher. In this way, it was said, the girls would be able to practise in school without disturbing one another! It probably had more to do with making it possible for one mistress to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaperon.html" title="Chaperon">chaperone</a> the girls with their music masters. Mr Bond-Andrews, the piano teacher, would have none of it: he dragged the first piano out of its glass case, refusing to be suffocated. Dr Harding was in charge of music for four decades: designing the new organ, and building up a music department with excellent orchestras and choirs. Today there are still those who remember the dreaded Miss Joyce Harding, his daughter, who trained the choirs, and auditioned all junior girls at the beginning of each year. Those who could not sing in tune were labelled "ghosties" and were only allowed to mouth! Musical alumnae include the soprano <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Nicholls_6f84.html" title="Agnes Nicholls">Agnes Nicholls</a> (Lady <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_Harty_24de.html" title="Hamilton Harty">Hamilton Harty</a>), the clarinettist *<a href="http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/artist_page.asp?name=tking" class="external text" title="http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/artist_page.asp?name=tking" rel="nofollow">Dame Thea King</a>, and more recently the soprano Alison Buchanan and cellist Naomi Williams.</p>
<p>Royalty have visited the school on two occasions. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_of_Teck_b949.html" title="Mary of Teck">Queen Mary</a> paid a visit in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> and they complimented Miss Collie on the way the girls <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtsey.html" title="Curtsey">curtsied</a>, and Dr Harding on the way they sang "<a href="../../../g/o/d/God_Save_the_Queen_65ab.html" title="God Save the Queen">God Save the King</a>". On another occasion, in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, they sang the <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia.html" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavian</a> <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a>. This was for the visit of <a href="http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/marieromaniabio1900.htm" class="external text" title="http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/marieromaniabio1900.htm" rel="nofollow">Queen Marie of Yugoslavia</a>. A governor was heard to remark afterwards how clever the choir were to learn it in such a short time, and in a foreign language. They had, in fact, been singing it in English!</p>
<p>So many members of staff have shaped the life of the High School over a century and a quarter, but within living memory two deserve a special mention for their long service. William Eddy was caretaker at the High School for 47 years. He was always at the door in his <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livery.html" title="Livery">livery</a> on special occasions to welcome parents and guests. Mrs Frieda Bray came during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> to help for two weeks in the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domestic_Science_00b0.html" title="Domestic Science">Domestic Science</a> department but stayed for forty years, working in the milk room and looking after the welfare of pupils and staff alike.</p>
<p>New girls to BHS frequently mention the assemblies as an impressive aspect of school life. From the start in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a> <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymns</a> were sung every day, accompanied by the piano and then, from <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>, on the organ. Girls always used to kneel for prayers, even in the early 1960s when on one occasion a girl in the front row of the gallery knelt down rather quickly, thrusting her head between the vertical wooden railings where it got stuck. A railing had to be sawn through in order to free her. A <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">bible</a> reading, a hymn and a chanted <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalm.html" title="Psalm">psalm</a> were mandatory until the 1980s when psalm singing went out of fashion. Hymns are still sung regularly, but the assemblies now have a much wider breadth of subject matter, often given by external visitors, but always centred around religion or school matters such as the correct way to wear uniform.</p>

<p>The school has changed almost beyond recognition since the early days, although there is still a strong sense of tradition and an emphasis on upholding high educational and moral values. About ten percent of the girls are boarders, living in four boarding houses: Wimborne Grange, The Quantocks, Westlands and The Chilterns. Many day girls travel quite long journeys to school. Girls take <a href="../../../g/c/s/GCSE_097d.html" title="GCSE">GCSE</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/l/A_levels.html" title="A levels">A levels</a> as well as the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baccalaureate_b6c1.html" title="International Baccalaureate">International Baccalaureate</a>, an alternative to A levels which encourages intellectual rigour and critical thinking as well as a global outlook. In today’s global society the school has taken on a very <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multicultural.html" title="Multicultural">multicultural</a> character, reflected not just in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> support given to the international students and the variety of Language A levels taken, but also in the social life: linguistic assemblies, or fundraising days in which girls are sponsored for speaking all day in a language other than their mother tongue. <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">Science</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_and_Communications_Technology_2c8e.html" title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</a> have kept abreast with new developments. In the sports department girls frequently compete at county and national levels, and <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hockey.html" title="Hockey">hockey</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacrosse.html" title="Lacrosse">lacrosse</a> teams have recently travelled to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>.
