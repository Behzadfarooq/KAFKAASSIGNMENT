<p>This section troubles me:</p>
<p>"Beder practiced the allegorical method of interpretation, and was by modern standards credulous concerning the miraculous; but in most things his good sense is conspicuous, and his kindly and broad sympathies, his love of truth and fairness, his unfeigned piety, and his devotion to the service of others combine to make him an exceedingly attractive character."</p>
<p>It seems to be implying that those who believe in miracles are typically lacking in good sense. I also think that declaring him an "exceedingly attractive character" is almost certainly POV. I'm hesitant to edit this page, since the reason I came across was that I didn't know who Bede was in the first place. I'll leave this notice here for a while before I attempt to make any changes.--<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 22:12, 2004 Jul 10 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly don't believe in miracles, but I agree that this is patronising. I'm also more dubious about Bede's love of truth etc.--alarichall 09.40, 2006 June 6</dd>

<dd>I agree that the passage is overly flowery and tends to be somewhat POV, but it is taken from the [Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge <a href="http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&amp;bookID=encyc02&amp;page=23&amp;view=" class="external free" title="http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&amp;bookID=encyc02&amp;page=23&amp;view=" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&amp;bookID=encyc02&amp;page=23&amp;view=</a>]. Bede's use of allegorical interpretation in his scriptural commentaries can be verified from the literature and and his concern for evidence in his historical writings is mentioned more specifically in the section on the <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bede.html#Historia_Ecclesiastica" title="Bede"><i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i></a>. I'll get around to pruning the flowers shortly. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveMcCluskey_1bdc.html" title="User:SteveMcCluskey">SteveMcCluskey</a> 01:53, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that the date of death was changed back to May 25 after I corrected it. He died the day before <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension.html" title="Ascension">Ascension</a>, which was on May 26 that year, and it was notied very early that his feast, on the day of his death, was in conflict with that of St Augstine of Canterbury (which is now May 27 in the Roman calendar, but still May 26 in England). May 25 didn't enter the picture until the calendar reform in 1969. <a href="../../../c/n/y/User%7ECnyborg_49e4.html" title="User:Cnyborg">Cnyborg</a> 23:47, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>If Ascension Day 735 was May 26th and Bede died the day before, then he died on May 25th. I don't understand your reasoning here. In the course of revising this page I've put the date back to the 25th, but obviously I'm happy to see it corrected if there's a clear and good reason. alarichall 09:57, 6 June 2006</p>

<dd>There's some kind of typo there, and while I'm sure it all made sense to me at the time, I can't remember it all now. I checked the date at <a href="http://www.albion.edu/english/calendar/easter.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.albion.edu/english/calendar/easter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.albion.edu/english/calendar/easter.htm</a>, and Ascension 735 was on 26 May, so he died in the evening on 25 May. As it is now, there are two different dates given in the article, 25 and 27 May, and the former seems to be the correct one. <a href="../../../c/n/y/User%7ECnyborg_49e4.html" title="User:Cnyborg">Cnyborg</a> 09:41, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>St. Bede was the patron saint of Scholars and Historians. His records of the dark ages have proven vital to many modern archeologists, and so this was felt to be the most fitting title. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWASTREL_1c19.html" title="User:WASTREL">WASTREL</a> 20:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding the text:</p>
<p>'After 596, documentary sources, which Bede took pains to obtain, are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed with critical consideration of its value. He cited his references and was very concerned about the sources of all his sources, which created an important historical chain. He is credited with inventing footnoting. Due to his innovations like footnoting he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfred, although the actual accusation was for miscalculating the age of the world, his chronology being contrary to the calculation of the time. The controversy is linked to footnoting because Bede cited another source in a note, rather than opining himself; others misunderstood the significance of citing another source.'</p>
<p>I don't know where this footnoting stuff is coming from. I'm pretty certain that he uses no footnotes--it looks like someone has got confused by Bede's famous habit of (selectively) saying in the body of his text where he got his information from. I've never heard of this relating to his accusation of heresy either. alarichall 09:46, 6 June 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have the same problem with the claim of his use of footnotes. This needs a source or should be removed.</dd>

<p>The first line of the entry at the moment reads 'Bede (IPA: /biːd/), also Saint Bede, the Venerable Bede, or (from Latin) Beda (IPA: /biːdə/)'. The IPA transcription of the Latin is right if you pronounce Latin with an English accent, but not otherwise! I think in Ciceronian, ecclesiastical Latin and Anglo-Saxon Latin pronunciations, it would have been /beːdɑ/. I'm inclined to change it, but obviously there are a lot of ways to pronounce Latin, which makes me wonder if we should include a Latin pronunciation at all? Since there's evidently quite a lot of activity on this page at the moment, I thought I'd ask what people think. alarichall 14:52, 28th June 2006.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Latin IPA has now been corrected, by <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.odonnell_07b9.html" title="User:Daniel.odonnell">User:Daniel.odonnell</a>, as you'll see. He finds no evidence for the length of the first vowel. Indeed, I feel doubts whether the vowel length distinction of classical Latin was made in Northumbria in Bede's time!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I rather agree with you that for dead languages such as Latin an IPA transcription is hardly wanted in Wikipedia. It is, actually, an unverifiable opinion, isn't it? And much more difficult cases than this one will arise if we try to determine how medieval people pronounced their names in Latin. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby">Andrew Dalby</a> 12:52, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the image of Bede "from a medieval manuscript" after discussing the image on Ansax-l with professional Anglo-Saxonists and Art Historians (June 29 and 30th, 2006). Although the image shows up all over the Internet as an unattributed image of Bede, this attribution is almost certainly wrong. It is probably Gregory the Great (the bird in the ear), or barring that St. Jerome (the context).

<p>There is a contention in the article that Bede's "<i>title is believed to come from a mistranslation of the Latin inscription on his tomb in Durham Cathedral, intended to be Here lie the venerable bones of Bede, but wrongly interpreted as here lie the bones of the Venerable Bede</i>".</p>
<p>What is the origin of this theory? Quoting the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02384a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02384a.htm" rel="nofollow">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The title <i>Venerabilis</i> seems to have been associated with the name of Bede within two generations after his death. There is of course no early authority for the legend repeated by Fuller of the "dunce-monk" who in composing an epitaph on Bede was at a loss to complete the line: <i>Hac sunt in fossa Bedae . . . . ossa</i> and who next morning found that the angels had filled the gap with the word <i>venerabilis</i>. The title is used by Alcuin, Amalarius and seemingly Paul the Deacon, and the important Council of Aachen in 835 describes him as <i>venerabilis et modernis temporibus doctor admirabilis Beda</i>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This sounds more convincing, especially so since the prosody in <i>Hac sunt in fossa Bedae venerabilis ossa</i> requires <i>venerabilis</i>, which can only be connected to Bede, not to his bones. <a href="../../../i/b/l/User%7EIblardi_3c55.html" title="User:Iblardi">Iblardi</a> 21:56, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
