<p>The brainchild of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk</a> legend <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Walker_aeb3.html" title="Chuck Walker">Chuck Walker</a>, <b>Bedlam Hour</b> was <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Carolina_aeeb.html" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>'s (SC) primary proponent of the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_edge.html" title="Straight edge">straight edge</a> movement. The most prolific of the SC punk bands, Bedlam Hour released several full-length records on vinyl, including the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop-punk.html" title="Pop-punk">pop-punk</a> masterpiece "Rock the Cradle". Later, bands such as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Day_5412.html" title="Green Day">Green Day</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blink_182.html" title="Blink 182">blink 182</a> would score massive hits with a sound Bedlam Hour embraced in the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.</p>
<p>Bedlam Hour's music was punctuated by catchy hooks and deft <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a> work, but the true heart of the band's creativity lay in Walker's lyrics. 10 years before "<a href="../../../e/m/o/Emo_%28music%29.html" title="Emo (music)">emo</a>," Walker penned sensitive, introspective and poetic lyrics that struck a chord with kids in the punk, metal and straight edge scenes.</p>
<p>The band started in 1983 when Walker, then a senior in high school received one hour of studio time as a Christmas gift. He had written a few punk songs for his earlier punk band OU812 and recruited OU812 alumni Doug Throgmorton, John Cook, and Rick Jones to record a song called "Teacher," an anthem about a teenage crush on a math teacher. Produced by Jake Hunter, this early track reflected Walker's main musical influences at the time, the B52s and Dead Kennedys. When Walker left to attend college at the University of South Carolina, he got a job at the campus radio station, WUSC, and solicited the song for airplay. The song became a campus favorite among Walker's friends and Bedlam Hour became a real band. As a result, Walker and crew returned to Hunter's Sun Sound studios to record "Vegetable Harvest," a cassette that reflected three new musical interests that Walker had discovered while working at WUSC: Killing Joke, Black Flag, and The Velvet Underground.</p>
<p>The band released 100 cassettes for sale and got some college airplay in the southeast. On May 18, 1984, the band played it's first show at The Beat Club in Columbia, South Carolina. From then on, Bedlam Hour began to develop a local and then regional following, playing Atlanta, Augusta, Florence, and Columbia on a regular basis. By 1985, John Cook and Rick Jones had left the group and Walker and Throgmorton recruited Jon Leroy, a high school friend who had recently returned from studying jazz guitar to play bass. Leroy's bass playing was phenominal and the band returned to Sun Sounds to record an early demo of the songs that would eventually end up on the Rock the Cradle album. In 1985, Walker also began listening heavily to the straight edge music of Minor Threat, DYS, and 7 Seconds. He could relate to the drug free, alcohol free message reflected in the music. Although he had been straight edge for his entire life, for the first time he found others who shared similar opinions. As a result, he made it a point to give a demo to Kevin Seconds of 7 Seconds when the band came through Columbia on their New Wind tour. Seconds liked the demo and signed Bedlam Hour to Positive Force records in 1987. The band returned to Sun Sound to record in 1987 with new drummer Scott Frey after the departure of Doug Throgmorton. "Rock the Cradle" came out in October 1987. After two east coast tours in 1987 and 1988 including a notorious appearance at the 9:30 club with Kingface and a CBGB's show with Token Entry, the band returned to Columbia. The band continued touring the Southeast. Bedlam Hour was known all over the southeast <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> for its wild live shows in which the band would feed the audience freshly-made snacks (made on stage with a small waffle iron). The band's core lineup in the late 1980s was made up of Walker (guitar, vocals), <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Frey_c4fb.html" title="Scott Frey">Scott Frey</a> (drums) and Jon Leroy (bass). In 1988, Frey left to join Channel Zero with Frank Robinson and Leroy left to pursue a Masters in English at Northwestern University. Walker then recruited good friend Adam Kolesar (bass), who often appeared on stage clad only in an adult-size diaper or an elaborate Frankenberry costume. Adam Kolesar and Walker became best friends, and Kolesar added a much needed, more focused theatrical direction to the band's live show. Bedlam Hour's live performances became an event where everyone expected snacks, props, comedy, and the Frankenberry Mosh, the band's signature dance. FYA drummer Brent Long joined in 1988. The band then recorded a double album called "The Interracial Sharing of Snack Foods" at Novus studios in Charlotte, NC. The album was never released due to the demise of Bedlam Hour's record deal. However, "Frankenberry Mosh" was released on the Stupid by the Grace of God compilation e.p. with other South Carolina bands Unherd and Toast. Another track from the session, "Stand Up and Fight" was released on Hardcore Breakout USA on the New Red Archives label. The band released a 12" in Germany on the Bodonski label called "Porcupine" and was featured on the French "Fragile Produkt" compilation. In 1990, guitarist Scott Kenneally joined the band, adding a strong degree of heaviness to the band's sound. In 1992, drummer Brent Long departed and the band reentered the studio with Walker on guitar, drums, and vocals. The day after the recording session was finished, the band left on a US tour with freshly recruited teenage drummer prodigy, Derik Roddy, who later became the world's premier extreme metal drummer. The band toured the US, reaching California in the summer of 1992. Upon their return, Bedlam Hour recorded at Bob Moore's Soundlab studio in Columbia, South Carolina. There, the band recorded Sardonic and Sublime, a collection of Killing Joke influenced punk songs. This time Derik Roddy played the drums. Adam Kolesar was on the bass. Scott Kenneally played guitar. Walker played guitar, and newly added keyboardist Ed Baker joined in as well. The band continued to play regionally in the Southeast and toured Europe in 1994 in support of the Porcupine ep. In the same year, the band released a split e.p. with friends Stretch Arm Strong, who later became huge. In 1995, Brian McKenzie, guitarist for Squearl and Walker's musical partner from a side project called Joy Buzzer joined the band as the third guitarist. Walker pursued a Teenage Fan Club inspired side project called The Virgin Ironpants with Roddy and guitarist Beth Watson. Derik formed speedmetal band Deboning Method, Kenneally and Baker formed Skinny Puppy inspired techno outfit Tongue, and Kolesar moved to New York City. The band came back together as a five piece in 1996 to record "Contact," which would be their swan song. "Contact" is their only full length CD release and features many of the songs the band performed on their 1994 European tour. The band also plays many of the songs on their live in Scotland concert video from the same tour. While musically the band was growing, they had also grown up as well. With limited commercial success, the band became too hard and too expensive to continue. After playing Florence, Augusta, and Columbia, where it played one of the final Rockafellas shows, the band called it quits in 1996.</p>
<p>One of the most long-lived of the SC punk bands, Bedlam Hour existed for 13 years. Many fans still point to "Rock the Cradle" as the band's definitive work.</p>
