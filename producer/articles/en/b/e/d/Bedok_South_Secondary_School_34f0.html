<p>Bedok South Secondary School was established in the year 1980 and declared open on 29th April 1982 by Dr Lee Chiaw Meng, MP for Tanah Merah.Its first building was strategically located along New Upper Changi Road. From these premises, BDS endeavoured to cater to the educational needs of the Bedok Town Community in the fast-growing economy which was industrialising and propelling the nation towards prosperity.</p>
<p>A comprehensive yet balanced educational programme was adopted not only to develop the needs of the students but also to mould them into useful and productive members of society.</p>
<p>Involvement in Extra Curricular Activities and exposure to the outside world were also given equal emphasis. A diverse range of programmes was introduced to enthuse, challenge and spur students to be adventurous, daring and determined.</p>

<p>Rapid technological advancement and globalisation prompted the education system to focus on processes that would facilitate the acquisition of Information Technology (IT) skills. To hone creativity and critical thinking, the Thinking School. Learning Nation (TSLN) policy was introduced and adopted by all schools.</p>
<p>In line with this impetus, BDS introduced an extensive IT and Thinking skills programme to prepare students for a workplace that had become increasingly computerised.</p>
<p>In addition, the academic programme was refined to consolidate the vision of maximising students' potential and producing independent learners capable of making the transition into a sophisticated economy. Through pastoral care, steps were taken to inculcate in students a sense of individual responsibility, to promote care and concern for their peers and the handicapped; and also to instill in them a healthy respect for the environment. 'Forge Ahead' was the driving force behind these moves, characterising the resilience pervading school life at BDS.</p>

<p>In order to keep pace with global changes and to cater to the nation's goal of creating a knowledgebased economy, schools are now placing greater emphasis on holistic education and entrepreneurship. Integration, which is imperative for progress, has been revitalised through the National Education(NE) programme. In response to these changes and challenges, BDS has embarked on a learning journey that embodies innovation, adaptability and racial harmony.</p>
<p>The year 2003 marked the school's move into its new premises along Jalan Langgar Bedok- another milestone in the history of the school. The school prides itself on having modern amenities such as gymnasium, a sports field, an Art room, a Humanities room and a well-equipped media resource library. State-of-the-art computer facilities are also fully made available to the students.</p>
<p>The new premises provide and ideal platform for the school to move towards organisational excellence. Improved facilities coupled with innovative ideas create a nurturing environment for students to grow and excel in. Attention to character development remains pivotal and the core values enshrined in I CARE have been carefully crafted to inculcate the right attitude essential to moulding successful and caring students.</p>
