<p>I need to know the definition of turn-key when selling a Bed and Breakfast. Just what is to be left behind when selling a Bed and Breakfast turnkey? I have received three different answers so one more would help.</p>
<p>Thank you <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.119.230.86 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.119.230.86_7cc5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.119.230.86">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>A real estate deal and selling a business is always subject to negotiation. Therefore, before you sign the contract you must negotiate what will be included in the sales price. I don't believe you will find that turnkey is legally defined. If I were buying the business I would state that the sellers can only take their clothes and maybe their transportation. You might ask them to list what items they will be taking. If they want to take a lot of things, then my offer would reflect the cost of replacing the needed items. You definitely need to keep the phone number and name of the going concern and the customer list. Photograph and video tape the business to identify missing items later. Also compare what other owners would include in their sales price.</p>
<p>If you have already sign the contract without clarification of what will be included, then you are depending on the sellers to be gracious and leave you with everything needed to help you succeed. If the previous owners help with the financing, they may be more inclined to leave you with more items.</p>

<p>Regarding External links on this article: Please see <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">Wikpedia's External links guideline</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Links should be kept to a minimum. <i>A lack of external links</i>, or a small number of external links <i>is not a reason to add external links</i>." (emphasis added)</dd>

<p>Note that anyone who can find their way to Wikipedia can also Google "Bed and breakfast". However, if editors <i>really</i> feel that we need to help our readers find commercial establishments, see</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Rather than creating a long list of external links, editors should consider linking to a related category in the Open Directory Project (also known as <a href="../../../d/m/o/DMOZ_e708.html" title="DMOZ">DMOZ</a>) which is devoted to creating relevant directories of links pertaining to various topics.

<p>Also note from this article's history, that every time a few links are added, they are immediately joined by half a dozen more. I would propose that we have no links at all, for the reasons given, or <i>at most</i> a dmoz link, if we really think that our readers are too feeble to find their way to Google results.</p>
<p>I would, of course, make an exception of the sort of link that External links are really meant for, that is, a page discussing, say, the history of such establishments. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> | <a href="../../../m/w/a/User_talk%7EMwanner_db45.html" title="User talk:Mwanner">Talk</a> 16:40, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- I respect the guidance that: "Links should be kept to a minimum. <i>A lack of external links</i>, or a small number of external links <i>is not a reason to add external links</i>."</p>
<p>The reason to add external links is that they are helpful to most readers who, whether they are academic researchers or simply looking for a Bed and Breakfast to stay in, will probably welcome two or three external links to comprehensive, free, up-to-date and easy-to-use directories.</p>
<p>In this regard I would choose to emphasise the primary guidance contained at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">Wikpedia's External links guideline</a>: "Adding external links can be a service to our readers, but they should be kept to a minimum of those that are meritable, accessible and appropriate to the article" and, immediately below this encapsulation:-</p>
<p>"Wikipedia articles can often be improved by providing links to web pages outside Wikipedia which contain information that can't or shouldn't be added to the article. These links belong in an External links section near the bottom of the article."</p>
<p>Looking at the history of spasm link deletions of some `contributors' to the Bed and Breakfast page (and other pages), it is obvious that some `contributors' may not be aware that the guidance on External Links has recently changed.</p>
<p>The primary difficulty with googling Bed and Breakfast is one of the raisons d'être for Wikipedia: search engine results are often way too verbose, unauthoritative and not as useful as those HUMAN editors can provide.</p>
<p>I have no desire to create or maintain a long list: my suggestion would be for two or three external links that cover the globe of B&amp;B possibilities.</p>
<p>Please remember that ALL Bed and Breakfast establishments are ‘commercial’ and any external links will also inevitably be ‘commercial’ in that restricted sense.</p>
<p>My vote would go to privatestay.com. Not because I have a commercial interest in privatestay.com (although some of my clients may - I'm an attorney specialising in intellectual property), but because it is reasonably comprehensive, well programmed and presented, free of charge to both on-line users and B&amp;B's that wish to be listed and the most comprehensive up-to-date source I have discovered. If there is a more comprehensive up-to-date source in existence then I would very much welcome its' nomination here so that it can replace one (and preferably both) of the two external links I keep re-instating.</p>
<p>Although privatestay.com is reasonably comprehensive as far as Europe and Australasia goes it is weak for N. America so I would welcome a suggestion for (preferably one) link to cover that area...</p>
<p>I concur that there is a risk of (and a strong commercial incentive to) having the current one or two links proliferate like noxious weeds. But rather than throw the baby out with the bath water and have no links at all, is there no process by which two or three links can be chosen on objective criteria and then locked down? <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaimhreadhan_563b.html" title="User:Gaimhreadhan">Gaimhreadhan</a> 12:41, 30 November 2006 (UTC) (St Andrews Day)</p>

<dd>Thank you for adding the DMOZ link, though I still question even its neccessity. I have removed the other directories. Looking at the many articles on Wikipedia that deal with things one might buy, I note that they have been kept clear of any External links to commercial sites or directories thereof other than DMOZ: see, for example, <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_phone.html" title="Mobile phone">Mobile phone</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_entertainment.html" title="Home entertainment">Home entertainment</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/p/Laptop.html" title="Laptop">Laptop</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/v/SUV_9cd0.html" title="SUV">SUV</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_media_player.html" title="Portable media player">Portable media player</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_audio_player.html" title="Digital audio player">Digital audio player</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_Disc_player_9b54.html" title="Compact Disc player">Compact Disc player</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_computer.html" title="Home computer">Home computer</a>. See especially the External links sections in <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel.html" title="Hotel">Hotel</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motel.html" title="Motel">Motel</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort.html" title="Resort">Resort</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacation_rental.html" title="Vacation rental">Vacation rental</a>, none of which have any directory links. (Note that I have edited none of these articles.) I conclude that ordinary Wikipedia practice calls for <i>at most</i> a DMOZ link.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Finally, I have to ask-- <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaimhreadhan_563b.html" title="User:Gaimhreadhan">Gaimhreadhan</a>, what, exactly, is your interest in this? I note that you have precisely two edits to articles other than <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bed_and_Breakfast_eca0.html" title="Bed and Breakfast">Bed and Breakfast</a>; is it possible that your interest in this issue is colored by self-interest? -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> | <a href="../../../m/w/a/User_talk%7EMwanner_db45.html" title="User talk:Mwanner">Talk</a> 14:17, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am an attorney and don't have too much spare time with two small children to look after. The first two Wikipedia articles I ‘edited’ had glaring (and misleading) spelling mistakes. I made a few similar minor corrections and additions to this B&amp;B article and added one external link that I believed to be helpful. (The external link I added was to a Directory which, at the time I added the link, I was not connected with but had found very useful. Subsequently I have made some bug reports to that Directory). I was then quite surprised to find that the helpful external links (which I had <b>not</b> authored) were summarily removed (contrary to the clear guidance about arbitrary and sweeping and unreasoned changes).</p>
<p>The conclusion of <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> is directly contrary to the `nutshell advice' provided by Wikipedia: "Wikipedia articles can often be improved by providing links to web pages outside Wikipedia which contain information that can't or shouldn't be added to the article. These links belong in an External links section near the bottom of the article."</p>

<p>According to the relevant Wikipedia article, DMOZ recently suffered a catastrophic failure, and I have pointed this out in the external links that I have re-instated this morning.</p>
<p>I clarify that I have no commercial interest in DMOZ, privatestay.com or Bedandbreakfast.com other than the probability that some of their programmers, shareholders, officers and contributors may have been or currently are private clients.</p>
<p>My interest in all this is, presumably, identical to most users of Wikipedia: to have a useful, accurate and growing resource.</p>
<p>Finally, may I say that I am disappointed that nobody has commented upon my suggestion that "rather than throw the baby out with the bath water and have no links at all, is there no process by which two or three links can be chosen on objective criteria and then locked down?" <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaimhreadhan_563b.html" title="User:Gaimhreadhan">Gaimhreadhan</a> 03:06, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for the baby/bathwater notion, I believe that the "baby" here is the article itself; the "bathwater" is the external links section.

<dd>Lastly, I'm awfully interested in that rather tortured phrasing of yours-- "I have no commercial interest in DMOZ, privatestay.com or Bedandbreakfast.com other than <i>the probability that</i> some of their programmers, shareholders, officers and contributors <i>may have been or currently are</i> private clients." In other words, then, your interests are <i>not quite</i> "presumably, identical to most users of Wikipedia", especially seeing that, unlike most users of Wikipedia, you appear to have no interest in any article but this one. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> | <a href="../../../m/w/a/User_talk%7EMwanner_db45.html" title="User talk:Mwanner">Talk</a> 03:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Appearances can be deceptive. I may well develop an interest in contributing more if it doesn't prove to be a waste of my time and that of others.</p>
<p>Is it your opinion that my other very minor contributions to <i>five</i> other articles are unhelpful?</p>
<p>If it were not for my lack of time and the approach you have shown me I might have developed an interest in contributing to other articles.</p>
<p>I'm not a fast typist.<br />
Is there a way we can discuss this voice? (At my expense and in your time zone).<br />

<dd>I apologise for missing your six quite helpful edits to five other articles, four of them made since my November 30 comment about your (then) two edits. I don't mean to belittle your work here-- merely to point out that your claim to be no more interested in this issue than any other Wikipedian appears to be spurious. If you are indeed a slow typist, you are spending quite an inordinate amount of time on these discussions. I am not especially interested in a voice conversation on this matter.

<dl>
<dd>Despite your reiteration of the assertion on my Talk page that I am opposed to all external links, the fact is that I have added many external links to Wikipedia's pages. I <i>am</i> opposed to links that have commercial intent, and the directories you are adding are all to pages that have commercial intent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is simply a factual error on your part.</p>
<p>I have only ever <i>originally</i> added two external links. One to DMOZ - is that a site with commercial intent?</p>
<p>And one link to privatestay.com which site is free of charge to both visitors and contributors. <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaimhreadhan_563b.html" title="User:Gaimhreadhan">Gaimhreadhan</a> 17:17, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Once again, I think that we should follow the example of the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel.html" title="Hotel">Hotel</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motel.html" title="Motel">Motel</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort.html" title="Resort">Resort</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacation_rental.html" title="Vacation rental">Vacation rental</a> articles, and have <i>no</i> External links on this page, unless one can find a page that is not trying to sell something.

<p>That is because I do not wish to provide you with a hit-list of articles that have useful external links that conform to Wikipedia guidelines that you would equally pointlessly excise. <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaimhreadhan_563b.html" title="User:Gaimhreadhan">Gaimhreadhan</a> 17:17, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would also like to make the following concrete proposals for external links on the renamed Bed and Breakfast article:</p>
<p>1) Reinstate the DMOZ external link</p>
<p>2) Reach agreement <i>in principle</i> to having ONE authoritative, global and up-to-date external link for at least as long as DMOZ is broken.</p>
<p>3) Reach agreement <i>in principle</i> to having the minimum number of regional directory links if the consensus is that ONE authoritative, global and up-to-date external link does not yet exist and for at least as long as DMOZ is broken.</p>

<p>OK, now that we have a cease-fire, I thought it might make sense to put together a joint final position, with the (faint) hope that we might actually come to an agreement that way, and (more realistically) that we will at least provide whatever mediators we call on with a more concise statement of positions, so they don't have to wade through all of our diatribes at each other. So, as simply as possible, my position is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> states that "Links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services" are "Links normally to be avoided".</li>
<li>One of the directories that you want to link to (<a href="http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) clearly takes payment for its services from the websites that it lists, and is therefore itself a commercial entity. Further, it provides links directly to commercial entities (<a href="http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/massachusetts-w-barnstable-themaplestreetinn.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/massachusetts-w-barnstable-themaplestreetinn.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) where one can book a room online.</li>
<li>Another of the directories that you want to link to (<a href="http://www.privatestay.com//" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.privatestay.com//" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) provides far fewer direct web links, but still presumably is in business to profit directly from its listings (<a href="http://www.privatestay.com/accommodation/New_Zealand/Auckland/Leigh-Matakana-Leigh_Harbour_Holiday_House_00003145.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.privatestay.com/accommodation/New_Zealand/Auckland/Leigh-Matakana-Leigh_Harbour_Holiday_House_00003145.php" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). At least it nowhere states that it is a non-profit enterprise.</li>
<li>The DMOZ link-- while DMOZ is a non-profit entity, a DMOZ directory of Bed and Breakfasts is, neccessarily, a directory of commercial web-pages, and thus merely passes the reader through to links that would be otherwise prohibited.</li>
<li>Finally, given that our articles on <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel.html" title="Hotel">Hotel</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motel.html" title="Motel">Motel</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort.html" title="Resort">Resort</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacation_rental.html" title="Vacation rental">Vacation rental</a>, have no directory links, the precedent exists for excluding External links in similar articles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Forgive me for not responding to your points above; I am not at all ready to concede the principles that they call for. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwanner_e32b.html" title="User:Mwanner">Mwanner</a> | <a href="../../../m/w/a/User_talk%7EMwanner_db45.html" title="User talk:Mwanner">Talk</a> 00:52, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Two major quibbles: It is yourself and similar zealots that have made many articles arid and less practically helpful by deleting all external links - so please do not cite those self-same articles as precedent - you have simply worn people down and into resigned submission.</p>
<p>I think we should attempt to reach consensus on my concrete principles first; if we can't it will be inevitably fruitless to attempt to discuss specific external links later.</p>
<p>A minor quibble: It is not myself that originally proposed www.bedandbreakfast.com as an external link. I am rather neutral about it and merely repaired your (perceived) link sabotage spasms.</p>
<p><br />
Apart from those quibbles, you are forgiven.</p>
<p><br />
Now I think it might be instructive to go and look again at the first article I ever edited: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Alliance_2d03.html" title="Star Alliance">Star Alliance</a></p>
<p>That article has pertinent external links to more than a score of commercial websites that seek to sell air transport services - principally those of the airline members of that alliance.</p>
<p>Do you seriously think that article would be improved by deleting all those external links?</p>
<p>And if not, please draw the distinction between the (commercial) topics of Airline Alliances and the (commercial) topics of Hosted Accommodation.</p>
<p>Finally, please excuse me if I do not reply for a few days - I have to travel to clients on the other side of the world... <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaimhreadhan_563b.html" title="User:Gaimhreadhan">Gaimhreadhan</a> 01:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel.html" title="Hotel">Hotel</a> was free of External links long before I first edited it, and I have never edited <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motel.html" title="Motel">Motel</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort.html" title="Resort">Resort</a>, so it is not <i>my</i> "zealotry" that is responsible for their lack of links. And yes, I seriously think that they would be the worse for being cluttered with commercial links, as, apparently, do many other editors. Are you seriously proposing that links to commercial sites make our articles, what, richer? How so? The world is already so cluttered with commerce, I, for one, find Wikipedia's relative freedom from it to be one of its best features. In fact, I've always felt that freedom from commerce was precisely why Wikipedia "makes the web not suck".</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I didn't want to get into another lengthy exchange with you. I was hoping that you would put forth a final, concise statement of your position. Could you, please? And, preferably, without the name calling?

<p>I'm somewhat confused about the baby throw out with the bathwater on this specific topic. While there are no "commercial" link on hotel or motel in a link section, there are multiple links to specific hotels and those specific hotels all link to their commerical external site.</p>
<p>if i can wiki hotel, pop to "library hotel" via embedded link to wiki entry, then pop to the commercial site from there, why would the exclusion of such links be required here?</p>
<p>perhaps do what hotels does, or motels to a greatly lesser extent.</p>
<p>link to several rating, recommendation sites, set up a wiki stub or article on them, then allow the visiter who links bed &amp; breakfasts to be able to get to external information on that lodging as the can for the library hotel, hilton hotel, motel6, etc..</p>

<p>...."in some smaller B&amp;Bs they will be expected to be away from the B&amp;B during the main part of the day. This arrangement, however, may not be inconvenient since many popular B&amp;Bs are located in beach and mountain areas, such as Hawaii, New England, and Colorado where daytime recreation and tourism activities are popular."</p>
<p>OK, almost none of the B&amp;Bs in the world are situated in the afforemention U.S. states, or even 'beach and mountain areas.' How about we phrase it "many B&amp;Bs are located in areas which offer a range of tourist and recreation activities"?</p>
