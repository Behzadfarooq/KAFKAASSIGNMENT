<p>Reading an article on another insect (ticks), I noticed that the section on removal had been removed. Is it appropriate to include a how-to pest control section in an article such as this? I wonder if the how-to section might not be better suited to wikibooks. In particular, the recommendation to mix pesticide and kerosene seems a bit-- well, scary. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Allen_935f.html" title="User:Tom Allen">Tom Allen</a> 06:51, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What version of <a href="../../../t/i/c/Tick.html" title="Tick">Tick</a> had a section on removal? I think this kind of information is appropriate and encyclopedic. Ticks and bedbugs are of primary interest to humans as pests, and one of the most important things to find out about pests is how to get rid of them and keep them away. Information of purely entomological/scientific interest is certainly very appropriate, but so is this kind of common knowledge about pest control. If it were to become very long than a separate article might be in order but that seems unlikely. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 16:01, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was formerly an article on Tick removal.

Several objected to including how-to instructions in an encyclopedia. (On the other hand, many print encyclopedias do precisely that!) I'm fine with leaving it in-- I was just wondering if there was a policy. Having said that, I <i>do</i> think the section could be cleaned up quite a bit. If a how-to section is included, it should provide sound, properly referenced, information. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Allen_935f.html" title="User:Tom Allen">Tom Allen</a> 20:00, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that "how-to" articles belong in an encyclopedia, but that's different from the description of procedures and processes. There doesn't need to be a separate article on "tick removal," a brief description in the "Tick" article proper should suffice. <a href="../../../n/t/k/User%7ENTK_0383.html" title="User:NTK">NTK</a> 19:59, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have marked the area regarding "self-removal" as "dubious," because I personally believe that a lot of its advice probably will not lead to successful removal. For example, I don't believe that most any insecticide will work, I think it's unwise to mix kerosene and something identified only as "insect poison" yourself, and fogging to the best of my knowledge has absolutely no effect on bedbugs. I also highly doubt that bedbugs can be treated without insecticide and do not believe that vacuuming a mattress every two to three days for several weeks will work. In short, I disagree with the effectiveness of almost everything in the "self-removal" section. Frankly, I propose its removal. The only thing I think is salvageable from that paragraph is the vaseline/glass jars paragraph, as I do think that is probably a good tip for very temporary prevention while other things are being carried out. — <a href="http://www.windycitymike.com" class="external text" title="http://www.windycitymike.com" rel="nofollow">WCityMike</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> 16:38, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think anyone's really actively paying attention to this article.

<dd>Fumigations are very effective. Some companies refuse to treat mattresses and cloth furniture not only because of the difficulties of treating them but also, due to the liabilities involved. People spend plenty of time sleeping or resting on furniture and may have complaints about the pesticides. Some pest control companies remove all mattresses, box springs, furniture, etc from a residence and fumigate. The fumigant will kill all the stages of the bed bugs and penetrate even those hard to reach areas. The drawback is that the fumigants have no residual action and will not prevent any re-infestation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.222.72.34 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.222.72.34_a313.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.222.72.34">contribs</a>) 12:28, November 21, 2005.</small></dd>

<dd>I crushed a couple of them after a sleepless night in the car outside the hostel I paid for ... obviously a couple of them had followed me to the car in my clothes or bags. There was quite a bit of blood there, and the bugs were pretty sizable, maybe a centimeter or so. Not sure how much - I shudder to contemplate trying to measure it; crushing the things alone made me want to vomit - but it was definitely more than a drop or two, and the whole thing seemed filled with blood; the smudge left was all blood colored, no bug-guts or whatever.

<p>Revert wars never look good to the end user. Let's hash out here and then act. I'm not one of the reverters, but I am the Wikipedian who did the first major rehash on the article after my bedbug infestation last summer, and initially put in the links. My stance is that they should stay in. Wikipedia's "External Links" page indicates that "sites that contain neutral and accurate material not already in the article" and "sites with other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article" are perfectly acceptable for inclusion in external links. This is hardly an indiscriminate collection of links. — WCityMike <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> 00:05, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is, indeed, unfortunate. Look back at the history. An advertisement for live-pest-free.com was added by 61.68.64.180/210.10.141.164. At the same time, a blog was added, which some people saw simply as a testimonial for the live-pest-free.com site. The revert war was with respect to the advertising. The other links suffered collateral damage. That aside, the question still remains as to whether blogs belong. Almost by definition, blogs are personal opinions. Do they belong in an encyclopedia? If so, when do you stop? What criteria do you use to select the links? <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 03:35, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was actually trying to zap the ads -- I don't know as I agree that the blogs were collateral damage from the ad revert. I don't know as they really deserve to be zapped in this case, because of the sole fact that when these people are speaking of their attempts to deal with bedbugs, they are sharing informative personal experiences. Also, seriously, bedbugs are not really a point of controversy -- it's not like we're speaking of political blogs about Bush and debating whether THOSE blogs belong on a Dubya entry. — WCityMike <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> 06:13, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Charles A. Campbell 1911 article is continually being removed by individuals who indicate that whale.to is a contentious site and a linkspammer.</p>
<p>The external link in question has no advertisements on it whatsoever; it is simply an essay. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Whaleto_2940.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Whaleto">The open Request for Comment</a> specifically "concerns the appropriateness of Whaleto linking to his personal website, and his conduct relating to such discussions." This is not the case with this external link; it was not placed on there by the user Whaleto; it was placed on there by me in one of my initial rewrites of the article.</p>
<p>I have reviewed, as suggested, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and I have no idea what is meant by JzG's comment in the edit history that "copies of other sources on private sites are not generally suitable." Perhaps he'd be so kind as to elucidate which item on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> he is referring to. The site seems to fully satisfy the suggested prerequisites listed under "What should be linked to" and embody none of the prerequisites listed under "Links to normally avoid". Additionally it does not appear to be external link spamming.</p>
<p>Despite the above, I'm not married to the whale.to source of the article and am more than comparable to a <b>lateral</b> edit. My point is: it is not fruitful to make entirely <b>destructive</b> changes for purposes of pure pedantic bureaucracy. If you have a personal problem with the version of the article being housed on whale.to, then find another source and change the link; don't just remove the source of information from the article. — WCityMike <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> 14:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>While I was gone, I noticed that the whale.to link was removed. I've found a non-whale.to link to the story. Additionally, there appear to be some concerns about its copyright status. As the new provided link indicates, it was copyrighted 1925; this means that as it was not renewed, the article now falls into the public domain.

<dd>This time, I'm trying to incorporate your changes but get them more towards a neutral point of view, which is the tone that Wikipedia articles are required to be written in. You used words like "worthless" and "reputable," which are words that demonstrate an opinion and a bias about something. Since we're writing encyclopedia articles, we're required as editors and writers to keep an objective tone and not let our opinions about the subject shine through. More on this can be found at <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'd like to see if we can come to a happy compromise, but it's difficult when you're editing from an anonymous account and seem to be coming from different IPs. I urge you to sign up for a Wikipedia account and come talk with me about what you feel needs to be done on the article's talk page, <strong class="selflink">Talk:Bedbug</strong>. I'm cc:ing this message there, just so people know I'm leaving this. I encourage you to work with me on getting this paragraph to a place where we're both mutually satisfied with it, instead of us just yanking it back and forth between our two ideas about how the paragraph should be written.</dd>

<p>First,, i was not aware of the discussion aspect of Wikipedia.. I too have found it frustrating to enter relevant information of value to readers and then find it either deleted or changed..</p>
<p>I would not enter info into a Wikipedia subject if I didn't have reasonable knowledge of the subject. IN the bedbug item, there is a considerable amount of suggestions and information about prevention, preparation, and treatment. While I may not always agree with every point of view, i do feel it my duty to inform and educate and warn readers in certain areas. So wehn i see something about Most reputable firms will ask for preparation.. i know that is patently incorrect -- and i changed it to ALL reputable firms.. that is just reality... not opinion or POV... no specific firm is named, so the recommendation speaks truth.. and in any service related item, this kind of information is absolutely necessary.. I am sure many of the bedbug sections are written by professionals in the pest control, professors of entomology and , like myself.. some Board Certified Entomologists .... i was beginning to feel as if someone in a disreputable firm did not want the warnings there...</p>
<p>still learning about how to input into wikipedia...</p>
<p>i had entered in another section and found deletions of very relevant information.. troubling.. so in that section (not bedbugs) .. i am pasting it back in every time i see it gone. I feel it a duty so people can have the important information someone else wants to hide or whitewash...</p>
<p>I look to the folks in Wikipedia to be on the alert for inappropriate entries, but mostly i find the material is really excellent..</p>
<p>i have not had time to go through every single bit of the bedbug item, but i will keep a watch on it and add material as it becomes known.. The use of glue boards and balloons to detect bedbugs is unproven.. i tried it.. perhaps not enough there.. some people tell me it works, .. wish we had more relevant info on that.. they are sometimes very very hard to find... when there is a hidden small pocket that has avoided being detected or treated...</p>
<p>I deal wtih this issue every day in my work...</p>

<dd>Your addition, "Due to the habits of bedbugs to hide almost anywhere, it is necessary to ensure that the treatment of the home as well handling clothing and bedding will ensure that the insects are all killed by treatment", says the exact same thing as what's already in that paragraph: "If an apartment is not properly prepared either by the resident or the professional, the coverage of pesticides and/or chemical treatment throughout the home will be impaired, and thus the effectiveness of the treatment will be heavily reduced." But I reworded that last sentence a little to make it clearer that we're talking about bedbugs surviving the treatment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We also talk about the ability of bedbugs to spread from one apartment to another higher-up in the article, because it's not speaking about pre-treatment, but about methods of infestation: "Finally, bedbugs may travel between units in multi-unit dwellings (such as condominiums and apartment buildings), after being originally brought into the building by one of the above routes. This spread between units is dependent in part on the degree of infestation, on the material used to partition units (concrete is a more effective barrier to the spread of the infestation), and whether or not infested items are dragged through common areas while being disposed of, resulting in the shedding of bedbugs and bedbug eggs while being dragged."</dd>

<dd>And, again, "reputable" is a word demonstrating bias and opinion. It's not a question of disreputable exterminators trying to sneak things in, Entoman; I'm not an exterminator. But this is an <i>encyclopedia,</i> and as such, we're seeking an entirely neutral point of view. That means keeping our opinions out of it. That doesn't mean we can't say things, just that we can't say things in an opinionated way. — <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMik</a><font color="green">e</font> (<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html#Reply_Policy" title="User:WCityMike">where to reply</a>) 23:49, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't agree with your point about 'reputable' but i am ok with the current phrasing of the preparation section, so no need for more editing wars. will check the piece now and then.. i changed delusionary to delusory as i believe that is the correct term describing the condition. I wrote an article on that about 18 years ago. Lots of stuff here on bedbugs... useful .... wikipedia an amazing thing.. Mike. how did you get so much into bedbugs?

<dd>Not immensely into bedbugs, but I got infested last year, and ended up asking my exterminator about five million questions. After I "survived" the infestation (partially by moving out!), I decided that it would be good if I could share what I learned from the experience, and rewrote the bedbug article to incorporate everything I learned. Nowadays bedbugs are mostly behind me — although, frankly, I'm jumpy enough that I might have a slight case of the D.P.s — but out of a sense of pride, I keep an eye on the bedbug article. — <a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">WCityMike</a> (<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 23:28, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a rather archaic word that one almost never hears in language for most readers.

<dd>I would hardly call "domicile" archaic. It may not be as commonly used as "home" or "house", but I have certainly come across it a number of times in general reading. In addition it appears that you are also one to unnecessarily complicate things by using words such as "obfuscate" in the place of "confuse".

<dd>I also disagree that "domicile" is archaic. I don't think we should be underestimating the intelligence of the readers and dumbing down to meet some arbitrary lowest common denominator. People don't come to Wikipedia for dumbing down, they come here for smarting up, and to look things up, including the meaning of words like "domicile".

<p>Does anyone know who wrote the original version of this article? I ask because I'm curious who it was, but I also feel the need to make a contribution to the text. In the section that refers to "number of visits by a pest management company" the author refers to an informal survey. I was one of the project leaders of that survey and it was not informal. I could add more information or a citation to an article to come out this summer covering more of the survey. I'm a new user (as of today) to Wikipedia, so I'm still figuring all this out.

<p>I am very keen on finding out what pathogens (disease causing germs) bedbugs are known to carry. Some sources have cited that bedbugs are known to carry 24 pathogens. Can getting blood of bedbugs on your body or hands when you accidentally kill them cause spread of diseases? There is very little information of discussion of this subject. Those of you who are interested or concerned about this please share your experiences. I am basically very concerned. How can an organism that is now becoming so prevalent in North America and is known to carry 20 to 30 pathogens not be spreading disease? Can we assume they are not (speading disease) or is it that we don't yet know how they are spreading disease? Research is needed in this area and if people like you and me share our experiences and update wikipedia perhaps we can get experts to offer their comments or spark off research?</p>

<p>To the question of using an ultrasonic device to repel bedbugs, professionals say "It's too good to be true." Yes, those plug-in type ultrasonic devices are known to repel redents and some kind of bugs, but not specially for bedbugs. However, I tested it out. After two days of keeping an untrasonic turned on, this morning, two bedbugs actually came out on the floor, waiting to be killed; this has never happened so far. They were hiding in some place I never know as if they have a sophisticated intelligent system. I can't say anything about the causal relationships between the bedbug's behavior and the device. But, I just want to know what's found and what can be found about the effect of an ultrasonic device.</p>

It's my position (i) that the websites are useful, (ii) that they add a significant degree of quality and usefulness to the article, (iii) that I have individually looked at the commercial websites and determined that they are strictly factual in nature and do not, as of my last examination, heavily (or, even, really, minorly) advertise their hosting PCO, and thus are not <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a>, (iv) that the blogs add a significant degree of quality to the article, especially such 'blogs' (that are not really personal blogs in nature) as Bedbugger, and (v) that, while not meaning to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">personally attack</a> the user in question, one of his primary focii on Wikipedia seems to be going around and strictly and without latitude applying <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EEXT_c232.html" title="WP:EXT">WP:EXT</a>, and that this may lead to a certain degree of inflexibility in interpretation of <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EEXT_c232.html" title="WP:EXT">WP:EXT</a> which does not match Wikipedia's larger-scale policies.</p>
<p>My counterposition is as follows: <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EEXT_c232.html" title="WP:EXT">WP:EXT</a>, the page he cites, is a guideline; "guidelines are not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception" (<a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">WP:POL</a>). It makes no common sense to remove useful, factual, nonbiased websites — websites which I and others have vetted for objectivity — that provide useful information on the article's subject. By removing the weblogs and the <i>non-spam</i> information provided by commercial websites (has he even visited each of these external links before determining they violate policy?), he is lowering the article's quality.

<dd>I don't mean to sound as if I am attacking you, but I can't figure out a way to phrase this in a polite manner. With regards to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation, I do think that cutting a wide swath across Wikipedia forcing a strict interpretation of <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EEXT_c232.html" title="WP:EXT">WP:EXT</a> on each article you visit is indeed disruptive to Wikipedia's improvement. Although there are obviously egregious examples of editors entirely shirking the <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EEXT_c232.html" title="WP:EXT">WP:EXT</a> guidelines, I'm sure, one of the more common behaviors of editors is to find a few articles in an area they know about and try to improve them (while recognizing that they don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> them, yes). I understand Wikipedia policies; so do others here. I'm not saying those editors who have worked on this article <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> it, but I'm saying that I think — with all due respect — that those who have "adopted" the upkeep and maintenance of this article (and that's where <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a> comes in — both through the edits themselves and the "silent agreement" <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a> refers to by a lack of prior reversions) ... that those people took longer than you did to examine and weigh the external links that now remain in that section for their value to the article. I'm aware of what <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EEXT_c232.html" title="WP:EXT">WP:EXT</a> says; that's why I indicated in my response that it was a <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">guideline</a>, not a policy, meaning that latitude is there for the betterment of an article, a position <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> does support. So I'd ask you to leave the external links section as it is; the removal of those links worsens the article, in my opinion, because those are useful sources of information, and <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> does suggest quality, in the end, is important than adhering to the finer points of regulations. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 02:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lovely.

<dd>Yeah, pretty much.

<dd>Another editor from <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam</a> here. I apologize for the appearance of us "outsiders" ganging up on you, but that is truly not our intent. While most of the editors in our project may not have tremendous experience with bedbugs, we do have a great deal of experience evaluating external links and whether or not they are appropriate. Often, one of our editors who is having a dispute will post at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam</a> asking for a second opinion to make sure they are doing the right thing. Sometimes we disagree and say "the link is okay, leave it"; other times we agree and help enforce the guideline. We don't just blindly support the link removal. So there certainly is not any "anti-spam cabal", but I'm sorry if you found <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeinor_0082.html" title="User:Veinor">Veinor's</a> sarcasm off-putting.</dd>
<dd>In this case here, I have also looked at the <i>bedbugger.com</i> website and concur that it does not meet the inclusion requirements of <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EExternal_links_ce44.html" title="WP:External links">WP:External links</a>. As far as consensus goes, you appear to be the only editor of this article that favors its inclusion (and many times we have backed down from deleting even an <i>obviously</i> inappropriate link if there is consensus among article editors to keep it).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I'm not here to kick you when you're down. I really am sorry you feel like we are gaming the system, so to speak, but <a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> made a good call on this one.
