<dd>The notability itself is kinda questionable. I mean during the Ottoman Empire numerous people, high post or not, deemed collaborators by both Ottoman and ARF or Armenian sides were jailed, removed or executed. A search for Bedros Kapamajian on google gave me 3 pages of results, many of em Wikipedia related pages. Bedros Kapamaciyan on the other hand (Turkish spelling) gave me plenty of results that deny the Armenian Genocide and exagerate Armenian activity during the Ottoman Empire. A search for Bedros Kapamajian on google books gave me <b>0</b> results. Kapamciyan gave me 1 result, an article in Turkish. Of course, the Ottoman Empire/today's Turkey would find anything to vilify all that is done by Armenians, particularily the ARF. If this were at all notable or supposedly true, opponents of the ARF, and there are alot, would most certainly accuse them of killing fellow Armenians and write something about it. <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 19:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Not everyone is involved in "denier-defender" fight, so it is a good idea to use words carefully! The general argument "If it is not printed in my media, it has to be wrong" is flowed. Each side has its media that only covers their arguments and ignores the opposing, and selectively publish (defending the <b>right·eous</b> view). I guess "deniers-defenders" needs to look from other arguments and try to understand what had happened 100 years ago. Each side has its own history and most of the facts (of the story) has some form of truth in it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOttomanReference_bb23.html" title="User:OttomanReference">OttomanReference</a> 21:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And just cause it's mentioned in Turkish books does not make it true. Propoganda could've been rampant during that time, on both sides. That is why we must find secondary sources (Justin McCarthy is not a neutral secondary source). It will be hard to find such sources because of the notibility of the alleged event being not that big. A mayor is not really notable. If it was a provincial governor or someone of a top post, it would've been very notable, such as the Yildiz Attempt on Hamid II. And the ARF had/has plenty of political opponents (who are Armenians), there could've been some coverage of it that bashed the event, it could've been documented in books such as the murder of the Armenian archbishop in Syracuse, a charge that has been layed on the ARF by other Armenians. <a href="../../../f/e/d/User%7EFedayee_044a.html" title="User:Fedayee">Fedayee</a> 23:20, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wrong, and reverted per WP:V - it is verifiability and not truth that counts - you cannot simply remove sources just because they are Turkish - that doesn't make sense. Please do not carry that ugly habit that plagued the recent Azeri-Armenian debate "no, that's pro-X, it must be removed" - there is no such rule. What is the point of the harassment of this article, may I ask? They are sourced, and people are free to discuss POV issues in talk however.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:05, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I apologize if I caused offense, but it was just that one thing that I had noticed in those disputes was the sources (biased, not biased, acceptable, not-acceptable etc). In any case, you are right in the sense that any other sources would be definitely welcome. Nevertheless, I don't understand why you want to nominate it for deletion - there are verifiable sources you know. It is not like the article is claiming that the moon is made of green cheese. I don't know the story, but I do feel some sense of minor harassment of the article - there are many articles out there written only by Armenian sources (some of the articles on battles), when was the last time I nominated any for deletion?</dd>
<dd>In any case, one thing you said is not correct: there are verifiable sources. nevertheless, neutrality is a double-edged sword and is on the eye of the beholder. Again, I don't like this habit of considering Turkish sources as unreliable or that they are always lying. Anyways, it is not the Apollo landing we are talking about, so if I were you I wouldn't be holding my breath for tons of documentation about this&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:29, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article should be nominated for deletion because all the sources in the article are not neutral sources. If anyone does not agree with the deletion then they should find more neutral sources besides sources that are Turkish. By the way Baristarim, next time don't tell me what I should or not learn, that doesn't not concern you. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 21:39, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. Actually, I would consider Armenian sources to be just as unreliable as Turkish sources. That's why I say that for this article the information must be verified by a neutral or verifiable secondary source. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 21:43, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm trying to fight the urge of reverting, but Baris will probably start whining about WP:POINT etc; his favorite <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i>. I doubt it would be a violation to add {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_credibility_5fa2.html" title="Template:Verify credibility">verify credibility</a>}} to the dubious citations.

<dd>It concerns Wikipedia, and disruption is detrimental to the project. Please read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - the info is verifiable and that's what is important, it is verifiability, not truth. Then we might as well delete all articles who primarily use Armenian sources by that logic.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:45, 7 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The other solution would be to "balance" this article by using Armenian sources as well as Turkish sources. Trouble is, there are no Armenian sources on Bedros Kapamajian. Turkish sources alone cannot back-up the information on this article. How can we be sure that Bedros Kapamajian even existed? I'm not saying that he didn't, but still, we need to verify this. -- <a href="../../../a/i/v/User%7EAivazovsky_a655.html" title="User:Aivazovsky">Aivazovsky</a> 21:48, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I hear your points. Listen, only thing that I found a bit odd is the excessive use of fact tags, deletions etc. That's the only thing that I am concerned about. As can be seen from the article history - I didn't write this article. I just would like things to be cool and calm. I will take some time to make some search of my own - you might also want to leave a note at Free Smyrnan - she said that she has some good books about Armenians in the OE et al. Ask her to take a look at it. If things are still not settled, an AfD is still possible. Are you sure that you have not found any mention of this guy in any Armenian sources? Roob23, by the way I apologize if I might have come on a bit strong earlier on, but trying to control tensions in certain articles is really hard and I had to run in with the fire extinguisher to numerous disputes today already!

<dd>I'm not ROOB323, but Baris that was very respectable of you. Your frustration with settling disputes is understandable (I've been there before). Had this taken place before Hrant Dink was shot, I think I would have just gone ahead and nominated this for deletion without thinking, but I decided to set a date (May 1) for an AfD unless some verifiable sources can be found before then. I haven't found anything in Armenian sources on this person, but I can double check. I'll contact Free Smyrnan.
