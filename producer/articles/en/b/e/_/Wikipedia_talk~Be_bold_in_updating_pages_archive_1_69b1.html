<p>For the most part, the instinctive desire of an author to "own" what he has written is counterproductive here, and it is good to shake up that emotional attachment by making sweeping changes at will when it improves the result. But there's an important exception to keep in mind: <i>Commentary</i> written by and specifically credited to one person should <i>not</i> be edited for content without correctly identifying all the changes. It's OK to fix obvious spelling and grammar bugs, but changing content is tantamount to making a false quotation claim. For example, the <a href="http://meta.wikipedia.com/wiki.phtml?Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikipedia.com/wiki.phtml?Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">Wiki is not paper</a> page contained a quote from Jimbo about something that would "grow gracefully old", and someone changed it into the cliche "grow old gracefully". That's not what Jimbo said, and it has a different meaning. It was also not an improvement on the original; in fact it was much worse. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Another comment: There are times when I have edited a page originally written in British English. Since my native language is American English, I do not consider myself competent to edit British text without accidentally throwing in a "realize" or "the team is..." or something else I'm not familiar with, so I simply "translated" the page into American English in its entirety so that I can be sure it's correct. This in no way implies that I think one is better than the other; only that I'm more competent to edit one. Of course, if a British person later comes along to edit it and wants to translate it back, that's fine too if he or she feels more competent editing that. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>

<dd>Perhaps this debate doesn't really belong here, but do you really find British English so different that you feel you can't piecemeal edit it correctly? I certainly feel competent to edit pages obviously written by Americans&#160;:) As far as ending up with a mixture of British and American (and, what the hell, let's throw in some Australian, New Zealand, and South African English as well), I can't see it as a huge problem. If somebody finds the spelling and vocabulary inconsistencies too annoying, they'll get cleaned up IMHO. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">user:Robert Merkel</a></dd>

<dd>Or consider Canadian English. Just read anything written in standard Canadian English (whatever that is), or peruse the Canadian Oxford English Dictionary, and you'll find that using a mishmash of British and American English is the norm in Canada. So rewriting an entire article is probably not worth the bother. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Makepeace_ab5b.html" title="User:Andrew Makepeace">AJM</a></dd>

<p>Isn't the first line "Wikis don't work if people aren't bold." too definitive (and misleading&#160;?)&#160;? It suggests that boldness is the only way to live in wikipedia. Better ways of rephrasing the line can be found at <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditing_policy_7a1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Editing policy">Wikipedia:Editing_policy</a>, section:On editing styles. It talks about different approaches to take while editing, boldness being one of them. Wikis work with other approaches too. Perhaps the line could be "Wikis develop faster when people are bold." as the speed element is the biggest advantage. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_ff70.html" title="User:Jay">Jay</a> 22:45, Sep 16, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quote:</p>
<p>If you encounter an article on a controversial subject that you would like to edit, first read the comments on the talk page and view the Page history to get a sense of how the article came into being and what its current status is. Then, if you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, you should either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move it to the Talk page, if it is a sentence or so, and list your objections.</li>
<li>Only list your objections to the section on the Talk page if it is longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text.</p>
<p>Unquote</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but there are several things I don't understand here.</p>
<p>- Wikipedia menus do not include a "talk page" (or even a "Talk page"). A fair amount of digging will eventually reveal that what is meant is the "Discuss this page" option; but aren't we dealing here with an article for newcomers to the Wikipedia?</p>
<p>- If taking option 1. we are instructed to "Move it to the Talk page" (presuming that the "it" refers to "anything substantial"). But later we are told "then wait a bit" before proceeding. Moving means taking away from one place as well as putting in another, so we are being instructed to proceed to make an amendment or deletion, then told not to proceed to do so before waiting "a bit" for responses to what we should not (or is it should?) have done anyway. The author of the caveat presumably meant not "move" but "copy" But why should we have to presume so much?</p>
<p>- After that conundrum comes another, equally difficult to grasp. Option 1: List your objections if they refer to a sentence or so vs. Option 2: Only list your objections if they refer to something longer (= don't list your objections if they refer to a sentence or so).</p>
<p>- Finally, "If no one objects, proceed". The liberum veto comes to Wikipedia! I sincerely hope not!</p>

- There seems to be a lot of people here talking about Wikis, and what to write and what not to write. What is the point!? Wouldn't it be more interesting to talk about something else? Like what people on these pages do for a living, or perhaps if there's a certain type of people who write things on these sites.</p>
<p>Having only just found out about these from a story on the BBC website - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3857621.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3857621.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3857621.stm</a> I thought the concept was fantastic. But instead of reading about all sorts of interesting opinions from around the world there's just a load of people saying what you should and shouldn't write...</p>

<dd>To me, this image seems ugly, but also unecessary. I don't see what this adds to the article - it seems to just clutter things up and screw up the minimalistic style of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwinxor_67b4.html" title="User:Twinxor">Twinxor</a> 20:28, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To me, the image is relevant, good-looking, and an enhancement to the article. I would also disagree that the Wikipedia is minimalistic; we do what we can to make our articles look good in spite of the technical limitations. But you might have expected that I would disagree with you--such is life.<br />
Do you see any way to rework the image so that the article is improved? --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a> 20:32, Sep 7, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose the main issue with the image is that it's distracting. The color, jumpy fonts, and prominent position on the left all draw one's focus away from the article. In this case the article is not encyclopedia content; rather, it's advice to editors, and it seems harmful to draw their attention from the important point being made. If you fix some of these issues, I think the image becomes less problematic.<br />
However, you should also consider what you are trying to say by including the image. Right now, it seems to just repeat the title (which sums up the whole point of the article). After a user has been referred here and has read the page title, does he really need a further repetition of the same title? Ultimately, I'm not sure that any image is appropriate here, because I don't think an image really illustrates the idea of being bold any better than text can. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwinxor_67b4.html" title="User:Twinxor">Twinxor</a> 22:56, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I doubt that the image's impact is as devastating as you describe it. I am also no more able to justify the image's inclusion on the article than I am able to justify the 10K Wikipedia logo in the upper-left corner--in both cases, they add nothing to the content, could easily be replaced with text, and are there simply because they look nice. Provided a webpage is accessible, I have no problem it looking good. The image is also an apt illustration of being bold (in my opinion): I saw a beautiful T-shirt design on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Wapcaplet" class="extiw" title="m:User:Wapcaplet">m:User:Wapcaplet</a>, asked him if he would mind if I put up on WP:BB, and there it is.<br />
For me, this is a trivial matter in the grand scheme of things. Do you seriously find the image to be so off-putting that it detracts from the message? If so, I'm afraid we'll be at odds and I will seek community consensus at the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village pump</a>. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a> 23:46, Sep 7, 2004 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Do you ever make significant changes to an article?</span></h2>
<p>I'm just curious, what do any of you do when you come across an article which you believe needs significant changes to its structure? Like if it restates facts, scatters facts under irrelevant sections, uses 'critics believe that...' too often, rambles, includes lots of citations which aren't relevant or noteworthy, or just generally has poor formatting - do you ever go in and rework an article significantly? If you do, how do you deal with previous editors who may get their nose bent out of shape that you redid their stuff?

<dd>I've reworked a couple of articles. Sometimes I just start rewriting it one paragraph at a time, adding a paragraph, and then later deleting the redundant parts in the rest of the article. Sometimes I just add all the missing pieces first, so grossly expanding the article that the previous text is in the minority. Then, later, the previous bits can be reworded, worked in, or just deleted. Either way, if your text is high quality, and no factual data is actually lost in the process, it'll probably stick, and hopefully fewer noses will be bent. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 03:42, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have also reworked a couple of articles. I think the following steps can be taken to minimise the risk of dispute -</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Check the article's history. If there is a frequent contributor or the article is clearly largely the work of one or two users, explain your plans on their talk page(s) - not to ask "permission", but just to keep them informed.</li>
<li>Explain your plans on the article's talk page and invite comments. Anyone watching the article will see this.</li>
<li>Re-write in stages. If a re-structuring is necessary, do this first, with minimal changes to existing text. Leave it for a day or two. Then tidy up existing text (spelling, grammar, style etc.) but keep the same content. Leave it for a day or two again. Then add all that new content that you have been itching to put in.</li>
<li>Try not to remove stuff - this is what often causes disputes. Clear factual errors should be removed, but other material can usually be incorporated in one way or another. POV stuff can be re-written as NPOV; bias can be balanced etc.</li>

<dd>I've seen the direct results of what the IBM study found, it isn't pretty. Some articles that started with text with factual errors continue to support those errors many edits later. I think people are afraid to edit it out. Frequently if the original text was disorganized, people just keep adding bits and pieces without ever actually restructuring it, leaving it a rambling mess. I've found myself doing this. It is much harder to rearrange and restructure a text than just add a few pieces. The original text will color the tone of the article long afterwards, even if it does not deserve to. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 04:41, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see what the issue was? The article is relatively informal, and is meant to be.. I don't really care that much, but just for future reference. Specifically, as much as I love wikipedia, I think one of the major weaknesses is that the writing style is so formulaic and drab. I think all the pressures to be NPOV and what-not (which I don't deny the importance of at all) have created a culture that is afraid to add any flair, humour or character to the content, in ways which aren't necessarily contradictory to the philosophy. Not that I'm claiming that this quote is the shining beacon of literature or anything, but nonetheless, isn't that what this page is partially about?
