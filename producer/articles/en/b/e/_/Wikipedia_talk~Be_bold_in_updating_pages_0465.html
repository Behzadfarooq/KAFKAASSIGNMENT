<p>I take issue with the header quotation of "Amateurs built the Ark, and professionals built the Titanic". First off, it has no relevance to the topic of this article. The article is talking about taking initiative in editing existing articles not creating new articles. Secondly, the quotation is misleading in that it compares fiction to fact. Just because a fictional person successfully designed and built a fictional boat that allegedly transported 2 of animal to a hilltop and some real engineers built a boat which sank does not imply that an average joe on the street can acomplish a difficult task. If people feel a quotation is necessary, it should be replaced with something like "Your opionion counts too!" to let people know that, if they disagree with the spelling, phrasing, or POV of an article, they should feel empowered enough to fix or comment of the topic. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeakerboy_c531.html" title="User:Beakerboy">Beakerboy</a> 21:22, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it should remain as it embodies the <i>spirit</i> of the guideline: just because you aren't a professional doesn't mean you have no chance (in this case, successfully adding to the encyclopedia). The fact that it compares fiction to reality is irrelevant, especially given the fact that, to many, the Ark is <i>not</i> fiction. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 21:41, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the purpose of this quote? Its removal is apparently contested, but I think its existence has yet to be justified. It is a rather odd quote, in my opinion. Who's it by? What POV is it trying to project? I, for example, do not believe in the mythology of the Ark and don't find the point being made about amateurs particularly deep. I am sure policies and guidelines can be illustrated better than with parables. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 23:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think 'don't be shy' sounds better than 'be bold.' To me, be bold sounds a little funny and people may think of it kind of awkwardly. But don't be shy to make contributions sounds more understandable and is used in our daily lives more. don't be shy to get something to drink people will say a lot for instance. But they don't say BE BOLD, get something to drink. Just a suggestion on how to make wikipedia a more lucid environment.</p>

<p>And I'm only half joking.</p>
<p>I understand the thought behind this guideline. In an ideal world, no, even in a pretty good world, it would be wonderful advice for all. It's excellent advice for a great number of people — perhaps even myself, though to claim this would be arrogant in view of my gut feeling that it's the <i>wrong</i> advice to hand out too eagerly.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, which I believe was once a pretty good article, is now a mess. It's not as bad as it might be partly because it <i>was</i> pretty good, and partly because a number of people have been busily patching up after moderately bold attempts to "improve" it by at least one well-intentioned but underprepared person. I'm only glad that he's not bolder. True, he hasn't been bold in the sense of refactoring the whole thing, but he's been bold in saying what he, as a Glaswegian (I think), <i>knows</i> to be true.</p>
<p>I didn't write this to knock the guy. He's just one case among many. In principle, yes, one could say that by pointing out that boldness must go hand in hand with NPoV, sourcing, etc., one avoids these risks. In practice, though, a significant number of people may read and digest what they want to, and no more; this can lead to a great amount of time being wasted by others.</p>
<p>I don't suggest that this guideline should be scrapped. But I do suggest that people should think thrice before urging it on a brand new editor. It does not belong in a welcome message. — <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 11:07, 2005 May 25 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it does say "be bold but not reckless". What it should really say is "be bold, but stop being bold if everyone disagrees with you." it's a matter of not being afraid of screwing up the page because it can always be reverted. It's not a matter of pushing your viewpoint on everyone. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 13:56, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, but what I'd like is "Stop, think, consider; remember that (i) this is an encyclopedia, not your soapbox even for what you may think is self-evident, and (ii) even what you're sure of could be wrong. Make few, tiny changes of which you are as confident as possible. Then make slightly more changes, or slightly bigger ones. Work only very slowly toward boldness." But that would be silly, really. After all, the people whose work suggests that they need such advice probably wouldn't read it. Much simpler: just don't go out of your way to urge people to be bold. — <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 14:51, 2005 May 25 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually thought "but don't be reckless" should have covered this. Not listening to other viewpoints and ignoring other editors' edits is a form of recklessness. This advice helps most newcomers out there, I was a newbie once myself, started back half a year ago was still rather "timid".</dd>

<p>I would like to register an objection to the promotion of this "Be Bold" policy as it stands. In general it's a worthy sentiment, but I believe it has more of a negative than a positive influence over disputes that involve Wikipedia's best articles. These articles, most but not all of which are enshrined as "Featured Articles", are often the result of long and careful collaboration, after which they have arrived at a high level of prose quality, detail, balance and optimal thematic progression. More and more we see editors, often new editors who tend to overestimate their current research and writing skills, leaping into Featured Articles (and other high quality pieces) and carrying out major overhauls. When challenged, their most frequent response is something like "I thought we were supposed to <b>be bold</b>!". And typically they go on to resist all efforts to scale back their overhauls, and not infrequently they are defended by Admins who perhaps have not given enough thought to the ramifications here. First, we have a serious downgrading of article quality. Second, and maybe as important, we have many topnotch editors who see their careful, recognized work thus scrambled and who then scale back their participation or leave the project altogether. Over time this will tend to make the pool of editors topheavy with bold but mediocre contributors, while the mature talents have moved on to less frustrating pastures. I implore Wikipedia Administrators and leading editors to take this problem seriously and to propose steps to counteract it. At a minimum, there should be forceful language on this page regarding major overhauls of Featured Articles. Discussion on Talk pages before such overhauls should be policy, and where there is a dispute there should be a presumption in favor of reversion. Other possibilities: an interstitial page that appears whenever the Save button is hit on a FA and the edit is anything other than an addition, with language urging conservatism in changes to FA; template language on FA Talk pages containing a specific caveat to "Be Bold" for FA pages, and similar… Perhaps this comment should have been made on the Talk page of this guideline page, but I opted to place it here because I believe the problem is quite pressing. I have no objection to moving this to Talk, but I would like to see proposed changes to this page straight off. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 21:56, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, you apparently don't see why. Let's try a trite analogy, Otron. Let's travel back many years and posit a gradeschool age Otron happily playing on the beach. Nearby, a gradeschool age Mdude, unacquainted with young master Otron, runs in and out of the surf. Just a few minutes back, young Mdude had been weeping from the effects of parental discipline: he had been running up the shoreline de-implanting people's sun umbrellas and flinging them into the tide. When the lifeguards returned him to his parents he yelled "But the umbrellas looked so pretty in the water! It's, it's a better ocean!" His punishment was to sit still on a beach chair for five minutes. At three minutes his mother was so moved, she gave him a snow cone to regale the remaining two minutes. It was about then that young Otron, a future engineer, began his sand castle. A minute later young Mdude was back zig-zagging along the surf, eventually zagging into the immediate vicinity of Otron. At this point Otron hadn't completed even one round tower. This was fortunate because at that moment Mdude said to himself "I will help him!". Help, to Mdude, meant he would demolish the existing structure, then sit beside Otron and construct the main castle while overseeing Otron's work on a few outbuildings. To Mdude, this was self-evidently the way it was to be done if a superior sand castle were to have any hope of rising. So Mdude halted next to Otron, said "Hi!", and drew back his foot to throw it through the one nascent sand tower. Otron, a quick boy, thought about seizing Mdude's ankle but said to himself "Achhh, I've hardly done anything yet. Why risk a fight over this?" (Otron felt confident he would prevail in such a contest, but maybe not without some contact, and he was prone to long nosebleeds). So flew Mdude's foot… Now fast rewind to the end of Mdude's ocean-improvement punishment. He's lapping up the last of his snow cone. But this time Otron had been at work for close to two hours already on his sand castle, nay, sand village. The castle was at the center, its tallest turret closer to the sun than Otron could jump. Eighteen windows, elongated arches with ledges, graced this turret alone. I could go on. The detail was stunning. It was a vista unto itself. It seemed a shame no sand people could be animated there, it was such a beautifully made place to live, complete with reflecting pools and a zoo with elephants and giraffes. Now up steps Mdude. He says "Hi!" and draws back his foot. Otron barely thinks about seizing the ankle before he does!</dd>

<dd>You should be bold in editing articles whether in the main namespace or the Wikipedia: namespace, including guidelines and featured articles, but not reckless. If someone reverts your changes you need to discuss it with them on the talk page and get a consensus going instead of revert warring.

If you want another third opinion, you can have mine. I don't think a guidleine page should be edited to make a point in a dispute. If you seek to protect featured articles from the being bold guideline then you should make a proposal and list it on RFC and the village pump. I will now remove this listing from third opinion's once again, as I have given a third opinion.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a>, is this a fair summary of what you would like to have added to the page?</p>
<p>Featured Articles are articles which have been edited to such an extent that the wikipedia community believe they are of the highest standard. Therefore major edits to these pages should be discussed on the featured article's talk page before being enacted. However, this should not stop you correcting minor mistakes. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> 09:04, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Steve, I did not consider the statements by JYolkowski and Omegatron to be "third opinions" as such, because they centered on a procedural point (whether my changes to the guideline were prudent while a relevant article dispute was ongoing), rather than centering on the merits of the changes themselves. Your own statement also centers on this procedural point (personally I see nothing wrong with editing a guideline during a dispute– that's when the issues are freshest in the mind and every edit to guidelines and policies is a form of advocacy anyway, does it matter so much how close in time they are to related disputes?).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, you can consider these "third opinions" if you like, but it would be much more satisfying to see opinions on the merits… Also, your summary is a good one. What do you plan to do with it? <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 09:36, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if everyone else in the dispute feels it accurately sums up the position, it could be made into a proposal. Until that point, do not edit the <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages</a> page. As for the third opinions, the point in dispute was whether you were right to edit <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages</a> to prove a point, and third opinions weighed in on that point.

<dd><b>"As for the third opinions, the point in dispute was whether you were right to edit Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages to prove a point, and third opinions weighed in on that point. No-one discussed the merits of your changes because you never gave them an opportunity."</b> How's that? I'm the one who called for a third opinion, and I asked the opinion to be on which version should stand, Mdude's or mine. I said nothing about whether I ought to have made any edit because I firmly believe there's nothing wrong with someone in a dispute working on relevant guidelines and poilicies. How did I not give an opportunity? That's the only opportunity I thought I was giving... Anyway, I won't edit <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages</a> for the nonce and, yes, I would like to see your summation made into a proposal.

<li>But Mdude's version is the original version, so you were basically asking if you were right in altering it, which is what you were given an opinion on.

<dd>Well it seems I have an objection to everything you say. Sorry 'bout that, but I can only say what I think. I don't believe my edit of Be Bold at all equates to the sorts of edits I am saying one should not make lightly and without discussion. For one thing, the Be Bold page isn't a FA. More importantly, my edit to it was very limited– basically an expansion of two sentences and a small additional sentence to another paragraph. This can in no way be called an "overhaul", and my main beef is with people who trundle in and perform all-at-once, undiscussed overhauls to FAs. Plus, I did discuss proposed changes on this Talk page first. So, no, I was not basically asking if I was right to alter Be Bold. It's totally separate from the issue of massive, undiscussed changes to FAs. I was asking if my alteration should stand on its own merits. The only person who had a problem with it for upwards of a week was Mdude, who, it should be clear by now, was pressing his own agenda at least as much as any I was pressing... Also, you had been saying "we" can put together a proposal, list it and build consensus. Now you seem to be backing off from involvement, saying I can go ahead if I wish. I would appreciate your help and support with it, if you still feel you can give it. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 18:39, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>I have again restored the long-existing guideline. As user:Omegatron said not so long ago in an earlier round of this dispute, " If you want to change a guideline that's been unchanged for a year, you need to get a consensus on the talk page first. Revert warring, especially a guideline, extra especially when changing it to a version that supports your position in another dispute, will get you nowhere.

<dd>I do not recognize you or Omegatron as authorities. My changes have merit to me. Those who dispute that merit may do so, and if the consensus is against me I will relent. You are simply another editor, not a one-person project-wide consensus, as you seem to see yourself as. Guidelines are not FA, and my simple one-sentence addition is not at all comparable to the radical all-at-once overhauls you try to equate it with. Also, your anon reversions are becoming too numerous to keep pawning off as "inadvertent". Instead, they are looking like intentional acts to subvert the 3RR. Any more anon reversions from this point will be considered grounds for new formal mediation. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 15:08, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightMonkey_f586.html" title="User:NightMonkey">NightMonkey</a> 09:36, September 4, 2005 (UTC): Just dropped in on <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">Be Bold</a> and saw that it was under dispute. I think that this proposed addition doesn't add any more clarity than the "...but don't be reckless!" section. The extant text seems explanatory enough. [NightMonkey, I ask you to reconsider. The "don't be reckless" section as it exists now limits itself to long articles on controversial topics. A top-notch Featured Article on a non-controversial topic should also be radically changed only after discussion, don't you think?

<li>While I agree with JDG's sentiment (that making big changes to a featured article is <i>usually</i> a bad thing to do), I agree with Nightmonkey that it's already covered by the "don't be reckless" part of this rule. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 00:04, September 6, 2005 (UTC) [But, Raul, as I note in my comment to Nightmonkey, the "don't be reckless" section specifically limits itself to controversial topics! <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 00:14, 6 September 2005 (UTC)]

<dd>Yes! Excellent. Would you consider amending your comment to include a mention of the need to discuss changes to FA beforehand? Something like "In addition, making large-scale, <b>undiscussed</b> changes to Featured articles, which are recognized as Wikipedia's best articles for their completeness, accuracy, and neutrality, is often a bad idea." Even if you decline to add this, your addition to the guideline is sufficient for me and if the editor who was revert warring will now desist I think the editing block may as well be lifted. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 00:37, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree that prior discussion is an unreasonable requirement to impose. I have seen reasonable and productive changes made to featured articles without prior discussion and to the benefit of the article. As a matter of policy, I'd rather not add mandatory overhead to that, which may preclude such edits. Just as is the case anywhere else in wikipedia, people should undertake the good faith efforts on both sides to hash out issues and improve the article collaboratively. Prior consent or discussion does not itself guarantee that good faith will be established with the new members of the editing community for a particular article, who are essential to the viability of Wikipedia. If, on the other hand, people quickly step up and clearly state the substance of their objections, then you're much more likely to keep the article intact and its editing community healthy. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 10:48, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly disagree, especially in cases where another Wikipedian is asking to discuss. Obviously it would be different on a low-traffic article where a potential overhauler cannot even flag down anybody's attention. Raul654's proposed addition is a good start, and I plan to press this in other policies and perhaps its own policy, including a strong recommendation to talk beforehand when there are other active editors. <a href="../../../j/d/g/User%7EJDG_ec32.html" title="User:JDG">JDG</a> 13:17, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As is the case with any other article if you end up with a dispute, you take it to the talk page. If you don't see a response on the article talk page, go to the user's talk page. If that fails, you ask for page protection. What I think would be useful would be some additional mechanisms within wikipedia to help mediate contentious editing. Specifically:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The entry cannot be directly edited.</li>
<li>A parallel page exists for editing purposes.</li>
<li>Changes made to body of the parallel page are automatically propagated to the article after one day. Tag changes and interwiki links to the parallel page are propagated after one hour.</li>
<li>The edit button on the entry takes you to the parallel page, which allows you to edit but explains the editing process.</li>
<li>The parallel page has a cumulative diff view that lets you see all pending changes (the last twenty-four hours), the editors for the changes, and when they were committed to the parallel page.</li>
<li>A revert viewer in the same diff view that shows you where you've have diffs reverted, who's done the reverts, and when (including repeated reverts).</li>
<li>The entry and the parallel page share a talk page.</li>
<li>Two reverts to the parallel page without citing vandalism or an accompanying entry on the talk page, referenced in the edit comments results in a 36 hour ban from editing the parallel page, including reverts. Three misidentifications of vandalism (i.e. calling content disputes vandalism) in a month, and you're banned from reverting the page for a week. (No gaming the system!)</li>
<li>You should get this automatically if you're an FA or after or in lieu of a page protection request.</li>
<li>Expedited resolution process by way of "lesser" mediation, along the lines of a third opinion pool, managed by a pool of admins. You are free to appeal, but the caveat would be that appeals over user conduct can be contested and blocked by the handler of the third opinion if they believe you have outstanding issues of good faith or civility (i.e. you must go to Canossa first; no gaming the system over these conduct fundamentals, whether you are the accused or the accuser). In cases of bad faith editing (i.e. unsupported changes), the lesser mediator can refer you to can refer you to "lesser" arbitration, which can ban you from editing an entry for up to one month, with one week being the preferred restriction. All of these mechanisms are for behaviour or content issues specific to a single entry. Other dispute mechanisms that believe that conduct or content entries are effectively specific to an entry can require disputing parties to use these mechanisms first. It would be nice if we had a capacity for private exchange pages between mediators and disputings parties so that we didn't have to resort to IRC.</li>

This would, of course, require a non-zero chunk of developer time. <a href="../../../b/u/f/User%7EBuffyg_c61f.html" title="User:Buffyg">Buffyg</a> 14:33, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would you consider not adding this change in light of its potential for abuse in the hands of a stubborn editor like user:JDG, who wants to use it to "claim ownership" over articles and deter others from contributing? I'm not the only editor he's been trying to push out of his "territory"; e.g., "The primary author of this long-Featured article is GWO. I have been the secondary author. We will need more than the whim of Zoso Jade and TacoDeposit to overturn this long accepted intro paragraph. Reinstating references.

<dd>Mdude, someday you'll understand the difference between a longtime contributing editor exercising a balanced care for the ongoing quality of an article and a truly antisocial editor who "claims ownership".

<dd>I don't see the same potential for abuse that you do. To use the example you cite, changing a paragraph does not really qualify as "large-scale changes" in my opinion. For that matter, as you point out, there's already a policy specifically that covers this sort ouf situation (the no ownership policy) that prohibits that sort of not-made-here mentality. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 01:47, September 6, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I still disagree with the change, which I don't think will surprise anybody. As the editing disputes that I and others have had with the editor who's repeatedly pushed for a change (never coming close to consensus support) of this sort show, it's, unfortunately, more likely to be used to abuse the editing process than to improve articles. I also think it doesn't take into account the way an FA can change after the initial designation, and an underlying process -- would, necessarily, an article still have been accepted by consensus as an FAif the designation carried more constrictive criteria about future editing? <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 00:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There's nothing "constrictive" (btw, though "constrictive" is a word, "constricting" is probably what you wanted-- I don't note this just to be a wiseguy: it's an example of the kind of thing you do to articles). Raul's addition urges care. It would only be constricting to ego-driven self-proclaimed experts who want to barge in and totally overhaul an existing FA in one undiscussed shot.

<p>Does anyone know if there is some sort of group or official Association that has this policy as it's base? Something analogous to a Wikipedia:JETFA Association (Just Edit the [Pick the "F-ing" of your choice] Article Association)?

<dd>That's because if your edits are not clearly an improvement, or worse, a "de-provement", obviously your edits will get reverted. People are allergic to poor edits.

<dd>Although I have experience with wikis in general, I have little experience with wikipedia, so take this with a grain of salt. That being said, I disagree with Mandel that "be bold but only if you know what you are doing" is an optimal policy for wiki. Many people new to wiki are too timid to make many or even any edits at all, because they are unsure if they know what they are doing, and countering that fear is one of the purposes of "Be Bold".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In your specific case, I think it is possible that the <b>be bold</b> policy is not in conflict with the fact that your edits are often reverted. That is, yes, you were bold, and yes, the edits were reverted -- and that is exactly what was supposed to happen. Most newcomers get reverted a few times. In doing so, you learned more about how to write the kind of content that the wikipedia community wants. Eventually you will become a seasoned wikipedian and will contribute content that will not get reverted. This makes it worth it to you to spend the time on those first few edits, even knowing that they may get reverted, and it makes it worth it for others to spend the time reverting your content.

<p>The Be Bold policy has been used so often, I think <i>now</i> is the time for a "Verify your facts before you update" policy. Reason?

It's not a matter of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, but a matter of how much you bother to confirm something before you update.

<dd>As a newby here, it strikes me that all of the various opportunities to contribute - article, discussion/talk, etc. - provide a swirl of interaction. Like a variation of the entropy in Brownian movement, we reach a steady state of discussion intensity on a subject, if only for a given time. Interest wanes, the more vigorous or persuasive or authoritative prevail, and on we go to another area of interest. Different levels of mental and emotional discipline are seen: some use the talk page well, asking others to vet their contribution, and then they move it into the article. Others do not. But wikipedia is not a zero-sum game, nor is its rest entropy level zero: it achieves a non-zero steady state, fueled by the interests and passions of its contributors, and that is its charm and achievement.</dd>

<dd>I am not a wikipedia old-timer but I'd like to say I agree strongly with Mandel, and I think something along the lines which he suggests should be added to this page. This is an encyclopaedia, of sorts. It is important not to write something in an encyclopaedia which has not been verified. Since there are "talk" pages available, there is no reason not to put your contribution on a talk page until someone has the time to verify it and promote it into the encyclopaedia.

<dd>There's been an ongoing dispute on this guideline, over the extent to which what sort of changes should call for talk page activity before the changes can be implemented, and which set of articles such a standard should apply to. Proposals to change the existing guideline, brought forward under the existing policy/practice of requiring Talk activity and consensus before making any significant alteration to the guideline have failed. Most recently, in September, a proposal requiring Talk activity/consensus before major changes to Featured Articles failed by roughly a 2:1 margin. The change under dispute was first added on October 20 by user:Mandel, without complying with the page guideline calling for prior discussion. The change would apply a requirement for prior Talk activity before major changes to any article. I think it is fair to say that the resolution of the September proposal, with a clear majority of editors finding such a requirement too drastic to apply to Featured Articles, also shows a consensus against applying a similar requirement to the entire universe of Wikipedia articles. With that background, I don't believe the guideline should be changed without the sort of notice, discussion and opportunities to participate in discussion that accompanied previous proposals. This change was initially made without even an edit summary. [For background, see in particular section 9 ("Poll") on this talk page as well as sections 3, 4, 5, and 8. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 22:58, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Carnildo. Both sides keep saying(I paraphrase slightly), "There's no consensus against what I'm doing. Stop reverting me." However, there was no consensus to make the change they keep arguing either. There was no consensus either way. This means we default to the version before the change. For policies and guidelines, (quite in contrast to the spirit of "Be bold", which is for articles), there must be consensus before adding something major. It is not acceptable to add something then try to keep it there, which is what happened here. As far as I can tell, no changes following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Be_bold_in_updating_pages&amp;oldid=25271666" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Be_bold_in_updating_pages&amp;oldid=25271666" rel="nofollow">this revision</a> have been proposed on talk.

As you can see, there is not even an edit summary.

<p>I'm probably rehashing arguments above, but it seems to me that if an article is reasonably complete (and I don't mean only FA's) and has stabilized over a long period of time (let's say six months), major reworks should be cleared in the discussion area first. It's hurtful to the craft of an article's earlier drafters to have all the work drastically changed without a discussion of the proposed changes first. I think the Wikipedia will drive away many of its best editors if in cases of major, stabilized work, it can be drastically changed without involving the previous editors. In law, we have precedent, and in an encyclopedia, it seems to me, we should have some sort of respect for longstanding material. This is not to say that article upheavals should not take place, but only that those who want to make such major changes should do so in a civil, respectful manner. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><span style="color:green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 20:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've encountered this problem on RC patrol stevie. I see a page that has been well established, and looking at the history I see many contributors have combined to make a good article. Then, an anonymous editor rewrites the whole thing in an apparently NPOV manner. The question is, its such a big upheaval, and I am faced with the question - do I revert? Usually I would, and explain to the anon that big changes to an article that is considered good, need to be discussed on the talk page first, as the anon's edit may not appear to be in consensus with anything that the previous editors agreed on.

<dd>I have some experience with wikis, but little with wikipedia, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I have basically the same answer here as I had above, in "Practice and Preach". I'll copy it (see next paragraph), but first, to give a straightforward answer to your question "whenever I have been "bold", I got f—ed over by the Government fiends here. Isn't that what should not happen?": no, that actually is what should happen -- "be bold" means don't be afraid to make a suggestion initially -- but ultimately, you are supposed to defer to the consensus of more experienced community members.</dd>

<dd>Yes, you were bold, and yes, the edits were reverted -- and that is exactly what was supposed to happen. Most newcomers get reverted a few times. In doing so, you learned more about how to write the kind of content that the wikipedia community wants. Eventually you will become a seasoned wikipedian and will contribute content that will not get reverted. This makes it worth it to you to spend the time on those first few edits, even knowing that they may get reverted, and it makes it worth it for others to spend the time reverting your content.

<p>Ok, BUT, I got reverted twice, before what I wanted on the article page was worked out, consensually. This caused me bad feeling, as a new person. Isnt the 3RR rule something to be considered? Or do I misunderstand the 3RR. If I as a new person make a section addition, and it has some value to the page, shouldn't some of what I added, remain? I mean it all worked out great, I am just wondering about in general. I am just trying to understand the bounds of adding to a front page and discussing it first. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiaison1_bea6.html" title="User:Liaison1">Liaison1</a> 23:44, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

You sound very positive about being bold, and very hesitant about bold-revert-discuss. It would help if you could give me a brief summary of your thoughts. My point is that an alternative to my changes to Be Bold may be to edit the introduction of bold-revert-discuss in order to put some emphasis on its deadlock-breaking properties as opposed to advertizing it as a general approach. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvB_e6f8.html" title="User talk:AvB"><small>talk</small></a> 11:15, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The thing is, a lot of wikipedia guidelines were written before some silly person decided that we needed "TEH OFFISSIOL POLISY" thing.&#160;:-P So oddly enough, a large number of our essays and guidelines are actually more binding than most of our policies. This is not the official written line, for sure, but in practice that's how it is. Be Bold is in fact a key principle in the use of a wiki. Without it, we could just go back to nupedia.&#160;:-P <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 13:18, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In reading through the above, there is but 'one' editor (I may have missed one, but I was looking hard) that mentioned <b>talk pages</b> in the context of FA page changes...</p>
<ul>
<li>It strikes me that a guideline like this is the very place to inculcate the caution and habit and good practices of <b>perusing an article talk</b> and examining <b>an articles history</b> <i>before making any changes</i> besides the simplest copyedits. Bold can be good, but not if it puts your foot on a land mine.</li>
<li>The burnt hand teaches best and I learned that important lesson by making a innocent logical seeming edit on <a href="../../../t/s/u/Tsushima_Island_4974.html" title="Tsushima Island">Tsushima Island</a> back last June, and hence suddenly found myself in the middle of an edit war. (I think it's listed in Lamest Edit Wars Ever, but that inclusion was over and about (a 'sub-war') the renaming/move issue and debate—the real edit war was far nastier.) That article is still unsettled the last time I checked <s>three weeks back</s> just now. User:Mr Tan seems to have worn out all the other opponents from then and made it in his own image after all. (re: RFC/Mr Tan, June 05, iirc)</li>
<li>Sorry for the digression—bad memories!</li>
</ul>
<p>In summation, <b>I think this page should have some strong advice on these two practices</b>. It may not be the best place either, but similar instruction at least in link form is needed on edit summaries that are clear and track significant template additions such as any and all creating a banner 'box' in the article (e.g. the ubiquitous 'CLEAN'), but especially likely contentious one's like NPOV ( <a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html#Here.27s_the_rest_of_the_story" title="User talk:Celestianpower">A case study</a>). At least this way the injunction to be 'BOLD' is balanced by a note of caution and on professionalism. <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 06:26, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How this page is interpreted by new Wikipedia users depends heavily on their preconceived notions about the project. Many new users assume that since <i>anyone can edit</i>, Wikipedia must be a free webspace provider. They think they can set up their own pages and publish anything they want. When their pages are proposed for deletion (or speedied), they often become very angry and feel that their "freedom of speech" has been violated. On the other hand, there are a lot of great potential contributors who read Wikipedia and might not ever consider editing an article unless someone encourages them to be bold. I know I would have never even tried to edit a page if I hadn't seen WP:BOLD. It gave me the confidence I needed to update some articles, and I was soon drawn into the Wikipedia community. Anyway, I think the page does a fairly good job of saying "<b>...but don't be reckless</b>." Of course, it is impossible to explain in such a short space exactly what is acceptable and what should be discussed first, partly because some new users have rather extreme preconceived notions. We might consider adding a couple tips about gauging the <b>boldness</b> of an edit to a contriversial or highly visible page, as you suggest. But we don't need to let this page grow too long. It needs to be kept prety short so that newcomers will take the time to read all of it. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#CD6600;">Tantalum</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#000080;">T</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_Esperanza_ed66.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride/Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#000080;">lluride</span></a> 16:01, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After watching the A&amp;E presentation of The Bible Codes, I was in awe that no one mentioned the possibility of human time travel. Either the goverment/military has or is about to invent a working prototype of a machine that is capable of transporting living matter through space and time in either direction, this is probable fact based on unclassified military experiments and basic human nature. <b>What if</b> the number one best selling book of all time was created by a small team of experts ie. one special ops decoding officer, Sir Isaac Newton for wisdom and maybe even Shakespere to dictate to an ancient rabbi prehaps John the baptist...who knows? The point is that if we had the means at our disposal...would'nt it make perfect sence to try to ensure the preservation of man by re-working the Bible in hopes that the codes are discovered in time to save us from ourselves?</p>

<p>Just noticing how the <b>Be Bold</b> guideline basically says "Be Bold" and then goes on to explain how slow, careful, deliberate and moderate editing is the best method... when you're being bold that is. The whole guideline really doesn't sit well with the title, in my opinion. If I were to be bold on this one, I'd slap a "<i>This article seems to contradict itself</i>" template on it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a> 20:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Be bold. Unless you're bucking the status quo. Now, that's a pretty bold statement, isn't it? How about this: We should have different criteria for those pages that are factual issues (history of russia) versus those that are based upon something else (best tasting type of tomato). Or even more bold: Anything in an encyclopedia that has anything to do with current events, politics, science, religion, public policy or similiar opinion-based articles is going to be hammered if you don't agree with the clique that controls the direction of those pages. But that's such a slippery slope. So I'll go back to slow careful deliberate moderate editing. --<a href="../../../s/l/n/User%7ESln3412_14b9.html" title="User:Sln3412">Sln3412</a> 03:44, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the page—as far as it goes: Be bold in making <i>initial edits</i>. But what if you are reverted? The page touches on this in the paragraph beginning “If you expect or see a disagreement with your version of the article….” But I think it needs to be clearer. Some editors (particularly newbies) take it as an open invitation to be bold in conducting a revert war. I propose the addition of a few words to following effect:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If someone reverts your change, do not revert back. Instead discuss your change on the talk page. Try to understand and accommodate the objections.</dd>

<p>Currently, the end of the page says, "Such edits will not survive. The "correctness" or "truthfulness" of the edit is irrelevant at this point.". I think that is misspoken. It is not the case that Wikipedia's goal is anything other than for the encyclopaedia to contain correct and truthful information. Perhaps the writer meant that, as a practical matter, if a participant is stubborn in a revert war, they are decreasing the chance of their edits surviving -- and that, rather than relying on the truth of one's edits and praying that truthfulness will magically protect them even if you are being stubborn, a better strategy is not to be stubborn.</p>
<p>Also, it is the case that, as a practical matter stemming from the fact that different people disagree about what is correct, the best way to achieve the ultimate goal of maximizing truth is to compromise.</p>
<p>To put it another way, it is not rational for each participant to enforce their viewpoint via a revert war -- you may think that this is ok for you to do because you are correct and your opponent is incorrect, and you want the correct content to be on the page -- however, you must realize that your opponent may believe that you are incorrect and they are correct. In this case, if both of you follow the revert strategy, you can see that there will be trouble. However, if both of you follow the compromise strategy, there is less trouble. Therefore, it is rational for the community to force all participants to talk to each other and try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>Also, it is certainly not the case that Wikipedia aspires to decide which content goes on which page based on the popularity of the submitter rather than the truth of the content (although, being fallible beings, certainly this will happen from time to time). It needs to be clear that, should there be a disagreement over content, it is perfectly okay for one participant to argue for a particular edit on the grounds that it is true --- as long as that participant ultimately compromises if others disagree.</p>
<p>But I think it is important for the original text to be removed -- it must always be clear that Wikipedia's goal is, in fact, correct and truthful content. Bayle Shanks 01:02, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>dear wiki community,</p>
<p>i am new to this, but whilst reading the excellent speed of light article, noticed that the speed of light is written incorrectly.</p>
<p>in the first definition, where it says the speed of light is <i>exactly</i> 300....km per sec, there is a comma where there should be a full stop and so the definition is 300 million rather than 300 thousand km per second ...... regards, harry white</p>
<dl>
<dd>many apologies, the speed of light is correct in metres per second ...... harry white</dd>

<p>Roughly 75% of the text in the Be Bold article is instructions on how not to be bold. If we want people to be bold, then we should have an actual essay on that, with a few caveats. Not an article full of caveats, with a brief paragraph on being bold. Perhaps the "don't be reckless" section could become its own essay, if we don't already have one on that topic, with a link to it here and a mere paragraph on that remaining here. I'd make such a change myself, but per this article, that would be far, far too bold. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 04:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
