	    <p><i><b>Before the Fact</b></i> is a 1932 novel by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Berkeley_43a5.html" title="Anthony Berkeley">Anthony Berkeley</a> writing as Francis Iles.</p>
<p>Iles' novel is experimental in that it is <b>not</b> a <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whodunit.html" title="Whodunit">whodunit</a>: It does not take long to determine the identity of the villain and his motives. According to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Dexter_4335.html" title="Colin Dexter">Colin Dexter</a>, <i>Before the Fact</i> is a "<a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_fiction.html" title="Crime fiction">crime novel</a>" rather than a "<a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_fiction.html" title="Detective fiction">detective novel</a>", Iles being "the father of the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_suspense_novel.html" title="Psychological suspense novel">psychological suspense novel</a> as we know it today". It is true that the police do not play any role in the book; none of the characters is ever charged with a crime, let alone <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indictment.html" title="Indictment">indicted</a> for or convicted of one.</p>

<p><i>Before the Fact</i> is the story of Lina, a "born victim". She is raised in the country in the early decades of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> and, at 28, she is still a virgin and in danger of becoming an old spinster. She finds country life with her parents rather boring, and only lives for strangers that might be passing through or that have been invited by someone living in or near their village. When the novel opens, such a stranger has just arrived: 27 year-old Johnnie Aysgarth, from an impoverished family who are, as she is told, "of rotten stock". General McLaidlaw, Lina's father, is opposed to the marriage, and everyone seems to know that all that Johnnie is after is Lina's money. Lina herself has been told from an early age that Joyce, her younger sister, got the looks and she got the brains.</p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties, Lina and Johnnie get married after only a short engagement. They go to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> on their honeymoon, where they stay at the best hotels and dine at the best restaurants, and, on their return, move into an eight-bedroom house in London. Only six weeks later, Johnnie, who is jobless, admits to his wife that they have been living on borrowed money and that it has run out. Gradually, unwillingly, Lina takes charge of the couple's finances and suggests that Johnnie get a regular job. They leave the expensive house and move to the country; they settle down in a part of <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset.html" title="Dorset">Dorset</a> where they do not know anybody and start living in a more modest house. For the time being, they rely entirely on Lina's <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allowance.html" title="Allowance">allowance</a>. Reluctantly, Johnnie takes a job as the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steward.html" title="Steward">steward</a> of a large <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estate_%28house%29.html" title="Estate (house)">estate</a> of a Captain Melbeck. Lina always wanted to have children, but, as it turns out, she never gets pregnant.</p>
<p>As time goes by, Lina gradually learns that Johnnie is a crook. Apart from being a compulsive liar, he turns out to be</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theft.html" title="Theft">thief</a>: During a tennis party, he steals an expensive diamond belonging to one of the guests and, soon afterwards, a piece of Lina's own jewelry. Also, he sells Lina's four <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Hepplewhite_83ac.html" title="George Hepplewhite">Hepplewhite</a> chairs to an antique shop in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bournemouth.html" title="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>.</li>
<li>a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgery.html" title="Forgery">forger</a>: He forges Lina's signature and cashes one of her cheques.</li>
<li>an <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embezzlement.html" title="Embezzlement">embezzler</a>: He embezzles Captain Melbeck's money to pay his gambling debts. Luckily, Melbeck doesn't <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosecution.html" title="Prosecution">prosecute</a>.</li>
<li>an <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adulterer</a>: During their marriage, he has affairs with many women and village girls, including Lina's best friend, Janet Caldwell - he has a flat in Bournemouth especially for that purpose - and Ella, their parlour maid, by whom he has a son.</li>
<li>eventually, a <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murderer</a>: He incites General McLaidlaw to do a trick involving chairs while he and Lina are staying with the General for Christmas. This is too much physical exercise for the General, and he dies suddenly. Some years later, Johnnie cheats a rich school friend of his, Beaky Thwaite, out of his money by traveling incognito to Paris with him, going to a brothel and having him drink a whole beaker of brandy in one gulp so that he drops dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Lina's own death will be Johnnie's first "real" murder. He goes to great lengths to conceive a undetectable murder. When Isobel Sedbusk, the author of detective stories, happens to spend the summer in their village, he associates with her and, on the pretext of discussing material for her new book, elicits a new method of murder from her: swallowing an <a href="../../../a/l/k/Alkali.html" title="Alkali">alkali</a> commonly used, but never suspected of being poisonous, and which leaves no trace in the human body for a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-mortem.html" title="Post-mortem">post-mortem</a> to find. At the very end of the novel, Lina, who really seems to have gone mad, catches the flu. She has been waiting for her husband to try to murder her for months now. When he brings her a drink, she swallows it deliberately, knowing that it is a poisonous cocktail. Johnny is going to get away with it ("People did die of influenza."), which is what Lina, so much in love with her husband, hopes will happen.</p>
<p>The novel covers a period of approximately ten years: Johnnie Aysgarth's <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtship.html" title="Courtship">courtship</a> of, and marriage to, Lina McLaidlaw, the disintegration of their marriage and her imminent death - although it is uncertain that she is really going to die. The whole story is told from Lina Aysgarth's point of view. We know everything she does and everything she thinks. On the other hand, we know practically nothing about the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain.html" title="Villain">villain</a> except for what Lina sees and gathers, creating more <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspense.html" title="Suspense">suspense</a>.</p>
