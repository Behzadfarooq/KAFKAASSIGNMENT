<dd><code>The advent of wireless communications, radar, and satellite navigation meant that the unexplained disappearances largely ceased at some point in the 20th Century. The occasional vessel still sinks, but rarely without a trace.</code> This section would seem to be POV and vague: "at some point" is not at all precise, and glosses over Gian Quasar's 2003 book which contains lists of missing aircraft &amp; vessels which Quasar asserts were researched from various official sources (US Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force etc). Quasar also lists a number of missing vessels from 1999-2001 over at <a href="http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/recent_statistics.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/recent_statistics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/recent_statistics.html</a> (however he notes that the list must be "treated with caution" and mentions a number of reasons for this). The 2005 SCi-Fi channel documentary, too, claims various craft have gone missing since the turn of the 21st Century. The documentary also plays a couple of recordings taken of the final radio calls from aircraft pilots who went missing.. "The advent of wireless communications" certainly does not mean that unexplained disappearances were suddenly a thing of the past -the recordings can lead to speculations, but those aired in the documentary did not contain any specific mention by the pilots that their aircraft was actually in the process of crashing- and yet they are missing and wreckage has either not been found or is inconclusive (swept away by Gulf Stream currents, perhaps?). While suspending judgement on the validity of Quasar's work (I want to examine his book first-hand), his website on the matter and the Sci-Fi Channel's documentary certainly contain some plausible points and should at least be mentioned in the article body to give a more balanced POV.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Oceanic flatulence</span></h2>
<p>I don't particularly like the term, but in the interest of NPOV I'm leaving it in. I felt it was in better taste to at least provide a source for the term. An Altavista search gives 17 hits. Skeptic's Dictionary is the only one that appeared to claim copyright to the page containing the term (SD claims copyright to all content on the site). So that's the one I'm citing, but it is of course possible that someone else coined the term first... <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharm_074a.html" title="User:Charm">Charm</a> 22:49, Nov 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">I don't buy this theory</span></h3>
<p>I don't think this is a sound theory. First, even though methane is "lighter" than air at sea level, if large quantities are to be released, it will rise until the it reaches an altitude where it shares the same density than air. This, therefore, will not affect the lift of the aeroplane, or any instrumentation, including altimeter (which operates based on ambient pressure, not so much air pressure).</p>
<p>What may be harmful, is that large quantity is released, and is mixed with air at a proportion that is combustable. The engine of the plane (as well as lightening) may set it off. This, however, is highly unlikely, as constant bulk air movement will always make sure that the mixture is too lean to burn. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_weisser_fc1d.html" title="User:Bart weisser">Bart weisser</a> 23:01, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't buy the atmospheric methane part either. I have never seen a credible reference associated with this theory. Unless I see opposition, at some point I will come back and delete it. --129.173.105.28 21:55, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to place an opinion on whether this is the right explaination or not, but I think the idea is that a methane bubble rising to the surface of the water and then through the air can swallow a ship or plane which was unfortunate enough to fly through it at the moment. I <i>don't</i> think there's any suggestion that the bubble would sit there for a long period of time. -PK9 09:18, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could it be possible that it isn't that the methane burns or lightens the air, but rather that it causes the engines to stall? I believe it has been proven that it takes no more than 1% methane content in the air to cause <i>that</i> particular rotary airplane engine to stall. Besides the engine exhaust does not get hot enough to combust the methane, even if it was in enough of a concentration. There was a program on the Discovery Channel on 3/23/06 about the methane theory. --65.190.140.201 04:04, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>YES</b> Methane would disperse in air, and it would have an effect on the air, there may be a sudden upwind filled with gas. A pilot unaware and using a WWII kind of airplane (no jet engines) suddenly got his airplane in an unstable colmn wind. And as they didnt fly that fast in those days it would be enough to turn it over. If a pilot would fly down it also wouldn't see the sea, since the gas rapidly creates dust around the area due to depresurasation when going out of the water. The pilot might think he goes up to the clouds. So suddenly thumbling in an airplane which had allready bad navigation devices in those days. He would slam right into the sea or get lost later. One might wonder then how could the gas erupt well thats because th area is also vulcanic active. This can result in rapid heating and melting of the hydrated gas below. eruptions are sudden and masive localy, and posibly even mixed with oter vulcanic (acid) gasses.</dd>

<p>The bubble of methane idea has been used to explain the <i>finding</i> of a disappeared trawler in the North Sea. the ship, which had been lost for several years, was found upright and undamaged on the sea bed. It has been postulated that a bubble of methane, perhaps disturbed by a minor quake, rose into the water, churning into a foam which would be unable to support a ship's weight. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 21:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Sign your posts, please.</i> I agree with the critique of the first line you cited. I think it's symptomatic of the weakness of this article as it now stands. The overall tone does not sound detached or analytical but alternately embraces both sides of the "argument" without presenting much evidence. The fact is that the "Bermuda triangle" has been pretty throughly debunked and Berlitz, the source of many of the accounts on which the legend is based, has been thoroughly discredited. There is no mention of this in the article, however (Berlitz wrote a lot of far-fetched books in the 1970s, all of which have been torn apart by serious researchers armed with empirical facts), and like Erich Von Daniken (who was similarly discredited), people seem to be re-embracing this folderol. The "Bermuda triangle mystery" is only a mystery to people who are not aware of the facts. The article should be presenting this not as a possible reality but as a myth or legend, discuss why it became popular mythology in the 1970s, and detail how it was debunked. There should be no room for far-fetched supposition like the bit about methane bubbles. The overarching truth -- presented in several places in the article but worthy of more prominent presentation -- is that <i>ships and planes do not disappear in the "triangle" any more frequently or mysteriously than they do anywhere else in the world</i>, and the handful of incidents popularly cited as "proof" (such as Flight 19) are not at all mysterious in light of substantiated fact. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 17:36, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The information about the torpedo bomber is incorrect. The Avenger weighed five tons empty and would sink like a rock.</p>
<p>Critical to understanding what may have happened is that the flight leader thought he was over the Florida Keys. It has been proposed he mistook one of the islands for the Keys but that is a stunning mistake. They had not been in the air long enough to have flown from the bombing range to the Keys and they were flying away from the keys. Radio traffic and a fisherman's sightings established that they performed the bombing practice.</p>
<p>The problem and radio messages happened after that first turn they should have been flying roughly north toward the second turn then south west back toward Ft Lauderdale.</p>

<li>Also in answer to Q2 - oh well if a friend told you... quick stick it on Wiki! Even a cursory glance at the map, a Google search or Q1 would have given you the answer that of course flights and boats go about their merry way within The Triangle. Just in case you're still wavering, I have personally (not a friend's aunt's colleague) flown within The Triangle on - yikes - Friday the 13th and lived to tell the tale.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent additions/Overall article</span></h2>
<p>First up, I wanna address the recent additions about the Star Tiger. so YES this incident is important and as yet unsolved. But this is seemingly (in my opinion at least) the only genuinely baffling and unexplainable incident so far - all the others have plausible explanations attached to them. So lets just say for the sake of the argument that Star Tiger's dissapearance was due to paranormal causes. This makes the case of the Star Tiger interesting, but it DOES NOT, IN ANY WAY imply that the bermuda triangle is a paranormal region. If you also assume that all other incidents from the region are non-paranormal (not an unreasonable assumption IMO) then this becomes an isolated paranormal event with no relationship to the geographical area.</p>
<p>So, I feel that the Star Tiger case should be part of the article. However I feel that more emphasis should be put on the fact that this is the only case that really is a mystery, and that overall the statistics still show nothing overly weird about the area.</p>
<p>As for the article overall, its a mess. The hypotheses about methane and suchlike need to be clarified as just that - hypotheses. The article seems to give them undue credibility IMO. Also the order of the article is all wrong - the start of the article essentially rubbishes the idea that the region is paranormal, but then you read into the bit concerning Star Tiger and suddenly the article implies that the region is highly paranormal!!! This is all wrong, the important caes should be repositioned. Also I feel a conclusion should be written summing up the facts - i.e. that the area's reputation for being paranormal is largely media hype and speculation based on poor research with the exception of one case, and that hence the interesting stuff is all to do with star tiger, NOT the bermuda triangle.</p>
<p>Well there you have it, discuss! --wilhen01 01:13, 26 March 2006</p>

<dd>I do greatly apologize for having real life stuff get in the way of putting up the sheer volume of information on the weirdness of this region. Not only is <i>Star Tiger</i> <b>not</b> the only unexplained case, to call it that borders on ludicrous (as I mentioned a long while back, and seems to have been deleted here). Therefore, we'll take them one at a time, in chronological order. First up, the disappearance of the <a href="../../../n/c/1/NC16002_disappearance_ea88.html" title="NC16002 disappearance">DC-3 NC16002</a> on December 28, 1948 <a href="http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/into_the_blue.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bermuda-triangle.org/html/into_the_blue.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. As for the issue of the article implying immediately that it is not paranormal, this is the result of several posters putting in total POV, by marginalizing the very idea of it being paranormal to begin with...then coming up against my research into <i>Star Tiger</i>, <i>Star Ariel</i> *gets tired of saying their names*, and soon the DC-3 just mentioned, all in the space of inside three years. To put it simply, they want to debunk the idea of the Triangle, and I've read too much on the actual transcripts of what happened to agree. Getting them on Wikipedia, however, is tougher due to time constraints. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 05:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Bermuda Triangle</span></h2>
<p>The Bermuda Triangle also known as the Devil's Triangle stirs up fear in many people because of its natorious reputation. Its notoiety beganin the mid-year nineteenth century, when there were mysteriously abandoned ships found. In 1945, a training squandron of five US navy bombers disappeared. The squandron of fourteen crewmen went missing after radioing a series of distress message and later a seaplane sent in search of the squandron also vanished as it went missing. Since then there were many reports on missing aircrafts and ships around the area.VVVVEEEERRRRYYYY CCCCRRRREEEEAAAAPPPPYYYY!</p>
<p>Scientific evaluations of the Bermuda Triangle have concluded that the number of disappearences in the reigion is not abnormal and that most of the have logical explanations. However, many people still assosiate the Bermuda Triangle with death and mystery. There are many explanations that link to the tragedies. Some proposed that the cause is an action of physical forces unknown to science while others think there is a <i>hole in the sky</i> above the area. Some other theorists said that the cause is an unusual chemical component in the region's seawater. The most popular belief is thatthe missing people were abducted by extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<dd>What does this have to do with anything more than a cross between a rant and an advertisement for a book??

<h2><span class="mw-headline">MAP</span></h2>
<p>In the Charles Berlitz's book concerning the Bermuda Triangle, there is a drawn map of this planet that indicates <b>12</b> areas that are equi-distant from each other. Two are on the poles, two are mentioned in the article. I have a copy of the map in my copy of this book. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 19:33, 6 April 2006 (UTC) <b>:)</b></p>
<p>Here are their locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>One is near Hawaii, somewhat to the N.E.</li>
<li>One is in or near Morrocco, which is in North Africa.</li>
<li>One is either in or near Pakistan and/or India.</li>
<li>One is in the Indian Ocean somewhat WEST of Australia.</li>
<li>One is north of New Zealand.</li>
<li>One is <i>in</i> the Pacific Ocean</li>
<li>One is near both Argentina and/or Brazil</li>
<li>One is in S. Africa.</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas, like the Bermuda Triangle and the Devil's Sea, located near Japan are known to have bizarre properties. As stated, there are <b>12</b> of these areas, one each at the two poles, two already mentioned here, the other <b>8</b> are located above according to Charles Berlitz's book concerning this matter, of which I have a copy. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 19:48, 6 April 2006 (UTC) <b>:)</b></p>

<p>Couple of weeks back I watched a program about Triangle at Discovery Science TV channel, although it was interesting, but an image shown just for a second or two got my focused intention with looked something like "oLLII". I've made that in JPEG but can't add in this comment. It was actuallt about the rock tracks formed within the triangle. I'll really appericiate if someone else could verify this also or guide me how to get it confirmed from the Discovery TV, as they don't give any email to communicate with them. As I beleive that It was so, based upon this I may have some extra to say... possibilities and new theories... Many Thanks from Ajmal Khan.</p>
<p>Same as me I have watched a show about the triangle and it is so freaky, but the famillys need to focus more on how the familly member went down.So then when they do they probaly can know how to get them back and know how they went down .If it was my familly member I would be terified but it is all up to you.</p>

<dd>It is the belief of many that the region in question comprises an area extending from the island of Bermuda to the eastern coastline of <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a>, to the northern coastline of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Juan%2C_Puerto_Rico_38f5.html" title="San Juan, Puerto Rico">San Juan</a>; these are the classic dimensions of "the Triangle." Other alternate figures stretch the proverbial lines from <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk%2C_Virginia_e3c8.html" title="Norfolk, Virginia">Norfolk</a> to Bermuda or Miami in turn, then to San Juan and back. Reality, however, shows that no actual well-defined lines exist, and that the entire western Atlantic itself is the site of the excessively odd occurrances such as planes vanishing in single passes of a radarscope, and the like. In this line of thinking, the Bermuda Triangle is not so much as actual thing as the term used for a region of bizarre reports, much like the disappearances associated with the "Bennington Triangle" in Bennington, Vermont. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 15:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've looked at the websites given, and there seems to be no (paranormal) mystery. the only 2 cases actually stated (apart from vague talk) are of light planes. One disappeared in bad weather, the other had some wreckage and survivors detected - but this was apparently covered up as one passenger was a politician who suspected the intrigue later revealed as Watergate. A strange claim indeed, but even the German website billing it as an "Alaska triangle" concedes there must be a normal explanation. It is also claimed that the pilot in this case was cavalier with regard to flying conditions - he would fly in all weathers. So basically talk of an "alaska triangle" is unfounded. I'm deleting all references, and if someone wants to start an "Alaska triangle" page (gawd help us), the stuff will be in the history section. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 23:43, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can water vapor (As in mist and fog) conduct electricity, static or otherwise? And if it can, is it still capable of putting off an intense enough magnetic field to foul up a compass and/or electronic devices? if so, could the "Electronic fog" a reality? I mean, if the Triangle has a large amount of electricity, static or conventional, it could FUBAR the instruments and lead them over land or wherever they crashed, and with the theory of debris dispersion, the wreckage could have gone everywhere.
