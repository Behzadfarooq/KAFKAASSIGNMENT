<p>Glieberman's father died when Glieberman was 17 years old, and after this the young Bernard took over control of his family real estate holdings. By the age of twenty-one he was a partner in a real estate firm, and at thirty-one he was able to buy out his partner's shares. By 1971, he had started the Crosswinds Communities corporation, which he runs and in which he is the sole shareholder to this day.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Glieberman_96d5.html" title="Edit section: Football involvement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Football involvement</span></h2>
<p>From 1991 to 2006, Glieberman was involved as the financier of several football operations in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the United States. Glieberman put up the money while his son Lonie usually handled media relations and football operations. These operations proved controversial and invariably died within a few seasons.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Glieberman_96d5.html" title="Edit section: The Rough Riders and Shreveport">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Rough Riders and Shreveport</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_CFL_season_1ae7.html" title="1991 CFL season">1991</a>, Glieberman and his son arrived in Ottawa to bail out the troubled <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Rough_Riders_7284.html" title="Ottawa Rough Riders">Ottawa Rough Riders</a> franchise. The team was losing money (and would, indeed, fold before the decade was out) and was over $1 million <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_dollar.html" title="Canadian dollar">CAD</a> in debt. With his son as the franchise's frontman, Bernie Glieberman bought the team for a dollar, assumed the debt, and provided the capital city's team with what must have seemed like stable ownership.</p>
<p>However, relations between the Gliebermans, the league, and its fans soon soured. Bernie merely provided the money but Lonie was making controversial and unpopular moves. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_CFL_season_4c42.html" title="1993 CFL season">1993</a>, the younger Glieberman fired general manager Dan Rambo, while ordering the team to sign and play former <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> defensive lineman <a href="../../../d/e/x/Dexter_Manley_6b85.html" title="Dexter Manley">Dexter Manley</a> despite his skills having faded badly and a nasty <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> habit getting him banned from the NFL. Lonie Glieberman also interfered with the team's training camp, driving away assistant coaches <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Daley_8e09.html" title="Jim Daley">Jim Daley</a> and Mike Roach. Meanwhile, Bernie Glieberman made noises about moving the team to the United States, further driving down enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Rather than stick it out in Ottawa, Glieberman sold the Rough Riders to <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Firestone_8f56.html" title="Bruce Firestone">Bruce Firestone</a> for $1.85 million, instead opting to be the first owner of the <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport_Pirates_357e.html" title="Shreveport Pirates">Shreveport Pirates</a> in the failed <a href="../../../c/f/l/CFL_USA_86fb.html" title="CFL USA">CFL USA</a> expansion scheme. The Pirates, like the whole expansion, were a failure, going 8-28 over two seasons. Glieberman initially attempted to stay in for the long haul, trying to move the team to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>. However, city officials were put out upon discovering that Glieberman had faced a number of lawsuits over his CFL career for not paying the bills, and that an antique automobile he owned had in fact been impounded due to his non-payment on a scoreboard for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Stadium_b5ce.html" title="Independence Stadium">Independence Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>After the failure of his CFL experience, Glieberman tried again in football. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Glieberman, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ritchie_3085.html" title="John Ritchie">John Ritchie</a>, and former Shreveport coach <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrest_Gregg_1fb6.html" title="Forrest Gregg">Forrest Gregg</a> started the All-American Football League with the objective of playing by March of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. Glieberman planned to play a 20-game season in the spring and summer, buy television time from networks, and make money by having the league sell the advertising rather than the network. The league would be a single-owner entity in much the same vein as the early days of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Soccer_7bb1.html" title="Major League Soccer">Major League Soccer</a>. The league also planned to have players directed to markets where they might be popular (the <i>South Florida Business Journal</i> giving the example of a failed <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Miami_4499.html" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a> player playing for a Miami AAFL franchise).</p>
<p>Despite Glieberman's ambitions and some minor media attention, the league never got off the ground. The league's plans included teams in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>, and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa%2C_Florida_a617.html" title="Tampa, Florida">Tampa</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Glieberman_96d5.html" title="Edit section: Return to Ottawa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to Ottawa</span></h3>
<p>In May of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_CFL_season_42b3.html" title="2005 CFL season">2005</a>, Glieberman resurfaced in the CFL, purchasing the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Renegades_6620.html" title="Ottawa Renegades">Ottawa Renegades</a> after a season in which the league had financed the team. Lonie was once again installed as team president. The Renegades had struggled both financially and in the standings almost since their inception, and few parties were interested in running the team, leaving the CFL little choice but to turn to the Gliebermans.</p>
<p>The first move made by the Gliebermans was typically controversial: bringing in 71-year old Forrest Gregg to the system, after having been out of professional football for ten years since his failed tenure as head coach of Glieberman's Shreveport Pirates (Gregg didn't help his own cause, famously forgetting starting quarterback <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Joseph_1a1a.html" title="Kerry Joseph">Kerry Joseph</a>'s name during a radio interview). Lonie's <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mardi_Gras_092d.html" title="Mardi Gras">Mardi Gras</a> promotion of trying to lure women to Renegades games by offering them beads (a reward traditionally given in the celebration for the baring of breasts) was also criticised. Before the Renegades' final game of the 2005 season, Lonie Glieberman announced the firing of popular head coach <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Paopao_06a0.html" title="Joe Paopao">Joe Paopao</a> and his staff, leaving them to coach the final game knowing that it would be their last. The Renegades missed the playoffs.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Lonie Glieberman resigned his post with the Renegades, leading to speculation that Bernie Glieberman would sell. The Renegades lost $4 million in 2005 but Glieberman agreed to continue operating the Renegades if the team received a $2 million loan from the league. This was rejected, and, unable to find a buyer after Glieberman backed out on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, the Renegades suspended operations for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_CFL_season_e9e1.html" title="2006 CFL season">2006 season</a>, and may return if new ownership can be found.</p>
