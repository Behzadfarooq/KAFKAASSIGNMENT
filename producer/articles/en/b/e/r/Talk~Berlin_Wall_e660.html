<p>The DDR's claim was that the building of the wall was not to keep people from leaving East Berlin.

<p>it's true...camel cigarette billboards were up before the first big mac was sold on the other side...the bananas were flying (mick , who was there...)</p>

<dd>They ran barbed wire across all access points and put tanks and infantry on the streets. While the concrete wall and permanent guard posts were lacking the physical barrier and intent were present from that day.

<p>1955 is less insane than 1855 but still wrong, being 6 years before the construction of the wall... <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> 18:40, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tend to agree with the prevailing view in this article (that the wall was built to prevent people going from east to west), however some of these sentences are too POV, like "It was clear from the beginning that this justification served as a cover for the fact that the citizens of East Germany had to be prevented from entering West Berlin and thereby West Germany (East Germany did not completely control traffic between West Berlin and the rest of West Germany)." I really don't have to be told it's clear one side is correct or another is, I think a reasonable person can just be handed the facts and interpret them themselves, we don't need interpretation in Wikipedia as well. I would tend to interpret it as said, but it doesn't belong.</p>
<p>On another point, most analysis I've seen of the migration, be it non-communist left or US intelligence analysis noted that the majority of people coming over were educated professionals and that this was the real problem. East Germany could well afford to have 2.5 million people leave the country from 1949 to 1961, East Germany could not afford that number when they were mostly professionals - electricians, doctors, scientists and the like. This is an important point and was not mentioned in the article, I added it. <a href="../../../n/a/k/User%7ENakosomo_2815.html" title="User:Nakosomo">Nakosomo</a> 05:06, 7 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>This part (under the "Aftermath and implications" section of "The Fall" doesn't seem to be related to the article: "In 1990 the U.S. Congress failed to pass the defense budget forcing many government defense contracting companies to lay off thousands of workers."

<p>There is a section repeated from the Secondary Response section in the main title section. While the Berlin Wall was important as a symbol, the passage in the first section should be pared down or removed, as it isn't directly revelant to specifically what the wall was.---</p>

<p>"<i><b>After a misunderstanding</b></i>, Günter Schabowski announced in a press conference..." .....Please give details on what the misunderstanding was! I really am intrigued. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 03:59, 21 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>My memories of the 9.11.1989 are as follows. The anouncement of Günter Schabowski (east german politician) that all travel restrictions for citizens of the DDR are lifted was made on a press conference. I heard it on the radio, and it sounded as even the news reader could not believe it. It would be great to have an audio sample of these radio news here. It was a Thursday evening, during the night Berliners tested the announcement and were able to get intot the west. Border guards were confused I was told, they did not know about the new policies, but they were afraid to oppose the masses of people who demanded to cross the border into West Berlin. On my way to work on Friday I could see a number of Trabant cars milling around in West Berlin, people from East Berlin coming over for a visit to the west. Saturday was complete chaos, Hundredthousands of citizens from East Berlin came for various reasons... Shopping, seeing family members... in the street where I lived I met somebody who was looking for the place he used to work before 1961, a roofer workshop, it was highly emotional.</p>
<p>For propaganda reasons visitors from the east could claim 20 DMark (west money) every time they were able to visit the west. Of course this was soon abolished after 1989. Before it was mostly pensioners with family ties to the west who were allowed to travel to West Berlin. (By the way, in East Germany, the official spelling for the west of the city was Westberlin. And East Berlin was 'Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'.) This payment was called 'Begrüßungsgeld' or 'welcome money'. It was paid by the banks on behalf of the government and you had to show your DDR passport or ID card as proof of identity I think. On the way to do my Saturday shopping I came past an enormous queue outside of a bank near my flat, east german visitors claiming their 'Begrüßungsgeld'. (This was the Berliner Bank at Hallesches Tor, I lived in Obentrautstrasse, and usually did my shopping in the upstairs supermarket in the 'Hertie am Halleschen Ufer'. This shop also was packed with people, trying to buy something from the 20DM they had. I could probably go on and on with my personal memories, and I have to write them down some time. I am always very moved thinking back to these days in Berlin.</p>

<p>I was told that there was an even larger wall on the whole thousand-kilometer border between the two Germanies. Should there be a mention of it here, or even a page for that&#160;?</p>
<p>Yes. Fences, watchtowers and minefields. These days that area is a nature refuge, because humans hardly interfered there for 50 years. Except for some towns directly at the border, the whole border regions were underdeveloped too</p>
<p><br />
There should be a page for that, if it doesnt exist yet. The border was strongly guarded between the BRD (Federal Republic of Germany) and the DDR (German Democratic Republic).</p>

<p>Given the recent poll data we are reporting on people now wishing we again had two Germany's instead of one, could someone find &amp; photograph one of those "Geben Sie mir zurück mein Mauer" T-shirts ("Give me back my wall", I may not have the German quite right) which I remember seeing circa 1996?

<p>I've reworded to fix this. The problem was that the underlying wikitext was "because... [of] the infamous [[Kristallnacht]] pogroms of [[1938]], [[October 3]] was chosen instead." The wiki tried to get too smart and reinterpreted "[[1938]], [[October 3]]", which it thought was a single date, into your preferred date style. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:53, Dec 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's extensive television coverage about these events. In brief: While everywhere else along the wall and in Berlin generally people were peaceful and euphoric during those November days, the Brandenburg gate attracted a crowd of aggressive youths (some drunk) from the west who were trying to break a hole into the wall. They partly succeeded, but finally were driven away by a joint effort of East German border guards using water hoses, and the West Berlin police. It's not quite clear who these people were, but judging from the coverage they were neither left wing nor right wing, even though they sang the national anthem and generally argued against the GDR. These circumstances are rarely told whenever the footage is shown. Anorak2 12:47, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not in general, I don't think so. While the wall indirectly caused wasteland in the inner city (e.g. near Potsdamer Platz), it also cut through some highly populated areas, where housing prices were not particularly lower than in comparable parts of the city further away from the wall. This applies to West Berlin of course. East Berlin had no free real estate market anyway. Anorak2 12:53, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not aware of any scholary work on that. But my personal impression (as a West German) is that the peacefulness of the events of autumn 1989 was very much due to the aftershock of Tiananmen. You could sense that the East German border guards/soldiers/military desperately wanted to avoid another Tiananmen on East German soil. I don't think that Tiananmen sparked the events that led to the fall of the Wall - but it was instrumental in the protests being succesful.--195.128.250.122 23:38, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the Berlin Wall and the "German Border system" are not the same thing, and while they have many things in common, the border system between East and West Germany (as opposed to East and West Berlin) has its own history (the physical barriers were created in 1954 for a start - the article as it stands is wrong). The German Wikipedia has seperate articles (<a href="../../../../de/i/n/n/Innerdeutsche_Grenze_0dd0.html" class="extiw" title="de:Innerdeutsche_Grenze">de:Innerdeutsche Grenze</a>, <a href="../../../../de/b/e/r/Berliner_Mauer_a871.html" class="extiw" title="de:Berliner_Mauer">de:Berliner_Mauer</a>). <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanb_ae9a.html" title="User:Ianb">Ianb</a> 22:24, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Ianb. The Berlin Wall was merely one part of the GDR border system. It was certainly by far the most famous part, but it was very different from the rest of the border system in terms of its construction, operations and history. The border system article mentions the Berlin Wall in passing and this article mentions the border system in passing; I don't think there's any significant overlap between the two. Vicarious' assertion that "2/3 of the articles are the same" (which s/he presents without providing any examples of similarity) is simply wrong, as even a cursory comparison of the two articles shows. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:52, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi everybody! I shortened and refined the lines: "East German residents wishing to leave the GDR, even merely for a vacation on socialist territory, often faced tough controls and long waits for exit visas. Meanwhile, residents of other East European Communist nations flocked to the GDR for trade and leisure when possible, as it was the most prosperous country of the Soviet bloc."</p>
<p>In this context the second part of the statement lacks meaningful information and suggest that other Eastern block residents had easier passage through the Polish-GDR, Czechoslovak-GDR borders. In fact the harsh contol was applied on all ordenary travellers regardless country origin.</p>
<p>The judment on GDR as being the most prosperious country of the Soviet block raises questions. It either needs some objective figures or it should be deleted. Generaly I beleive "prosperity" is not an appropriate term to use to describe any of the former Eastern block countries. Perhaps "relatively prosperious" would be more accurate, but this above mentioned context can live without it.--<a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukorelli_2e8d.html" title="User:Kukorelli">Kukorelli</a> 23:27, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was still possible to leave East Germany after the construction of the Wall. I think this should be mentioned somewhere in the article because the only clue to this was in the opening paragraph (which was misleading and I corrected) and later when it states that "a few" people who were too old to work were allowed through. It sounds like some old codgers hobbled over to the Wall and the guards took pity and let them through... whereas in reality there was an official process. In fact, in order to comply with United Nations directives on freedom of movement, the GDR had an official application form for leaving the country. This was of course just for show because the answer was almost always 'Nein', unless they wanted you to go - like if you were an unproductive member of society: retired or just too much trouble. I don't have the official figures at hand but I know that 10s of 1000s left annualy. In 1983 11,000 left and that was the lowest amount in any given year, with highs of around 40,000.</p>
<p>Then there are also the political prisoners that were sold by the East to the West. 'Compensation' was the communist spin of the day. West Germany took prisoners off their hands, set them free and made them into West Germans. There was an old joke in the East that if the communists were running out of money there would be a whole load of arrests. I actually met someone who got himself deliberately arrested in order to be sent to the West, successfully.</p>
<p>As it stands the article gives the impression that absolutely no one could cross into the West at all but in fact 100s of 1000s did so. It was the illegal emigration that was a problem - not the government sanctioned emigration. Per1892 20:24, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Describing the barrier as having "effectively decreased illegal emigration" in the first paragraph is misleading and perhaps a poor choice of words. The word emigration alone would suffice in my opinion. Illegal emigration is wrong. Even it were GDR policy to limit travel to western countries, the people in the GDR were mostly born with a common German citizenship and the GDR right to limit their travel in the country of their was never recognized by most countries in the world. "Illegal emigration" is too reminiscint of "illegal immigration", an issue with a completely different legal and social background in common use. I would suggest it be changed to simply "emigration" (without illegal) or something that better explains the situation, such as "effectively decreased emigration, which was restricted by the East German regime.--62.245.143.34 08:11, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the entry "Escape attempts" there was the following line: "During the Wall's existence there were around 5,000 successful escapes into West Berlin <i>(a form of illegal immigration).</i>" First of all, the Berlin Wall was mean't to keep people in, and being in mean't being a communist slave. Second, while the Wall was in operation, the words "illegal immigrant" were never used to describe anyone escaping from East Berlin; these people were shot on sight by the guards determined that no one leave. They were escaping a totalitarian regime.

<p>The section <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html#Portion_of_Wall_at_Westminster_College" title="Berlin Wall">Portion of Wall at Westminster College</a> seems to me to be rather long proportional to its importance, and a bit magazine-ish. Does anyone have a problem with the idea of editing this down to the basics? We can move the bulk of this to the article on the college, if it is not already there. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:49, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with Jambel. I think that the Westminster College section is completely out of place in this article and ALL of it should be moved to the main Westminster College article. It is over long and of little interest to anyone except former students of the college and perhaps distant relations of Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>I've added a wise citation by mr.Suvorov, summarising the political importance and meaning of this construction. The original is:</p>
<p><i>13 августа 1961 года Берлин был разрезан пополам бетонной стеной. Назначение стены: удержать жителей Восточной социалистической Германии от бегства в нормальный мир.</i></p>
<p>Стена постоянно совершенствовалась и укреплялась, превращаясь из стены в систему непреодолимых инженерных заграждений с ловушками, сложнейшей системой сигнализации, с бетонными огневыми точками, наблюдательными вышками, противотанковыми тетраэдрами и ежами, с хитроумными автоматами-самострелами, которые убивали беглецов даже без участия пограничников.</p>
<p>Но чем больше труда, изобретательности, денег, бетона и стали коммунисты вкладывали в дальнейшее развитие стены, тем яснее становилось: удержать людей в коммунистическом обществе можно только неприступными заграждениями, колючей проволокой, собаками, стрельбой в спину. Стена означала: система, которую построили коммунисты, не привлекает никого.

<p>In the main text, it's stated that the "no man's land" was mined and booby-trapped. But I don't recall reports of people getting blown up during the 1989 celebrations. So when were they de-mined? When one of the subsequent walls was constructed? Or did people avoid the areas they knew to be mined and de-mining happened afterwards? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 20:21, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Afaik, there were no mines or booby traps at the inner city section of the Wall, only at the outskirt areas. 85.181.45.105 10:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There were no mines nor auto-triggered guns at any part of the Berlin Wall, as opposed to the border between East and West Germany. That part of the description is just wrong. Anorak2 13:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The museum at Checkpoint Charlie features an automaic spring gun they claim is from the wall, are they lying?</p>

<dd>It probably is from the border between East and West Germany. Unless they claim it's from the Berlin Wall proper, they're not lying. Anorak2 10:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The Wall was chipped away at by a euphoric public and souvenir hunters over the next several weeks, it was later removed using industrial equipment and its so called "fall" prepared the way for Nationalist tendencies which gained acendency in East Germany towards the end of 1989 following extravagant promises of "blooming landscapes" and "economic wonders" the East German voters were convinced of the need for German reunification, which was formally concluded on October 3, 1990." Is this a real sentence? It needs serious revision.</p>
