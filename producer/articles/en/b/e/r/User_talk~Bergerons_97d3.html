<p>Since I made my request for unblock SlimVirgin has changed the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> policy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASock_puppetry&amp;diff=66951323&amp;oldid=66638306" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASock_puppetry&amp;diff=66951323&amp;oldid=66638306" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Since there wasn't, as of yesterday, a section called <i><a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Avoiding_public_scrutiny" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Avoiding public scrutiny</a></i> I still maintain that I haven't violated policy. This is a smoking gun - evidence that suggests Jayjg completely disregards CheckUser Policy. I know that it is more likely that Grace Note will be anointed GodKing than that Jay would be held accountable. But still people. Which edits did <a href="../../../m/r/o/User%7EMRosenberg_3151.html" title="User:MRosenberg">MRosenberg</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MRosenberg_992b.html" title="Special:Contributions/MRosenberg">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosenbergSWE_a992.html" title="User:RosenbergSWE">RosenbergSWE</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RosenbergSWE_6448.html" title="Special:Contributions/RosenbergSWE">contribs</a>) make that were "too similar" to the edits of Dervish Tsaddik? And WTFI SoCalJustice? That and disclosing my name for no good reason was just a cruel joke I presume. Now, I may or may not have been Dervish Tsaddik (I may or may not have been quite a few accounts) but if I had consecutive multiple accounts it was not to deceive but to avoid getting 'attached' to a screen name. A philosophical choice, if you will, that was allowed until today (when SlimVirgin changed <small>(such irony)</small> the policy). Look at the time frames, note that previous to this I have never been blocked, notice the complete lack of procedure, note that no linguistic and pattern analysis can explain the accusations. The only thing that comes to mind is abuse of Check User (that goes great together with abuse of oversight btw). Now if you would unblock me and investigate Jay's actions I would have to eat dog food (a bet with a mate), but it would be worth it. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBergerons_3f7f.html" title="User:Bergerons">Bergerons</a> 02:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what your conspiracy theory is about my editing the policy page, but if you read it, the introduction already talks about avoiding public scrutiny, and that's been there for a long time; all I did was create a section about it. The intro quotes Jimbo saying: "multiple usernames are really only a problem if they are used as a method of troublemaking of some sort. For example, to generate an appearance of consensus, or to vote more than once, or to <b>hide from public scrutiny</b>" (my emphasis). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My theory is that you took a quote from the intro and created a new section (that contradicts the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Segregation_and_security" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Segregation and security</a> section btw). I wouldn't call it a conspiracy theory since I can give evidence <small>(see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASock_puppetry&amp;diff=66951323&amp;oldid=66638306" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASock_puppetry&amp;diff=66951323&amp;oldid=66638306" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</small> to support the 'theory'. One implication of <i><a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html#Avoiding_public_scrutiny" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Multiple accounts should not be used as a way of avoiding the scrutiny of your fellow editors by ensuring you leave no audit trail.</a></i> is that <i>you</i> are now in violation of the WP:SOCK policy, courtesy of you. Because <i>you have</i> edited Wikipedia under other usernames than SlimVirgin, right? And I don't see any links from your user page to those accounts.</dd>

<dd>I didn't accuse you, MPerel, or anyone else of using sockpuppets in violation of WP:SOCK. I said that you have had previous usernames.

<dd>In fact, as of yesterday there are plenty of admins who are in violation of the "hide from public scrutiny" policy. I find all this unjust. See here, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Theboardtakeback" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Theboardtakeback" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> was the one who shut down the Igor nazi review board, if you look at the cached versions you'll see that his stated reason why he felt enough was enough and started banning everyone was my actions. I also had a couple of run-ins with him after that (which I'm happy to say he didn't like at all). I didn't partake in the following boards. And this is the thanks I get - being put in danger by having my name revealed (in violation of CheckUser policy) by your colleague. In your world Guy Montag and Zeq are good editors while Homey and KimvdLinde are disruptive POV pushers. In my world the opposite is true. You don't have to agree but please respect that it is possible for me to sincerely hold this opinion. It doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean that I'm demented. It doesn't <i>necessarily</i> mean that I'm out to <i>cause trouble</i> <b>™</b>. It <i>certainly</i> doesn't mean that I'm anti-Israel (I just prefer Naomi Klein over Phyllis Chesler).

<dd>My theory is that she clarified the intent of the policy. The edit is not contentious in my view, since avoiding scrutiny is indeed an abusive use of multiple accounts - the other sections make this quite clear. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:41, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sounds like a good theory. I still don't understand how <i>"Multiple accounts should not be used as a way of avoiding the scrutiny of your fellow editors by ensuring you leave no audit trail"</i> doesn't contradict <i>"Someone who is known to the public or within a particular circle may be identifiable based on their interests and contributions; dividing these up between different accounts might help preserve the person's anonymity."</i>? Also, everybody knows that quite a few admins use multiple accounts to avoid being scrutinized at times. SlimVirgin is aware of this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62489748" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=62489748" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and has had at least two other accounts which she doesn't disclose for public scrutiny. Note that I don't think she is responsible for the policy being contradictory, nor do I think it's wrong that she doesn't link to previous user names from her user page. Especially due to issues of harassment, which I can appreciate since I have to deal with such issues myself (part of my life is devoted to fighting neonazi and anti-immigration parties). Jayjg's actions were not only irresponsible, he also broke every rule in the rulebook in his efforts to intimidate me. Now, will anything be done about that? --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBergerons_3f7f.html" title="User:Bergerons">Bergerons</a> 10:28, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
