<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/User_talk%7EBerig_Archive_1_%28December_22%2C_2006_-_January_31%2C_2007%29_de6f.html" title="Edit section: Footnotes &amp; Haakon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Footnotes &amp; Haakon</span></h2>
<p>Now let's reiterate: you come to the footnotes talk page requesting some info, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EFootnotes_55f9.html#What_have_I_done_wrong.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Footnotes">Wikipedia talk:Footnotes#What have I done wrong?</a>. I point you to the relevant guideline (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>), quoting the relevant text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If quoting from a different language source, an English translation should be given with the original-language quote beside it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you misinterpret that, and start adding original-language quotes, where an acceptable English translation has been published.</p>
<p>If you want to continue using non-English sources (like the familjebok and the encyklopedin) for <i>verifiability</i>, then quote the original-language sentences from these sources which you need as supportive evidence for the contentions you add to the encyclopedia, and add a translation of these quotes. I prepared the Haakon the Red article so that that is all you have to do.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Swedish_monarchs_e6a4.html#References" title="List of Swedish monarchs">List of Swedish monarchs#References</a> contains four reference works which have both the advantage of being in <i>English</i>, and being more <i>recent</i> than the abovementioned sources. Note that non-English sources should only be used <i>if there are no reliable sources in English</i>, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English" title="WP:V">WP:V#Sources in languages other than English</a>. I have no access to the sources mentioned in the <i>List of Swedish monarchs</i> article, and whether or not I can read any Scandinavian language is irrelevant (BTW: I <i>speak</i> Dutch, I <i>am not</i> Dutch). References follow the standards laid down in Wikipedia guidance (WP:CITE, WP:V, etc). I do the same when I write articles based on sources in Dutch. It comes down to a bit of cleverness, selecting just those sentences you need for support of the contentions you want to add to English Wikipedia, and no more. Not copying complete encyclopedia articles. Don't make a caricature of it. This has also nothing to do with <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> - only with building an English-language encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 22:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again: these are not <i>my</i> demands. I just quoted what is in <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. I'll do it again:

</blockquote>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>As said, this gives me extra work too, when I want to use a source that only exists in Dutch. But I don't go around complaining about it.</dd>

<dd>LOL! I am just surprised that an obscure little king (about whom there is so little documentation that there will never be an FA on him) should need such excessive referencing.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 10:06, 23 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In all earnest, as far as I'm concerned any "topic" is as predestined for FA as any other, see e.g. <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">spoo</a> as an example of a FA on a more or less "obscure" topic, so I wouldn't make a distinction there. FA depends on the quality of the article, not on "fame" of the described topic.</dd>
<dd>I grouped some suggestions for improvement of the Haakon the Red article at <a href="../../../h/a/a/Talk%7EHaakon_the_Red_e23b.html#Suggestions_for_improvement_of_the_article" title="Talk:Haakon the Red">Talk:Haakon the Red#Suggestions for improvement of the article</a> --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 10:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks like your RfA won't achieve consensus on this occasion. I'm sorry about that as I think that you are a good candidate; the only point that I would make would be to demonstrate your knowledge of <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicy_4cef.html" title="WP:Policy">policies and guidelines</a> when you contribute to XfD discussions. Don't take this as a knock-back - everyone who contributed wants you to be the best admin that you can be! I reckon that you can achieve this with three months' effort, looking at all of the constructive criticism that you have received. Best wishes for 2007 and I'll look forward to seeing your name on the RfA list in the future. Regards and happy editing, <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a> 13:02, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Don't take it too hard. You're a level headed editor that could certainly be promoted if you took the time to demonstrate knowledge of policy. But then again, we need you as an editor too, so keep your focus on that if you'd rather. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'll echo that; I think you're an outstanding contributor to the encyclopedia, but like I said, I saw very little involvement in the "nuts and bolts" of Wikipedia. If you up your involvement in the various processes of the site, I'd have no problem supporting you. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> <span style="color: #999;">// <a href="../../../e/v/u/User_talk%7EEVula_6eaa.html" title="User talk:EVula">talk</a> // <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_admin_63be.html" title="User:EVula/admin"><span style="color: #366;">☯</span></a> //</span> 17:13, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sigh. Look what I missed! I definitely support Berig in that role too -- and next time I'll try to put in a good word as well. But a little knock on my user page door when things that might be interesting to me come up would be helpful and greatly appreciated (like a little innocent "Hi there", or in this case, a strange little "Happy Lucia" or even a little premature "Merry Christmas") --- So I can focus when something nice is around the corner. Some people are just naturally distracted, you know&#160;:) Happy New Year, Berig! <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPia_L_f99c.html" title="User:Pia L">Pia</a> 13:14, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, Berig. Yes, there sure is enough drama here for a full season of primetime soaps. I can't keep up with it all, so I just have to treat it like TV static---tune it out. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPia_L_f99c.html" title="User:Pia L">Pia</a> 09:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A very valuable and interesting article, in my opinion. I agree with DAB that some of the shorter runestones should be grouped together in one article (as <a href="../../../f/%C3%A4/r/F%C3%A4rentuna_runestones.html" title="Färentuna runestones">some of them</a> are) but this one is long and notable enough to deserve its own spot. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Briangotts_3847.html" title="Special:Contributions/Briangotts">(Contrib)</a> 20:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I think it is better now that I have corrected the translation from the old version. I personally think only notable runestones should have articles.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 20:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About your unfolding runestone drama, and your message to me about the two viking "drama queens" the stones depict: LOL, you're so funny! Yes, this is the kind of soap I love to know more about...please tell us more. You find the most fascinating things to write about, Berig!

<dd>Thanks Pia! I am happy you like them. I am thinking of writing two articles on Gerlög and Estrid. The stories of these Viking Age women deserve to be made more accessible in English.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 11:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

I do generally trust your judgment as to what is and is not reliable in these areas. I think it's ironic that you're being attacked now as a Swedish imperialist right-wing oppressor.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Could you please give your opinion about this and that. I don't have that much time to work on Wikipedia so when I come here, it's to contribute to articles, not to waste my time repeating what I've already written before. I've already left the French Wiki because of this kind of discussions, and I wish I could stay there longer.</p>

<p>It does seem a bit unusual, but the source I referenced says he "boarded a cog for Denmark", and the Hanseatic League were active in the Baltic. The online edition of the saga gives the ambiguous translation "trade-ship", but being from 1899 it is a bit outdated compared to the newer 2001 translation. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 22:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is probably a just a translation. I have just checked the <a href="http://www.snerpa.is/net/isl/laxdal.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.snerpa.is/net/isl/laxdal.htm" rel="nofollow">Old Norse</a> version and it says <i>knarrarbátinn</i>, another word for knaar. The German Wikipedia has a <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Modell_Knorr.JPG" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Modell_Knorr.JPG" rel="nofollow">nice picture of a knarr</a> if you would like to use a knarr picture instead.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 22:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a nice picture - I'm surprised it isn't on Commons. However, the cog was in existence at the time of the voyage, even though the Hanseatic League itself was not founded until over a century later. The Dutch used the first known cog about half a century before Bolli was born (948 <a href="http://www.abc.se/~pa/mar/cog.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abc.se/~pa/mar/cog.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), and the Germans would probably have used them before the <i>hansa</i> as well. The cog was in part an evolution of the knarr, and the terminology used could easily refer to the newer vessel. Of course, when I chose the picture that is currently used in the article, I avoided those that were overtly Hanseatic, such as the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Kraweel.jpg" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Kraweel.jpg" rel="nofollow">Lisa von Lubeck</a>. The one used at present is shown from the side. The alternative to that was <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Kogge_Kampen_HST_2.jpg" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Kogge_Kampen_HST_2.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but the picture is too close and I wasn't too keen on modern flags being associated with the time of the travels.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think there is nothing wrong with the current image used, but the Knarr image is also needed for the <a href="../../../k/n/a/Knaar.html" title="Knaar">Knaar</a> article itself, so thanks for bringing the picture to my attention.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrimhelm_9989.html" title="User:Grimhelm">Grimhelm</a> 16:40, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Berig, your rewordings in the Vendel section are very useful: this article is already rather long, and the more concise and accurate this statement about these links can be the better. Which is the second helmet you have put in? It looks a bit like Vendel (I) but can't be because that has curly animals above the eyebrows in openwork. I haven't got a copy of the Valsgarde report, only the old Stolpe and Arne Vendel one from 1927. If you've got that reference available it would be good to add it to the Bibliography, because altho' its already very long it would help any reader or student to know where to find it. The best place for the footnote to it would be at the first mention of Valsgarde in the ship-burial description section.

<dd>Thanks for your messages, received. I think the Vendel helmets are fairly secure in the 550-650 bracket: Mitford and Evans have been satisfied with this horizon long enough not to need to reinforce it massively for the purpose of the Sutton Hoo article. I haven't looked at the English Wiki Vendel article lately, but our brief summary ought to be enough here if the Vendel article is properly referenced and linked. Sutton Hoo generates so much discussion, but if that starts to flood into this article then it will go into overload. Perhaps there should be a page called 'Sutton Hoo theories'?!

<p>The oldest god in the Germanic mythology is Búri, known within the Saxons as Tuisto or Tuiscon. Þórr derives from this proto-god; in the same line as the other gods. The Germanic proto-god is pictured at rock-carvings with its two palms up towards the sky. One of the palms is the sky's Sól (Sun), and the other one is the night sky's Máni (Moon). When we say that the wolf eats the Moon, it is a reference to the myth of the Fenriswolf eating Týr's one hand. The natural manifestation of this is the lunar-eclipse. As with the other gods, Týr derives from Tuisto. The thunder-god's two arms are also identical to Tuisto's two palms. One of them symbolizes Þórr's hammer; the other represents the Sun. This is the proto-god's role as Þórr. The hammer is the life-conserving force in the universe. The Sun, the life-creating force. There are three proto-forces in the universe. We call them by many names: Óðinn (Odin), Vílir (Vilje) and Véi (Ve); Istwô, IrminiaR and IngwaR; Óðinn, Lóðurr (Loki) and Hœnir; Óðinn, Þórr and Freyr... Óðinn's force is explosion, Þórr's force is gravity and Freyr's force is standstill. That is, respectively: expansion, implosion and the harmonic state of balance, that always come in-between the transition from the one force's dominance over the other forces - that is, balance between the two original proto-forces. Óðinn's force is that which throws the ball up into the air, Þórr's is the one which pulls it back down; and Freyr's the moment when the ball's velocity equals zero. Otherwise, look at this <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freyr.html" title="Freyr">Freyr</a> article part: In this temple, entirely decked out in gold, the people worship the statues of three gods in such wise that the mightiest of them, Thor, occupies a throne in the middle of the chamber; Wotan and Frikko have places on either side. The significance of these gods is as follows: Thor, they say, presides over the air, which governs the thunder and lightning, the winds and rains, fair weather and crops. The other, Wotan—that is, the Furious—carries on war and imparts to man strength against his enemies. The third is Frikko, who bestows peace and pleasure on mortals. His likeness, too, they fashion with an immense phallus.</p>

<p>So I'm asking myself why aren't you able to see it, and why have you erased my contribution to the Mannus article without wondering about that??? <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenrisUlven_989a.html" title="User:FenrisUlven">FenrisUlven</a> 20:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you feeling alright? I haven't even touched your edit in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mannus.html" title="Mannus">Mannus</a> article.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 20:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I sincirely apologize for my confusion, but still don't understand why you haven't left my contribution to the <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigurd.html" title="Sigurd">Sigurd</a> article when links refer to web pages that mention the undeniable fact: Siegfried/Sigurd is obviously <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arminius.html" title="Arminius">Arminius</a>. <i>Avec tout mes respects</i> <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenrisUlven_989a.html" title="User:FenrisUlven">FenrisUlven</a> 21:56, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand why you connect Sigurd with Arminius, but the names are very different, and in order to add such a theory you need to cite a scholarly source.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 22:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
