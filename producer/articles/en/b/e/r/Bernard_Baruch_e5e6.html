<p>Bernard Baruch was born in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camden%2C_South_Carolina_3ac2.html" title="Camden, South Carolina">Camden, South Carolina</a> to Simon and Belle Baruch. He was the second of four sons. His father Simon was a German <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> immigrant who came to America in 1855. He became a surgeon on the staff of Confederate general <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. His mother's <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephardic.html" title="Sephardic">Sephardic</a> Jewish ancestors came to New York in the 1800, they were in the shipping business. In 1881 the family moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and Bernard Baruch graduated from the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_College_of_New_York_8e2f.html" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> eight years later. He eventually became a broker and then a partner in the firm of A. Housman and Company. With his earnings and commissions he bought a seat on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Stock_Exchange_a4c5.html" title="New York Stock Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> for $18,000. There he amassed a fortune before the age of thirty via speculation in the sugar market. In 1903 he had his own brokerage firm and had gained the reputation of "The Lone Wolf on Wall Street" because of his refusal to join any other financial house. By 1910, he had become one of Wall Street's financial leaders.</p>

<p>During World War II he was a consultant on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homefront-United_States-World_War_II_1f76.html" title="Homefront-United States-World War II">economic issues</a> and proposed a number of measures including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../../../p/a/y/Pay-as-you-go_tax.html" title="Pay-as-you-go tax">pay-as-you-go tax</a> plan</li>

</ul>
<p>Baruch argued that in modern war there was little room for free enterprise. He said Washington must control all aspects of the economy and that both business and unions must be subservient to the nation's security interest. Furthermore, price controls were essential to prevent inflation and to maximize military power per dollar. He wanted labor to be organized to facilitate optimum production. Baruch believed labor should be cajoled, coerced, and controlled as necessary: a central government agency would orchestrate the allocation of labor. He supported what was known as a "work or fight" bill. Baruch advocated the creation of a permanent superagency similar to his old Industries Board. Thus Baruch proposed to freeze economic freedom during war in order to preserve it for peace. Obviously his approach enhanced the role of civilian businessmen and industrialists in determining what was needed and who would produce it.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Baruch's ideas were largely adopted, with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Byrnes_69c0.html" title="James Byrnes">James Byrnes</a> appointed to carry them out.</p>
<p>In 1946 he was appointed the United States representative to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Atomic_Energy_Commission_d4b8.html" title="United Nations Atomic Energy Commission">United Nations Atomic Energy Commission</a> (UNAEC) by President <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_S._Truman_d2df.html" title="Harry S.

<p>Baruch was a high profile public figure, and did his best thinking in Washington D.C's <a href="../../../l/a/f/Lafayette_Park_85cd.html" title="Lafayette Park">Lafayette Park</a> and in New York City's <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Park_8961.html" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>. It was not uncommon to see him discussing government affairs with other people while sitting on a park bench; this became his trademark. It was said that his office was a park bench near the White House.</p>
<p>In 1960, on his ninetieth birthday, a commemorative park bench in Lafayette Park across from the White House was dedicated to him. One would think after 55 years, he would stop to rest, but Baruch was not satisfied with staying put. He continued to advise on international affairs until his death on Sunday, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, in New York City, at the age of ninety-four.</p>
