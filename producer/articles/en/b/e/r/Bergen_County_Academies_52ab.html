<p>The Bergen County Academies is located on the John Grieco Campus of the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_County_Technical_Schools_37fb.html" title="Bergen County Technical Schools">Bergen County Technical Schools</a> District in Hackensack, NJ. In addition to the main, three floor building, the Environmental Science Center (ESC) and ten modular classrooms are used for academic purposes. Major construction is currently ongoing. A two floor addition is currently being built and renovations to various classrooms and the cafeteria are planned. <sup id="_ref-Budget_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Budget" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_County_Academies_52ab.html" title="Edit section: Program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Program</span></h2>
<p>The school's strengths are evident in its challenging academics, extracurricular activities, and distinguished faculty, many of whom are doctorates in their respective fields. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> The school also offers individual research opportunities which allow students to compete in science fairs on local to international levels. Seniors participate in Senior Experience, <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> in which they attend an all-day internship once a week instead of reporting to school. The school is heavily involved in the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_Program_866e.html" title="Advanced Placement Program">Advanced Placement</a> (AP) and <a href="../../../i/b/_/IB_Diploma_Programme_9f29.html" title="IB Diploma Programme">International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma</a> programs.</p>
<p>The school is divided into seven different college-preparatory academic programs. Each program is called an <i>academy</i> and offers a unique set of courses catering to a specific area. An eighth program, called the Global Leadership Exchange (GLE) exists for the classes of 2008 and 2009, but does not exist for later classes.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate a traditional liberal arts high school education in addition to higher-level education in specific fields, the school day is from 8:00 AM to 4:10 PM. Students are permitted to enter the building and work as early as 7:15 AM.</p>
<p>While the different academies are often treated as a single school within the district and the state, students apply to colleges and certain academic programs under the aegis of their respective academic programs, rather than BCA as a whole. For example, a student in the Science Academy would list the "Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology" on his college applications; Bergen County Academies itself has no <a href="../../../c/e/e/CEEB_code_c458.html" title="CEEB code">CEEB code</a>.</p>
<p>The school is also known for defying traditional methods and practices adopted by typical high schools. Students are not required to attend study hall during free time and are allowed to socialize in hallways. This time is referred to as "free mods". Homerooms are referred to as <i>IGS</i> (Information Gathering Sessions). All seniors participate in the Senior Experience internship, and classes are scheduled using <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flexible_modular_scheduling.html" title="Flexible modular scheduling">flexible modular scheduling</a>.</p>

<p>Though it is a public school, the <a href="http://www.bergen.org/admissions" class="external text" title="http://www.bergen.org/admissions" rel="nofollow">admission process</a> is selective. Tuition is free for residents of Bergen County and is paid for by the student's home school district, the State of New Jersey, and a number of public and private grants. Payments from sending districts are mandated by both state and county legislation affecting vocational and technical districts such as BCTS.</p>
<p>BCA serves all 70 municipalities of Bergen County. In recent years, a class of about 250 has been accepted from an applicant pool of 1100 - 1200. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup> Limits are held on the number of students that can be accepted from each district, with the limit being based on the size of the high school. The school reports that there are "4 or 5 districts where this is a problem." According to the <a href="http://www.bergen.org/update/update5.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bergen.org/update/update5.html" rel="nofollow">March/April 2001 special superintendent's report</a>, published in the wake of the 2001 funding controversy (see infra.), there exists an informal agreement that the Academies will accept at least one (qualified) student from each district.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_County_Academies_52ab.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>BCA began as a single academy, "The Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology" (AAST), which inducted students in fall 1992 for the graduating class of 1996. The school originally intended to provide a unique learning environment where classes were discussion-based and where students were not given grades. However, AAST quickly adopted more standard teaching methods, including the offering of <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_Program_866e.html" title="Advanced Placement Program">AP Programs</a>, largely due to pressure from parents. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>In 1997 the school expanded to include The Academy for Business and Computer Technology (ABCT), The Academy for Engineering Design Technology (AEDT), and The Academy for Medical Science Technology (AMST). The following year, three career institutes were added: The Culinary Arts Institute, The Power and Transportation Institute, and The Visual Arts and Graphic Communications Institute. Although the first class to apply to these three programs was in 1998 (the class of 2002), there was also a class of 2001. The students in this class began as freshmen at the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_County_Technical_High_School_0cc9.html" title="Bergen County Technical High School">Bergen County Technical High School</a> (which had also been located on the Hackensack campus), and subsequently became sophomores in the career institutes. In 1999, the career institutes were renamed to become academies: The Academy for Culinary Arts (ACA), The Academy for Power and Transportation (APT), and The Academy for Visual Arts and Graphic Communications (AVAGC).</p>
<p>In subsequent years, several of the newer programs underwent changes. Eventually all 7 programs were geared less towards career prep and more towards college prep, adopting a liberal arts curriculum with an extra focus on their respective fields. Beginning in 2002 with the entering class of 2006, ABCT changed its focus and became The Academy for Business and Finance (ABF), APT was replaced by The Academy for Telecommunications and Computer Science (ATCS), ACA added hotel administration to its coursework and became The Academy for Culinary Arts and Hotel Administration (ACAHA), and AVAGC expanded its scope to include performing arts, and became The Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The school itself also changed its name numerous times: first "Bergen County Regional Academies", then "Bergen Academies", then "Bergen County Academy" (with the singular denoting the unity of the seven programs), and then the present "Bergen County Academies".</p>
<p>Over the past several years, funding policies and admissions procedures have drawn the ire of many local districts. In 2001, a major dispute initiated by the Bergen County School Administrators' Association focused on what Paramus Superintendent Janice Dime called "elitism." <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> Several of these districts threatened to withdraw funding from the program. The Bergen County Technical Schools agreed to increase the transparency of the admissions process and enter into talks with a number of sending districts. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> For the 2006 - 2007 school year, districts pay annual tuition of $6600 for each student.<sup id="_ref-Budget_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Budget" title="">[1]</a></sup> For copies of Bergen Record articles on the subject of BCA admissions as well as a rebuttal to the original allegations by then-superintendent Dr. Grieco, see the <a href="http://www.bergen.org/update/update5.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bergen.org/update/update5.html" rel="nofollow">March/April 2001 special superintendent's report</a>.</p>

<p>The academies are listed here in order of identification numbers. The first three academies (AAST, AEDT, and AMST) share parallel schedules and science courses each year; they merge in core classes, while AEDT is more similar to AAST than AMST. The last three (ATCS, ACAHA, and AVPA) have science courses spread through the four years similarly, also sharing courses and classes. ABF provides its rigorous IB course. It has a science and intellectual focus while incorporating aspects of Telecom, Culinary, and the Visual and Performing Academies. The academies are commonly referred to, not by their acronyms, but rather by single-word nicknames: AAST is Science, AEDT is Engineering, ABF is Business, AMST is Medical, ACAHA is Culinary, ATCS is Telecommunications or Telecom, and AVPA is Visual/Performing/Music. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>

<p>AAST was founded on a charter school framework in 1992 with the mission of preparing interested students for careers in math and science by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment. Over time, AAST has departed a bit from this model and has become a more standard magnet school, drawing students from across the county. The roots of the program, however, can be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology and physics, and its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation. This academy celebrated ten years of excellence in 2006-07. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>

<p>This academy's core curriculum is similar to that of AAST. The two programs share the same core courses, but AEDT directs students away from some of AAST's focus on biology in order to provide room for courses in electronics and design increasingly in upper grades. However, a neuroscience course called Physiological Control Systems is required for all junior AEDT students. The program encourages students to take part in several competitions such as "BattleBots IQ". Students in AEDT take the required science courses with AAST, as well as its own engineering courses, like <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_engineering.html" title="Civil engineering">civil engineering</a> and Digital Electronics, so they are considered a busy academy. The only courses that are mandatory for AAST and not AEDT are biology electives. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>

<p>Students in this academy take more biology courses than other BCA students. During the ninth grade, in addition to Biology, students explore epidemiology, pharmacology, and science methods in their Medical Science Seminar. To make up for taking one less year of physics, the students take required college-level medical courses including Biotechnology and Zoology in the tenth grade, Anatomy and Physiology in eleventh grade, and Bioethics in twelfth. In addition, they are required to take four more medical electives before graduation. AP courses such as AP Chemistry, Biology, or Psychology may count for three of these electives. Additional electives in biology include Botany, Developmental Biology, Experimental Science, Molecular Biology, Psychology, Virology, and Immunology. Medical students typically take literature and history courses alongside business students. These students are parallel with AAST and AEDT, but tend to differ increasingly in the upper grades. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_County_Academies_52ab.html" title="Edit section: Scheduling">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scheduling</span></h2>
<p>BCA students observe a form of <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flexible_modular_scheduling.html" title="Flexible modular scheduling">flexible modular scheduling</a>. Robert Aloia, superintendent of schools, suggested a new schedule in the spring of 2006, to be implemented in the 2006-2007 school year, to relieve the guidance department which had previously manually scheduled 1100 students and 100 teachers. The new schedule consolidates three-mod periods into hours, institutes a common lunchtime (from module nine to module fifteen <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup>), and staggers classes throughout the week. It is criticized because it has exceeded the capacity of the cafeterias during lunch, eliminated a number of classes that met exclusively in two-mod periods, and required amendments to the faculty contract that had not yet been negotiated. It was met with disapproval by the staff and more vocal resistance by students and parents; Aloia postponed implementation for an unspecified period but promised to revisit the issue in 2007. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Each day is divided into twenty-five sections, the first being IGS. The other twenty-four, called modules, last seventeen minutes; three free minutes between each module are used to navigate to the next class. Classes typically last three modules, or fifty-seven minutes (or one hour, adding the additional three minutes). Other classes are two modules long, and some classes, notably Wednesday Labs and Wednesday projects, last four and six modules respectively.</p>
<p>Class time is variable, ranging from four hours (3 mods, 4 times) per week for AP programs or high-level classes to two hours per week for electives, for example. Due to this scheduling method, students generally have each class two or three times a week (with a few exceptions, notably <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_Program_866e.html" title="Advanced Placement Program">AP</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Baccalaureate_b6c1.html" title="International Baccalaureate">IB</a> programs), as opposed to standard schedules in which each class meets every day. Exceptions to these principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students may schedule individually with teachers; this is available only for independent studies such as research or choir.</li>
<li>Students with labs meet for four mods each Wednesday for laboratory work, relevant to their chemistry, physics, or biology courses, in rotation.</li>
<li>Students with projects meet for six mods each Wednesday for classes that are more project-driven than usual courses. Since 2003, Wednesday projects have become increasingly restricted by required projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, between classes are "free mods" (modules with no class). Most students take electives, socialize, do homework, study, or use the computer labs during this time. Most students have a free mod each day during the scheduled lunchtime, somewhere between 11:10 and 1:10, and there are upper and lower limits to a student's free mods (30 and 15, respectively). <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup> Students were once required to sit in the school office during their free mods, but in 2004 this was replaced by a more traditional detention.</p>
<p>During the final three modules on Wednesday, the students report to their elected clubs. These include chess club, homework club, club for course help, and break-dancing club. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>

The site debuted to the public on January 27, 1997, originally located at <i>teenvoice.com</i> and known as <i>in-site</i>. Beginning in 1998, the website officially changed its name to <i>Teenvoice</i>. In 2000, Women Express, Inc., publisher of <i><a href="http://www.teenvoices.com" class="external text" title="http://www.teenvoices.com" rel="nofollow">Teen Voices</a></i> magazine, threatened the school with a copyright infringement lawsuit for using the name Teenvoice, so the name of the website changed to FreshAngles on May 9, 2001. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>FreshAngles was much more prominent in the past. Originally, students participated in this project by taking elective classes in Journalism and Wire Editing, where students learned how to acquire articles from the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">AP</a> wire. At one time, the site had a staff of over 220 students. As of January 2001, just before Teenvoice became FreshAngles, the site was receiving over one million hits per month. Companies such as Random House and Sony often sent the staff music, books, and electronics for review well before the commercial release date. Teenvoice also had collaborations with <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University's</a> <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/" class="external text" title="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/" rel="nofollow">Center for New Media</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_W._Friendly_771a.html" title="Fred W.

The project suffered throughout the Teenvoice to FreshAngles transition, as it saw a reduction in website visitors, staff members, and lost contact with prior collaborators. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>FreshAngles began to gain popularity again, but a crash of the server lasting from 2005 to 2006 temporarily destroyed the website and the articles archived on it. Beginning in 2007, FreshAngles started back up on an outsourced server, run by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Society_of_Newspaper_Editors_c0e3.html" title="American Society of Newspaper Editors">American Society of Newspaper Editors</a>. <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>

<p>The Academies' <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleBots_fb9d.html" title="BattleBots">BattleBots</a> IQ team, known as the <a href="http://www.bergen.org/Battlebots/" class="external text" title="http://www.bergen.org/Battlebots/" rel="nofollow">Titanium Knights</a>, won the 2006 national heavyweight championship in the high school division with the robot <i>E2V2</i>, <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup> and won two other awards for another 120lb robot, <i>Knightrous</i>. In previous years, the team has won second, third, and fourth place titles in BBIQ, and affiliated student teams have won numerous awards in <a href="http://www.nerc.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.nerc.us/" rel="nofollow">Northeast Robotics Club</a> events.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/o/s/Mission%7E_Bossou_1608.html" title="Mission: Bossou">Mission: Bossou</a> is a charitable project of the students of Bergen County Academies. Its official purpose is <i>to deliver food as quickly as possible to people suffering from hunger in Bossou</i> [<a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea.html" title="Guinea">Guinea</a>] <i>and surrounding communities</i>.</p>
<p>The Bergen County Academies is also home to a large <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> student group. Students from the chapter participate in biweekly letter-writing campaigns, bring speakers to campus, lobby government officials, and attend local, regional, and national conferences on <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Academies also have a strong debating tradition. The Academies' <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policy_debate.html" title="Policy debate">policy debate</a> program finished first in Bergen County in 2005-2006, beating Tenafly High School (which had won the previous six years) and the Dwight-Englewood School. There are three levels of competition: Novice, Junior Varsity, and the highly selective Varsity level that accepts only six teams, with more than twice that number usually trying out. During the 2006-2007 school year, however, there was no novice debate program, due to a lack of freshman debaters. The single freshman team competed at the JV level instead.<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>The Bioscience Research Program enables up to 40 students per year from any academy to learn how biologists work as scientists in the research laboratory. The program consists of a series of four courses: Experimental Science 1 and 2, and Research 1 and 2. The Experimental Science courses focus on learning how the research investigation process works, and the Research courses allow students to design and complete a project in an area of biology. The goal is publication of their work via competition in science fairs during trimester 3 of the second year. A new cell biology research laboratory under construction planned to be open in February 2007.
