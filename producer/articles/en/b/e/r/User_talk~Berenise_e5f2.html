<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/User_talk%7EBerenise_e5f2.html" title="Edit section: User:Berenise possibly Robert Clark Young?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">User:Berenise</a> possibly Robert Clark Young?</span></h2>
<p>This question is posed to <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">User:Berenise</a>: Are you <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Clark_Young_c34b.html" title="Robert Clark Young">Robert Clark Young</a>? I ask this because I previously discovered Young editing the article about himself (a conflict with Wikipedia guidelines since it was done secretly) and almost all of your edits on Wikipedia have been to this article. I had a suspicion before but assumed good intentions and let it go. However, despite the issues I raised on the article's talk page you went ahead and deleted all online references in Young's article, which ended up removing almost anything negative about Young (while this doesn't personally bother me, since I generally agree with Young's assertions about Vice--if still having questions about certain possible mistakes in Young's article--but encyclopedia articles need to be ballanced). Anyway, I have no desire to ask for a checkuser on you. An easier way to clear this up is for you to use the e-mail function to contact me. Since you have publically stated that you are a sociologist, you should have a university e-mail in your name. I will not reveal your name to anyone upon receiving this e-mail proof and will vouch publically that you are not Young and also make a complete apology for saying this. In fact, I apologize in advance for asking this. However, since Young has a history of editing this article about himself and since your user contributions show an almost exclusive focus on the Young article, I hope you will understand why I ask this. If you are Young, you are welcome to edit this article as long as you do it publically so that people can take that into consideration of your edits. (Shoot, if you're Young I'd like to say how much I enjoyed reading your book One of the Guys and also ask, when's your next novel coming out?) If you are not Young, I apologize for saying all of this and look forward to clearing this up.

<p>[copied from <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">User talk:Jmabel</a>]:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I would like your feedback on the use of newspapers as a source instead of blogs. In the case of the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Clark_Young_c34b.html" title="Robert Clark Young">Robert Clark Young</a> article, I have found newspaper sources that cover much of the same material as the blogs that have been used in the article. When I replaced the blog sources with the newspaper sources, Alabamaboy reverted every single one of my edits. Also, very strangely, he accused me on the discussion page of being Mr. Young himself!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is the Wikipedia Guideline I am trying to follow with my edits:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Publications with teams of fact-checkers, reporters, editors, lawyers, and managers — like the New York Times or The Times of London — are likely to be reliable, and are regarded as reputable sources for the purposes of Wikipedia. At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, I have replaced the blog sources with newspaper sources. Again, let me stress that this has not led to much change in the text of the article itself--what I'm trying to do here is change the nature of the sources so that they themselves comply with Wikipedia Guidelines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Could Alabamaboy and I get some feedback on this? I wonder if you could go over to the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Clark_Young_c34b.html" title="Robert Clark Young">Robert Clark Young</a> history and compare both versions of the sourcing--the one using newspapers, and the one using blogs. Thank you. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">Berenise</a> 01:16, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two remarks:
<ol>
<li>I've crossed paths with Alabamaboy quite a few times, and he usually knows what he's doing. Yes, in the case of an article where the subject of the article has been known to meddle with the article and where a new user appears and seems focused almost entirely on that article (I didn't verify this independently, if it is a mischaracterization it is his not mine), it is reasonable to ask that person if they are the same person as the subject of the article. Conversely, it would also be reasonable to assume good faith.</li>
<li>In general, if particular material can be cited from newspapers rather than blogs, we should prefer the newspapers. The only exceptions I can think of offhand are (1) if the newspaper was quoting or paraphrasing the blog (which makes the blog the primary source and the newspaper secondary) or (2) if the blog is that of someone directly involved in the story. For an example of the second case, (and I have given only a brief glance at the article), it would be entirely appropriate to quote Robert Clark Young's own blog, if he has one, or that of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melany_Neilson_d293.html" title="Melany Neilson">Melany Neilson</a>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<dd>While I was writing this here, Alamababoy was writing the following on my user talk page:
<dl>
<dd>You should be aware that there are three reasons the article was reverted: 1) <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">Berenise</a> made the changes despite a lack of consensus and my objections on the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Clark_Young_45a8.html" title="Talk:Robert Clark Young">Talk:Robert Clark Young</a>. In short, the online references are refered to in the newspaper and print articles, making the online sources primary sources. The article also has many print sources which complement and add to the online sources. 2) The edits made the article less NPOV b/c they removed opposing viewpoints. While these references may be online, they are from credible named sources who are considered experts in their respected areas. 3) There is a strong possibility that <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">Berenise</a> is Robert Clark Young. Young previously edited the article about himself and most of <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">Berenise</a>'s edits since coming to Wikipedia have been to the Young article. I'm trying to clear this up with <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerenise_0272.html" title="User:Berenise">Berenise</a>; once she proves she is not Young I'd love to get opinions from other editors about this situation. For full details, see <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Clark_Young_45a8.html" title="Talk:Robert Clark Young">Talk:Robert Clark Young</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlabamaboy_1073.html" title="User:Alabamaboy">Alabamaboy</a> 01:24, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have no opinion on the claim that you might be Robert Clark Young, but it sounds like the blogs are the primary sources, in which case (as I wrote above, not knowing this) they should be included.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, Alabamaboy and I are two different people. Honest. And neither of us is Robert Clark Young. Or, at least, I'm not. (If I used smilies, I'd put one here.) -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:32, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thought I'd drop a line to let you know many editors here don't like people to cut and paste messages across too many of their talk pages. Bringing in a few editors on this is great; posting your message on a ton of talk pages could bring a backlash. Just wanted to let you know.
