<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Gilpin_5fa8.html" title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
<p>Gilpin descended from a <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westmorland.html" title="Westmorland">Westmorland</a> family, and was born in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentmere.html" title="Kentmere">Kentmere</a>.</p>
<p>He was educated at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Queen%27s_College%2C_Oxford_8b71.html" title="The Queen's College, Oxford">Queens College</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>, graduating B.A. in <a href="../../../1/5/4/1540.html" title="1540">1540</a>, M.A., in <a href="../../../1/5/4/1542.html" title="1542">1542</a> and B.D. in <a href="../../../1/5/4/1549.html" title="1549">1549</a>. He was elected fellow of Queens and ordained in 1542; subsequently he was elected <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Church%2C_Oxford_3eb9.html#Governing_Body" title="Christ Church, Oxford">Student</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Church%2C_Oxford_3eb9.html" title="Christ Church, Oxford">Christ Church</a>.</p>
<p>At Oxford he first adhered to the conservative side, and defended the doctrines of the church against <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hooper_4fc5.html" title="John Hooper">John Hooper</a>; but his confidence was somewhat shaken by another public disputation which he had with <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietro_Martire_Vermigli_7cc6.html" title="Pietro Martire Vermigli">Pietro Martire Vermigli</a>. In <a href="../../../1/5/5/1552.html" title="1552">1552</a> he preached a sermon on sacrilege before <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Edward_VI_0981.html" title="King Edward VI">King Edward VI</a>, which was duly published and displays the high ideal he had formed of the clerical office. About the same time he was presented to the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicar.html" title="Vicar">vicarage</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norton.html" title="Norton">Norton</a>, in the diocese of <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a>, and obtained a licence, through <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cecil_9f19.html" title="William Cecil">William Cecil</a>, as a general preacher throughout the kingdom as long as the king lived.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Gilpin_5fa8.html" title="Edit section: Foreign theological pursuits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign theological pursuits</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_I_of_England_3d2b.html" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a>'s accession he went abroad to pursue his theological investigations at <a href="../../../l/e/u/Leuven.html" title="Leuven">Leuven</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>; and from a letter of his own, dated Leuven, <a href="../../../1/5/5/1554.html" title="1554">1554</a>, we get a glimpse of the quiet student rejoicing in an excellent library belonging to a monastery of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minorites.html" title="Minorites">Minorites</a>. Returning to England towards the close of Queen Mary's reign, he was invested by his mother's uncle, <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthbert_Tunstall_d5cd.html" title="Cuthbert Tunstall">Cuthbert Tunstall</a>, bishop of Durham, with the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdeacon.html" title="Archdeacon">archdeaconry</a> of <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham.html" title="Durham">Durham</a>, to which the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rectory.html" title="Rectory">rectory</a> of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easington.html" title="Easington">Easington</a> was annexed. The freedom of his attacks on the vices, and especially the clerical vices, of his times excited hostility against him, and he was formally brought before the bishop on a charge consisting of thirteen articles. Tunstall, however, not only dismissed the case, but presented the offender with the rich living of <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houghton-le-Spring_6a12.html" title="Houghton-le-Spring">Houghton-le-Spring</a>; and when the accusation was again brought forward, he again protected him. Enraged at this defeat, Gilpin's enemies laid their complaint before <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Bonner_e7bc.html" title="Edmund Bonner">Edmund Bonner</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, who secured a royal warrant for his apprehension. Upon this Gilpin prepared for martyrdom; and, having ordered his house-steward to provide him with a long garment, that he might go the more comely to the stake, he set out for London. Fortunately, however, for him, he broke his leg on the journey, and his arrival was thus delayed till the news of Queen Mary's death freed him from further danger. He at once returned to Houghton, and there he continued to labor till his death on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">4 March</a> <a href="../../../1/5/8/1583.html" title="1583">1583</a>. When the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> bishops were deprived he was offered the see of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlisle.html" title="Carlisle">Carlisle</a>; but he declined this honor and also the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provost.html" title="Provost">provostship</a> of Queen's, which was offered him in <a href="../../../1/5/6/1560.html" title="1560">1560</a>. At Houghton his course of life was a ceaseless round of benevolent activity.</p>
<p>In June 1560 he entertained <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cecil%2C_1st_Baron_Burghley_28f6.html" title="William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley">Cecil</a> and Dr <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Wotton_7cdc.html" title="Nicholas Wotton">Nicholas Wotton</a> on their way to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. His hospitable manner of living was the admiration of all. His living was a comparatively rich one, his house was better than many bishops palaces, and his position was that of a clerical magnate. In his household he spent every fortnight forty bushels of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cereal.html" title="Cereal">corn</a>, twenty bushels of malt and an ox, besides a proportional quantity of other kinds of provisions. Strangers and travellers found a ready reception; and even their horses were treated with so much care that it was humorously said that, if one were turned loose in any part of the country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton. Every Sunday from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michaelmas.html" title="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a> till <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a> was a public day with Gilpin. For the reception of his parishioners he had three tables well covered, one for gentlemen, the second for husbandmen, the third for day-laborers; and this piece of hospitality he never omitted, even when losses or scarcity made its continuance difficult. He built and endowed a grammar-school at a cost of upwards of Â£500, educated and maintained a large number of poor children at his own charge, and provided the more promising pupils with means of studying at the universities. So many young people flocked to his school that there was not accommodation for them in Houghton, and he had to fit up part of his house as a boarding establishment. Grieved at the ignorance and superstition which the remissness of the clergy permitted to flourish in the neighboring <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish.html" title="Parish">parishes</a>, he used every year to visit the most neglected parts of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westmorland.html" title="Westmorland">Westmorland</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>; and that his own flock might not suffer, he was at the expense of a constant assistant. Among his parishioners he was looked up to as a judge, and did great service in preventing lawsuits amongst them. If an industrious man suffered a loss, he delighted to make it good; if the harvest was bad, he was liberal in the remission of <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tithe.html" title="Tithe">tithes</a>. The boldness which he could display at need is well illustrated by his action in regard to <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duel.html" title="Duel">duelling</a>. Finding one day a challenge-glove stuck up on the door of a church where he was to preach, he took it down with his own hand, and proceeded to the pulpit to inveigh against the unchristian custom. His theological position was not in accord with any of the religious parties of his age, and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ewart_Gladstone_b6ab.html" title="William Ewart Gladstone">Gladstone</a> thought that the catholicity of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_a5cf.html" title="Anglican Church">Anglican Church</a> was better exemplified in his career than in those of more prominent <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastic.html" title="Ecclesiastic">ecclesiastics</a> (pref. to A. W. Hutton's edition of S. R. Maitland's <i>Essays on the Reformation</i>). He was not satisfied with the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> settlement, had great respect for the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_fathers.html" title="Church fathers">Church fathers</a>, and was with difficulty induced to subscribe. Archbishop Sandys' views on the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> horrified him; but on the other hand he maintained friendly relations with Bishop Pilkington and Thomas Lever, and the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritans</a> had some hope of his support.</p>
