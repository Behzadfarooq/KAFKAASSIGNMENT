<p>Although his private life was rather known and even controversial, Bernhard was generally seen as a charming and popular figure among the majority of Dutch people for his performance as a pilot and activities as a liaisons officer during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and rebuilding afterwards, or even for helping out specific individuals.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernhard_of_Lippe-Biesterfeld_37a8.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Bernhard was born <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count.html" title="Count">Count</a> <i>Bernhard Leopold Friedrich Eberhard Julius Kurt Karl Gottfried Peter of Lippe-Biesterfeld</i> in <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jena.html" title="Jena">Jena</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, the elder son of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld (younger brother of the reigning Prince of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality_of_Lippe_97f4.html" title="Principality of Lippe">Lippe</a>) and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroness.html" title="Baroness">Baroness</a> Armgard von Sierstorpff-Cramm. Because the marriage of his parents did not conform with the marriage laws of the House of Lippe, Bernhard was only born with the title of "count". In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> the Reigning Prince of Lippe, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_IV%2C_Prince_of_Lippe_2728.html" title="Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe">Leopold IV</a>, gave Bernhard the title of "Prince of Lippe-Biesterfeld".</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Bernhard's family lost their German <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principality.html" title="Principality">principality</a> and the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue.html" title="Revenue">revenue</a> that came with it. But the family was still wealthy and Bernhard spent his early years at Reckenwalde, the family's new <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estate_%28house%29.html" title="Estate (house)">estate</a> in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Prussia_9913.html" title="East Prussia">East Prussia</a> (now Woynovo in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> ), near the city of Züllichau (<a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulech%C3%B3w.html" title="Sulechów">Sulechów</a>). He received his early education at home. When he was twelve, he was sent to <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarding_school.html" title="Boarding school">board</a> at the <a href="../../../g/y/m/Gymnasium_%28school%29.html" title="Gymnasium (school)">gymnasium</a> in Züllichau and several years later to board at a gymnasium in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, from which he <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graduation.html" title="Graduation">graduated</a> in 1929.</p>
<p>Bernhard as a boy suffered from poor health. Doctors predicted that he would not live very long. This prediction might have been the key to Berhard's reckless driving and the risks that he took in the second world war and thereafter. The prince wrecked several cars and planes in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Bernhard studied <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Lausanne_9cfc.html" title="University of Lausanne">University of Lausanne</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and in Berlin, where he acquired a taste for fast <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">cars</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_riding.html" title="Horse riding">horse riding</a>, and big-game <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting.html" title="Hunting">hunting</a> <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safari.html" title="Safari">safaris</a>. He was reckless and was nearly killed in a <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boat.html" title="Boat">boating</a> accident and an <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">airplane</a> crash, and he suffered a broken neck and crushed ribs in a 160 <a href="../../../k/m/2F/Km_h_cbf6.html" title="Km/h">km/h</a> (100 <a href="../../../m/i/2F/Mi_h_c48d.html" title="Mi/h">mi/h</a>) <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_crash.html" title="Car crash">car crash</a> in 1938.</p>
<p>Bernhard joined the NSDAP, the SA and a special branch of the SS called the "Reiter SS" (SS on horseback). The Prince was not a Nazi by conviction; these memberships made life easier for an ambitious young man. People defending the Prince have stated that membership was necessary to be a student. The Prince later denied these well-documented memberships. Whatever the case, he was not politically active and although this German aristocrat was never a fierce champion of democracy, there are no accounts of him ever having made fascist or anti-semitic remarks.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernhard_of_Lippe-Biesterfeld_37a8.html" title="Edit section: Entry into the House of Orange">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Entry into the House of Orange</span></h2>
<p>In the 1930s, with the rise of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, Prince Bernhard's younger brother Aschwin publicly declared his support for the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazis.html" title="Nazis">Nazi Party</a>. Prince Bernhard was a member of the honorary German Reiter <a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_d53a.html" title="SS">SS</a> Corps (SS Cavalry Corps). The Prince eventually went to work for the German chemical company, <a href="../../../i/g/_/IG_Farben_2057.html" title="IG Farben">IG Farben</a>. After a period of training, he became <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary.html" title="Secretary">Secretary</a> to the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Directors_5676.html" title="Board of Directors">Board of Directors</a> at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> office in 1935. Because he was a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> and a Royal, Bernhard was acceptable to Queen <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelmina_of_the_Netherlands_6678.html" title="Wilhelmina of the Netherlands">Wilhelmina of the Netherlands</a> as a suitable husband for her daughter, Princess Juliana. However, Bernhard's appropriateness as the consort of the future Queen would later become a matter of public debate.</p>
<p>Prince Bernhard's political affiliations with the Nazi regime have received much attention. Various members of his family and acquaintances were aligned with the Nazis prior to and during the war - a number of these being entertained shortly before and joining the royal wedding. Protocol demanded that the Prince-Consort be invited to an audience with his head of state, the German dictator Adolf Hitler. The atmosphere was less than cordial. The dictator is reported to have made some small talk about tourism on the Rhine and reportedly hailed the union between the Prince and Princess Juliana as a great alliance of Germanic nations. The Prince and Hitler met only once. Later, at his dinner table Hitler called Berhard "a complete idiot".</p>
<p>The Prince's brother Prince Aschwin of Lippe-Biesterfeld was serving his country as an officer in the German army. Although the secret sevices on both sides were interested in this peculiar pair of brothers, no improper contacts or leaks of information were discovered. The Prince showed himself to be a loyal Dutch citizen and officer. He cut off relations with those members of his family who were enthusiastic Nazis. As a sign of his "Dutchness" he spoke only <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> when negotiating the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands. The Prince was known to be very fond of smart uniforms and medals. He made a point of wearing his medals in the English "Court style". The Dutch armed forces wear their medals in a manner that is copied from the Prussian Army. The Prince's deliberate disobedience of the regulations was not widely noticed but it is a clear sign of his allegiance .</p>
<p>The Prince's mother was no admirer of the Nazis and got into trouble for refusing to hoist a <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">swastika</a> flag on her country seat in Reckenwalde. The Nazi government did not take kindly to her, as the mother of an allied general.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernhard_of_Lippe-Biesterfeld_37a8.html" title="Edit section: World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h2>
<p>Prince Bernhard began to make himself popular and trusted in the eyes of the Dutch people at the outset of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. During the German Invasion, the Prince, carrying a machine gun, organised the palace guards into a combat group and shot at German planes. The royal family fled the Netherlands and took refuge in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. Once safely there, Princess Juliana and the children then went on to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, where they remained until the end of the war.</p>
<p>In England, Prince Bernhard asked to work in British <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence_%28information_gathering%29.html" title="Intelligence (information gathering)">Intelligence</a> but the War <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiralty.html" title="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>, and later <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Eisenhower_f660.html" title="Dwight Eisenhower">General Eisenhower's</a> Allied Command offices, did not trust him sufficiently to allow him access to intelligence information. However, on the recommendation of Bernhard's friend and admirer <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a>, he was later permitted to work in the war planning councils.</p>
<p>In 1940 flight Lieutenant Murray Payne instructed the prince to fly a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Spitfire</a>. The prince made 1000 flight-hours in a Spitfire with the RAF's 322 "Dutch" squadron wrecking two planes during landings. As " Wing Commander Gibbs ( RAF )" Prince Bernhard flew over occupied Europe in a <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-24.html" title="B-24">B-24</a> bomber attacking <a href="../../../v/-/1/V-1.html" title="V-1">V-1</a> launch pads, he was in a <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-25.html" title="B-25">B-25</a> Mitchell bomber bombing <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisa.html" title="Pisa">Pisa</a>, over the Atlantic ocean bombing a submarine and in an L-5 reconnaissance plane over occupied Europe. Prince Bernhard was awarded the Dutch Flying Cross for his " ability and perseverance" (Dutch: "bekwaamheid en volharding"). (source: Interview with the Prince,1993, Henny Meyer, published in " Het Vliegerskruis" 1997)</p>
<p>In 1941 Prince Bernhard was given the honorary rank of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wing_Commander_%28rank%29_fd97.html" title="Wing Commander (rank)">wing commander</a> in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>. He then trained as a pilot and gained his wings later that same year.</p>
<p>From 1942 to 1944 Bernhard flew as a pilot with the Royal Air Force. He also helped organise the Dutch resistance movement and acted as personal secretary for Queen Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>Queen Wilhelmina erased the word "honorary" (the exact words were " à la suite") in the decree that promoted Bernhard to General. In this unconstitutional manner she gave this Royal Prince a position that was never intended by either parliament or her ministers. The minister of defence did not choose to correct the monarch and the Prince took a real and important role in the Dutch Armed forces.</p>
<p>By 1944, Prince Bernhard became commander of the Dutch armed forces. After the liberation of the Netherlands, he returned with his family where he became active in the negotiations for the German surrender. He was present during the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice.html" title="Armistice">armistice</a> negotiations and German surrender in <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel_de_Wereld_6dc6.html" title="Hotel de Wereld">Hotel de Wereld</a> ("<i>The World Hotel</i>") in <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wageningen.html" title="Wageningen">Wageningen</a> in The Netherlands on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_5.html" title="May 5">May 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. The Prince was a genuine war hero in the eyes of most of the Dutch and even kept cordial relations with the communists who fought against the Nazis. In the post-war years the popular and very regal, glamourous and well-connected Prince earned respect for his hard work in helping to reinvigorate the economy of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>After the war the position of Inspector General was created for the Prince. He was made a member of the board of supervisors of <a href="../../../f/o/k/Fokker.html" title="Fokker">Fokker</a> Aircraft, <a href="../../../k/l/m/KLM_7464.html" title="KLM">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</a>, and within a few years was invited to serve as an advisor or non-executive director of numerous corporations and institutions. After a 1952 trip with Queen Juliana to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, Prince Bernhard was heralded by the media as a business ambassador <i>extraordinaire</i> for the Netherlands. With his global contacts, in May 1954 he was a key figure in organising a meeting at the Bilderberg Hotel in the Netherlands for the business elite and intellectuals of the Western World to discuss the economic problems in the face of the then growing threat from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>. As a result of the success of this first meeting, it would become an annual affair known as the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilderberg_Group_5eac.html" title="Bilderberg Group">Bilderberg Group</a>. The idea for the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, first proposed by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Schuman_4418.html" title="Robert Schuman">Robert Schuman</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_9.html" title="May 9">May 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, was encouraged at Bilderberg.</p>
<p>Though generally not reported in the Dutch press, growing strain arose between Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard during this time. The jet-setting Bernard used his many absences from the country to carry on numerous <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affair.html" title="Affair">affairs</a>, while throwing lavish parties at the various Dutch embassies.</p>
<p>Prince Bernhard was a very outspoken person, who often flouted protocol by making personal remarks on subjects about which he felt deeply. Almost until his last day he called for more recognition for the Polish WWII veterans, who played such an important role in the liberation of the Netherlands. It was only after his death that the Dutch government took the decision to publicly recognize the important role of the Polish army in the liberation of the Netherlands. On 31 May 2006 at the Binnenhof in The Hague, Her Majesty <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Beatrix_fd77.html" title="Queen Beatrix">Queen Beatrix</a> awarded the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade with the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_William_ec17.html" title="Order of William">Order of William</a>, the highest possible decoration for the armed forces.</p>

Prince Bernhard, Amsterdam, 1999.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As a man Prince Bernhard was a "larger than life" figure with a large network and a cosmopolitan lifestyle. Rumours, gossip and anecdotes about him are widespread. Some of the "facts" that have been printed about him are clearly not true. Some of the Prince's work for charity was never made public. On the other hand there were business deals and parts of the Prince's private and political life that were distinctly shadowy.</p>
<p>The following list of scandals and rumours is therefore by no means complete. On the other hand there is no complete list of the Prince's achievements and charitable work.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 1950s Prince Bernhard was involved in what some considered a personal vendetta against <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greet_Hofmans_4709.html" title="Greet Hofmans">Greet Hofmans</a>, a faith healer and hand layer. For nine years she was a friend and advisor of Queen Juliana, often residing at Palace Soestdijk. Originally, Hofmans was introduced to Queen Juliana on the initiative of Prince Bernhard in 1948 to treat the eye sickness of Princess Marijke Christina. This illness arose after Juliana was infected with rubella during pregnancy. Hofmans developed a great influence on the queen, encouraging pacifist ideas. In the period of the Cold War this caused a crisis in the royal household. Reputedly it reached the point where it threatened the marriage of Juliana and Bernhard.</p>
<p>Outside the Netherlands a great deal was written over the Hofmans affair. On 13 June 1956 an article appeared in the German magazine Der Spiegel with the title <i>Zwischen Königin und Rasputin</i>, literally meaning <i>Between queen and Rasputin</i>, which, as the title already indicates painted a less than flattering picture of Hofmans. Later on, Bernhard admitted that he personally provided the information for the article. It is thought that by doing this he hoped to have Hofmans removed from the court. The prime minister, Willem Drees, had to act and appointed a committee of three wise men (elder statesmen) to advise the royal couple. The Prince got what he wanted; Hofmans was banished and various friends and supporters of the Queen in the Royal household had to give up their office. The report of the three wise men seems to have been mislaid in the archives.</p>
<p>By the 1970s, Prince Bernhard served on more than 300 corporate boards or committees worldwide and was loudly praised in the Netherlands for his very active efforts to promote the economic well-being of the country. But scandal rocked the Royal family in 1976 when it was revealed that Prince Bernhard had accepted a US$1.1 million <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bribe.html" title="Bribe">bribe</a> from U.S. aircraft manufacturer, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Corporation_54f8.html" title="Lockheed Corporation">Lockheed Corporation</a> to influence the Dutch government's purchase of <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-104_Starfighter_eca8.html" title="F-104 Starfighter">fighter aircraft</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands_0cd1.html" title="Prime Minister of the Netherlands">Prime Minister of the Netherlands</a> <a href="../../../j/o/o/Joop_den_Uyl_c840.html" title="Joop den Uyl">Joop den Uyl</a> ordered an inquiry into the affair while Prince Bernhard refused to answer reporters' questions, stating: "I am above such things." <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1387624,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1387624,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>The Dutch and international press headlined the stories for months, providing proof of Prince Bernhard's German SS participation and his numerous extra-marital affairs, including the purchase of a luxurious <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> apartment for his <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistress_%28lover%29.html" title="Mistress (lover)">mistress</a> Helene Grinda, with whom he had an <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimate.html" title="Illegitimate">illegitimate</a> daughter, Alexia. (Bernhard has a second illegitimate daughter, Alicia, in the USA.)</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_26.html" title="August 26">August 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, a toned-down, but nonetheless devastating, report on Prince Bernhard's activities was released to a shocked Dutch public. The Prince's own letter in 1974 to Lockheed Corporation that demanded "commissions" be paid to him on Dutch government aircraft purchases was damaging evidence of improper conduct. Criminal charges were not laid by the government due to threats by Queen Juliana that she would <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdication.html" title="Abdication">abdicate</a> if her husband were prosecuted.</p>
<p>Prince Bernhard resigned as Inspector-General of the Dutch armed forces and agreed, although he was given an "honourable discharge", not to wear his uniforms. Prince Bernhard did wear his uniform at the funeral of Lord Mountbatten of Burma and at a D-day commemoration. The prince was evenually laid to rest in his Royal Dutch Air Force uniform.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Joop den Uyl made a statement in Parliament and told the delegates that the prince would also resign from his various high profile positions in businesses, charities, and other institutions. The <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands_States-General_43ba.html" title="Netherlands States-General">States-General</a> voted against criminal prosecution. Prince Bernhard turned over presidency of the international <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wildlife_Fund_c006.html" title="World Wildlife Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> to the British <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Edinburgh_458a.html" title="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a>. The Dutch Royal family worked hard to rehabilitate the Prince's name, but other scandals were to be revealed in later years.</p>
<p>In 1988, Prince Bernhard and Princess Juliana sold two paintings from their personal collection to raise money for the World Wildlife Fund. The paintings sold for <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">GBP</a>700 000, which was deposited in a Swiss WWF bank account. In 1989, however, Charles de Haes, director-general of the WWF, transferred GBP500 000 back to Bernhard, for what De Haes called a private project. In 1991, newspapers reported what this private project was: Prince Bernhard had hired <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenaries</a> - mostly British - to fight against <a href="../../../p/o/a/Poaching.html" title="Poaching">poachers</a> in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_reserve.html" title="Nature reserve">nature reserves</a>. The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramilitary.html" title="Paramilitary">paramilitary</a> group infiltrated organisations profiting from illegal trade in <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivory.html" title="Ivory">ivory</a> in order to arrest them.</p>
<p>This 'Project Lock', as it was called, seemed to have backfired enormously, however. The "private army" of Bernhard had not only infiltrated in the illegal trade, they were also participating in it. To make things worse, <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> reporter Kevin Dowling discovered that the South-African army was also involved in the trade, hinting at connections between the army of Bernhard and the WWF and the struggle for maintaining <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a>. Moreover, he claimed members of the South-African run counterinsurgency unit <a href="../../../k/o/e/Koevoet.html" title="Koevoet">Koevoet</a> (<a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>/<a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> for "crowbar"), responsible for the Boipatong massacre in 1992, were trained under Project Lock.</p>
<p>In 1995, <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> called upon the Kumleben Commission to investigate, among other things, the role of the WWF in apartheid South Africa. In the report that followed, it was suggested that mercenaries from Project Lock had been planning assassinations of <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_National_Congress_8427.html" title="African National Congress">ANC</a> members and that mercenaries had been running training camps in the wildlife reserves, training fighters from the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorist</a> groups <a href="../../../u/n/i/UNITA_8a16.html" title="UNITA">UNITA</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renamo.html" title="Renamo">Renamo</a>. Although Prince Bernhard was never accused of any crime in its context, the Project Lock scandal dealt another damaging blow to the Prince's name.</p>
<p>The Prince is also alleged to have sent a letter to Adolf Hitler offering the Prince's support in exchange for Hitler's support of Bernhard as "Stadhouder" of the occupied Netherlands. These allegations have never been substantiated and no letter has ever been discovered.</p>
<p>Yet more controversy came on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">30 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, when he paid the fines of two <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Heijn_e8dd.html" title="Albert Heijn">Albert Heijn</a> supermarket staff members, who were convicted of assaulting a shoplifter after they detained him.</p>
<p>Prince Bernhard is also well-known for his love for fast planes, fast cars and speeding. Apparently <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill.html" title="Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> said that he only knew of one person that was having a great time during WWII, and that it was Prince Bernhard <a href="http://www.nu.nl/news.jsp?n=450300&amp;c=10" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nu.nl/news.jsp?n=450300&amp;c=10" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview published after his death, Prince Bernhard admitted that he had accepted more than one million dollars (US) in bribes from Lockheed, he acknowledged it was a mistake and all of the money went to the WWF. He also admitted to having fathered two illegitimate daughters in the years following his marriage. <a href="http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGBE5HEOQ2E.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGBE5HEOQ2E.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>Prince Bernhard is father of six children, but only four of them are of his wife Juliana. The eldest daughter is the current queen of the Netherlands, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatrix_of_the_Netherlands_6e5b.html" title="Beatrix of the Netherlands">Beatrix</a> (1938). His other daughters are <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Irene_of_the_Netherlands_1ea0.html" title="Princess Irene of the Netherlands">Irene</a> (1939), <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Margriet_of_the_Netherlands_2453.html" title="Princess Margriet of the Netherlands">Margriet</a> (1943) and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Christina_of_the_Netherlands_6eff.html" title="Princess Christina of the Netherlands">Christina</a> (1947).</p>
<p>He also had two illegitimate daughters. The first is Alicia von Bielefeld (born 1954), whose mother has not been identified. A landscape architect, she lives in the United States. Prince Bernhard's sixth daughter, Alexia Grinda (a.k.a. Alexia Lejeune, born 1967), is his child by the French socialite and fashion model Hélène Grinda (Mrs. Stanislaus Lejeune, born 1944). Although rumours about these two children had already spread, it was made official after his death.</p>

<p>Prince Bernhard died of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> at the age of 93 in an <a href="../../../u/t/r/Utrecht_%28city%29.html" title="Utrecht (city)">Utrecht</a> hospital (the <i>Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht</i> - <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Utrecht_40ae.html" title="University of Utrecht">University of Utrecht</a> Medical Centre) on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">1 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>; until his death he suffered from malignant <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung.html" title="Lung">lung</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intestine.html" title="Intestine">intestinal</a> <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumour.html" title="Tumour">tumours</a>.
