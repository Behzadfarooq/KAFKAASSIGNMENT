<p>After completing his undergraduate studies at <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_State_University_abb7.html" title="San Diego State University">San Diego State University</a>, Rimland obtained his PhD in <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experimental_psychology.html" title="Experimental psychology">experimental psychology</a> and research design, from <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_State_University_be4e.html" title="Pennsylvania State University">Pennsylvania State University</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Rimland's son, Mark, was born in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, when the diagnosis of autism was rare. From birth, however, something was drastically wrong with Mark. Rimland had recently earned his doctorate, but was not yet familiar with the word autism. Only much later was it determined Mark's condition fell into the category of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_infantile_autism.html" title="Early infantile autism">early infantile autism</a>, rather than <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regressive_autism.html" title="Regressive autism">regressive autism</a>. Despite challenges, Mark has nevertheless become a talented artist.</p>
<p>After his son's diagnosis, Rimland set forth on a quest to understand autism and bring much needed attention to the disorder, in order to foster research into its causes and treatment. Rimland has often sparked controversy along his way.</p>
<p>Among Rimland's major contributions to autism research was his discovery that autism is <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurological.html" title="Neurological">neurological</a>. This refutation of the prevailing theory, propounded by <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> professor <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_Bettelheim_a13a.html" title="Bruno Bettelheim">Bruno Bettelheim</a>, that autism was caused by unloving '<a href="../../../r/e/f/Refrigerator_mother.html" title="Refrigerator mother">refrigerator mothers</a>', helped to substantially change the way autism is viewed by the medical profession today.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Rimland_7e6c.html" title="Edit section: Encountering resistance from the medical establishment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Encountering resistance from the medical establishment</span></h2>
<p>The medical establishment has long questioned Rimland's contributions to autism research. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, Bennett Leventhal, a professor at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, tersely dismissed as "rubbish" Rimland's concern about the rise in autism diagnoses, and his assertion that <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine.html" title="Vaccine">vaccinations</a> might be among the causes. Rimland was among a minority of researchers who believe that <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiomersal_controversy.html" title="Thiomersal controversy">thiomersal</a> (a mercury-based preservative) used in vaccines is a direct cause of autism. The United States <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Medicine_f174.html" title="Institute of Medicine">Institute of Medicine</a> (IOM) in its 2004 report found that, "the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism."<a href="http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10997" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10997" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency_d18c.html" title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</a> (MHRA), <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Health_Service_ad67.html" title="National Health Service">National Health Service</a> (NHS), <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Health_Organization_57ba.html" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Medicines_Agency_e04e.html" title="European Medicines Agency">European Medicines Agency</a> (EMEA), <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_and_Drug_Administration_b75c.html" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centers_for_Disease_Control_73db.html" title="Centers for Disease Control">Centers for Disease Control</a> (CDC), and many other national and international medical organizations have issued statements of a similar nature, denying a link between autism and thimerosal based on the evidence currently available to science from a variety of studies. Vaccine critics generally dismiss such studies, contending they are often tainted by significant <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> problems, such as the fact that a now-retired FDA commissioner had financial stakes in <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmaceutical.html" title="Pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> companies that produce vaccines and thimerosal.<a href="http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/10/27a.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/10/27a.php" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>In her book, <i>Children with Starving Brains</i>, Jaquelyn McCandless, MD, calls Rimland "The grand godfather of the movement for understanding the biological treatment of autism." Rimland's book, <i>Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implication for a Neural Theory of Behavior</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>), is credited by many with changing the prevailing view of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a>, in the field of <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatry.html" title="Psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, from an emotional illness --widely thought to be caused by refrigerator mothers-- to the current recognition that autism is a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurodevelopment.html" title="Neurodevelopment">neurodevelopmental</a> disorder.</p>

<p>Rimland was among the first medical professionals to draw attention to increases in the number of diagnoses of autism. Rimland's early observations about the rise in diagnoses during the mid-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, are seen by some as prophetic of the '<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a>' theory. Others hold that increases in the number of diagnoses of autism are a natural result of changing diagnostic criteria and improving awareness, among other factors. The number of controversies surrounding <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination.html" title="Vaccination">vaccination</a> campaigns, many of which Rimland has found himself in the midst of, have also escalated in tandem with the scope of the possible epidemic.</p>

<p>Rimland has lectured on autism and related problems throughout the world, including before thousands of professional groups, and he is the author of numerous publications. His high profile, within what was then a small community of autism activists, caught the eye of movie producers in nearby <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood%2C_California_ebf3.html" title="Hollywood, California">Hollywood, California</a>.</p>
<p>Rimland subsequently served as the primary technical advisor on autism for the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> movie <i><a href="../../../r/a/i/Rain_Man_bc4a.html" title="Rain Man">Rain Man</a></i>. Mark Rimland was interviewed by <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustin_Hoffman_be7f.html" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, serving as one of several models for the character portrayed by the movie star. The movie helped establish worldwide awareness of autism, just when the prevalence of autism was first becoming apparent.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Rimland founded the Autism Research Institute as a global network of parents and professionals concerned with autism. ARI conducts and fosters scientific research intended to enhance treatments for, and prevention of, autism. The ARI data bank, the world's largest, contains over 35,000 detailed case histories of autistic children.</p>
<p>Rimland was the editor of the <i>Autism Research Review International</i>, published by ARI, which covers biomedical and educational advances in autism research.</p>
<p>Rimland and his wife, Gloria, had recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. The couple was married by Rabbi Monroe Levens of Tifereth Israel Synagogue, which was then located in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kensington%2C_California_9e1e.html" title="Kensington, California">Kensington, California</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Soon after my textbook on autism was published in 1964, I began to hear from other parents. Many parents told me that their children were normal until getting a triple vaccine – the <a href="../../../d/p/t/DPT_vaccine_5caf.html" title="DPT vaccine">DPT shot</a>. In 1965 I began systematically collecting data on the symptoms and possible causes of autism: In 1967 — 33 years ago — I began querying the parents, specifically about the child’s response to the DPT shot. Many had reported marked deterioration. During the past few years the Autism Research Institute has been flooded with an upsurge in pleas for help from parents throughout the world – from wherever the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Health_Organization_57ba.html" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_schedule.html" title="Vaccine schedule">vaccine guidelines</a> are followed.
