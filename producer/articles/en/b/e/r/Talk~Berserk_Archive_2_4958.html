<h2><span class="mw-headline">Note</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to mention that my comments I stated later in this talk page were intended as neither flame nor flame-bait. I deeply apologize if anyone misinterpreted it as such. The entire argument(s) that follows are completely moot (see <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS-JA_9394.html" title="WP:MOS-JA">WP:MOS-JA</a> under "fictional characters"), so I'm going to archive them later. Thank you, and I'm looking forward to helping cleaning up the current article. This will be a lot easier after next week, as my finals will be over then.

<dd>What I mean is you are referring to something he said about the Berserk TV series to support your claim that the transliterations found in the PS2 game were requested by Miura. Just because he made certain corrections on TV series doesn't mean that, for example, he made similar corrections on the PS2 game. We really have no way of knowing, and we shouldn't make assumptions. -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 22:59, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did that overview include how his character's name's would be transliterated in the game? How can we be so sure? What I'm saying here is that this quotation doesn't even speak of the topic which you feel is important (transliterations of character names in the ps2 game). As a matter of fact he <b>doesn't</b> say anything about transliterations. Indeed, this omission may in fact indicate that he <i>didn't</i> do anything concerning the transliteration. Once again, we really have no way of knowing. I'm also stating that this quotation has little to do with the topic at hand. -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 22:59, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think you are misunderstanding what he said in English. In no way did he say that Dark Horse deals directly with Miura. As a matter of fact, if you read on, he talks about speaking with a company, presumably <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakusensha.html" title="Hakusensha">Hakusensha</a>, and implies that he has no way of directly talking to Miura. It's silly to figure that some guy at <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakusensha.html" title="Hakusensha">Hakusensha</a>, provided Miura didn't specify a transliteration, didn't arbitrarly chose (for example) "Knight of Skeleton" simply because he pulled out an English to Japanese language dictionary and picked it. -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 08:40, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"I think you are misunderstanding what he said in English" you're thoughts are wrong. I've understood Dark Horse deals with the "licensors", which seems to be Hakusensha, but it doesn't mean that Hakusensha has no contact with Miurai overviewing things, which is pretty impossible. About "Knight of Skeleton" you don't know what happened with Miura and how Hakusensha works, maybe naming Knight of Skeleton was Miura's will. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 13:51, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I know by experience how much the Japanese laws are strict regarding copyrights and trademarks (license). The logical reason for the original name (even including katakana transcription mistakes or awkward translations!) has to be used over another word (even if it's the correct translation!) is a simple trademark issue. Some words are bought -trademarked- with a specific spelling, and this spelling only holds a legitimate copyright. Hence a strict control over the terms used overseas. My understanding. ex:"<b>髑髏の騎士</b>" &gt; sarekoube no kishi &gt; knight of skull(cranium)</p>

I remember the same person saying "it's to much work to do right now"... so I would ask these persons to save their time for the actual Article where there are many stuff that needs to be enhanced or created. Personaly i've done the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_soundtrack.html" title="Berserk soundtrack">Anime OST</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_PS2_Soundtrack_c8b2.html" title="Berserk PS2 Soundtrack">PS2 game OST</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_Berserk_%28soundtrack%29_920c.html" title="Sword of Berserk (soundtrack)">DC game OST</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28PlayStation_2_game%29_67ff.html" title="Berserk (PlayStation 2 game)">PS2 game</a> Berserk articles but since a few weeks i've switched to Cold War articles. I'm really into it, so now I spend my remaining free time making searches, reading, watching and listening related stuff for the upcoming articles. It means i have no time to waste on the Berserk talk anymore, if you know what I mean. I'll be probably back to Berserk article later, but now i've more "important" articles to do. Thanks to the working Lady though! It remembers me the group work and the school days, with a few people working hard and the rest of the group talking and doing peanuts! ^^ Good luck and good WORK people!! <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 15:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I'd prefer that instead of adding new 'content' en mass, we cleaned up and organised the current article. Additionaly, I for one don't think it's good to constantly make massive edits without discussing these edits beforehand. -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 10:50, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"massive edits" can always be edited later, this is the wiki basic principle everyone agreed here, including me.

Oh, nice job <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">avoiding personal insults</a> there. -_- Besides, not everyone has a lot of free time, and it's rather rude of you to imply that just because I have less free time, that I'm somehow "lazy". I'd like to think that the edits I do make (mostly linking to other articles) are rather important to Wikipdia as a whole. -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 10:50, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"not everyone has a lot of free time" of course, but everyone can take it over week-ends and holidays, like i do. "it's rather rude of you" maybe but it's just i'm getting upset with wasting time on the talk when this precious time could be used on more useful things such as "linking to other articles", adding general infos, or creating new articles. evidences have not been posted yet, but as trolling will get us anywhere, i'll not bother about flaming users anymore.<a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 17:42, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are plenty of religious references appearing in Berserk from the "Golden Age" to the "Mandragora" (Berserk game) to the "Beherit" and "Samson". Does anyone would like to work a short section dedicated to this? <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 15:28, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A Trivia Section would be better. These references, while having some passing resemblence to their source name ("makara" for example being a Hindu sea monster), don't go much deeper then that. I know people have cited a passing resemblence between the Holy See in Berserk and the Vatican in the real world, but these two don't have much to do with one another besides being an influencial religious organization. Truth is, there aren't even churches in the Berserk world, but temples as the Kanji "寺" (temple) is used throughout the story. Martisty 22:19, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was not asking for a huge section you know, a trivia "Religion Symbol" paragraph would be ok. You're pretty right about the churches, actually I was thinking of a more vast religious aspect, not only Catholiscm, you've pointed the truth but there's an <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00004R9FI.01.PT03._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" class="external text" title="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00004R9FI.01.PT03._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" rel="nofollow">important church and a Sister in the mandragora infested village</a> if you remember the Dreamcast game. A religious references short inventory will be perfect actually.
<ul>
<li>Those references in the game (which may not even be canon in the manga) are only suferficial, like the "father" in the church-like building in Enoch village. Martisty 07:09, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>i disagree with this, and see the game just like an OAV and as a valueable extension of Berserk created with Miura's overview. A more implicit reference to religion is the word "baptism" used in the episode 24 of the anime though. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 16:59, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm pretty sure Japanese users will do it anyway, they're very strict, much more than here, from what i've experienced. I'm even expecting a sys operator to do a "revision" and undo my work! ^^<a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 23:58, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've seen the translations and I'd rather they be left out completely except for what Miura has confirmed. In the end, I'm sure what you said (someone else editing) will happen. Martisty 07:09, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"I'd rather they be left out completely" thank you! how sweet of you, that mean my translations are completely wrong and implies that YOU knows the good ones... but that you don't want to write them ("check it and correct the mistakes i've made")!! = pff! easy speaking and lies. Moreover if "Miura has confirmed" something why don't you post some scans or your sources. I'd rather you'd have said nothing instead of writing such bullshits and that you made new things for the articles instead of being all speak. It's curious to notice how the english article has not changed since the last time i've worked on it while there are many new stuff to do! <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 15:53, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow, you're out of the loop. Berserk volumes 27 and up have a two page characer section at the beginning where the katakana is written, followed by the the character's name in roman characters (not "<a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphabet.html" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a>", as not all alphabets are based on the roman characters), followed by a short summary in japanese about that character. A picture (of each character) is also listed. Pick up 27-30 if you don't belive us. I don't have book 27 on hand, so here's 28 and up: book 28 character names (i'm assuming you know the katakana by now, so I won't list it): Guts, Puck, Casca, Farnese, Isidro, Serpico, Schierke, Griffith, and Zodd. Volume 29 list the same, only Sonia is the last character listed instead of Zodd. Volume 30 lists Roderick as the last character. -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 12:11, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"<i><b>I'm sure what you said (someone else editing) will happen</b></i>". Actually 2 days before this message was written... an American boy from <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonoma.html" title="Sonoma">Sonoma</a>, California (i will accuse nobody!!) has edited my translations (a Japanese guy from <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osaka.html" title="Osaka">Osaka</a> has come after me and did no change to my translations though). The Californian was not a registered member of the Japanese Wikipedia and the only thing he has ever done on the JP wiki was to edit my translations. I mean there is no proof that he did legitimate corrections over my translation. What I made was a correction from "Guston" (american surname) to "Gaston" (fench name) which is more plausible and used in the US Anime and made <b>50 translations</b>. The American has changed <b>21</b> of them (that makes <b>29</b> -the majority- accurate!) including many subjective arguable changes like "Grunbe<b>l</b>d" to "Grunbe<b>r</b>d", "Eri<b>k</b>a" to "Eri<b>c</b>a", "God<b>eaux</b>" to "God<b>ot</b>", "Si<b>l</b>at" to "Si<b>r</b>at", "Volkoff" to "Borkoff" (while V=B &amp; R=L w/being the french translate and "Borkoff" the english for the <a href="http://mvolkoff.narod.ru/" class="external text" title="http://mvolkoff.narod.ru/" rel="nofollow">Russian "Волков"</a>, the most accurate being probably "Volkov"), "Voss" (Voss coming from a 60's BBC SF TV series w/the "Minister Voss" character) to "Foss", "<b>L</b>aban to <b>R</b>aban", "Varg<b>aas</b>" to "Varg<b>a</b>s" or "Boscorn" (the "corn" was a reference to the "Rhino Knights"!) to "Boscone". These changes are subjectives because both translations are acceptable for the katakana spelling (R=L, V=B, K=C, V=F, etc.) and there is no proof that these "corrections" are more accurate. After all i've seen Japanese fans spelling "Godo", "Hannah", "Fosse", "Silatt", "Judaux", "Vandhimion", "Roch" (for "Rox"/"Locus") etc. Other subjective arguable corrections are "Jill" (english name) over "Gilles" (french name) and "Mule" (animal name coming from the french word "Mule") over "Muhl" (french name) as many french names are used in Berserk e.g. "Colette", "Charlotte", "Jerome" or "Gaston" and "Balzac" (from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac_3b42.html" title="Honoré de Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> famous french author) or even "Charles" (with the french pronunciation and it's specific mute "s" hence the official "チャールル"! not the english form which has a totally different katakana "チャールズ" from the "CHAARLZ" pronunciation) in the games. This is why i would like someone here to post Miura's so called "official statements" about the "correct" katakana translation for the characters. Thanks for the scan &amp; post. I've started the <a href="#Official_romaji_.28alphabet_use.29_for_Berserk" title="">#Official romaji (alphabet use) for Berserk</a> thread w/verifiable official sources for this purpose. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 15:16, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
