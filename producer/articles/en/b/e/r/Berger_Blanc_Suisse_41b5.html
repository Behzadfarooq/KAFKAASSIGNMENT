An example of a White Shepherd</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>From the AWSA Breed Standard: The White Shepherd is a well developed and balanced animal with the look of intelligence, energy and purpose in life. It should have a regal appearance with secondary sex characteristics being distinctive. The dog should be somewhat longer than tall, with smooth curves rather than sharp angles. Extremes of anything distort type and are to be strongly discouraged. This is a herding dog that must have the agility, freedom of movement and endurance to do the work required of it. When gaiting, the dog should move smoothly, with all parts working in harmony. Overall balance, strength, and firmness of movement is to be given more emphasis than a sidegait showing a flying trot.</p>
<p>The White Shepherd has a weather-resistant double coat. Both a short coat and a long coat are equally acceptable. The coat color is white as defined by the breed’s name and the ideal is pure white. Other coat markings that range from a very pale cream to a light biscuit tan are acceptable, but not preferred. It is important to note that when judging the White Shepherd, temperament, overall quality and movement are to be considered more important than coat color alone.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Berger_Blanc_Suisse_41b5.html" title="Edit section: Temperament">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Temperament</span></h2>
<p>The White Shepherd has a distinct personality marked by a direct, but not hostile expression of self-confidence. It is poised but when the situation demands, it should be eager and alert, ready to serve in any capacity such as companion, watch dog or service dog. To his inherent aptitude as a guardian of flocks should be an added protectiveness of the person and property of his family. With those he knows well, he should be open and friendly. With strangers, he should be observant and may be somewhat aloof but never apprehensive.</p>

<p>The History of the White Shepherd is the generally the same as that of the German Shepherd.

White Shepherd</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>White coated herding dogs of rural Germany were an essential part of the late 19th century breeding program that founded the German Shepherd breed. It is a historical fact that a white herding dog named Greif was the Grandfather of Horand von Grafrath, the dog acknowledged as the foundation of all contemporary German Shepherd Dog bloodlines. “Der Deutsche Schaferhund In Wort Und Bild" ("The German Shepherd Dog in Words and Picture") written by the recognized father of the breed, Rittmeister (Cavalry Captain) <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_von_Stephanitz_4063.html" title="Max von Stephanitz">Max von Stephanitz</a>, in 1921 included a photo of a White German Shepherd directly descended from Horand.</p>

<p>Information provided in early books on the German Shepherd Dog, such as "The Alsatian WoIf Dog" written by George Horowitz in 1923, as well as "The German Shepherd, Its History, Development and Genetics" written by M. B. Willis in 1977, make mention of white German herding dogs, with upright ears and a general body description that resembles modern German Shepherd Dogs, shown in Europe as early as 1882. From the very these direct ancestors of the German Shepherd Dog forward to the German Shepherds of today, the recessive gene for white colored coats has been carried in the DNA of the breed.</p>
<p>Shepherding was a common way of life for thousands of years all across Europe, including the countryside that is today called Germany. Over countless centuries shepherds used dogs to herd their sheep throughout the day, and guard them against wolf and bear predators at night. The Roman writer Columella in the 1st century A.D. published a 35-volume essay on agriculture entitled, “The Agricultural Arts” that stated, unequivocally, the dogs that guard the sheep are white in color. Earlier in history, the Roman historian and writer, Marcus Terrentius Varro (116-27 B.C.), described the guardians of the flocks as being invariably white in color. He also writes that, in his opinion, the shepherds preferred white dogs in order to be able to distinguish them from the wolves that usually attacked in the half-light of dawn or dusk.</p>
<p>Many descendants of the ancient shepherd's white dogs were present on 19th century German farms. In addition to the somewhat larger white guard and herding dog varieties, several varieties of medium sized shepherding dogs were also in use on German farms. These medium-sized shepherd dogs were especially fast and agile dogs that were particular well suited to moving and guiding sheep herds across the country side. These medium-sized dogs had coat colors of brown, grey, grizzled and white. For example, the medium-sized Puli, was known to have white coats and the Sharfpudel of Germany was always white. It is, therefore, a fact, that the modern German Shepherd Dog bread presents all of the coat colors, including white, of the breed’s founding ancestors.</p>
<p>Across the regional landscape of 19th century German farms, Shepherds bred a wide variety of dogs to herd their sheep with no uniformity of size, color, or shape, except for what was common for their particular region. The only real interest was that herding dogs be physically and mentally sound so they could work tirelessly, competently and faithfully along side the shepherd. This was the landscape seen by Max Von Stephanitz in the 1880s.</p>
<p>As a young cavalry officer, Stephanitz’s military duties often required him to travel across the German countryside. It was common for travelers like Stephanitz to board with rural families along the way. At that time most rural German farms had at least a few head of sheep and a herding dog or two to tend them. Stephanitz became fascinated with the German herding dogs and their working capabilities. He admired all the hard working dogs, but observed some dogs had a special look and bearing about them that he especially admired.</p>
<p>Eventually Stephanitz became inspired with the idea that Germany should have a national herding dog that combined the work ethic of the most accomplished herding dogs with that special look and bearing he so admired. Stephanitz envisioned a German shepherding dog who was extremely intelligent, could reason and be a working companion to man. Further, the dog must be quick on his feet and well coordinated, protective, noble in appearance and bearing, trustworthy in character, physically sound in joint and muscle, and be born with an innate desire to please and obey the shepherd master. <a href="http://www.german-shepherdherding.com/manfred-english/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.german-shepherdherding.com/manfred-english/index.html" rel="nofollow">This is the German Shepherd dog that we know and love today.</a> By 1891 Stephanitz started selecting the best herding dogs from across the German countryside for his breeding program, but Stephanitz was not alone in his passion to develop a national German Shepherding Dog.</p>
<p>The Phylax Society, active primarily between the years 1891-1894, was an organization of German shepherding dog fanciers that in many ways formed the foundations for the German Shepherd Dog Club of Germany. The Phylax Society documented shepherding dogs of varying sizes, types and colors, including white, to have been in all areas of Germany during the late 1800’s.</p>
<p>Like Stephanitz, Phylax Society members were actively engaged in uniting the various sizes, types and colors of German shepherding dogs to produce a standard shepherding dog for Germany. Stephanitz corresponded with Phylax Society members and attended dog shows organized by the Society, thus adding to Stephanitz’s already considerable understanding of bloodlines.</p>
<p>The Phylax Society provides an essential prolog to the modern German Shepherd story, both white and colored. The society ultimately did not long survive because it had no strong central figure to organizing and manage Society affairs. The Phylax Society essentially evolved into the German Shepherd Dog Club of Germany, organized and managed by Stephanitz, as many former Phylax Society members later joined with Stephanitz.</p>
<p>As interest in dog breeding continued to grow in Germany throughout the 1890’s, one of the largest all breed dog shows to date took place in the Rhineland town of Karlesruhe on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_3.html" title="April 3">April 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>. Stephanitz, accompany by his friend Artur Meyer, attended the Karlesruhe Exhibition in his continuing search for shepherding dogs that could be added to his breeding program.</p>

</div>
<p>Among the many shepherding dogs brought to the exhibition from a number of different German agricultural areas, Stephanitz saw a truly unique and noble looking shepherd dog name Hektor Linksrhein, born the 1st of January 1895 along with litter brother, Luch von Sparwasser, later registered SZ 155. The breeder of Hektor and Luch was Herr Friedrich Sparwasser of Frankfort. Stephanitz at once recognized Hektor as his ideal German Shepherd Dog that he had been striving to develop in his own ten year long breeding program. He bought Hektor on the spot and renamed the dog Horand von Grafrath.</p>

<p>Hektor’s and Luch's maternal grandfather was a white-coated German herding dog named Greif von Sparwasser, whelped in Friedrich Sparwasser's Frankfort kennel in 1879. George Horowitz, renowned English Judge, German Shepherd (Alsatian) columnist, author and historian documents the background of Hektor Linksrhein (a.k.a. Horand von Grafrath) in his 1923 book, “The Alsatian Wolf-Dog.” In his book Horowitz documents that the white-coated herding dog named Greif von Sparwasser, born in 1879, was presented at the 1882 and 1887 Hanover Dog Shows.</p>
<p>Next, at the 1888 Hamburg Dog Show, Greifa, another white-coated herding dog, was presented and a third white-coated shepherd named Greif II was presented at the 1889 Cassel Show. The Master of Hounds of Beyenrode, Baron von Knigge, who acquired Greif from the Frankfurt breeder Friedrich Sparwassar, eventually owned all three of the white-coated herding dogs Greif, Greifa and Greif II. These dogs were described as very alert, well proportioned, erect eared white herding dogs. The modern German Shepherd Dog appearance further developed when Greif von Sparwasser was mated with female Lotta von Sparwasser who then whelped a litter that included a wolf-grey colored female named Lene von Sparwasser, later registered SZ 156. Both Greif and Lotta had the distinctive 'up right' ears that we see in the modern German Shepherd Dog breed, but which was uncommon in shepherding dogs of that time. Lene then passed the genetic coding for 'up right' ears as well as white coats, in her pairing with dog Kastor, to Hektor von Linksrhein (a.k.a. Horand von Grafrath SZ 1) and his litter brother Luch. Friedrich Sparwasser's line of dogs, therefore, contributed very important conformation and behavioral aspects to the modern German Shepherd Dog breed. If Stephanitz can be called the father of the German Shepherd Dog breed, then perhaps Frankfurt breeder Friedrich Sparwasser should also be credited as a grandfather. Concurring information is provided in “The German Shepherd Dog, Its History, Development and Genetics,” written by M. B. Willis, B. Sc.Ph.D.</p>
<p>In Stephanitz's original book "The German Shepherd Dog in Words and Picture," printed in Germany by Anton Kamphe, Jena in 1923, he describes the background of the dog types used to develop the German Shepherd breed.</p>

<p>Clearly, among the several dog types used in the breeding program there were two dog types of particular importance to the development of the German Shepherd Dog as we know them today: sheepdogs from the German highland Thuringia region who had erect ears and a general conformation of the modern German Shepherd dog, and sheepdogs from the Wurttemberg region which were heavier, larger-boned and had very bushy tails. Greif, Lotta, Hektor and Luch are noted as having "Thuringian blood." Unfortunately, later revisions of Stephanitz's book eliminated much of Stephanitz's original descriptive commentary on the various dog types used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to develop the modern German Shepherd Dog breed. Information and photos of Old German Shepherds can be found in the book (in German) "Hirten und Huetehunde" by Karl Hermann Finger, Eugen Ulmer GmbH &amp; Co., published 1988.</p>
<p>Stephanitz writes in his book, "Horand embodied for the enthusiasts of that time the fulfillment of their fondest dreams. He was big for that period, between 24" and 24 1/2", even for the present day a good medium size, with powerful frame, beautiful lines, and a nobly formed head. Clean and sinewy in build, the entire dog was one live wire. His character was on a par with his exterior qualities; marvelous in his obedient fidelity to his master, and above all else, the straightforward nature of a gentleman with a boundless zest for living. Although untrained in puppy hood, nevertheless obedient to the slightest nod when at this master's side; but when left to himself, the maddest rascal, the wildest ruffian and incorrigible provoker of strife. Never idle, always on the go; well disposed to harmless people, but no cringer, mad about children and always in love. What could not have been the accomplishments of such a dog if we, at that time, had only had military or police service training? His faults were the failings of his upbringing, never of his stock. He suffered from a superfluity of unemployed energy, for he was in Heaven when someone was occupied with him and was then the most tractable of dog."</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>, less than a month after Stephanitz purchased Hektor, who he renamed Horand von Grafrath, Stephanitz founded the German Shepherd Dog Club of Germany or <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Verein_f%C3%BCr_Deutsche_Sch%C3%A4ferhunde_0547.html" title="Der Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde">Der Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde</a>, the SV, as he wrote the first entry into the new SV Stud Book – “Horand von Grafrath, SZ 1.” Thus, Horand (a.k.a. Hektor) was documented as the foundation of the German Shepherd Dog breed. Membership of the SV German Shepherd Dog Club grew quickly and soon many breeders were using Horand’s progeny, as well as Horand’s litter brother Luch and his progeny, to expand the German Shepherd Dog breed population.</p>
<p>The genetic influence of Horand’s maternal grandfather, white-coated Greif, is significant in the breed given Horand was line-bred and inbred with his own offspring in the expansion and refinement of the new breed after 1899. Horand was bred to 35 different bitches, including his own daughters, producing 53 litters, of which, 140 progeny were registered with the SV. Horand’s litter brother Luchs was also widely bred in the same way in the expansion of the modern German Shepherd breed. Further, Horand’s offspring was inbred with Luchs's offspring, which further concentrated the DNA of these dogs. It is a statistical certainty that a large percentage of all of Horand’s and Luchs’s offspring inherited the white genetic factor that was passed to them by white-coated maternal grandfather Greif. The white genetic factor in turn was forwarded on to a percentage of all subsequent generations of the breed. In the first 15 years of pedigreed German Shepherd Dog breeding more than half the registered dogs had litters with white puppies. Many of Horand's grandsons produced white pups including Baron von der Seewies (1913) who became the first white German shepherd registered in the breed book. Of the many genetic traits that became firmly entrenched in the founding breeding program, the white-coat color gene figures prominently, even to this day.</p>

Included Photograph of Berno v.d. Seewiese</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Stephanitz's original 776-page book, "The German Shepherd Dog in Words and Picture," he included a photograph of a celebrated White Shepherd, Berno von der Seewiese, who was a direct descendant of Horand von Grafrath, (a.k.a. Hektor) the father of the breed. Berno v.d. Seewiese, born in 1913 was in a direct line down from Horand von Grafrath through Horand’s equally famous, and some said even more handsome, son Hektor von Schwaben. In his 1921 book, Stephanitz wrote, "The coloring of the dog has no significance whatsoever for service" and "Our German Shepherd Dogs have never been bred for color, which for the working dog is a matter of quite secondary consideration. Should any fashion breeder allow himself to pursue such a senseless fad, he might be bitterly disappointed." Clearly, the founder of the breed stressed utility over appearance, however, it must be noted that in other passages in his book Stephanitz also wrote of his preference for dark colored shepherds. Stephanitz writes in his 1925 book, "Albino's, (i.e. animals without color, in other words white dogs with completely colorless skin, pale claws, flesh colored nose and reddish eyes) must be completely excluded from breeding. With dogs, however, who have been bred to white color, where the skin has retained the pigmentation, it is not a sign of paling but of breed. This, however, applies only to other breeds; for shepherd dogs, both smooth and rough haired, white is only allowed for shaggy haired ones as the descendants of the old sheep dogs bred for white."</p>
<p>The prime directive of Stephanitz breeding mandate was that the German Shepherd Dog breed must embody all the qualities of a working herding dog. He maintained that the beauty is in the working abilities of the dog; muscle, bone, joint, proud look and bearing, intelligence, stamina and work ethic were the primary strengths sought in the breed. To ensure this prime directive of breeding was honored Stephanitz created the Koerung, a survey, in which the dogs were thoroughly examined, judged, and deemed fit or unfit for breeding. Coat color considerations did not disqualify a dog from Stephanitz’s German Shepherd breed standard during the first twenty years of the breed club. Dogs known to carry the "white coat factor" were not, for this reason alone, excluded from the SV breed program. This is not to say white-coated puppies were happily received in all breeder's litters, even in these early formative years of the breed when the recessive gene for white coats was so well established and wide spread in the breeding pool. (<a href="../../../s/c/h/Schutzhund.html" title="Schutzhund">Schutzhund</a> is the modern version of Stephanitz's breeding assessment survey.)</p>
<p>By 1923 Stephanitz's still growing club membership numbered over 57,000 enthusiasts who grouped into factions of herdsmen, commercial breeders, and show dog devotees. Many commercial and show oriented breeders, who were less passionate about the dog's working characteristics, particularly wanted the breed to have a full wolf appearance. This, in part, is a carry over from the old Phylax Society members who joined with Stephanitz on the founding of his club in 1899. Winfred Strickland writes in her (1988 revised edition) book, “The German Shepherd Today,” that the old Phylax Society, "was based solely on its members common interest in breeding (herding) dogs to resemble wolves, presumably hoping to cash in on their high market value." Another faction opposed to the SV direction, who did not reject white as a breed color, actually broke away and operated under the DSV name until about 1928.</p>
<p>In his 1923 book Stephanitz recognized the esteem many held for the wolf look and wrote that breeders must not to add more “wolf blood" into his dogs because he had already developed the ideal balance of conformation and temperament. Stephanitz also wrote of SV politics in his 1923 book, “The group with the best chance of gaining the upper hand was the one which envisioned turning the breed into a working-type show dog, with at costs, erect ears and, possibly, a wolf-like appearance as well.” Even while expressing the importance of utility over appearance, Stephanitz himself expressed a personal preference for the wolf-like black and tan coloring in his 1916 and later writings. By the late 1920's SV breeders were already beginning to [cull] white-coated puppies from litters and the SV breeding program.</p>

<p>In 1913 the German Shepherd Dog Club of America was established with the registry of Queen of Switzerland (AKC # 115006) and the adoption of Stephanitz’s breed standard. One of the founders of the German Shepherd Dog Club of America and one of the earliest German Shepherd Dog breeders in America was Ann Tracy of New York. Ann Tracy's breeding program, using Stephanitz's colored German Shepherds imported from Germany, produced white-coated Shepherds almost immediately. A litter that whelped on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">March 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> in Tracy's kennel contained four white puppies: Stonihurst Edmund, Stonihurst Eric, Stonihurst Eadred and Stonihurst Elf. These four white German Shepherds are believed to be the first white Shepherds bred and born in the United States and are the first to be registered with the American Kennel Cub.</p>

Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge and her German Shepherds</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the early 1920’s, H. N. Hanchett of Minnesota and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Geraldine_Rockefeller_Dodge_a9f3.html" title="Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge">Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge</a> of New York imported additional German-bred German Shepherd Dogs, including some white-coated dogs, to the United States. Thus, the white-coated German Shepherd Dog had an early and prominent entry in North America. The beauty of these White German Shepherds became increasingly admired throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico in the years after World War I and its numbers increased as popularity of the German Shepherd Dog breed increased.</p>
<p>In 1920 America, just as the Strongheart (registered as Etzel v. Oeringen) and Rin-Tin-Tin silent movies were ready to exploded in popularity, the AKC registered just 2,135 shepherd dogs. From 1921 onward movies and vaudeville stage acts featuring nearly two-dozen German Shepherd stars rapidly grew in popularity. A few white German Shepherds appeared in movies during this period, but they were particular popular for vaudeville acts because their size and white coat made them highly visible on stage. Popularity of the German Shepherd dog on stage and screen quickly translated into explosive demand for German Shepherd puppies across North America. The German Shepherd became the most popular breed in North America as every little boy and girl wanted his or her own Strongheart and Rin-Tin-Tin dog.</p>
<p>By 1926 the annual number of German Shepherds registered with the AKC had increased to 21,596 and that reflects only part of the population increase for the year as not every breeder and new shepherd owner registered their dog with the AKC. The German Shepherd dog remained the most popular breed in North America for several years thereafter. The recessive gene for white coats was common in the American breeding population during this period of breeding frenzy. As with the first two decades of Shepherd breeding in Germany, more than half the litters of this population explosion presented white puppies. The famous dog bloodlines of Strongheart (Oeringen) and Rin-Tin-Tin are also known to have produced black-pigmented white-coated puppies. The Oeringen bloodline was considered one of the better lines in Germany at that time and it supplied the foundation stock for many of the more prestigious kennels in North America.</p>
<p>Paul Strang writes in his 1983 book, "The White German Shepherd Book" that, "During the late forties and early fifties Lloyd C. Brackett's Long Worth Kennels dominated the scene, producing more outstanding shepherds than any kennel in North America. This bloodline combined the best shepherds of the nation... From this line came solid black, Kirk of San Miguel, and many other notable dark color-coated dogs such as Morex or Ilex of Long-Worth, who each carried the white-coat gene. Here again we find the appearance of White Shepherd puppies in these popular lines was common. Many of North America's German Shepherd lines have Long-Worth bloodlines in their pedigrees. In fact, the Long-Worth bloodline is more common in American White Shepherd pedigrees than any other." It is, therefore, clear that well managed breeding programs produced high quality dark color-coated dogs side by side with dark pointed (pigmented) white-coated dogs in the same litters for generations.</p>
<p>In the 1930s members of the <a href="http://www.naiaonline.org/issues/Passion_to_Survive.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.naiaonline.org/issues/Passion_to_Survive.htm" rel="nofollow">Nazi party were the "elite" and dominated every aspect of German society, even German Shepherd dog breeding</a>. Many of the elite did not agree with Stephanitz that the breed should embody, first and foremost, the qualities of a working shepherd dog. The predator wolf appearance of the colored German Shepherd Dog increasingly symbolized everything German in the eyes of the Nazi Party and so, partly because Hitler also loved the breed, SV politics became an extension Nazi politics. <a href="http://www.dog.com/breed/German-Shepherd.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.dog.com/breed/German-Shepherd.asp" rel="nofollow">Adolf Hitler even bred German Shepherds</a> and while he was Chancellor he would exhibit them in shows.</p>
<p>The Nazi party confiscated entire kennels owned by Jewish breeders and appointed Nazi party officials to oversee the remaining kennels and breeders. These overseers were not experienced breed people and were unqualified to evaluate individual dogs’ contributions to the breed; their decisions were often impulsive and not in line with Stephanitz's prime directive for breeding. Dogs, and sometimes even their owners, who didn’t fit Nazi ideals of the moment were immediately culled. Hitler disliked Stephanitz, who would not join the Nazi party, and Nazi breed overseers continuously attempted to banish breed founder and club president Stephanitz from the Dog Club. In her (1988 revised edition) book, “The German Shepherd Today,” Winfred Strickland writes, "There were many SV members who were Nazi and they tried to meddle in the affairs of the SV. They persistently used vile means to cut Stephanitz off from his life's work and when he resisted they threatened him with a concentration camp." After thirty-six years of managing the German Shepherd Dog Club of Germany, he gave up and left the club in 1935. He died one year later on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>.</p>

Undesirable Trait?</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By the time the Nazis party took full control of the SV in 1935 white-coated shepherds were, without question, outlawed as undesirable. SV doctrine maintained the white-coat factor caused coat paling across the full range of dark coat colors. In the flawed eugenics science popular at the time, all manner of breed ills were attributed to the white coat "factor" including: deafness, blindness, albinism, mental instability, sterility and degeneration and loss of vigor were associated with and blamed on the white factor influence on. Once these beliefs took root, they flourished, grew and remain to this day. By the mid-1930's white German Shepherds had been banished from all German dog shows and breeders culling all white puppies from litters.</p>
<p>By the end of World War II, thousands upon thousands of German Shepherd Dogs in Germany had been slaughtered, as the military confiscated any dog they could find for military service, regardless of breeding value, in the final years of the war. While the few German Shepherd Dogs that managed to survive World War II almost represent a new start for the breed in Germany, they nonetheless embodied the foundation stock established by Stephanitz's original breeding program. White-coated puppies born in Germany after WWII were not documented and they were immediately culled out of new litters, as is true to this day. Therefore, we do not have a complete record of white-coated German Shepherd Dogs presenting in "standard-color" litters in Germany since 1935. However, sires and bitches that breed litters with one or more whites are documented in the SV Zeitung (magazine) and unregistered, when breeders report such litter presentations. A few White German Shepherd Dogs did managed to survive the Nazis and WWII in Germany and Holland. Descendants of these lucky white-coated dogs that trace their heritage directly to the white GSDs of the early 1900s survive to this day, despite not being allowed registration by the SV.</p>
<p>In America, the full diversity of the German Shepherd Dog gene pool was not impacted by World War II and White German Shepherds were registered and shown at AKC dog shows through the 1960s. In fact, White German Shepherds found increasing popularity throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico and their numbers were on the up swing. Then, through the late fifties and early sixties, influential members of the German Shepherd Dog Club of America endorsed the German Club’s mandate for “breed purity” and mounted a campaign to exorcise all dogs with the white gene from the gene pool. A difficult goal given the recessive gene for white coats was so well entrenched in gene pool at the very foundation of the breed!</p>
<p>There are many misconceptions about white-coated German Shepherd Dogs and the gene that expresses their coat color. First and foremost, white German Shepherd Dogs are NOT albinos. Albinos lack all pigment where white German Shepherd Dogs have brown eyes and black pigment on their noses, around their mouth, on their paw pads, around their eye rims have dark skin and nails.</p>

One In the Same Breed</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The white gene is recessive and only expresses coat color. The white gene is not linked to poor health, temperament, color paling in the entire breed, or any other negative trait in breed's genetic make-up. The white coat gene is actually a masking gene that masks the real color and pattern of the dog. A white German Shepherd Dog can carry genes for any color and pattern found in the breed, including, black, black and tan, black and red, black and silver, black and cream, blue, liver, sable, saddled and bi-colored.</p>
<p>White shepherds are unjustly blamed for color dilution or paling for the entire breed because the white gene can mask expression of genetic coding for diluted (pale) colors such as a black and silver, black and cream or liver. German breeders of the 1930’s misinterpreted pale offspring of white dogs, masking a pale colored coat, as an undesirable result of a “white” generic trait rather than the actual expression of genetic coding for diluted (pale) colors from the breeding pair. Even today, influential members of the German Shepherd Dog Club of America identify color paling in the entire breed as one of the primary justifications to “cull” white coated shepherd puppies from new litters.</p>
<p>By the mid-1960’s the color white was made a disqualification in the <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_shepherd_dog" class="external text" title="http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_shepherd_dog" rel="nofollow">GSD Breed Standard</a> as defined by the German Shepherd Dog Club of America (GSDCA.) The disqualification was then approved by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, the White German Shepherd Dog was outlawed from the AKC show ring. Up until that time, white-coated German Shepherds were eligible to compete in conformation dog shows the same as standard-colored German Shepherds. While the German Shepherd Dog Club of America wanted to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cull.html" title="Cull">cull</a> white-coated shepherds from the breeding pool, the AKC refused to withhold them from registration. Hence, even today, white is prominent in the colors registered with the AKC! While the AKC has repeatedly made it clear they will continue to register white-coated German Shepherd Dogs, influential members of the German Shepherd Dog Club of America actively continue their 45 year campaign to discredit white-coated shepherds and separate them from the breed. The newer alternative to the GSDCA named the <a href="http://germanshepherddog.com" class="external text" title="http://germanshepherddog.com" rel="nofollow">The United Schutzhund Clubs of America Inc.</a> also disqualifies white-coated German Shepherds.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, with the White German Shepherd Dog becoming ever more popular, friction developed between breeders of the White German Shepherd Dog and the standard-colored German Shepherd Dog that continues to this day. Genetic problems appearing in the German Shepherd Dog breed continue to be blamed on the White German Shepherd by the "standard-colored" German Shepherd Dog Clubs of both Germany and America. This point has been refuted innumerable times by leading <a href="http://www.wsgenetics.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wsgenetics.org" rel="nofollow">White German Shepherd Dog breeders</a> and modern <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneticists.html" title="Geneticists">geneticists</a> using state of the art DNA methods. So far, the German Shepherd Dog Clubs of both Germany and America do not accept the modern genetic evidence that white-coated German Shepherd Dogs and color-coated German Shepherd Dogs stem from the same ancestral dogs and are otherwise genetically identical. For over 40 years, <a href="http://www.wgsdca.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wgsdca.org" rel="nofollow">White German Shepherd Dog supporters</a> have worked to change the GSDCA German Shepherd Dog Standard in order to return the White German Shepherd once again to the AKC conformation show ring, and to eliminate the practice of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culling.html" title="Culling">culling</a> white-coated puppies from standard-colored breeder's litters.</p>
<p>As the “standard-color” German Shepherd Dog Club of America moved to expel white-coated members of the breed in the 1960’s, White German Shepherd Dog supporters formed their own clubs to protect the white-coated dog’s interests. In 1964, White German Shepherd Dog supporters in Sacramento, California formed the first White German Shepherd Dog Club to safeguard the white dogs. With the 1968 expulsion of white-coated German Shepherd Dogs from the AKC conformation dog show ring, White German Shepherd Dog supporters across the United States joined with the Sacramento club in 1969 to form the White German Shepherd Dog Club of America.</p>
<p>The White German Shepherd Dog Club of America adopted Stephanitz’s German Shepherd Dog breed standard and formally recognized the white dog as a member of Stephanitz’s German Shepherd Dog breed. This new national club quickly scheduled conformation dog shows for White German Shepherd Dogs and organized efforts to protect the interests of white-coated German Shepherd Dogs. In 1977, the White German Shepherd Dog Club of America changed its name to <a href="http://www.whitegermanshepherd.org" class="external text" title="http://www.whitegermanshepherd.org" rel="nofollow">The White German Shepherd Dog Club International, Inc</a>. (WGSDCII) and continues in the United States to this day under that name. Through the club’s efforts, the AKC continues to this day to register white Shepherds in their German Shepherd Dog breed registry and to allow White German Shepherd Dogs to show in AKC’s obedience show rings and compete in AKC tracking, herding, and temperament trial events.</p>
<p>Since 1977 many other white Shepherd clubs independently formed in the United States and other countries around the world. In the United States a new organization named <a href="http://www.wgsdca.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wgsdca.org" rel="nofollow">The White German Shepherd Dog Club of America</a> (WGSDCA) was founded in January 1997. The WGSDCA was originally named the White German Shepherd Dog Fanciers, but the name was changed in 2002 to better reflect the goals of the organization. Like the WGSDCII the WGSDCA sponsors independent conformation dog shows using qualified judges to award championship points and titles to white dogs and colored dogs that carry the white-gene. Both clubs also promote Schutzhund-style activities including agility, obedience, tracking and various working trials. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schutzhund.html" title="Schutzhund">Schutzhund</a> is a dog sport that was developed in Germany in the early 1900s to test the German Shepard dog's behavior and abilities to a predetermined breed ideal.</p>
<p>Both the WGSDCII and WGSDCA organizations today continue to lobby the German Shepherd Dog Club of America and American Kennel Club for the reunification of white-coated and color-coated members of the breed under one breed standard. The Constitution of both clubs state that the FIRST objective of the Club shall be: to preserve the name and heritage of the white-coated German Shepherd Dog as an integral and inseparable part of the German Shepherd Dog breed. Breeders affiliated with WGSDCII and WGSDCA typically selectively pair color-coated sires and bitches that carry the white recessive gene and/or white-coated dogs directly out of or by color-coated bitches and sires to produce litters that include white-coated puppies.</p>
<p>Their number one argument for reunification is that a white-coated founding member of the breed contributed crucial conformation and behavioral traits to the breed and that founding dog’s DNA contribution, including his recessive gene for white hair, continues to circulate in the German Shepherd Dog breed gene pool to this day. White-coated puppies presenting into a "colored" German Shepherd Dog breeder’s litters are often killed in an effort to eradicate white dogs from the breed. At the same time color-coated puppies from the same litters, who in some numbers carry the recessive white coat gene, are sold and often used to produce new litters. Further, color-coated sires and bitches that produce white puppies, thus proving they carry the white recessive gene, are most often used again and again to produce new puppy litters who then carry the white recessive gene forward. White-coated puppies, therefore, may always be present in German Shepherd Dog breed litters in some numbers. This is why the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Kennel_Club_2a94.html" title="American Kennel Club">American Kennel Club</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Kennel_Club_1f8b.html" title="Canadian Kennel Club">Canadian Kennel Club</a> continue to register white-coated dogs when white and colored dog breeders choose to appreciate or at least acknowledge the white-coated German Shepherd Dog’s certainty in the breed.</p>
<p>Those who support reunification further argue that coat color in the Shepherd breed should not be a basis for separate breed registries when varying coat colors in other AKC recognized breeds show as one breed or as a color variety of the breed. Separating the breed just to show in AKC conformation dog shows is ultimately not in the best interests of either color-coated or white-coated members of the German Shepherd Dog breed. Further, if the White German Shepherd Dog were to be separated into a new AKC recognized breed, white-coated dogs born to "colored" German Shepherd Dogs would not be eligible for AKC registration. Finally, reunification supporters contend that the initial small gene pool diversity of a separate “white-only” Shepherd breed is the never the most healthy genetic circumstance, regardless of animal species.</p>
<p>The AKC and CKC are not the only dog registries in North America, or indeed, the world. Established in 1898, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kennel_Club_f204.html" title="United Kennel Club">United Kennel Club</a> (UKC) started as a club for fanciers of a few breeds, with emphasis on working-hunting qualities. Today, the <a href="http://www.ukcdogs.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ukcdogs.com" rel="nofollow">UKC</a> is the largest all-breed performance-dog registry in the world, registering dogs from all the United States and 25 other international countries. The German Shepherd Dog has always been recognized by the UKC as a breed that includes white coats as well as various colored coats.</p>
<p>The UKC breed standard for the German Shepherd Dog states in part, “the German Shepherd Dog comes in many colors and white. Regardless of coat color, the dog’s nose, lips, and eye rims must have dark pigment.” White-coated German Shepherd Dogs are qualified to compete equally in all 12,000 annually licensed UKC events including conformation shows, tests of herding and working ability, and other performance events in which those dogs can prove their instincts and heritage. White German Shepherds can show in conformation events in a variety of other clubs too, including: the <a href="http://www.arba.org" class="external text" title="http://www.arba.org" rel="nofollow">American Rare Breed Association (ARBA)</a>, the <a href="http://www.internationaldogshow.com" class="external text" title="http://www.internationaldogshow.com" rel="nofollow">International All-Breed Canine Association (IABCA)</a>, the <a href="http://www.nationalcanine.com" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalcanine.com" rel="nofollow">National Canine Association (NCA)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.caninekennelclub.org" class="external text" title="http://www.caninekennelclub.org" rel="nofollow">Canine Kennel Club (CKC)</a>. The WGSDCA awards championship points based on wins in many, but not all, of these clubs.</p>
<p>Even though the UKC fully accepts white-coated German Shepherd Dogs, many original North American supporters of a unified white/colored breed standard have determined the German Shepherd Dog Clubs and Kennel Clubs of America and Canada are on an unalterable path to discredit and eradicate the white-coated German Shepherd Dog. Many white Shepherd supporters had already given up their efforts to promote a unified white/colored breed by 1998 when the <a href="http://www.gsdcc.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.gsdcc.ca" rel="nofollow">German Shepherd Dog Club of Canada</a> finally won its 30-year campaign to have the white-coated dogs expelled from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Kennel_Club_1f8b.html" title="Canadian Kennel Club">Canadian Kennel Club</a> sanctioned Conformation Dog Shows. (Like the AKC, the CKC continues to register white Shepherds in their German Shepherd Dog breed registry and allow White German Shepherd Dogs to show in AKC’s obedience show rings and compete in AKC tracking, herding, and temperament trial events.) This disenfranchised group of White German Shepherd supporters decided the White Shepherd could find acceptance and finally cast off the lie that it is genetically defective only through its own separate breed recognition and registration. Their resolve for a separate White Shepherd breed registration has only strengthened as the German Shepherd Dog Clubs of America and Canada have continued pressure on the Kennel Clubs of each country to stop registering white-coat dogs as members of German Shepherds Dog breed.</p>
<p>During the late 1990’s the <a href="http://www.awsaclub.com" class="external text" title="http://www.awsaclub.com" rel="nofollow">American White Shepherd Association</a> (AWSA) organized in the United States and the <a href="http://www.whiteshepherdclub.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.whiteshepherdclub.ca" rel="nofollow">White Shepherd Club of Canada</a> (WSCC) reorganized in Canada to advance the interests of purebred White Shepherds as a separate and distinct breed of working and herding dog. The WSCC first organized in 1971 and for twenty years worked to reunify white and colored dogs under one breed standard. Early in 1995 the WSCC abandoned its unified breed standard efforts and organized to promote the separate White Shepherd breed standard. The U.S. and Canadian clubs then petitioned the AKC and CKC to recognize the white-coated dog as a separate White Shepherd breed, but as of January 2007 neither kennel has approved the petitions. In 1999 the <a href="http://www.unitedwhiteshepherdclub.org" class="external text" title="http://www.unitedwhiteshepherdclub.org" rel="nofollow">United White Shepherd Club</a> (UWSC) organized as a United Kennel Club affiliate and immediately petitioned for a new UKC White Shepherd breed classification.</p>
<p>The UKC accepted the UWSC‘s petition and created a new and separate White Shepherd breed conformation standard and registry. The UKC now recognizes both the new White Shepherd breed standard as well as the original German Shepherd Dog breed conformation standard where white and colored dogs continue to be considered together as one breed. The UKC’s decision to register White Shepherd Dogs and White German Shepherd Dogs in separate breed registries is an acknowledgement of the two main truths articulated by breed unification and breed separation advocates: The recessive gene for white coats will continue to circulate in the colored German Shepherd Dog breed gene pool and increasing numbers of White Shepherd breeders worldwide are rapidly refining and expanding a distinct breed line of White Shepherd dogs.</p>
<p>Since the early 1990’s White Shepherd breeders affiliated with AWSA, WSCC and UWSC have continually paired and repaired only white-coated German Shepherd Dog sires and bitches for several generations to breed what is today considered a "pure" White Shepherd breed. Using Stephanitz’s original German Shepherd Dog standard, breeders have successfully founded a North American White Shepherd breed that closely resembles Stephanitz’s vision of an ideal Shepherd Dog, similar in conformation to German Shepherd Dog breed progenitor white-coated Greif von Sparwasser and early White German Shepherd Dog Berno v.d. Seewiese depicted in Stephanitz’s 1921 book. (Even so, it is a genetic reality that the DNA coding for German Shepherd Dog colored coats will continue to circulate in the "pure" White Shepherd breed gene pool just white coat genes continue to circulate in the colored German Shepherd Dog breed gene pool.) As with WGSDCII and WGSDCA these clubs also promote and organize conformation dog shows and advocate that associated breeders and owners participate in obedience training and working trials such as are supported by the Kennel Clubs. <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schutzhund.html" title="Schutzhund">Schutzhund</a> training is popular among European White Shepherd clubs, but interest in <a href="http://www.awdf.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.awdf.net/" rel="nofollow">American Schutzhund</a> is now budding among some North American White Shepherd owners.</p>
<p>Notably, the new White Shepherd breed has been readily adopted in many countries around the world. White German Shepherd Dogs and White Shepherd Dogs have become increasingly popular throughout Europe and other parts of the world. Many European breeders have imported North American White Shepherd dogs, some originally registered as AKC or CKC White German Shepherd Dogs, to build their own separate pure White Shepherd breeding programs. Today, European populations of the white dog, along both the White German Shepherd Dog and "separate" White Shepherd breed lines (,but increasingly along the "separate" White Shepherd breed line over successive breeding generations) have grown quite large. It must be noted too that a few small lines of white German Shepherd Dogs (still recognized by that name by the breeders and owners) remain in Germany and Holland that trace their heritage directly to the white German Shepherd Dogs of the early 1900s, even though they have not enjoyed registration by the SV since 1935.</p>
<p>Since June 1991, White Shepherd dogs have been registered as a separate breed with the Swiss Stud Book. Lobo White Burch, born in May 1966 and registered with the American Kennel Club, is considered the progenitor of the White Shepherd breed in Switzerland. Ms. Agathe Burch brought Lobo at the age of four years and imported him to Switzerland from America in 1970. In 1973 Lobo was bred to English registered white German Shepherd Dog, White Lilac Blinkbonny, who had been imported to Switzerland from England. Their offspring were registered with the Swiss Kennel Club (SKC) under Ms. Burch's Shangrila kennel prefix in 1973. The SKC officially recognized the White Shepherd as a separate breed name 1991 due to Ms. Burch's pioneering efforts. Kurt Kron acquired Lobo and continued breeding White Shepherd when Ms. Burch returned to America.</p>
<p>Now, one or more White Shepherd dog breed clubs have organized in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Hungary, Czech Republic, the U.K, Slovenia, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Holland. As of January 2007, White Shepherd clubs in several countries including <a href="http://www.berger-blanc-suisse.ch/" class="external text" title="http://www.berger-blanc-suisse.ch/" rel="nofollow">Switzerland</a>, <a href="http://www.weisse-schaefer.at" class="external text" title="http://www.weisse-schaefer.at" rel="nofollow">Austria</a>, <a href="http://www.sfjk.try.hu/" class="external text" title="http://www.sfjk.try.hu/" rel="nofollow">Hungary</a>, <a href="http://www.rws-weisse-schaeferhunde.de/" class="external text" title="http://www.rws-weisse-schaeferhunde.de/" rel="nofollow">Germany</a>, <a href="http://www.amicalebergerblanc.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.amicalebergerblanc.com/" rel="nofollow">France</a>, <a href="http://www.bily-ovcak.cz/cz/vitejte.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bily-ovcak.cz/cz/vitejte.html" rel="nofollow">Cech Rep.</a>, <a href="http://white-shepherd.szm.sk/" class="external text" title="http://white-shepherd.szm.sk/" rel="nofollow">Slovakia</a>, and <a href="http://www.hvidhyrdehund.dk/" class="external text" title="http://www.hvidhyrdehund.dk/" rel="nofollow">Denmark</a> have associated with a parent club named <a href="http://www.berger-blanc-international.com" class="external text" title="http://www.berger-blanc-international.com" rel="nofollow">Berger Blanc International</a>. In the year 2002 Berger Blanc International petitioned the <a href="../../../f/%C3%A9/d/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Cynologique_Internationale_5ca0.html" title="Fédération Cynologique Internationale">Fédération Cynologique Internationale</a> <a href="http://www.fci.be" class="external text" title="http://www.fci.be" rel="nofollow">(FCI)</a> (English translation, World Canine Federation) to recognize the White Shepherd as a new and separate breed. The FCI accepted the petition and now recognizes the White Shepherd breed as the "Berger Blanc Suisse." The FCI named the White Shepherd (Berger Blanc) breed 'Suisse' because the Swiss Kennel Club (SKC) was the first to register the breed separately from GSDs.</p>
<p>The White German Shepherd Dog and White Shepherd history in Australia is similar the their histories in Canada. The Australian National Kennel Council list white coats a fault in its German Shepherd Dog breed standard in 1994 and stopped registering white-coated German Shepherd Dogs in 1995. White German Shepherd Dog breed and White Shepherd Dog breed clubs in Australia include: <a href="http://www.whiteshepherdclub.org.au" class="external text" title="http://www.whiteshepherdclub.org.au" rel="nofollow">The White Shepherd Association of Australia (WSAA)</a>, <a href="http://www.wgsdcv.org.au" class="external text" title="http://www.wgsdcv.org.au" rel="nofollow">The White German Shepherd Dog Club of Victoria (WGSDCV)</a> and <a href="http://www.whiteshepherd.org.au" class="external text" title="http://www.whiteshepherd.org.au" rel="nofollow">The White Swiss Shepherd Dog Club of Australia Inc (WSSDCA)</a>. <a href="http://www.whiteshepherdsnz.com" class="external text" title="http://www.whiteshepherdsnz.com" rel="nofollow">The White Shepherd Dog Club of New Zealand</a> also protects and promotes the white dog.</p>
