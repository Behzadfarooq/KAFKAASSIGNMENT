<p>In Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, it says the Berlin Philharmonic Society was founded in 1826 (not 1862), and by Eduard Rietz. Does anyone know if there was any connection between the BPO and BPS? Peter / 2006-06-25.</p>

<li>Format A:
<ol>
<li>It isn't encyclopedical, it's a blog format. Wikipedia is not a blog.</li>
<li>A1 lists Furtwängler on a single line, breaking the timeline. It's sorted anti-chronologically but is bastardized with an alphabetical list format, neither fish nor fowl.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Format B:
<ol>
<li>It provides the encyclopedical chronological format.</li>
<li>As a compromise with format A's wish of highlighting the current director, the non-TOC bold headers allow the reader to immediately find the current director. Format B1 goes deeper into this compromise by having the current director first, and the chronological order applied only to the list of *past* conductors.</li>
<li>It clearly states the criterion used for the sorting, and the sort key, dates, are prominent and aligned.</li>
<li>Listing Furtwängler twice isn't a bug but a feature, preserving the timeline and allowing one to easily lookup who was the director at any given date, whitout having to read the whole list to find the Furtwängler Easter egg.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../a/s/_/Wikipedia%7EAs_of_1bbb.html" title="Wikipedia:As of">As of</a> syntax informs the reader of the last update and validity of this information, while flagging the page for a later update if local editors forget it.</li>

<dl>
<dd>You've omitted format C, which was the original format on this and almost every other orchestra page (it's still there on most other orchestra pages). C is reverse chronological order with repeated conductors (such as Furtwangler) listed twice. I don't really care between formats C and B, but we should be consistent. I agree that repeated conductors should appear twice. Usually people are more interested in more recent conductors, which pushes me slightly towards C, but it's not a big deal. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrover_cleveland_cc48.html" title="User:Grover cleveland">Grover cleveland</a> 14:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I've added your C as "A2", to keep the cousins "A1" and "A2" together. The difference between A1 and A2 isn't trivial, but the divide between A2 and B remains wide and open to debate. For a fuller choice, I've also split B into cousins B1 and B2. I still think B2 is more encyclopedical, but someone could add compelling reasons for B1, and B1 could provide a larger consensus. -- ChronoOrder as 62.147.38.70 16:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some points and food for thought:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lists orders are usually based on the nature of the document, its public, and the service it provides.
<ul>
<li>On a blog, which is updated and read frequently by the same people coming back, it makes sense to adopt a reverse chronological order - but Wikipedia isn't a blog.</li>
<li>On commercial sites such as <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDb_27b2.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a>, they also list movies in reverse chronological order. This is because they reckon a majority of their visitors have seen or heard about recent movies, and will find them more quickly when listed at the top. And, for their DVD-selling ads, recent items generates more profit than older movies. But Wikipedia isn't a commercial site, and isn't selling orchestral records.</li>
<li>Universally, encyclopedias use chronological order, which is the more convenient to read, look up, and thus the more globally useful for all sorts of readers. Most readers of a Wikipedia article won't come back often. They either came to read the full article, or they're searching for a specific information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the one hand, I agree there should be, eventually, some consistence between orchestra articles. At some point, we should invite the editors of the other majors orchestra, from their article's talk page, to come here provide their opinions about the pros and cons.</li>
<li>But on the other hand, there should also be consistence with the encyclopedic purpose, and with the *rest* of the Wikipedia: chronological order is the one massively adopted on Wikipedia in every other domains: bibliographies, discographies, filmographies, etc. Should lists of orchestra conductors be the only ones in Wikipedia to be in reverse chronology, and why?</li>
</ol>

<dd>1. chronological order is boring and not interest, because everyone has topical interest, which one is now conductor. 2. is it easier to added a new one. 3. it would be better, you'r registered as a normal user! <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDontworry_fa94.html" title="User:Dontworry">Dontworry</a> 18:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>Wikipedia intends to be an encyclopedia, not a glossy magazine. It doesn't matter if "chronological order is boring" (as you put it), it's standard, practical, and useful, and that's why it's used in every encyclopedia or reference book. On a related item, a phonebook too is a pretty "boring" format, but it's done this way for a reason: it works. Furthermore, about "topical interest, which one is now conductor" (as you put it), both format B1 and B2 prominently show who's current conductor; much more than your blog format, actually, where the reader first have to guess what's the list order, before interpreting it.</li>
<li>The format is supposed to be useful for READERS first, not just for editors; this is an encyclopedia, not a role-playing game. Furthermore, it isn't especially more difficult to add someone at the end of a list than at its beginning, you're making a mountain of a molehill. Last but not least, this list isn't something updated every day, or every week, not even every year. This point is nonsense.</li>
<li>Advice for advice: it would be better, you'r learned English as a normal user!</li>
<li>Thus, none of your "objections" is valid.</li>
<li>And you've provided no retort to the points I brought above.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Current conductor in lead</span></h2>
<p>The lead is supposed to be a dicdef of sorts of the topic and a summary or digest of the article's main information, as well as an introduction, as per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>. Thus, it's perfectly normal to have it mention who's the BPO's current director, as the article always did until now.</p>
<p>But it just dawned on me: the reason Dontworry has been recently and repeatedly trying to delete the information about the current conductor from the article's lead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin_Philharmonic_Orchestra&amp;diff=64257492&amp;oldid=64254817" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin_Philharmonic_Orchestra&amp;diff=64257492&amp;oldid=64254817" rel="nofollow">(diff of July 17 lead deletion)</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin_Philharmonic_Orchestra&amp;diff=64439265&amp;oldid=64439121" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlin_Philharmonic_Orchestra&amp;diff=64439265&amp;oldid=64439121" rel="nofollow">(diff of July 18 lead deletion)</a>, in violation of <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, common sense, and readers' interest:</p>
<p>His only "point" for forcing blog format on conductors is that he allegedly wants to highlight who's the current conductor. Not only was this point refuted by the bold header and the first place offered by list format B1... but the very fact that the current conductor is told right from the article's lead was invalidating it, too. So, he's now trying to remove this useful information from the lead, weakening the whole article, just to manufacture a point in favor of blog format. Ouch.</p>
<p>IMO, since he refused discussion and mediation, there's no reason to "assume good faith" any more about him, and we can thus look into that sort of rationals for his otherwise inane actions on the lead.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mediation</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I have been asked to serve as mediator regarding the issue on presentation of data in the Philharmonic page. Mediation is a structured way to resolve disagreements by making conversation easier, with any party able to withdraw at any time. I don't have contact information for all possibly interested parties (some of whom don't have accounts). If you accept mediation, please leave a note on my talk page along with your email address or other preferred means of contact. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 14:52, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note: I'm the one who requested (and thus accepted) this mediation on Improv's talk page. After 5 days of refusing to provide arguments on this talk page, and more petty vandalism on the article, Dontworry rejected it on his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dontworry&amp;diff=64448651&amp;oldid=63680698" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dontworry&amp;diff=64448651&amp;oldid=63680698" rel="nofollow">(diff)</a>. -- ChronoOrder as 62.147.112.38 12:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. This guy/girl claimed, that only in his/her way conductors are listed.</p>
<p>2. In minimum of 80% of this list [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_symphony_orchestras" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_symphony_orchestras" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] (if an orchestra/artikel has such a list of conductors) you can see, it is in reverse form!</p>
<p>3. I can't believe, that WP-admins support such amazing behaviour of a crazy user, instead to kick out he/she! <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDontworry_fa94.html" title="User:Dontworry">Dontworry</a> 18:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Nope, I provided in the first section of this page the negative points of the blog format, and the positive points of the regular format, and justified each of my moves. You're the one who simply claimed your way was right, tried to impose it without debate, and used agressive and insulting edit summaries to do so.</li>
<li>Because some other orchestras have cut-n-pasted this format without minding what's the best format, doesn't mean it's set in stone and can't be debated and changed now. Furthermore, 99% of Wikipedia uses chronological format for lists of works and people, just like reference books and encyclopedias.</li>
<li>You're the one who broke every wiki-rules at every turn, and not just on this article. I hope you are aware that all your actions remain permanently logged, because I have been advised by the mediator that I could send your case directly to the Arbitration Committee, where they can ban you.</li>

<dd>I'm not supporting either side. I don't really care which order the conductors are listed in. What I do care about is that the edit warring and name-calling stop. The fact that the other user prefers the other order does not make him or her either stupid or ignorant. Persisting in making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> against other editors can get you blocked. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 19:18, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion the attack comes first from him/her and this unregistred user tells me always about his selfmade creative rules and accuse me of vandalism - it's like a story from Kafka or King. Can you explain me, why this gay/girl don't change before all the other list from where I'd above tell you? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDontworry_fa94.html" title="User:Dontworry">Dontworry</a> 22:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About "why this gay/girl don't change before all the other list from where I'd above tell you" (as you put it): because we're not like you, we don't go on a rampage changing things on a personal whim without first debate and deciding what's the proper format to change things to. As has been explained above:
<ul>
<li>We were first supposed to do our homework and debate the two formats here, listing pros and cons, clearing up the debate.</li>
<li>As a second step, as said above, we would have notified the editors of the other orchestra pages to come here see our arguments, and provide theirs, to get a consensus on the final format for conductors lists.</li>
<li>And then only, we would have harmonized all orchestra pages with the best format for lists, agreed upon by all parties.</li>
<li>Sorry if such rational, democratic process seems so mind-blowing to someone such as you with his own private direct line to Truth, but that's how us foolish mortals do those things in those parts.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And at any rate, you can not support your argument by invoking the fact that I didn't went and unilateraly changed all others orchestras pages while a debate about the best format was taking place here: doing so would have been a serious offense against due process. So you're accusing me of not having committed the sort of offense you'd do, that's hardly a point.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps <i>both</i> of you could explain why it's so all-fired important one way or the other.

<dd>"Both"&#160;?? Er, could you please see the large talk section at the top of this page, about formats:
<ul>
<li>Since July 12, I have listed there the 4 possible formats, annotated them, explained why blog format isn't useful, consistent, or encyclopedical, and why the regular format is. Not to mention side details about expliciting sort criteria, and "As of" syntax. At least, I can say I have a fully exposed rational basis for defending this.</li>
<li>But you're right that the other party never explained his urges, he simply stated that "chronological order is boring" (above), and that "wrong is wrong" (on his talk page), which is hardly solid ground for his persistent vandalism of the article. (Many of his reversions have been made back to a 10-day old preferred version, cancelling all later progress of the article, which is destructive and qualifies for vandalism.)</li>

<li>It should also be noted that, according to your (ir)rationale, we should also write articles in reverse chronology, starting with the latests exciting news about the topic, and ending with its boring birth.
