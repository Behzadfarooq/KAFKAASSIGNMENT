<p>What happened? Up to August 2006, there was a section called "Controversy and Criticism" to which I contributed solid references to articles critical of the Bears' stereotypical gender roles. This section has now been replaced by "Praise and Comment" which now has a smattering of "blog" entries among its sources.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure but it appears the deletions were by a user "BerenstainMike". I guess you must be a fan. I don't mind keeping the "Praise &amp; Comment" section because there are one or two good references there. But I went ahead and re-instated the Controvery &amp; Criticism section (which still needs some work formatting the references)</p>
<p>Tweesdad</p>
<p>Someone removed the substantive criticism again, but left the orphaned References section. I don't care much about the criticism, but I put it back. If whoever hates the criticism decides to remove it again, please also remove the appropriate reference entries, thanks. --<a href="../../../v/a/c/User%7EVAcharon_21d8.html" title="User:VAcharon">VAcharon</a> 01:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be kind of funny, wouldn't it, a pun with the "bear" inserted into the name? However, the official site, <a href="http://www.berenstainbears.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.berenstainbears.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.berenstainbears.com/</a>, spells it "Berenstain". —<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/w/User_talk%7ELowellian_719b.html" title="User talk:Lowellian">talk</a>) 06:33, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, throughout my childhood, it was always "Berenstein" Bears. At some point in the mid 90's, it looks like they changed it to "Berenstain" with an A. I found some old books with the original spelling, so I know I'm not crazy. Anyone know when/why it was changed? I'm just curious, since I noticed that Stan's recent obituary had the "Berenstain" spelling. Salena 22:27, January 1, 2006</dd>

<dd>Yes, they've written a couple of Berenstain Bears novels. I've read some of them myself, all of them from either <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a> or <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>.

<p>One of my favorite books when I was a kid was "The Berenstain Bears and the Spooky Old Tree." It does not appear to be listed here... I remember it featured only Brother and Sister Bear, and they were exploring the interior of a mammoth tree which combined equal parts cave (bats, dripping water, etc) and haunted house (there were staircases and evil-looking paintings in the interior) I remember the repeated tagline, "Do they dare (insert action here)?" and on the next page, "They dare!" <a href="../../../t/m/o/User%7ETmorrisey_2efd.html" title="User:Tmorrisey">Tmorrisey</a> 21:53, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is no longer a themed section of Berenstain Bears at Cedar Point, much to my dismay. They have converted it to a Peanuts cartoon theme, although one can still see remnants of the unique Berenstain Bears-style architecture. If your curious, there was an indoor and outdoor section. Inside, there was a whole library of all the Berenstain Bears books, some woods (denoted by plastic trees and colored carpeting), a lab and other things I don't quite remember. The lab had this really cool bicycle that would power a lightbulb, lightning globes/plasma spheres, etc. Outside they had a sandpit, a little train, and a replica of the Berenstain Bears's home! I'm not the only one bitter about it turning into a Peanuts gift shop... --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrowiz_a6da.html" title="User:Macrowiz">Macrowiz</a> 15:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the Amazon.com reviews for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>These reviews are informal rantings made by beings with names such as <b>JamieX-Treme</b>, and so that doesn't make a source of any consequence, nor could you base any facts on them since they are open to considerable dispute</li>
<li>They unessesarily made the article %50 longer, and much harder to read</li>
</ol>
<p>unfortunately that leaves the religion controversy unsourced. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantosh_fa6c.html" title="User:Bantosh">Bantosh</a> 9:32, 19 June 2006</p>
<p><br />
Examples of critical user reviews from Amazon.com:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I was a fan of the Berenstain Bears as a kid and as I grew up I respected the way they could address difficult issues in an open minded, positive, and non-biased manner. Thus, I was surprised when I read this title. Expecting maybe a look at world religions or some such, I was disappointed to find it only looked at Christianity."- Zappaphile</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I love all of The Berenstein Bear books. I've been reading them since I've been a kid. I'm now 20 years old and I still read the books. But this one offends me. I love Jan &amp; Stan Berenstain, but why did they have to bring 'God' into the series? I am an atheist, and hearing/reading the word 'God' makes me sick! I'm sick of people being obsessed with all these mythical gods and stuck up in religion! I crave the day that religion and the belief in gods is completely destroyed from people's minds. Bringing 'God' into my favorite children's book series is an absolute disgrace."-JamieX-Treme</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I'm 24 years old and have always liked the Berenstain Bears books because they are fun and tackle serious issues in a very human way. "The Big Question," however, left me wondering if this book was meant to urge kids to become Christian. While I'm not always so quick to jump onto the "conspiracy" bandwagon, it seems that this story could have been handled much differently. Unlike the other books, it appeals to only one audience-- Christian. I am Jewish and agnostic. I know some Jews, Christians, Muslims, Wiccans/Pagans, Buddists, atheists, and agnostics. What bothers me is that Mama answers Sister's question as if she KNOWS the answer. Why not tell sister that this is a tough question? There are many religions, many beliefs, and we have to respect all of these beliefs and that, ultimately, nobody really knows the answer? Why not tell her that many believe in one or many gods, and others don't believe in a god at all? Maybe then Mama could have said that she believes in God, and then taken the family to church (or wherever) to teach Sister about one of many ways of looking at the world, instead of insinuating that Christianity has all the answers?"-"Animation Junkie"</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of positive user reviews from Amazon.com:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This Book is one of my favorites out of the Berestain Bear Collection. The book deals with the question how did we come to be, who created us&#160;? The writers give their view by taking the family to church and show what they learn. This book is a rare collection and it gives me great pleasure to know that my kids can read a book like this. Coming from a strong Christain home I can say this book hits a spot on our family book case."-A Reader</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"This book is another hit to add with the Berenstain Bear Collection. I thank God that there are still books out there that still teach kids a lesson and entertains them at the same time. These books are truley a good way to get your kids motivatived to read, instead of watching TV. So I give this book and all the other Berenstain Bear books 5 Stars."-A reader</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of a Neutral Review from Amazon.com:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I grew up with the Berenstain Bears, reading them and having them read to me both as a connection with the outside world and a symbol of morality. While I enjoyed their handling of bullying, Racism, and School Problems, I find myself not that satisfied with this interpretation of 'what is out there'.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a Humanist. Unlike the Richard Dawkinses out there, I don't believe in the eradication of Religion entirely, but in tolerating it as an alternative and mostly good view. Like The Bears themselves and their Grandparents in this book, my less immediate Family were and still are deeply faithful Methodists, and like the bears they were more in favour of using Religion as a connection between different people rather than a seperation between different faiths.</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins and some similarly-minded reviewers on this very page fall into the trap of believing that Religion is only one thing, and in their idea it is a force that makes people kill other people for a holy wars. Yet look into the stories of Buddhism and the traditions of Judeaism, spend one morning in a methodist Church and an afternoon in a Mosque, and you can see that the Average true believer couldn't care less who doesn't worship the way they do - all that matters to them Religion-Wise is Pleasing God, and the biggest rule of all Religions is: 'Do Unto Others as youw ould have them Do Unto You'...</p>
<p>...All I'm saying is that though I deeply respect all of the Berenstain family, it might be wise to revise their introduction to Religion. Children, when books are read to them, are 'Clean Slates' - their ideas are new and only vaguely affected by outside influence. Unlike TV &amp; Gaming machines, a Book can give them an informed opinion of a subject - so we have to be careful not to give them one view, but let them choose from several." - Alex 'Gecko' Nuan.</p>
