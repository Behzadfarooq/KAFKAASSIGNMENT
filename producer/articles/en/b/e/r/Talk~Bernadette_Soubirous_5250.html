<dd>Thank you, dominick. Speaking frankly, I have <i>had it</i> with the pseudo-skeptical remarks being inserted into this article. They do not serve to make the article more NPOV -- rather, they interrupt the flow of the narrative. There are ways to report what happened, and what was said to have happened, without resorting to "This could have happened for natural reasons" and the extraneous links to Ms. Shack's ill-worded articles, which are based largely on original research and her own speculation. I've done my fair share of that when I was disturbed about a subject, and I try not to handle articles like that on wikipedia any more if I can't keep my emotions out of it. I'm coming very close to going on another hiatus from this article if something can't be done. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 07:42, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Was Bernadette 14 or 17 when she had her first vision? If she was born in 1841 and the first vision was in 1858, she should have been 16 or 17; however, the article says that she was 14. Is her age at the time a typo?</p>

<p>Whoever is editing this article to insert material from Werfel's book is hereby requested to stop it. Werfel's book is not a biography or a documentary, it is hagiographic fiction. Vauzous was not Bernadette's school teacher, for instance. You've inserted this material several times (comments like "at sixteen the ailing child was very beautiful" are direct quotes from the book).

<p>My understanding is that Bernadette's name at birth was "Marie-Bernard", and "Bernadette" is only a diminutive of this name (a <i>soubriquet</i>). However, she was so widely known as <i>Bernadette</i> that it became accepted as her name. Can anyone confirm this? (I do know that when she took the veil, her name became Soeur Marie-Bernard). <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreacherdoc_067c.html" title="User:Preacherdoc">Preacherdoc</a> 00:50, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>According to Oliver Todd's <i>The Lourdes Pilgrim</i> (Chelmsford: Matthew James Publishing, 1997) she was baptised as <b>Marie-Bernarde</b> but always known as Bernadette. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbristol_f821.html" title="User:Benbristol">Benbristol</a>, 14:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, in addition to the above, the article has her named as St Bernadette Soubirous. This is wrong. She is Bernadette Soubirous, sure, but St Bernadette of Lourdes. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbristol_f821.html" title="User:Benbristol">Benbristol</a>, 14:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In her excellent, well-researched book <i>Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age</i>, the author Ruth Harris describes several events which echo the accepted Bernadette narrative. Until I read it, I was unaware that, in the decades before Bernadette's visions, several illiterate peasant children (usually girls) claimed to see the Virgin Mary in visions in remote countryside (typically clefts or caves in rocks) all along the Pyrenean border between France and Spain (sometimes on the Spanish or Basque side). After investigation, all were discredited. However, Harris points out that Bernadette's visions, rather than being unique and unprecedented, took place against the backdrop of a cultural ethos which supported (perhaps even expected) such events.</p>
<p>Although Bernadette herself claimed to shy away from the publicity which her visions brought, there is no doubting the benefit (in money and status) it brought to her penniless family. It might be reasonable to include some remarks along these lines in the article. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreacherdoc_067c.html" title="User:Preacherdoc">Preacherdoc</a> 01:05, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've seen in some places that she had 17 visions of the Virgin Mary, other places (in the seeming majority) have claimed 18. So, what I want to know is: which one is it? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Betts_6cab.html" title="User:Michael Betts">Elemento</a> 16:33, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
