<p>The first recorded cricket match to take place in Bermuda occurred on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">30 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1844.html" title="1844">1844</a>. The Bermuda Cricket Club was formed one year later and had support from locals as well as British troops. Some international games were played against American sides, principally from <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in the late <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, but the cricketing strength of the island diminished greatly after the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>. Indeed, the only significant tour in the inter-War years was a five-match tour by a team led by Sir <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julien_Cahn_f705.html" title="Julien Cahn">Julien Cahn</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>.</p>

<p>After the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> cricket regained popularity in Bermuda, and many tours arrived, including some Test sides on the way to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indian_cricket_team_6ec3.html" title="West Indian cricket team">West Indies</a>. The first Bermudian tour of <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">England</a> took place in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> and more tours followed. Bermuda also is the place where the first non-Yorkshireman played for <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club_284c.html" title="Yorkshire County Cricket Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a>. Yorkshire traditionally had a rule that no-one born outside the county could play for them, a rule abandoned in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990s</a>. However, the rule was bent to allow <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Sobers_7463.html" title="Garry Sobers">Garry Sobers</a> to play some games for them under the captaincy of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Close_2b2a.html" title="Brian Close">Brian Close</a> during a festival match in Bermuda.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> Bermuda was elected to Associate Membership of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">International Cricket Council</a>.

Since then they have competed in a wide range of international competitions including the <a href="../../../i/c/c/ICC_Trophy_8748.html" title="ICC Trophy">ICC Trophy</a>, a competition which was proposed by <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_Hunt_cb15.html" title="Alma Hunt">Alma Hunt</a>, the Bermudian delegate to the ICC.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> they competed in the <a href="../../../i/c/c/ICC_Intercontinental_Cup_2b1c.html" title="ICC Intercontinental Cup">ICC Intercontinental Cup</a>, playing in the same group as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_cricket_team.html" title="Canadian cricket team">Canada</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_cricket_team_2c10.html" title="United States cricket team">United States</a>. In 2004, the first running of the competition, they were knocked out after losing to Canada and drawing against the Americans. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_ICC_Intercontinental_Cup_93c8.html" title="2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup">2005</a>, they won the American group after beating Canada and the <a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayman_Islands_cricket_team_6e73.html" title="Cayman Islands cricket team">Cayman Islands</a> in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. However, the semi-final against Kenya in October was lost.</p>
<p>Bermuda's greatest cricketing moment came on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">7 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> when they qualified for the semi-finals of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_ICC_Trophy_1540.html" title="2005 ICC Trophy">2005 ICC Trophy</a>. Qualification for the semis meant they won a place in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007_cricket_World_Cup_af06.html" title="2007 cricket World Cup">2007 cricket World Cup</a> in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indian_cricket_team_6ec3.html" title="West Indian cricket team">West Indies</a> and that, from <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> until the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2009_ICC_World_Cup_Qualifier_d779.html" title="2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier">2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier</a>, they will have official <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_international.html" title="One-day international">one-day international</a> status.</p>
<p>Bermuda's first international engagement of 2006 ended in disappointment, when they lost every game on a five-match tour of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Emirates_edab.html" title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</a>. It should be pointed out that the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Emirates_cricket_team_d245.html" title="United Arab Emirates cricket team">UAE team</a> was much stronger than the one fielded at the 2005 ICC Trophy, as several players selected are not eligible for selection in ICC-sanctioned tournaments.</p>
<p>Bermuda played their first <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-day_International_5936.html" title="One-day International">One-day International</a> in May 2006, and were successful in their first outing, beating <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_cricket_team.html" title="Canadian cricket team">Canada</a> at the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Park_Oval_7e35.html" title="Queen's Park Oval">Queen's Park Oval</a> in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinidad.html" title="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> as part of a triangular series which also included <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwean_cricket_team.html" title="Zimbabwean cricket team">Zimbabwe</a>. This made them the fourth team to win their first ODI, after <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_cricket_team.html" title="Australian cricket team">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_cricket_team_b7ed.html" title="New Zealand cricket team">New Zealand</a> and Zimbabwe. However, Bermuda lost their second ODI, against Zimbabwe, by 194 runs, after conceding 338 for seven and also lost the final, again against Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>In July 2006, they took part in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_20_20_3ad6.html" title="Stanford 20/20">Stanford 20/20</a> knock-out tournament, but lost to Jamaica. They were given $100,000 for participating in the event. The following month they toured Canada, playing a four-day <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercontinental_Cup_1103.html" title="Intercontinental Cup">Intercontinental Cup</a> game and two ODIs. They lost the Intercontinental Cup game by nine wickets in a match that went into the final hour, but won both of the two ODIs. They are due to play <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenyan_cricket_team.html" title="Kenyan cricket team">Kenya</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_cricket_team.html" title="Dutch cricket team">The Netherlands</a> in their other Intercontinental Cup matches later this year.</p>
<p>Also in August, they played in Division One of the <a href="../../../i/c/c/ICC_Americas_Championship_73e8.html" title="ICC Americas Championship">ICC Americas Championship</a>, and they won the tournament for the first time, without losing a game.</p>
<p>In November they visited <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenya.html" title="Kenya">Kenya</a> for an Intercontinental Cup match and three ODIs. They drew the Intercontinental Cup match in a rain-affected game, and lost all three ODIs. They then went to South Africa, starting with an Intercontinental Cup game against the Netherlands. This was drawn, but highlighted by a record breaking innings from <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glamorgan_County_Cricket_Club_b621.html" title="Glamorgan County Cricket Club">Glamorgan</a> batsman <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hemp_1e7c.html" title="David Hemp">David Hemp</a> who scored 247 not out, the highest score in the history of the competition.</p>
<p>This was followed by a triangular series against Canada and the Netherlands. They lost the first three games, but beat the Netherlands in the final, low-scoring game.</p>
