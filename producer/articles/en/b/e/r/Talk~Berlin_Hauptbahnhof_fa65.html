<p>Is more correctly translated as "main station". Main station is not always the central station, and supported anecdotally that most mass transit systems in Germany/Austria with English translations call it "main station". --<a href="../../../k/j/d/User%7EKjd_0ab4.html" title="User:Kjd">kjd</a> 20:21, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may be Berlin's main station, but Main Station is a rare title in English; we wouldn't call it Head Station either, even though this might be even more literal. Just as the various Central Stations in English-speaking countries are usually translated to Hauptbahnhof in German (e.g., Newcastle Hauptbahnhof), Central Station is the usual term in English for Hauptbahnhof. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 20:51, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is kind of silly. Most people wouldn't fuss about translating New York's Grand Central Station.

<dd>Rare as in Farnborough (Main) being AFAIK the only instance of an indigenous Main Station - and even that's misleading: the "Main" refers to the line it's on (BML - Bournemouth Main Line). The more traditional British English designation for a non-central main station is General Station - this was once very much standard GWR practice (Neath General, Cardiff General, Bodmin General, Stratford-upon-Avon General, Leamington Spa General, Oxford General etc etc etc), but now only survives in the name of Wrexham General, which sounds very archaic now. 82.36.26.229 01:37, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I originally made the change (my apologies for failing to log in properly on that occasion). I did it not only because it was not the strict literal translation but because I could not see how one could possibly call it Central. If we were talking about Leipzig or Cologne or just about anywhere else even I accept that this was being over-pedantic. My feeling was that in this case to call it Central would be simply wrong and misleading. If this was Britain I do not think a station in the middle of nowhere would be called Central. By way of analogy think of Exeter. Exeter St. Davids is a big interchange station which is the main station for Exeter. It is at the foot of a hill on which the city is situated. There is also another station in the middle of the city with an infrequent train service called Exeter Central. It is called Exeter Central because it is, um, central. Am I missing something&#160;? I accept Main is rare in the UK but we all know what is meant, there is no confusion - and although it is rare it is (or was) not unknown. At the end of the day I am not really bothered. I just thought calling it "Central" might confuse someone visiting Berlin for the first time.--Pedantic of Purley 09:53, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is indeed in the middle of nowhere, but geographically it's smack dab in the center of Berlin. Built with the expectation that by now all the division would have been healed and Berlin would be booming with nearly 5 million people. A better name would be Berlin White Elephant station. (FWIW, SÃ¼dkreuz, the new expensive second-biggest station, is also in the wilderness.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 11:01, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"It is indeed in the middle of nowhere, but geographically it's smack dab in the center of Berlin." True. In the spirit of non-discrimination, it is equally inaccessible from all parts of the city. I live much closer to <s>Lehrter Bahnhof</s>Hauptbahnhof than to Zoo, but if I want to go there, I still have to change trains at Zoo. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<small><i><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a></i></small> 11:41, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of what we translate its name as, it might be worth describing its location which we all seem to agree is in the geographic centre of Berlin surrounded by nothing - hence the need for U55 which might be worth a mention. As I don't live in Berlin this is the sort of thing that I don't feel able to accurately comment on.--Pedantic of Purley 14:07, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does it refer to the man as a "German man"? Isn't that redundant? I mean, if this station was in the United States, they wouldn't say "an American man". Besides, regardless of where the incident takes place, does the ethnicity of the person really matter? Why can't it just say "a man"? So, yeah, I don't think that it should say a "German man". <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Speyeker (<a href="../../../s/p/e/User_talk%7ESpeyeker_7cbb.html" title="User talk:Speyeker">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Speyeker_702d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Speyeker">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Why is this "incident" relevant for Berlin Hauptbahnhof at all? It did not happen during the actual opening ceremony and it was some hundred metres away. [Jan from Germany, 84.137.51.8 14:28, 27 May 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<dd>I noticed 88.134.200.250 tried to remove the incident section but his/her actions were reverted by <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyboycrashfan_c289.html" title="User:Royboycrashfan">Royboycrashfan</a>, a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a> patroller. However, I believe the removal of the incident section should be a point open for discussion. In my personal opinion this incident does indeed not deserve a seperate section, although if someone were to write something on the opening itself, the incident could perhaps be briefly mentioned. It's all pretty current at the moment, I advise you to first let the attention die down. In the meanwhile try discussing it with <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> and other regular contributors. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrucevdk_d94b.html" title="User:Brucevdk">Bruce</a> 22:48, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Au contraire, any mention of the station opening is going to mention this incident, and all of the news reports of the station opening I've seen have described the ceremony as being overshadowed by the incident. In future, we don't have to give any details, but it should still be mentioned; for example, "The station opened after a cosnstruction time of nearly eleven years. It was opened by Chancellor Angela Merkel in May 2005, shortly before the World Cup began. The lavish ceremony was marred by an incident in which an unnstable man stabbed 28 spectators, although there were no fatalities." ...and then move on. This is still one of the most notable cases of someone running amok in recent German history. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:white;background:#700">&#160;<span style="background:#800">Pr<span style="background:#900">oh<span style="background:#a00">ib<span style="background:#b00">it<span style="background:#c00"><b>O</b></span><b>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>n</b></span><b>s</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 22:02, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, all mention of it has been removed from the German article as being irrelevant to the train station.

<dd>It was the opening ceremony, which spread out quite far around the station, and was the reason all the people were there. The attacks took place in various locations, but it was the fact that there was a big crowd, a distraction (the station and the light show) and lots of noise (the music) that allowed him to get away with stabbing so many people. I agree that it deserves little more than a passing mention, but it's giong to be something people remember in conjunction with the station, and all the media are reporting it this way. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:white;background:#700">&#160;<span style="background:#800">Pr<span style="background:#900">oh<span style="background:#a00">ib<span style="background:#b00">it<span style="background:#c00"><b>O</b></span><b>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>n</b></span><b>s</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 22:33, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think "crossing station" is a literal translation of the German word "Kreuzbahnof" or "Turmbahnhof". This denotes a station where railways from different directions meet on separate levels. (Only?) In the area of former Prussia this a common type of station. Thus, "Europe's largest crossing station" is no predicate really worth mentioning.

<dd>That explains the enormous line for the toilet I saw when I went to Hauptbahnhof last week. When you come up from the parking garage, you walk out into the hallway where the restrooms are and there was a <i>huge</i> line of mostly women waiting to get in. They don't need one more set of toilets, as they say in that article; they need at least three more sets. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 12:09, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, have to say the station displays a remarkable lack of attention to the needs of its users (although, I should point out, this is not so remarkable for Germany). The worst part is changing trains from north-south to east-west, which is the entire reason the station was built. The two track levels are five storys apart, but the escalators are located at 90-degree angles to each other, along narrow walkways, which are lined with shops and which are bisected by roof supports every few meters. It only takes a couple of people standing still (or browsing in a shop window) to create a bottleneck. There are cool-looking glass elevators that look like pistons, but these are very slow and are usually crowded. What's more, like most German stations there is no separation of incoming and outgoing pedestrian traffic, so that there are often collisions on steps as a train arrives, as those who are trying to get to the train are hindered by those leaving it. And there is, as always, no attempt made to encourage the "stand on the right" rule on escalators, meaning that the trip between trains can take a long time.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While the stupid LadenschluÃgesetz mercifully does not apply to the station, Deutsche Bahn should have taken note of how things work at, say, Leipzig Hbf, and put in very large retail units, but the biggest store is a Kaiser's supermarket (I'd guess 100 square meters) and it is always crowded.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Meanwhile, the station is still in the middle of nowhere, and almost all the hustle and bustle is due to people changing trains; that is, going from the top floor to the bottom one, for which there is, as I mentioned, no direct route.</dd>

<dd>The parking garage is a disaster too. There's no clear signage showing how to get from the parking garage to the station, and as far as I could tell there's only one entrance. You ought to be able to get to any level of the station directly from the parking garage, but instead you have to go inside first and use the same poorly laid-out escalators or too-few elevators as everyone else. When you leave again, the automats where you stamp your ticket and pay your money are placed in the middle of the parking lots instead of near the doors where you exit the station. Then when you try to drive out, the signs marking the way to the <i>Ausfahrt</i> are ambiguous at best. The exit you need to drive through to get to the Tiergartentunnel has a big sign over it saying <b>AUSFAHRT -&gt;</b>, making you think that isn't the exit after all, but that you have to turn right there to get to the exit. After driving around in circles three times, we finally decided to risk going straight ahead there to see what happened, and sure enough it was the exit. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 11:44, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The new station is a disgrace. It is basically a shopping centre. If you look carefully between the Starbucks, McDonalds and Virgin, you may be lucky enough to find the very small, completely inadequate ticket office. A good way to find it is to look for the queue of unhappy passengers. Similarly there is a small understaffed left luggage office where I had to queue for about twenty minutes to leave my suitcase. And there is no tourist information office. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Matthews_3ef1.html" title="User:Paul Matthews">Paul Matthews</a> 09:52, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A couple more points - when you do find the toilet it costs you 80c. - There is no large clearly visible clock (a basic essential in any station) only two small ones low down at the ends, invisible from most points. - Boards giving departure times, another basic requirement, are scarce (I suppose they would limit the potential for shopping and advertising). <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Matthews_3ef1.html" title="User:Paul Matthews">Paul Matthews</a> 13:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
