<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Sanders_5f17.html" title="Edit section: Early political career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early political career</span></h2>
<p>Sanders' political career began in 1971, when he joined the <a href="../../../o/p/p/Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War_d362.html" title="Opposition to the Vietnam War">anti-Vietnam War</a> <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Union_Party_3ba3.html" title="Liberty Union Party">Liberty Union Party</a> in Vermont. Sanders was an unsuccessful independent candidate for election to the Senate in 1972 and 1974, as well as for governor of Vermont in 1972, 1976 and 1986. In his initial campaign Sanders received only two percent of the vote, but in subsequent races for Senate and Governor were slightly more successful, with Sanders' highest vote tally being six percent.</p>
<p>In 1977, Sanders resigned from the Liberty Union party and worked as a writer and the director of the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-profit_organization.html" title="Non-profit organization">non-profit</a> American People's Historical Society. In 1981, at the suggestion of his friend Richard Sugarman, a religion professor at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Vermont_11e6.html" title="University of Vermont">University of Vermont</a>, Sanders ran for mayor of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlington%2C_Vermont_67b0.html" title="Burlington, Vermont">Burlington</a> and defeated six-term Democratic incumbent Gordon Paquette by 12 votes, in a three-way contest. (An independent candidate, Richard Bove, split the Democratic vote after losing the primary to Paquette).</p>
<p>Increasingly popular because of his successful revitalization of Burlington's downtown area, Sanders won three more terms, defeating both Democratic and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> candidates. In his last run for mayor, in 1987, he defeated a candidate endorsed by both major parties.</p>
<p>During his first term, supporters of Sanders formed the Progressive Coalition, forerunner of the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont_Progressive_Party_49f6.html" title="Vermont Progressive Party">Vermont Progressive Party</a>. The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but held enough votes to keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under Sanders, Burlington became the first city in the country to fund community-trust housing. His administration also sued the local <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_television.html" title="Cable television">cable television</a> provider and won considerably reduced rates and a substantial cash settlement.</p>
<p>Sanders ran for governor for the third time in 1986. He finished third with 14.5 percent of the vote, which was enough to deny incumbent Democrat <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madeleine_Kunin_d21b.html" title="Madeleine Kunin">Madeleine Kunin</a> a majority; she was elected by the state legislature. In 1988, when six-term incumbent Representative <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Jeffords_6ba6.html" title="Jim Jeffords">Jim Jeffords</a> made a successful run for the Senate, Sanders ran for Jefford's vacated seat in the House. Sanders narrowly lost to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Plympton_Smith_5bff.html" title="Peter Plympton Smith">Peter P. Smith</a>, the former lieutenant governor and the 1986 Republican candidate for governor. Sanders again ran against Smith in 1990. In one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, he took 56 percent of the vote and defeated Smith by 16 points, becoming the first independent member of the House since 1950.</p>
<p>Sanders was a member of the faculty at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> in 1989 and of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton_College_d44f.html" title="Hamilton College">Hamilton College</a> in 1991.</p>

<p>Although relations between Sanders and House Democratic leadership were not always smooth, the Democrats did not actively campaign against Sanders since his first run for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a>. While Democratic candidates ran against him in every election except <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> (when Sanders managed to win the Democrats' endorsement), they received little financial support.</p>
<p>Sanders was reelected six times and was the longest-serving independent member of the House. Despite his independent status, he only faced one difficult contest. That came in 1994, in the midst of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Revolution_84e8.html" title="Republican Revolution">Republican Revolution</a> that swept Republicans into control of the Congress. In a year when many marginal seats fell to Republicans, Sanders managed a narrow three-point victory. In every other election, he has won at least 55 percent of the vote. In his last congressional campaign, in 2004, Sanders took 69 percent to Republican Greg Parke's 24 percent and Democrat Larry Drown's 7 percent.</p>
<p>Sanders' lifetime legislative score from the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-CIO_f5ff.html" title="AFL-CIO">AFL-CIO</a> is 100 percent. As of 2006, he has a grade of "C-" from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rifle_Association_d13c.html" title="National Rifle Association">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA). Sanders voted against the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brady_Bill_245e.html" title="Brady Bill">Brady Bill</a> and in favor of a NRA-supported bill to restrict lawsuits against gun manufacturers in 2005.<a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll534.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll534.xml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Sanders voted to abolish the so-called "marriage penalty" and also for a bill that sought to ban <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_cloning.html" title="Human cloning">human cloning</a>. Sanders has endorsed every Democratic candidate for <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">president of the United States</a> since 1992. Sanders is a co-founder of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_Progressive_Caucus_bdae.html" title="Congressional Progressive Caucus">House Progressive Caucus</a> and chaired the grouping of mostly <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">left-wing</a> Democrats for its first eight years.</p>
<p>Sanders voted against both <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Resolution_ee7d.html" title="Iraq Resolution">resolutions</a> authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002 and opposed the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. He later joined almost all of his colleagues in voting for a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-binding_resolution.html" title="Non-binding resolution">non-binding resolution</a> expressing support for U.S. troops at the outset of the invasion, although he gave a floor speech blasting the partisan nature of the resolution and the Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. In relation to the leak investigation involving <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerie_Plame_dd1f.html" title="Valerie Plame">Valerie Plame</a>, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Sanders said, "The revelation that the president authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is now for a serious investigation of how we got into the war in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the president." <a href="http://bernie.org/?p=169" class="external autonumber" title="http://bernie.org/?p=169" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Sanders supports <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_health_care.html" title="Universal health care">universal health care</a> and opposes what he terms "unfettered" <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_trade.html" title="Free trade">free trade</a> <a href="http://bernie.house.gov/trade.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://bernie.house.gov/trade.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which he argues deprives American workers of their jobs while exploiting foreign workers in sweat-shop factories.</p>
<p>An amendment he offered in June 2005 to limit provisions giving the government power to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November 4 of that year by House-Senate negotiators, and never became law. <a href="https://lists.wisc.edu/read/messages?id=495733" class="external autonumber" title="https://lists.wisc.edu/read/messages?id=495733" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Sanders followed this vote on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">November 5</a>, 2005 by voting against the Online Freedom of Speech Act, which would have exempted the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> from the restrictions of the <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act_b192.html" title="Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (McCain-Feingold Bill).</p>
<p>In March 2006, Sanders stated it would be impractical, given the "reality that the Republicans control the House and the Senate", to <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeach.html" title="Impeach">impeach</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

Still, Sanders makes no secret of his opposition to the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_administration_2a44.html" title="George W. Bush administration">George W.

<p>Sanders has also criticized <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>. In June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion with then-<a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_599e.html" title="Federal Reserve">Federal Reserve</a> chairman, Sanders told Greenspan that he was concerned that Greenspan "was way out of touch" and "that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations." <a href="http://bernie.house.gov/statements/20030716135257.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://bernie.house.gov/statements/20030716135257.asp" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>Republicans have attacked Sanders as "an ineffective <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">extremist</a>" for passing only one law and fifteen amendments in his eight terms in the House.<a href="http://www.gopsenators.com/newsdesk/document.aspx?ID=238" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gopsenators.com/newsdesk/document.aspx?ID=238" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://www.nrsc.org/newsdesk/document.aspx?ID=214" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nrsc.org/newsdesk/document.aspx?ID=214" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Sanders responded by saying that he had passed "the most floor amendments of any member of the House since 1996." <a href="http://bernie.org/?p=53" class="external autonumber" title="http://bernie.org/?p=53" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_National_Committee_458c.html" title="Democratic National Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> chair <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a> has stated that "Bernie Sanders votes with the Democrats 98 percent of the time." <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1408482/posts" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1408482/posts" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<p>Sanders had mentioned on several occasions that he would run for the Senate if Jeffords (with whom he has a longstanding friendship) were ever to retire, and entered the race on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> following Jeffords's announcement that he would not seek a fourth term. <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> Senator <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Schumer_2099.html" title="Chuck Schumer">Chuck Schumer</a>, chairman of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Senatorial_Campaign_Committee_5fc0.html" title="Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>, endorsed Sanders; Schumer's backing was critical, as it meant that any Democrat running against Sanders could not expect to receive any significant financial help on a national level. Sanders was also endorsed by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate_7524.html" title="Party leaders of the United States Senate">Senate Minority Leader</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Reid_979b.html" title="Harry Reid">Harry Reid</a> of <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_National_Committee_458c.html" title="Democratic National Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> chairman and former Vermont governor <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a>. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who voted with House Democrats. Senator <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barack_Obama_6463.html" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> also campaigned for Sanders in Vermont. Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did easily.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sanders consistently led his <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican</a> challenger, businessman <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Tarrant_705d.html" title="Richard Tarrant">Richard Tarrant</a>, by wide margins in polling. In the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history,<sup id="_ref-BGlobe-110706_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BGlobe-110706" title="">[4]</a></sup> Sanders defeated Tarrant by an approximately 2-to-1 margin in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_general_elections%2C_2006_457b.html" title="United States general elections, 2006">2006 midterm election</a>. Many national media outlets (including <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a>) projected Sanders the winner before any returns came in.</p>
<p>Sanders is only the third Senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats — following Jeffords and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Leahy_1bee.html" title="Patrick Leahy">Patrick Leahy</a>. Sanders made a deal with the Democratic leadership similar to the one Jeffords made after Jeffords became an independent. In exchange for the committee seats that would be available to him as a Democrat, Sanders will vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless he asks permission of <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_Majority_Whip_0fc6.html" title="Senate Majority Whip">Majority Whip</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Durbin_8d00.html" title="Richard Durbin">Richard Durbin</a>. However, such a request is almost never made and is almost never granted. He is free to vote as he pleases on policy matters, but almost always votes with the Democrats.</p>
<p>In his first Senate term, Sanders serves on the committees on <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Health%2C_Education%2C_Labor%2C_and_Pensions_938f.html" title="United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions">Health, Education, Labor and Pensions</a>; <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Budget_3bc4.html" title="United States Senate Committee on the Budget">Budget</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Environment_and_Public_Works_cb11.html" title="United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works">Environment and Public Works</a>; <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Veterans%27_Affairs_4a74.html" title="United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs">Veterans' Affairs</a>; and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Energy_and_Natural_Resources_ab7c.html" title="United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources">Energy and Natural Resources</a>.</p>
