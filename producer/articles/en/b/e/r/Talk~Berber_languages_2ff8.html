<p>"The Berber languages in the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maghreb.html" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> have officially been subjected to Arab, as part of government policy and was mainly spoken at home and in villages. However, with a growing tribe-awareness and desire for (at least cultural) independence (especially among the Kabyl people), the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_tongue.html" title="Mother tongue">mother tongue</a> has become more important and efforts are made to make for instance formal education bi-lingual.

<p>i'am a reffijn , i speak tarifit, but i say also that i speak tamazight . berber language is a schield word. berber exist not in tamazight (berber language). mean that that we don't speak tamazight (berber language)&#160;?</p>
<p>That wasn't the case historically in many dialects. You check old dictionaries of Kabyle, you won't find any word "tamazight"; there was a word "amazigh", but it just meant "noble man", and didn't have an ethnic meaning.

<p>I think that "THamazighth" should be mentioned as another translation for "Berber language" as in many regions no words start with "T". In addition, neither the terms "Berber" nor "Tamazighth" is used to describe the language people speak in many regions.

<p>Tasoussit is called part of Tachelhit by the Ethnologue; I've added a note to that effect. What are you talking about "acoord with basset not with karl prasse and harry stroomer"?

<p>I have a few remarks I want to add to this discussion. First of all, it was stated that usage of the most commonly used English name is Wikipedia policy. However, there are a number of Wikipedia entries whith a preference for native nomen clatura: for example <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> vs <a href="../../../e/s/k/Eskimo.html" title="Eskimo">Eskimo</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian.html" title="Indian">Indian</a> vs <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native American</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">The Netherlands</a> vs <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a>. Secondly, shouldn't text be as neutral as possible (<a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>)? I don't think Berber is that neutral (e.g. compare with Eskimo/Inuit). Lastly, I'd like to refer to <i>The Berbers (The Peoples of Africa)</i>, Michael Brett and Elizabeth Fentress, pg. 5, 1997: <i>... Of cource, even the use of the name 'Berber' is somewhat arbitrary: ... The word for Berber today is either 'Tamazight' or 'Imazighen', ... Both have been recently adopted throughout North Africa, although their first attestations are only known from Moroccan dialects... There is, however, some evidence that the term was used more widely in the classical period. Under the Romans tribal name 'Mazices' ... too widespread to refer to a specific tribe: it is probably a cognate of Imagizhen, and it may have been one of the terms used to refer to indigenous Africans in general.</i></p>

<dd>The view that 'Tamazight' is a proper name for Berber as a whole is mentioned in the first paragraph of the article. This article has been moved back and forth in the past and I don't see a new argument to revert yet again to <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamazight.html" title="Tamazight">Tamazight</a>. Additionally, the problem of Tamazight is that it really is not truly applicable to all of the Berber languages. See <a href="../../../t/u/a/Tuareg_languages.html" title="Tuareg languages">Tuareg languages</a> for the names of the Tuaregs for their (Berber) languages, and see <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zenaga_language.html" title="Zenaga language">Zenaga language</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/w/Siwi_language.html" title="Siwi language">Siwi language</a> for examples of other Berber languages whose speakers would not refer to their language as 'Tamazight'.</dd>
<dd>In recent years, there have been attempts (mainly by Morrocan and Algerian Berber speakers) to apply the term 'Tamazight' to all of the Berber languages (an important reason for choosing this term has been the fact that it is derived from the old Berber word <i>Amazigh</i>, 'free, noble men'). This has certainly resulted in wider use of the term among the more 'culturally conscious' Berbers, to the extent that one may be able to find some Kabyles who say they speak 'Tamazight' rather than the more specific <i>Taqbaylit</i> â€” but the term 'Tamazight' has by no means gained as wide a use as 'Berber' or 'Berber languages'. â€” <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">âœŽ</a> 11:42, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Professional anthropologists have already postulated, in a classic work on European <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnology.html" title="Ethnology">ethnology</a>, that the modern day <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque.html" title="Basque">Basque</a> people of the Pyrenees Mountains (northern Spain/southern France) speak a language inherited directly from <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cro-Magnon_1943.html" title="Cro-Magnon">Cro-Magnon</a> Man (Ripley, 1899). To give a couple of illustrative examples of the reasons for the above postulation, the Basque word for knife means literally "stone that cuts," and their word for ceiling means "top of the cavern" (Blanc, 1854).</dd>

<dd>But what about the little-known <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian.html" title="Iberian">Iberian</a> language (generally believed to be related to the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a> language of North Africa)? The defunct Iberian language is known to us only through inscriptions (the Iberian script is mainly syllabic, but also partly alphabetic). It was once spoken throughout the entire Iberian peninsula, and through Iberian language specialist William J. Entwhistle (1936) we learn that this language is also related to the modern Basque language.</dd>

<dd>If Basque was indeed the language of Cro-Magnon Man, it must have once been spoken over a much larger area of Europe than it is now. Today it stands isolated into two tiny linguistic "islands," surrounded by languages totally alien in vocabulary, syntax, and grammatical structure (Saltarelli, 1988). According to Harrison, who has done his homework, Basque did indeed cover a far greater area than it does today. He points out that this fact was recorded by the Carthaginians and Romans (Harrison, 1]]974).</dd>

<p>So Ethnologue gives no figures for other European countries than France? Well, maybe I could help you with some rough figures from Holland. There are slightly more than 300.000 people of Moroccan origin in the Netherlands, of which 40% are Arabian an 60% are Berbers. That means that aproximately 200.000 people in the Netherlands speak Berber (perheps a little fewer). Indeed virtually all of them speak Berber as their native tongue, but among the younger generation, Dutch is more often used and many of the youngsters are more fluent in Dutch than in Berber.</p>
<p><br />
I am new to this page but am working from Prasse to try to put together a dictionary of the various Tuareg words he lists into English - I use the term 'Tuareg' advisedly as there are at least seven different central Saharan dialects which I know of and although 'Tamachek' is the word most often used in English the people themselves use other words to refer to their language. I am English and I am also looking for a 'Tamachek' speaker who lives in England from the area (Algerie/Niger) to assist.</p>
<p>I have seen the articles about the Basques. DNA testing has been done on the European population which has confirmed that the Basques are the only people now living in Europe who were the original Stone Age peoples. Their language is also unique, most Europeans speak an Indo-Aryan language base. I am part Romany, part French and part Welsh, and all these languages have origin words from North India/Central Asia. The Guanche also speak a language which has words similar to Basque.</p>
<p>The Berber peoples, whether mountain/coastal or desert peoples (and there is a language difference between the two which my north Moroccan/Algerian friends acknowledge)are a very ancient people. Recent comparisons have confirmed that ancient Egyptian language is a Berber-related tongue. The Berber do have cultural similarities to the proto-Iberians. There are also cultural links to the Phoenicians of coastal settlements and to other prehistoric cultures of the western Mediterranean. The people are one of the most ancient peoples in the world, probably older than the Arabs.</p>
<p>This whole matter of relationships, looking at language, culture (craft items, carvings etc) and the physical structure of the peoples themselves, is a huge and fascinating subject and so far very little work has been done to decide who the Berber people are and where Berber culture spread to in the past. Part of the reason for this is the logistics of working in the physical landscape.</p>
<p>I apologise for this being so long an article but I look forward to your comments.</p>

<dd>While Berber languages could indeed be so ancient, comparisons of the kind of "older than Arabs" serve no rational purpose. The assertion that "ancient Egyptian language is a Berber-related tongue" is also an over-simplification, because it assumes that one language had existed in a form identifiable with its current state before the other has evolved as a deviation from it. While this model indeed exists, it could not be the case with Berber and Egyptian languages. What is more acceptable that both languages have in their ancestors an older Afro-Asiatic language that was neither Berber nor Egyptian. This reminds me of simple anti-evolutionists refusal of "Man being a descendant of a monkey" which no one has ever proposed!</dd>
<dd>In all cases, while many people share the interest in promoting the diversity of the various world cultures, pro-Berber enthusiasts here in Wikipedia need to learn to be more rational in their assertions, and more tolerant in discussions, bearing in mind that Wikipedia is not a place to promote certain ideologies or to publish original research; not until it has been peer-reviewed an established as accepted theses in academia. I'm talking from my experience both here and in fledgling Arabic Wikipedia where either long and intense word-fights are being held, or plain national pride propaganda is being left unchecked to avoid the hassle! --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlef01_4b1a.html" title="User:Alef01">Alif</a> 14:48, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Yes I will agree. It would have been more accurate to say "proto-Berber". There is a problem in studying languages in this area because the word "berber" is one imposed on both the language and the people but neither has itself an "umbrella" or overall term to use.</p>
<p>Research has shown that the language roots of ancient Egyptian are closely related to the Berber tongues which are themselves of ancient origin, and knowledge of Amazigh or other Berber tongues has helped in deciphering ancient Egyptian. Early (19th century) philologists did not pick up on this because the languages of north Africa were ignored or not thought to be relevant.</p>
<p>I also wonder what relationship Maltese has to the Berber tongues. The use of the basic consonants ('t','m','kk', 'x' in Maltese)on which language comparison is largely based seem very similar though I haven't checked the languages against each other. Apart from the loan words which it has an abundance of, due to its history, there seems to be little relationship to nearby European languages. Has anyone loooked into this?</p>
<p>Meanwhile I will continue to concentrate on Tamazigh, Temazlayt, Tamachek. I am interested to find out how much what appear to be different words are different dialects or simply phonetically-written different accents. Given the large area over which this language is spoken then linguistic differences must occur. On the other hand, given the geographical environment, the Berber languages have remained remarkably similar over a very long period of time.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before I could do with help here.</p>

<p>It is stated in the article under the section called Origin that "Tamazight is a member of the Afro-Asiatic language family (formerly called Hamito-Semitic). Traditional genealogists of tribes claiming Arab origin often claimed that Berbers were Arabs that immigrated from Yemen. Some of them considered Tamazight to derive from Arabic. This view, however, is rejected by linguists, who regard Semitic and Berber as two separate branches of Afro-Asiatic."</p>
<p>These statements are a bit misleading. First some may think those traditional geneologists are of Arab origin while it is actually oral Berber (Amazigh) traditions passed down generation to generation and now well documented. This is not to say Berber are from a certain place. It is up for argument and research but the truth is that many Berber tribes that have always been independent and say Yemen is their origin. Those that state this is due to a direct effect of Arabs actually dont know the complexities of ancient Berber traditions as well as their independence.</p>
<p>Also it is misleading to "Tamazight is a member of the Afro-Asiatic language family (formerly called Hamito-Semitic). Traditional genealogists of tribes claiming Arab origin often claimed that Berbers were Arabs that immigrated from Yemen. Some of them considered Tamazight to derive from Arabic." It is well known Arabic has relatively recently entered some Berber vocabulary but I have never read or heard a scholor say Berber languages were derived from Arabic. Also it is misleading to say these genealogists concider or ever concidered Berbers were Arabs. This has never been brought up by any scholor.</p>
<p>The fact that many scholors &amp; berber traditionalists claim Yemen as their origin does not mean Arab. Yemen does not always equal Arab. According to both Berber &amp; scholars of the Arab world, Yemen was the origin of Arab tribes &amp; other tribes that were not Arab (essencially similar tribes that had different languages). Ancient Yemen was ruled by the tribes that although were a middle eastern type people, did not speak Arabic. Only after thousands of years did the weaker Arab tribes overtake their cousin tribes that spoke the other ancient language.</p>
<p>If we take into concideration the time frame Berber traditionalists speak about it was during the time Yemen was predominantly ruled by non-Arabic speakers. According to Ancient Berber traditions those people of Yemen cut across the Red Sea to conqour what is now Ethiopia and from there set off north-westward to North Africa.</p>
<p>The key is not to prove Berber are from any other place other then North Africa but rather to make certain that the facts are not misleading. Berber geneologists &amp; traditionalists can common tribal peoples modern and ancient claim to have Yemen heritage. Yemen does not equal Arab as Yemen spoke a different language. Many are confused between what is called the first Yemeni wave of immigration and the second. If the first happened when the berber traditionalist claim then it happened "before" Yemen was predominantly Arabic speaking. The second wave happened thousands of years later after the Arabic speaking Yemeni tribes overtook the other linguistic groups to become the majority then after accepting Islam went to north Africa to spread Islam. Only then can we assume those Yemeni tribes were Arab. These are all the methods scholars explain, which is completely clear and not misleading. One of the strangest oddities is the fact that DNA tests have brought Yemen and Berber as being the most close genetically. But don't be confused by the words caucasian in dna tests because rather then giving middle-easterners their own race all are listed under caucasian, this point has confused many Berber into thinking that caucasian automatically means aryan. It has never been said that Tamazight is from Arabic. by Mazighe</p>
<p>Linking Imazighen to Yemen is as awkward as trying to diffuse a galon of gasoline into a pint of water. It just can't happen nor is it soluble in water! Nevertheless, if mazigh fossils were to be excavated in Yemen, that would not surprise anthropologists at all. Crossing miles through the desert has been ans is still a usual thing among the Touaregs. About the term Berber: It comes from the greek word 'berbera' used to designate 'strangers' refering to those living on the other side of the sea. Then, the map of the globe just started taking basic shape and our planet beleived to be just flat. In the same perspective, the term "Atlas" refers to the territory of the "berbers" identifing today the Atlas Moutains, the Atlantic ocean and a "vanished" Atlantide continent.--TIDETZ 03:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
