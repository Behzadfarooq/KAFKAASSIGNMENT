<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Blyleven_41e8.html" title="Edit section: Baseball career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Baseball career</span></h2>
<p>The Netherlands-born but Southern <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>-raised Blyleven became interested in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> as a young boy watching <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Koufax_b2ac.html" title="Sandy Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> pitch for the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. Blyleven was drafted by the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> in the third round in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, and after a brief stint in the minor leagues he was called up by the Twins on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2.html" title="June 2">June 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. In his first season, his sharp curveball helped him to ten victories and he was named AL Rookie Pitcher of the Year by <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sporting_News_afe1.html" title="The Sporting News">The Sporting News</a></i>.</p>
<p>However, Blyleven's early career with the Twins was not always pleasant as he was hounded by critics and fans and suffered with a dismal Minnesota Twins team. Becoming more vocal, Blyleven was traded to the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_%28baseball%29_b4f3.html" title="Texas Rangers (baseball)">Texas Rangers</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>. He pitched well with the Rangers, having a 2.76 ERA in his first season and throwing a <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-hitter.html" title="No-hitter">no-hitter</a> against the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Angels_dc4b.html" title="California Angels">California Angels</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, just two weeks after being sidelined with a groin injury.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">December 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, Blyleven and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Milner_a0e9.html" title="John Milner">John Milner</a> were traded to the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> as part of the first four-team trade in Major League Baseball history. With the Pirates, he led the team in ERA, strikeouts and complete games in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> and helped them to a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> victory in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>.</p>
<p>However, Blyleven became disgruntled with the Pirates and threatened to retire during the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> season if he was not traded. Eventually, the Pirates did trade him to the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_9.html" title="December 9">December 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. Blyleven sat out most of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> season with an elbow injury and struggled again in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, but came back in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> with one of his best seasons: a 19-7 record with a 2.87 ERA. He missed a second 20-win season that year when he was forced to miss a couple of starts after breaking his foot when joking around in the bullpen. Blyleven was unhappy playing for the lackluster Indians and forced a trade back to the Twins, where he passed the 3,000-strikeout mark and helped the Twins to a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_World_Series_31b3.html" title="1987 World Series">1987 World Series</a> victory.</p>
<p>Blyleven went to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Angels_dc4b.html" title="California Angels">California Angels</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> and pitched a 2.73 ERA for a 17-5 record in his first season, but he missed the entire <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> season following <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotator_cuff.html" title="Rotator cuff">rotator cuff</a> surgery. He came back in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> but was mostly unproductive, going 8-12 with a 4.74 ERA. He retired following that season with a career 287-250 record with 3,701 strikeouts (only thirteen other pitchers have at least 3,000 career strikeouts) and a 3.31 ERA. He tried out for the Twins again in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> but did not make the squad, making his retirement official.</p>
<p>Blyleven is often considered to be the best eligible pitcher not yet in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>; his first year of eligibility was <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> and if not elected, he will lose eligibility in <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012.html" title="2012">2012</a> (except by special election of the Veterans' Committee). Though he received only 17.55% of the vote for Hall of Fame admission in 1998 (first year of eligibility), by 2006 this total had increased to 53.33%. In 2007 Blyleven's total dipped to 47.7%. 75% is the minimum required for admission to the Hall. Because of his long association with the club, it is believed that if elected to the Hall, Blyleven would enter as a Minnesota Twin.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Blyleven became a color commentator for the Twins. In early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> during a quiet portion of a Twins game, he circled (on television) a fan carrying a sign in the stands of the <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome_d019.html" title="Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome">Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a>, and signs reading "<a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_Me%2C_Bert_7910.html" title="Circle Me, Bert">Circle Me, Bert</a>" (or variants thereupon) quickly became a popular phenomenon at the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrodome.html" title="Metrodome">Metrodome</a>, and has continued to the present day as a popular tradition. His commentary is frequently risqué for a baseball broadcast, a fact which seems to cause play-by-play announcer <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Bremer_5692.html" title="Dick Bremer">Dick Bremer</a> no small amount of discomfort (see below).</p>

<p>Blyleven has been known to make off-color remarks during some Twins television broadcasts. Play-by-play announcer <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Bremer_5692.html" title="Dick Bremer">Dick Bremer</a> frequently responds to these comments with stony silence or an awkward attempt to change the conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>In April 2002, Minneapolis City Council member Joe Biernat was indicted for accepting free plumbing work on his house in exchange for lucrative city contracts. The day after the indictment was made public, City Council President Paul Ostrow was a guest in the Twins' broadcast booth, explaining a plan for a new Twins stadium. At the end of the interview, Blyleven asked Ostrow "So do you know any good plumbers?" After an uncomfortable pause, Ostrow replied "I'm not going there."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 2004, while discussing pitcher <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Johnson_5d7e.html" title="Randy Johnson">Randy Johnson</a>, Blyleven stated that he saw Johnson in the shower, and didn't understand why he was called the "Big Unit."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During a 2006 broadcast, a conversation with a guest morphed from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Brett_%28baseball%29_6ead.html" title="George Brett (baseball)">George Brett</a> to <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singing_in_the_shower.html" title="Singing in the shower">singing in the shower</a>. Blyleven mentioned that he had showered with Brett, and the guest expressed surprise. Blyleven exclaimed "Well, there were other guys there! ... Although they did say not to bend over."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the same broadcast, Blyleven asked guest <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Young_e72c.html" title="Ace Young">Ace Young</a> (of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a> fame) if he "got lucky" with show host <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Abdul_c06c.html" title="Paula Abdul">Paula Abdul</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Later in the season, Blyleven and Bremer were discussing <a href="../../../p/e/e/Pee_Wee_Herman_fb11.html" title="Pee Wee Herman">Pee Wee Herman</a> when Blyleven remarked "I wouldn't want to be in a movie theater with him!"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bert was heard to crack the following joke during a telecast, "What do you do to an elephant with three balls? Walk him and pitch to the giraffe."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On August 15, 2006, the Twins were facing the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shin-Soo_Choo_bce7.html" title="Shin-Soo Choo">Shin-Soo Choo</a> pinch hit in the ninth inning. When Bremer said Choo's full name, Blyleven responded by saying "Bless you."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the pregame show on September 3, 2006, Blyleven twice used the word "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>" while he was live on air after getting caught up in his words during commentary. Blyleven stopped his commentary and muttered "We're gonna do this fuckin' thing over again, cause I just fucked it up." Upon being told by fellow broadcaster Anthony LaPanta (who was filling in for Dick Bremer) that they were actually broadcasting live, Blyleven said "Oh we're live? I didn't know that." In the first inning of the game, he apologized. Blyleven was originally suspended by the network for two telecasts but was then suspended three additional games. During his suspension, fans were occasionally spotted holding "Free Bert" signs at the Metrodome. <a href="http://www.nothingtoxic.com/media/1158319131/Bert_Blyleven_Drops_the_F_Bomb_Twice_on_the_Air" class="external text" title="http://www.nothingtoxic.com/media/1158319131/Bert_Blyleven_Drops_the_F_Bomb_Twice_on_the_Air" rel="nofollow">Watch the video of Bert Blyleven's on-air mishap</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Later in the same broadcast, the Twins were facing <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> reliever <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Myers_%28baseball_player%29_6dee.html" title="Mike Myers (baseball player)">Mike Myers</a>. Blyleven introduced Myers and commented on his unorthodox <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine_%28baseball%29.html" title="Submarine (baseball)">submarine</a> delivery by saying: "Myers at six-foot-three, but he throws like a midget."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On September 30, 2006, During the 6th inning versus the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>, when Bert responded to Dick Bremer's question of what subject he would have taught if he would have become a teacher Bert said "I would have taught math, that's pretty much all I knew, well either that or sex-ed."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A conversation between Blyleven and Bremer during a spring training game on March 20, 2007, was inappropriate on several levels. Bert was musing about how it was helpful for people to know the mayor of the town they're in. "You never know when, late at night, you may need to drop the Mayor’s name," he said. Bremer asked if Blyleven ever had to do this, and Blyleven responded in the affirmative. Bremer replied: "Me, I know the dog catchers." Blyleven retorted: "Is that ‘cause of the girlfriends you used to have?"</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bert_Blyleven_41e8.html" title="Edit section: Circle Me, Bert">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Circle Me, Bert</span></h3>
<p><b>Circle Me, Bert</b> is a popular sign raised by fans of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>. Fans hope that broadcaster Bert Blyleven will spot their sign and circle them on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> with his <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telestrator.html" title="Telestrator">telestrator</a>.</p>
<p>Use of Bert's "Circle Machine" is an honor rarely extended to his broadcast partner <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Bremer_5692.html" title="Dick Bremer">Dick Bremer</a>. Blyleven did allow Bremer to use the telestrator on August 5, 2006. "For heaven's sake, let me circle my daughter," Dick pleaded. Blyleven then permitted Bremer to circle his daughter, who was in the crowd at the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Royals_78c3.html" title="Kansas City Royals">Kansas City Royals'</a> <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauffman_Stadium_5f13.html" title="Kauffman Stadium">Kauffman Stadium</a>. Again, on August 16, 2006, Blyleven permitted Bremer to use the Circle Machine but was less than thrilled when Bremer drew a peanut shape around a fan's head. Fans have responded to these sorts of incidents by creating new signs for Bremer involving other shapes, including "<a href="../../../t/r/i/Triangle.html" title="Triangle">Triangle</a> Me, Dick" and "<a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhombus.html" title="Rhombus">Rhombus</a> Me, Dick."</p>
<p>Starting in 2005, fans that are circled have a chance to win $100 in Minnesota State Lottery Tickets as part of the promotion called Winner's Circle.</p>
