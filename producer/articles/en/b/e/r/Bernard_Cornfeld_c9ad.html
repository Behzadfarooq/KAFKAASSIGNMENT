<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Cornfeld_c9ad.html" title="Edit section: The Early Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Early Years</span></h2>
<p>Bernard Cornfeld's father was a Romanian-Jewish actor; his mother was from a Russian-Jewish family. They moved to America when Bernard was four years old—two years later his father died. The young Brooklyn-raised Cornfeld worked after school each day in fruit stores and as a delivery boy. Although he suffered from a stammer, he had a natural gift for selling and when a schoolfriend's father died, the two of them used the $3,000 insurance money to purchase and run an age and weight guessing stand at the Coney Island funfair.</p>
<p>During the Second World War he joined the US maritime service. Afterwards he went to Brooklyn College, graduating with a degree in psychology, and then did an MA in social work at the New York School of Social Work, Columbia University. He initially worked as a social worker, but then switched to selling mutual funds for an investment house. In 1955, he left New York for Paris and started his own company selling mutual funds using his savings of a mere few hundred dollars. By selling the mutual funds mostly to American servicemen in Europe, Cornfeld was able to avoid both American and European tax regulations.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Cornfeld_c9ad.html" title="Edit section: The IOS Scandal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The IOS Scandal</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, Cornfeld formed his own mutual fund selling company, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investors_Overseas_Service_f9a4.html" title="Investors Overseas Service">Investors Overseas Services</a> (IOS), which he incorporated outside the US with funds in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and headquarters in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The main operational offices of IOS were in <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferney-Voltaire_21a3.html" title="Ferney-Voltaire">Ferney-Voltaire</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, a short drive from the Swiss border to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>. He hired 25,000 salesmen who sold his 18 mutual funds door-to-door all over <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, especially in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, to small-time investors. He targeted US expatriates and servicemen who sought to avoid US <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income_tax.html" title="Income tax">income tax</a>. Cornfeld called it "people's <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>."</p>
<p>During the next ten years, IOS raised in excess of $2.5 billion, bringing Cornfeld a personal fortune of more than $100 million. Cornfeld himself became known for conspicuous consumption with lavish parties. Socially, he was generous and jovial.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, IOS launched its "Fund of Funds," which meant investment in shares of other IOS offerings. The offering was very popular in the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bull_market.html" title="Bull market">bull market</a> times, and Cornfeld's one-line pitch, "Do you sincerely want to be rich?" became a by-word for its success. However, then the market dropped and the guaranteed dividends had to be paid straight out of the capital—in effect, it had become a <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_scheme.html" title="Pyramid scheme">pyramid scheme</a>. IOS was forced into <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initial_Public_Offering_bb9c.html" title="Initial Public Offering">Initial Public Offering</a> to meet its costs. The next <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_market.html" title="Bear market">bear market</a> made many investors cash their funds, and the IOS stock value decreased further. Cornfeld later blamed a "bear raid" and that a number of German banks sold the stock short.</p>
<p>Share value decreased from $18 to $12 in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. Cornfeld formed an investment pool with some other investors, but they lost when the share value dropped to $2. Even IOS employees and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portfolio.html" title="Portfolio">portfolio</a> managers sold their shares. Cornfeld was ousted from IOS in May 1970 and within a year the IOS group collapsed.</p>
<p>Financier <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Vesco_f652.html" title="Robert Vesco">Robert Vesco</a> who, at the time, was also in financial trouble, turned to Cornfeld and offered his help. Vesco proceeded to use $500 million worth of IOS money to cover his own investments in his International Controls Corp. When he was discovered, Vesco fled to <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahamas.html" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. IOS collapsed and in the process ruined a number of US and European banks.</p>

<p>Cornfeld owned a villa in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva.html" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, a 12th-century chateau in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, a house in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgravia.html" title="Belgravia">Belgravia</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, and a mansion in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, as well as a permanent suite in a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> hotel and his own fleet of private planes. He is quoted as saying, "I had mansions all over the world, I threw extravagant parties. And I lived with ten or twelve girls at a time." He had romances with <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Principal_8c3f.html" title="Victoria Principal">Victoria Principal</a>; <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heidi_Fleiss_dc78.html" title="Heidi Fleiss">Heidi Fleiss</a>; <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alana_Stewart_3bdc.html" title="Alana Stewart">Alana Hamilton</a> (née Collins - a model and former spouse of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Hamilton_56d1.html" title="George Hamilton">George Hamilton</a> who subsequently married <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Stewart_ba9d.html" title="Rod Stewart">Rod Stewart</a> [1978-1983]); and Princess <a href="../../../i/r/a/Ira_von_F%C3%BCrstenberg_27af.html" title="Ira von Fürstenberg">Ira of Fürstenberg</a>.</p>

<p>A group of 300 IOS employees complained to the Swiss authorities that Cornfeld and his co-founders pocketed part of the proceeds of a share issue raised among employess in 1969. Consequently he was charged with fraud in 1973 by the Swiss authorities. When Cornfeld visited Geneva, Swiss authorities arrested him. He served 11 months in a Swiss jail before being freed on a bail surety of $600,000. Cornfeld always maintained his innocence, blaming the fraud on other IOS executives. His trial did not take place until 1979 and lasted three weeks, with Judge Pierre Fournier finally acquitting Cornfeld.</p>
<p>Realising that his "good time" friends left him during his 11 months in jail, Cornfeld began to seriously start thinking about his life and decided for the first time that he wanted a wife and children. In 1976 he married a model, Loraine, at his Beverly Hills mansion Grayhall. However, he had difficulty settling down. Polygamy was "considerably simpler than monogamy and a lot more fun," he insisted. He was still worth an estimated $1.85 million.</p>

<p>He returned to Beverly Hills, living less ostentatiously than in his previous years. He developed an obsession for health foods and vitamins, renounced red meat and seldom drank alcohol. In his last years he was a chairman of a land development firm in Arizona and also owned a real estate company in Los Angeles. His marriage ended in divorce, and he is survived by a daughter. His daughter, Jessica Cornfeld, wrote an article about her father in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mail_on_Sunday_acde.html" title="The Mail on Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a> (London, England) 29th June 2003, entitled <i>My father, the playboy who could never get enough lovers,</i> where she suggests that he maintained a close friendship with <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heidi_Fleiss_dc78.html" title="Heidi Fleiss">Heidi Fleiss</a> until his death in 1995.</p>
