<h2><span class="mw-headline">Russel was a liberal?</span></h2>
<p>liberal and socialist is a possible contradiction in terms, depending on your definition of a liberal. The very artical on liberalism linked on the page says: "Broadly speaking, liberalism seeks a society characterized by freedom of thought for individuals, limitations on the power of government, wealth, and religion, the rule of law, the free exchange of ideas, a market economy that supports private enterprise". Is socialism compatible with "a market economy that supports private enterprise"? Methinks not. However I'm not sure of a practical replacment for the word "liberal" that would keep the clarity of the article. Any ideas?</p>

<dd>Please sign your contributions to talk pages by adding -~~~~ at the end. Socialism (which you don't seem to have in mind, despite your choice of words) and communism (which you seem to have in mind) can sometimes be distinguished, and old-school liberalism is certainly more compatible with the former than the latter. That said, (speaking from a US point of view) liberalism divides into several camps (you might check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism#Economic_versus_social_liberalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism#Economic_versus_social_liberalism" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism#Trends_within_liberalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism#Trends_within_liberalism" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism#A_general_overview_of_political_positions" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism#A_general_overview_of_political_positions" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#Libertarian_socialism_and_anarchism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#Libertarian_socialism_and_anarchism" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#Democratic_socialism_and_social_democracy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#Democratic_socialism_and_social_democracy" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> for further clarification): the libertarian camp you seem to be describing, a socialist-like camp which would seek to improve peoples lives by using government power and money to effectively increase wealth and decrease cost of living, and an anarchist camp which would go well beyond the liberal description you've given. None is necessarily incompatible with the others. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 00:27, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Russell was a great social liberal (way ahead of his time on sexual liberation, women's rights, etc.) In terms of his economic views, they changed over his lifetime, but he was basically a Keynesian. Liberalism as a broad political movement isn't at all incompatible with some degree of government intervention in the economy. And of course, it's debatable to what extent a "free market" really is consistent with the ideas of liberalism. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 14:20, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article <a href="../../../w/h/a/What_I_believe_1194.html" title="What I believe">What I believe</a> is today dominated by E. M. Forster's essay with the same title as Russell's essay.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>I find the article seriously lacking in critiques of Russell's works, at least on the philosophical part. One would also expect to see remarks directed towards that disastrous conflation of personal bias, envy and lack of learning that is his History of Philosophy. Particularly afflicting is that corny carnival of high-praising quotations, perhaps some counter-examples could be added?</p>

<dd>Please sign your contributions to talk pages by adding -~~~~ at the end. Yow! That's some arrogance, random guy on the internet referring to <i>Bertrand Russell's</i> (author of <i>Principia Mathematica</i>) "lack of learning"! But yeah, you're right - there should be more criticism, though not every point deserves a counterpoint (we should be aware of our own, perhaps, personal bias and envy). As for quotes, did you catch this one?
<dl>
<dd>In other words, it was specifically not for his incontestably great contributions to philosophy—The Principles of Mathematics, 'On Denoting' and Principia Mathematica—that he was being honoured, but for the later work that his fellow philosophers were unanimous in regarding as inferior.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Welshness</span></h2>
<p>Russell happened to be born in Wales, of English parents, and lived there at the very end of his life. As far as I'm aware he never himself claimed to be Welsh, though there are dozens of online sites claiming him to be Welsh on the basis of his birthplace. I'd want to see some evidence that Russell claimed to be Welsh before admitting him to categories of Welsh philosophers, Welsh intellectuals and so on. --&#160; <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 12:55, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you'll never find such evidence, although he loved living in Wales -- 1872-6, most of 1933, 1946-9, and 1956 until his death. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 14:53, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is very petty indeed to censure Russell's inclusion in the categories Category:Welsh Mathematicians and Category:Welsh writers. as you say youself, many, many people DO consider Russell to be Welsh, and he was born, spent large portions of his life, and died there. I was nor attempting to remove him from any of the various British categories, but surely it is only reasonable to list him under the country of his birth? I am adding those two Cats back in.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 19:21, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Geography is being made to count too heavily here. Children born of English parents who were busy ruling India would not be regarded as Indian. Nor did Russell have ethnically Welsh ancestors, despite the entry on <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_mathematicians.html" title="Welsh mathematicians">Welsh mathematicians</a> saying that he was of "Welsh descent". Ancestrally, he was somewhat Scottish, but not Welsh at all, his parents being English people who liked living over the Monmouthshire county (not country) border. If anyone still thinks Russell was Welsh, why didn't he regard himself as Welsh? He was not careless about such things and knew whereof he spoke. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 19:51, 5 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> is quite correct. Russell considered himself to be and was an Englishman. Clearly his parents and grandparents were English, and he is a decendent of the Duke of Bedford, John Russell, an advisor to Henry VIII. He loved Wales, specifically, the Welsh Coast. But that does not make him Welsh, and, as far as I know, he never once declared that he was by preference. I know of no major biography (Clark, Ryan, Monk, Moorehead, Ayer, etc.) or encycopedia entry, including the venerable Encyc. of Philosophy, which states that he is anything other than English. <a href="../../../i/c/u/User%7EIcut4you_0ea4.html" title="User:Icut4you">icut4u</a></dd>
<dd>Flicking through the autobiography, I can find several references to himself as English, and throughout his writings he uses English and British to refer to his nationality. So if we're going to subcategorise him by nation within the UK (something which I think is unnecessary, like a lot of Wikipedia classification), he needs to be classified as an English philosopher, writer etc. Looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Welsh_mathematicians" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Welsh_mathematicians" rel="nofollow">Welsh mathematicians</a> I can see why someone might want to populate it, but that doesn't make Russell's inclusion correct. --&#160; <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 09:47, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's scrutinize the claim that Russell was Welsh. The facts in the claim's favour seem to be that (a) he was born in the area of the United Kingdom known as Wales (although <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monmouthshire.html" title="Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</a> seems to have been a special case); (b) that he lived for almost 20 of his 97 years in the area; (c) that he died there. Perhaps (a) and (c) are considered by Mais oui! to be sufficient, but I don't know that. I propose that the effect on the rest of Wikipedia of determining nationality merely by place of birth, death and perhaps residence be examined. Would there be consequences that contributors like Mais oui! would reject? For example, would Sean Connery's Bahamanian residence make him non-Scottish? Is Salman Rushdie still Indian and Henry Kissinger still German? Was Graham Greene a Swiss novelist? He lived and died there. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 16:00, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's also the point that he was educated entirely outside Wales, and did not live there during the period when he produced virtually all of his philosophical and mathematical work. So he might have been Welsh in some sense, but it's daft to call him a "Welsh philosopher". Then again, perhaps he belonged to the class of Welsh people who are not Welsh themselves? --&#160; <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 19:15, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My objection to omitting him from the Welsh categories is that you are all being very fundamentalist. Do you not realise that many, many people have two or more national identities. for example many people are English, British and European; or Corsican and French; or Turkish and German. Why must Russell only be classified under the one term "British"? As has been pointed out, he did not even describe himself as "British", but as English. They are not the same thing you know. And I would have absolutely no objections if Bahamians or Spaniards were to also put Sean Connery in their subcategories, just as long as they did not try to remove him from the perfectly legitimate Scottish categories. Stop being so anal. You are acting like the worst types of bureaucratic jobs-worths.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 19:36, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought "British" was meant to encompass "English", "Scottish", "Welsh", "Northern Irish" (and possibly "Cornish"). Thus you wouldn't say Connery was both British and Scottish. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 19:50, 7 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course you could! I doubt very much whether he would ever describe himself as British, but other people might. No, British does NOT encompass English, Scottish; Welsh, or Cornish (and definitely not Northern Irish). For many millions of citizens of the UK, British is a descriptor that does not apply to them: a recent survey, reported by <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1740712005" class="external text" title="http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1740712005" rel="nofollow">The Scotsman newspaper — 7 August 2005</a>, found that "... only 27% of Scots said they were British, 35% of Welsh people and 48% of English." Ie. a minority of UK citizens feel that the adjective "British" applies to them. Bertrand Russell didn't. He used the term "English" for a reason, unless you think that he was typically careless in his terminology.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 20:36, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect Connery wouldn't say he was Bahamian or Spanish, either. The crucial point is self-identification. Connery is Scottish, despite not living there. Tony Blair (born in Scotland and partially educated there) is, as far as he is concerned, English rather than Scottish. Russell was, as far as he was concerned, British or English (he used both words interchangeably - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a>, have you actually read any of his autobiographical or other writings?). I'd be more sympathetic to this attempt to categorise Russell as Welsh if there was any evidence put forward to suggest that he ever described himself as being Welsh. It's far more honest to say he was British, and leave it at that. --&#160; <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 20:59, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't really matter much what Connery thinks. Yes, he would say Scottish, but if other people ALSO (note the inclusiveness) want to put him in the British, Bahamian or Spanish, or American categories, they are all, at least partly, true also. I seek inclusivity. Other people are desperately trying to <b>exclude</b> Russell from a perfectly legitimate category: he was born in Wales for heaven's sake. That alone would qualify him under any reasonable approach.--<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 21:08, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Isn't it so much simpler, if that's all that nationality means, to say where and of whom a person was born? The opening of the article proper conveys the facts: "Bertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Trellech, Monmouthshire, Wales, into an aristocratic English family." Oops. I see that this begs the question. The family is said to be English. Is that supposed to convey anything more than "born in England"? I think so. Anyway, whether Russell was a Welsh mathematician is only a category dispute, and it doesn't affect the entry for him. I'm sure we haven't seen the last of unusual categories loosely applied to him. I do wonder, however, whether Wikipedia has any standards for the application of nationality. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 13:07, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All this discussion of Russell's "Welshness" has reminded me that he loathed most patriotism and abominated nationalism and from at least his Free Trade days was an Internationalist. I have tried but failed to include him in the category of World citizen. There is actually an article with that title and Russell is in the list. Perhaps someone more Wiki-adept than I would make the category. I've left it in need of repair. It seems that a category and an "entry" can have identical titles, as is the case with "Welsh mathematicians". In the entry of that title Russell's descent has been revised from Welsh to English. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 00:23, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Russell said he was English; his family at least since the 16th century thought of itself as English; all major philosophy and mathematics texts, anthologies, biographies, and encyclopedia entries refer to him as having been English; no other reputable or authoratative source has ever referred to him as Welsh; therefore, I maintain that he is English. I suspect there is an attempt to burnish the contributions of Wales at the expense of accuracy. Yes, he was born and he died there; but geography, alone, does not make nationality, as the several examples given by others have shown. <a href="../../../i/c/u/User%7EIcut4you_0ea4.html" title="User:Icut4you">icut4u</a> 03:34, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geography certainly does play a large part in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationality.html" title="Nationality">nationality</a>, and it has hardly been "shown" otherwise by the opinion of a few other Wikipedians. By default, one's nationality is where one is born; if Wales was a sovereign country, Russell would have had Welsh citizenship. I suspect the fact that he was generally referred to as English was more to do with the relatively common practice of using "English" as a synonym of "British" during (and prior to) the first half of the 20th Century. <a href="../../../r/l/s/User%7ERls_ca3b.html" title="User:Rls">Rls</a> 17:32, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geography and birthplace do not determine nationality on their own. What we have here is a small number of people who are ignorant of Russell's own writing who say he was Welsh, and people who have actually read Russell's autobiography, Monk's biography, and at least some of the many writings on culture and politics that Russell produced throughout his life. The latter group say there is no evidence that he ever thought of himself as being Welsh, or was ever described by others as being Welsh (indeed, his autobiography starts with his arrival in London, that being his earliest memory). He was an English aristocrat, and extraordinarily proud of that. --&#160; <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 17:48, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nationality is based on three main aspects: place of birth, blood, and naturalisation. Place of birth alone should be enough to make a case for nationality -- Russell would for example have been qualified to play rugby or football for Wales under current rules (even if that does conjure up a slightly bizarre image&#160;:). He was unquestionably of English descent, but he chose to spend extended periods of his life living in Wales, so the third point is under dispute. In any case, the categories are not formally defined. My view is that being born in a country qualifies someone for categorisation under that category; it is not necessarily an absolute statement of nationality. By the way, I find your assumptions of my state of ignorance slightly insulting. <a href="../../../r/l/s/User%7ERls_ca3b.html" title="User:Rls">Rls</a> 18:06, September 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, people. This is an absurd discussion. He was both Welsh and English, because he has an English heritage and was born in Wales.

<p>I agree the discussion is absurd, but only because Russell was so obviously not Welsh. Everyone has neglected the Welsh language here. The Welsh do have their own language, you know, which is like nothing else on the planet. I have known several Welshmen, and they could all speak Welsh. Indeed, I have known one Welsh girl who was not all that comfortable speaking English. Now, there's no evidence known to me, at least, that Bertrand Russell could speak a word of Welsh. The Welsh language is such a great part of Welsh identity that I can confidently maintain that Russell wasn't Welsh on linguistic grounds alone. If I were born in Paris, but couldn't speak any French, would I be a Frenchman? You might as well say I'm a bus because I was born in a garage.</p>
<p>I will also point out for the record that being Welsh isn't a nationality at all. There's no such thing as a Welsh passport, for instance. It's more like being a Texan. I'm surprised I have to explain these things. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStedder_0794.html" title="User:Stedder">Tex</a> 13:12, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Tex (I suspect this may be a wind up, so I shall keep the answer short)- I'm afraid you are misinformed. One does NOT have to speak Welsh in order to be from Wales- in fact, much of the population are not fluent speakers, and very few (although some) speak Welsh as a first language. The Welsh language (which shows similarities to other Celtic languages and is not 'like nothing else on Earth') is widely spoken, but it is not a prerequisite of nationality. As for the national status of Wales- it is slightly ambiguous. The American federal systemt (esp. Texas, which has at least some independent history in its own right) is one analogy, although not in my opinion a particularly apt one. I don't think that the situation with regards to UK constitutional politics and component nations is easily explained to a non-native- the various <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> pages should give you a start however. Basically, Russell was not Welsh because he did not identify himself as such, although there is ambiguity. Describing him as 'British' is the best compromise- it is unambiguously true, although not everyone's going to like it. If his work and life were synonymous with his nationality (like, for example, <a href="../../../d/y/l/Dylan_Thomas_e0bc.html" title="Dylan Thomas">Dylan Thomas</a>, then it would be obviously appropriate to describe him as Welsh. Here, it isn't clear how Russell saw himself, and there is to say the least room for discussion given his personal circumstances.

<dd>Quebec considers itself a nation independent from the state in which it lives, Canada. So the "Texas" analogy isn't necessarily relevant: nationality is different from statehood.

<dd>The thing is that many people who are not native speakers of Welsh, and indeed some people who can't even speak it as a second language, still consider themselves Welsh. The status of Welsh in Wales isn't anything like the status of French in Quebec. People from outside the UK/Ireland often don't understand just how rare native speakers of the various indigenous Celtic languages are these days. There has been a resurgence in the number of people who speak Welsh as a second language recently, because there's been a big political drive in Wales to keep the language alive by teaching Welsh in schools, teaching some lessons in Welsh, etc. But for the vast majority of Welsh people, Welsh isn't part of everyday life in the way that French is in Quebec.</dd>

<dd>The discussion is a lexical muddle. There are competing claims which involve competing social jurisdictions: culture, (i.e., active behavior and self-identification of Russell), genetic heritage (i.e., geneology), and political geography (i.e., place of birth within both national- and state-defined boundaries). The only plausible outcome is to say that our semantic tools are not adequate to be certain one way or the other, and that he is in a fuzzy category. He was natively Welsh, and culturally English, whatever that helps. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">Lucidish</a> 21:04, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is well put. He is in a fuzzy category, as are many UK citizens, and therefore (unless he self-identified as Welsh, or was strongly identified by others as being Welsh, neither of which are true to my (limited) knowledge) it is best to simply describe him as British, which is always completely unambiguous. (Note that I would NOT always support describing all UK biographies in those terms, as there are often more inclusive categories obviously available). Language doesn't really have anything to do with it- even with the recent laudable effort that's gone in to revitalising Welsh (and to a lesser extent Gaelic and the other indigenous languages), I suspect that very few in Wales speak Welsh better than they speak English, for better or for worse. In terms of national sentiment and feeling, Quebec is probably a decent analogy, maybe also the Basque country, Corsica, and perhaps a few others. It is a complex picture, but basically, Russell can't unambiguously be identified as Welsh because a) He didn't think he was Welsh; b) Nobody else thought he was either. Language (I am presuming btw that he actually didn't speak Welsh- I don't have any definite knowledge either way) has nothing to do with it. A high percentage of the population of Wales don't speak Welsh either- I am quite certain that they (for the most part) would happily and consistently identify themselves as Welsh.

<p>Russell should be in both English, and Welsh people categories. I consider this effort to define Russell by his English ethnicity alone to be a very sinister development. It reflects very, very poorly on the people calling for categorisation by racial purity. I concede that I am not going to win what you have chosen to make an editing war, as long as nobody tries to remove him from Natives of Monmouthshire out of sheer spite. This is a very sad day for the more cosmopolitan members of the Wikipedia community. Ethnic categorisation, if applied throughout Wikipedia, would completely destroy the entire project. Shame on you!

<dd>It is unnecessary to resort to name calling and personalizing the matter as you have done in this last squib. No reference has been made to race, here, only to nationality; there is no such thing as "racial purity," and no one has said so on this page. Russell was concerned with precision, so I am not sure what is un-Russellian about the position that he was English. Yes, some people do claim dual nationality, as you said earlier; however, Russell, to my knowledge, and I have read a good part of his writings and his letters, <i>never</i> claimed this. Indeed, he often said he was English. No one who is a widely accepted authority on Russell has ever claimed that he was anything other than English, either. No one in his family has claimed this. It is perfectly legitimate to reference Wales as an important place in his life (as was America, in a different way); it is not correct to refer to him as Welsh, however. <a href="../../../i/c/u/User%7EIcut4you_0ea4.html" title="User:Icut4you">icut4u</a> 15:45, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<p><i>The Amberley Papers</i> has interesting information on Bertrand Russell's immediate ancestors (who aren't in Wikipedia) and his siblings. His father was born in England. His mother was born in England. His brother was born in England. His sister was born in England. Then they all moved over the Monmouth border to Trelleck a year or two before Bertrand was born, and he was moved back by age 3.

What Welsh characteristics could he have gained as an infant? <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 18:16, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no such thing as a "Monmouth" border. The nationalities of his siblings are irrelevant.

<p>"Self-description" being enough to include, but not sufficient to exclude, I should like to argue Russell was an American. After all, his wives Alys and Edith were both American. He had at least one American lover. He spent a good deal of time in America. He occasionally became involved in American political affairs. His daughter Kate married an American and, I think, she might still live in America. He has American grandchildren. Some Americans, myself included, believe him to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. I should like to claim him as a fellow American, and think I could rouse others in support of this. He wrote more philosophy in America than he did in Wales. He was in America when it was announced he would win the Nobel Prize. Thus, I think we should include him among American philosophers and mathematicians. Of course, this is not a good argument: <i>he was English</i>. <a href="../../../i/c/u/User%7EIcut4you_0ea4.html" title="User:Icut4you">icut4u</a> 23:39, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Argument by assertion is a logical fallacy. It's ironic how many fallacies have been used in this discussion considering the subject of the article.

<p>And your "argument" mischaracterizes mine, which I said quite clearly was a poor one, but every bit as good as ones mounted in favor of calling him Welsh, which, again, is to say <i>it is poor.</i> A bit of Russell and his student, Wittgenstein, tells us that <i>convention</i> has a great deal to do with language and meaning, and this includes the terms and meanings often associated with nationality. The convention among philosophers, biographers, intellecutal historians, people associated with Russell, notably his family, and, most importantly, Russell himself is to refer to him as English. No one of this group with whom I am familiar, or who has been cited here, refers to him as being Welsh. The contrary, however, is true. No reputable encyclopedia, including the Encyclopedia of Philosophy, calls him anything other than English, though most texts certainly refer to the fact that he was born in Wales. It strikes me as a bit of hubris to suppose that Wikipedia ought to be the first to set everyone straight on this. <a href="../../../i/c/u/User%7EIcut4you_0ea4.html" title="User:Icut4you">icut4u</a> 23:31, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was referring to your final sentence, "he was English", which did not follow from the rest of your argument, but which was mere assertion. I did not in any way mischaracterize your argument, but pointed out that it was incomplete -- had Russell been born in America, I said a case could indeed be made that he was (partly) American. Further, you are attacking a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man_argument.html" title="Straw man argument">straw man</a> by trying to argue that he was English; my argument was not that he was not English, but that he should be dual-categorised under the Welsh categories for the reasons I have already put forward. Anyway, I have already conceded the discussion on grounds of triviality. <a href="../../../r/l/s/User%7ERls_ca3b.html" title="User:Rls">Rls</a> 00:00, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I had already argued for that point, and I have had to repeat myself. It is a matter of convention. Wikipedia proscribes against original research, and the proposition that Russell is Welsh is, as far as I can observe, original research. I should be interested in any reputable sourcing that suggests he is Welsh, in which case a dual categorization would be quite acceptable; however, there is considerable body of citable evidence for the contrary point of view, which is that he is thoroughly English. I myself don't think it is trivial, but I do agree, it is no longer constructive, so I shall say no more on this.

Still, I do not understand that a man who's been criticized so much not only doesn't have a Criticism of Bertrand Russell page, but doesn't even have a criticism section in his article. Plus, those LaRouche people seem pretty ardent on putting things in, and I don't understand why the name of the guy isn't even mentionned on the page. Is it a very minor movement that simply has a few very active supporters on wikipedia? Is he one among many? (in the latter case, a criticism page should exist, or at least a section on his ennemies). I think that the quote "from an ennemy" that was reverted several times, was a simple, unobstrusive way of putting a mention of this movement in, so why the hostility to the slightest mention? Once again, from what I read here, I admire this man much, but for the sake of NPOV I think criticisms shouldn't be forgotten or diluted across the article. But I might be wrong: obviously the editors here must know the subject much better than me. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules.lt_85f8.html" title="User:Jules.lt">Jules LT</a> 07:31, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The question is, what aspect of Russell is being criticised? If it's criticism of his epistemology, or his mathematical work, or his political campaigning, then the criticism needs to go into the sections already there (e.g. the mention of Goedel at the end of the "Logic and mathematics" section, Strawson in the "Philosophy of language" section, or most of the "Philosophy of science" section). The idea of <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> is not to have a hagiography and a separate "Why Russell was a Very Bad Man" section, it's to have a neutral article reflecting what he believed and how others (others with some credibility) reacted to him and his views. --&#160; <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 15:57, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did the Theory of Types <i>really</i> influence computer science and IT?

<dd>Agree. However I think Russell did have an influence on computer science simply because he had an influence of virtually every area of mathematics.

<dd>I disagree. Russell's theory of types the first to posulate that there were different types of mathematical entities, and that improper mixing of types lead to inconsistent systems (which he proved by example). To quote from the appendix to <i>The Principles of Mathematics</i>: "Every propositional function Theta(x) - so it is contended - has, in addition to its range of truth, a range of significance, i.e. a range within which x must lie if Theta(x) is to be a proposition at all, whether true or false." Modern type theory is the straightforward generalization of that idea from propositional truth functions to any computable functions, and owes the idea to Russell; he wanted type-safety in his theory of mathematics to prevent inconsistencies, in the same way we want type-safety in our theory of programming to prevent crashes. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Wreschnig_8d45.html" title="User:Joe Wreschnig">piman</a> 00:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Frege on empty descriptions</span></h2>
<p>I have revised the following attempted description of Frege's views, because it does not in fact describe Frege's views:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p><a href="../../../g/o/t/Gottlob_Frege_683c.html" title="Gottlob Frege">Frege</a> seemed to think we could dismiss as nonsense any proposition whose words apparently referred to objects that didn't exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know to whom he "seemed" to think this; certainly not to himself (since in <i>Über Sinn und Bedeutung</i> he clearly states that "Is it possible that a sentence as a whole has only a sense, but no <i>Bedeutung</i>? At any rate, one might expect that such sentences occur, just as there are parts of sentences having sense but no <i>Bedeutung</i>. And sentences which contain proper names without <i>Bedeutung</i> will be of this kind. The sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense. But since it is doubful whether the name 'Odysseus', occurring therein, has a <i>Bedeutung</i>, it is also doubtful whether the whole sentence does." Since Frege holds that the <i>Bedeutung</i> of a sentence is its truth-value, this means that if all the constituents of a well-formed sentence have a sense but at least one of them has no <i>Bedeutung</i>, the sentence is <i>not</i> nonsense; rather it expresses a thought (has sense) but is neither true nor false of the world (has no <i>Bedeutung</i>).</p>
<p>Nor did it seem to Russell that this was Frege's view. In "On Denoting," what he says is that you <i>might</i> think that Frege's view makes sentences such as "The present King of France is bald" senseless, but the actual view he attributes to Frege is one on which empty denoting phrases are assigned <i>ad hoc</i> technical denotations (e.g. the null-class for "the present King of France" and the set of all Mr. Jones's sons for "the son of Mr. Jones," if Jones has ten strapping young boys). This is a failure, on Russell's part, to appreciate the full subtlety of Frege's view, but he certainly does not attribute to Frege the view that it is said Frege "seems" to hold, either.</p>
<p>Since this is neither Frege's actual view nor the view which Russell attributed to Frege in "On Denoting," I think the sentence (and the sentences following it which describe an alleged problem for Frege's view) well deserves being corrected to reflect Frege's actual view.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Eugenics quotes</span></h2>
<p>I have been searching for the sentence which says that black people are inferior to white and also the one which says that women are inferior to men in Marriage and Morals but I haven't found them. Could someone write which page this comes from?</p>
<dl>
<dd>As mentioned with the quote, Russell altered the original passage. You'll find it in Chap. 18, "Eugenics", 2/3 of the way in, in the paragraph starting "In extreme cases". In the Bantam paperback edition first published in 1959, the passage is on p. 180.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is no passage in _Marriage and Morals_ that states that women are inferior to men. I'd venture to say that there no such passage in Russell's entire corpus. There is a passage in MM in which he refers to the "stupidity" of women. It goes with Russell's not too unusual view that the education afforded women has been stunted, and deliberately so. You can see this in the ironic passage about reestablishing the old morality: "The first essential is that the education of girls should be such as to make them stupid and superstitious and ignorant; this requisite is already fulfilled in the schools over which the churches have any control." (Near the end of "The Liberation of Women" chapter; Bantam, p. 61) Clearly, Russell is drawing the conclusion about women's intelligence that is warranted by the belief that their education has been substandard. Those who hold that women are not stupid in Russell's sense must also hold that their education has been the equal of men's! <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilt_a707.html" title="User:Milt">Milt</a> 17 January 2006</dd>

<p>Uh...The article still says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although Russell changed "It seems on the whole fair to ..." to "There is no reason to ..." in much later editions of the book, he did not change the sentence "women are on the average stupider than men".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The above "clarification" is all well and good, but it completely fails to address the fact that the sentence I just quoted above is utterly without context. I have neither the source material nor background knowledge [of Russell, his work or his philosophy] to fix this problem, but would encourage someone who does, to do so. From the above, I gather that this "problem", without bothering to look at the article's history, is <i>at least</i> 7 weeks old, if not &lt;gasp!&gt; more... Any takers?

<p>Obviously, not everyone likes a man who wrote a book called <i>Why I Am Not a Christian</i>, not even Jews or Muslims, because they are on the same side of his issue that the Christians are.

One cannot be innovative in everything at once, thought being at the top in one thing does help people like that, because it gives them access to others on the same intellectual level, in other subjects. Some important intellectuals have much worse records on social issues, such as some of the German physicists and engineers of that period.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some remarks on Russell's attitude with respect to Wittgenstein</span></h2>
<p>As is now, the last paragraph in 2.6 (philosophy of language) suggests that Russell had quite an antipathy against Wittgenstein (at least it does in my reading). Althought his might be true about 'Wittgenstein II', Russell appreciated Wittgeinstein's Tractatus logico-philosophicus. He even wrote the preface for the English edition (which made Wittgenstein upset, for - as some have told me - Russell didn't quite understand the Tractatus).</p>
<p>I am not certain, but I doubt (cannot prove, perhaps someone else can) Russell <i>"thought Wittgenstein's elevation of language as the only reality with which philosophy need be concerned was absurd"</i> with repsect to Wittgenstein I.</p>
<p>I therefore suggest to clarify this paragraph with an explicit reference to the part of Wittgensteins philosophy that Russell thought to be absurd. (Which is, I guess, the thoughts of Wittgenstein II, hence the Blue and Brown Books and the Philosophical Investigations.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Russell did have a big problem with the "cult" associated with Wittgenstein, and most of LW's followers (see <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinary_language_philosophy.html" title="Ordinary language philosophy">ordinary language philosophy</a>) were extremely disparaging of Russell (see the <i>Words and Things</i> section in <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Gellner_37ae.html" title="Ernest Gellner">Ernest Gellner</a> for a little more information). The two men had an awkward relationship after the first world war (did anyone ever have a comfortable relationship with Wittgenstein?), and although they seem to have had respect for each other they disagreed quite profoundly, especially once Russell started pronouncing on moral or ethical questions (the last chapter of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Problems_of_Philosophy_8133.html" title="The Problems of Philosophy">The Problems of Philosophy</a></i>, for example). LW thought <i>The Conquest of Happiness</i> was "vomative" according to Ray Monk's biography of him, and Russell thought Wittgenstein (even in the <i>Tractatus</i>) was dangerously mystical. But LW in particular continued to care what Russell thought about his philosophical work, and seems to have been quite disappointed that Russell didn't engage with it seriously (he sent the "Blue Book" to Russell, long after the two men's philosophical interests had diverged, and Monk has more on his wanting to know Russell's reaction). I don't see any of that in the Philosophy of Language section, just a fairly neutral description of the fact that the two men were philosophical opponents in this area. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 13:33, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I should write in my first sentence that Russell had quite an antipaty against <i>Wittgensteins philosophy</i> without suggesting this was personal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I definitely - and correctly - associate the term <i>ordinary language</i> with 'Wittgenstein II' - id est: the works and thoughts of Wittgenstein after his return to philosophy. Before (that is: in the Tractatus) Wittgenstein and Russell more or less agreed (and I assume less) on language.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whatever, my concern is not that Russell and Wittgenstein where (or not) friends/... just that the last paragraph of 2.6 is somehow blurry, casting confusion on whether Russell had troubles with the Tractatus or with Wittgensteins later works.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Totally unrelated, I am kind of surprised not to read any remark on the troubles Kripke notes with respect to definite descriptions. That is: substituting names for their descriptions in modal contexts and counterfactuals results in neccessary true/false propositions.</dd>

<dd>Russell's introduction to the <i>Tractatus</i> says he has "a certain sense of intellectual discomfort" with the final remarks (6.4 onwards, I guess), which Wittgenstein saw as the conclusion of his argument (my books are mainly at work, but my recollection is that LW felt Russell had <i>completely</i> missed the point of the book, and only consented to the introduction because otherwise it wouldn't get published). The final part of the introduction's rather ambiguous - what he seems to be saying is that he doesn't agree with the <i>Tractatus</i> on several important points, but he doesn't have worked-out reasons for his disagreements. Wittgenstein, even at this early stage, was saying that you can't directly express "propositions of ethics" (6.42), and Russell was starting to pronounce directly on ethics (<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._C._Grayling_948e.html" title="A. C. Grayling">A. C. Grayling</a> has just written an introduction to a new edition of <i>The Conquest of Happiness</i> where he says Russell's opposition to the war was disconnected from his being a philosopher, and Russell only united his social and philosophical interests in the early twenties). --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 17:37, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">In the Quotes by others about Russell</span></h2>
<p>Two thoughts. First, the Ray Monk quote is kind of trite--it is a stock observation of a great many nobel nominees that they are nominateed for their later, inferior work. BR is in no way exceptional in this regard. Probably I should know who Ray Monk is, but I don't, and if this is an uninteresting observation from a minor figure, I would say to cut it. Second, while Solzhenitsyn is great, it seems odd that the <i>only</i> quote on Russell as activist should be one that portrays him as essentially apathetic. Russell was among the first of Western leftist intellectuals to really criticize the Soviet regime, and from the quotes section, you could get the impression that his only political activity was to have been a closet Stalinist.

<dd>I think all of the quotes should be removed (possibly to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a>) or moved into more appropriate places in the text. Some of them originate from the attempt by LaRouchists to put their spin on the article (The Solzhenitsyn quote is from back then, I'm pretty sure, and possibly also the Monk quote). The stuff about race and eugenics is also really not a big part of Russell's thought, and could probably do with being slimmed down. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 15:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I hope that was not motivated by a desire to make people like him better. He is too dead to care whether people like him.

<dd>I don't think that's my motive. BR was a voluminous writer across many, many fields. It is impossible, in an article of this size, for the reader "to hear everything he had to say." But we can clean try to offer a fair breakdown of his major viewpoints and major criticisms levelled against him. I think a brief mention of his support for eugenics is very important, but eugenics was neither a major platform of his nor is it something his critics have especially focused on, so I don't see that it should take up a great deal of space. The assertion that BR was pro-Stalinist is absurd, at least without some kind of argument, and the Solz. quote might simply be read as a rhetorical device, anyway. But if you think it contributes, let's put it back. Ethan Mitchell 13:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">my edit re Marx, Communism, and influence</span></h2>
<p>I would not call Russell a Marxist. He is not a Marxist. But how can one not say that any 20th century socialist, as Russell was, was not influenced by Marx?! Also, true, his political views evolved from a liberalism to a rather thorough-going socialism (Fabian), and while he was critial of certain aspects of Marx (esp. those aspects that were of a more dogmatic nature), this does not make him anti-communist. Quite the conrary. Take a look at his series of books including <i>Principles of Social Reconstruction,</i> <i>Roads to Freedom</i>, and <i>The Prospects of Industrial Civilization</i> (1923), as examples. Infact, he was initially very sympathetic to the Russian Revolution of 1917. His visit Soviet Union in 1920 left opposed to Soviet "communism," which he expressed in <i>The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism</i> (1920), but even in this work, (which I have read), he frames this in the following way, which I quote from the books introduction (page 4), and then its conclusions on page 184:</p>
<p>"I believe that Communism is necessary to the world, and I believe that the heroism of Russia has fired men's hopes in a way which was essential to the realization of Communism in the future. Regarded as a splendid attempt, without which ultimate success would have been very improbable, Bolshevism deserves the gratitude and admiration of all the progressive part of mankind."</p>
<p>"But the method by which Moscow aims at establishing Communism is a pioneer method, rough and dangerous, too heroic to count the cost of the opposition it arouses. I do not believe that by this method a stable or desirable form of Communism can be established. Three issues seem to me possible from the present situation. The first is the ultimate defeat of Bolshevism by the forces of capitalism. The second is the victory of the Bolshevists accompanied by a complete loss of their ideals and a régime of Napoleonic imperialism. The third is a prolonged world-war, in which civilization will go under, and all its manifestations (including Communism) will be forgotten."</p>
<p>Russsell concludes at the end of the books:</p>
<p>"THE fundamental ideas of Communism are by no means impracticable, and would, if realized, add immeasurably to the well-being of mankind. The difficulties which have to be faced are not in regard to the fundamental ideas, but in regard to the transition from capitalism. It must be assumed that those who profit by the existing system will fight to preserve it, and their fight may be sufficiently severe to destroy all that is best in Communism during the struggle, as well as everything else that has value in modern civilization. The seriousness of this problem of transition is illustrated by Russia, and cannot be met by the methods of the Third International."</p>
<p>The edit you revereted was my change of this:</p>
<p>"He was extremely critical of the <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> exhibited after Lenin's death by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalin.html" title="Stalin">Stalin</a>'s regime, of Marx's thought, and of actually existing <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> generally."</p>

<p>This is a question of accuracy and NPOV, as well. Totalitarianism is a disputed theory that has an organic view of the nature of the State. In the work you mention that I should look at, infact he never even uses the word. He does use "<a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarianism.html" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a>." One should not use the T word without it being problematized. Lastly the wording, "actually existing Marxism and communism generally" is not precise writing. There is not actually existing Marxism or Communism. There are various attempts at implementing these ideas which are disputed as being representative of Marx's thoughts, and no one claims it to be "communism," but rather a term known as "state-communism," which ofcourse is not communism, but a state proclaiming it is attempting to built it.

<dd>Wholesale approval of Marx? No, he was not a Marxist, as I explained, but he was for communism and a socialist, albeit an evolutionary socialism, opposed to the revoltionary version. I listed cited four books above, and quoted extensively from the work often cited as anti-Marx/anti-communsims, when in fact it was anti-Bolshevism, critical of some of the aspects of Marxism that distinguish it from the Fabian outlook he is most closely identified politically with. This is an important distinction. This book is available on the net for free, I beleive, if you don't own a copy and you can check that my quotes from it above are accurate. Do you disipute it? The issue of using the theory of totalitarianism as if that theory were an accepted, and then attributed it to Russell is highly problematic, to say the least, whereas <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarianism.html" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a> would work.

Why do you think Marx was not an influence on Russell. I do not think you deny was a socialist, and advocated communsim as a great ideal for mankind? But do you deny this is an influence of Marx? All socialism of the 20th century, reformist or revolutoinary, are deeply influenced by Marx. This fact stands out with even a cursery view of his writings.

<dd>As a philosopher, Russell was <i>extremely</i> opposed to Hegelianism, and as Marx's thought is an extension of Hegel's, he was opposed to that too. He consistently makes it clear in his writings that although he's a socialist, he's not a Marxist (socialism didn't begin with Marx). If you want to show that Marx was an influence on Russell, produce some evidence. There have been far too many unsourced and dubious claims about Russell's politics inserted into this article. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 09:19, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again you are engaging in a straw-man fallacy. The argument is NOT if Russell was or was not a Marxist. I never said he was, and infact agree he wasn't. I only say that he was influeced by Marx. In particular his political views that led him to socialism is abundantly clear given the ample evidence of Marx's influence on his thinking. Socialism didn't being with Marx, true, but no socialist after Marx escaped his influence. Marx weighs down like a giant on all the socialist movement, and I know of no one who seriously argues the contrary. I did produce evidence above, but do I need to quote more? For example, just opening up the book randomly in, <i>"The Roads to Freedom:</i>I quickly find where Russell writes in Chapter six on international relations: "I do not wish to be thought to deny that capitalism does very much to promote wars, or that wars would probably be less frequent and less destructive if private property were abolished. On the contrary, I believe that the abolition of private ownership of land and capital is a necessary step toward any world in which the nations are to live at peace with one another." Can someone seriously read this and say with a straight face that Marx was NOT an influence?! However, this point of contention you raise here regarding this point does not explain your reversion of my other edit changes, i.e. T vs. A.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 09:35, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is, I think, a result of narrow reading. It is perfectly possible to be a Socialist and an opponent of capitalism while being a strong opponent of Marx and Marxism (as a particular variety of Socialism); and in 1896, when Russell first wrote on the subject, it was probably true of more Socialists than not. Giovanni33 is making the provably false assumption that Marx had no sources or contemporaries; for a clearer view of the subject, by a supporter of Marx, try <i>The Road to the Finland Station</i> by <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Wilson_c474.html" title="Edmund Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a>. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:09, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ofcourse its perfectly possible. Did I ever say otherwise? I do not see why understanding the actual argument is so difficult, here. You are arguing against a straw-man. Its not my argument. It would be nice if someone would actually address the real argument at hand. You seem to think that its impossible to be influenced by Marx and Marxism and yet not be a Marxist? That is an absurd proposition. But before I refute it, I would like to know if that is something that is being asserted here. Also, I do not make the assumption that Marx had no sources or contemporaries. Again, where I have I ever made that assumption? Another straw-man! However, please show me any of the pre-Marxian 'utopian socialists", or contemporaries of Marx which frame an economic and political understanding of capital and private property in the way that Russsell adopts (advocating its aboltion as a necessary and desired condition), in the above references I selected from Russell's writing, to show that this is not from Marx but from some other influence?
<dl>
<dd>(Giovanni33 happens to be in actual error about Socialism before Marx; he should really try reading some of the "utopian Socialists", instead of assuming that vulgar defenses of Marx are correct.) But even if he were not, this would be original research; his obligation here is to find some reliable secondary source which says that Marx influenced Russell, without which <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Our policy on verifiability</a> says that statements may be removed without further explanation. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So your arguing that the Fabians, who laid the groundwork for the organization of the Labour Party in 1906, the French Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO), founded in 1905 under Jean Jaurès, and later Léon Blum, were not influced by Marx? Infact they adhered to Marxist ideas, and this is not in dispute as far as I know. Ofcourse in practice they were a reformist party. There are many versions of socialism on the 20th century but they were all directly influeced by Marx, even to the extent of adotping the same language, as Russell does, in the excerpts I provided above. Yet, this is not evidence of influence of Marx?! Talk about dogmatism!<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 18:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Did I mention the Fabians, or Jaurès? No. (And if Russell was influenced by the gradualist aspects of Fabianism, that shows no influence by Marx.)

<dd>You don't need to mentio nit. Russell was a member of The Fabian Society! (so was Marx's daughter, I believe). If Russell was a member of this socialist group and this group shares some ides of Karl Marx (as it did), then it logically follows that Russell was influenced by Marx, as well. The resistance to this idea seems to come from a faulty notion that to be influenced by Marx would make one a Marxist. Infact, Marx exherted a very strong influence on intellectuals of this period, esp. in the 20's. Needless to say, most were not Marxists themselves.User:Giovanni33|Giovanni33]] 16:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, as of yet no one has bothered to explain the reversion of the other issues I raised which have nothing to do with Russell being influenced by Marx. Specificallly the use of "totalitarianism," a disputed theory from Cold warriors, as opposed to authoritarianism, and the usage of pov language that puts in non-accurate wordings such as "the actuality of communism," when in fact there was no such "actuality." No one has of yet defended these erroneous wordings that they have restored, despite my explaination for changing them to reflect a more accurate and precise description of these states.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 18:12, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are giving a disputed theory legitimacy by giving it the voice of Wikipedia, without it being problematized, and in the very least attributed. What is your objection to the use of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarianism.html" title="Authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a>? When you answer that question you will see it is a question of pushign a disputed conception of the state. As such this is the POV that is being pushed here in violation of NPOV, while authoritarianism as a conception/theory of the state is also in wide use but does not have the problems of the T word. You still do not address the other issues.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 18:30, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The rules work both ways, yes? If you are claiming Russell as an advocate of accepting the concept of "totatliarianims' and seeing a legitimate use of that term then you have to also find a reputable source which supports this assertion. As I pointed out not once in the works I've read from Russell does he use this word, however, he does use authoritarianism, which unlike the T word is not a theory that is itself in dispute as even existing other than a loaded, ideologically charged term stemming from an organic theory of the state that is largely discredited. To use that term as if it were accepted as a legitimate theory is what I object to. Even if Russell does use this, it must be worded as such. You still have not defended restoring the "actual communism, and actual Marxism" bits I removed as nonsense. How do you defend restoring that? Does anyone say there was any "actual Communism?!" Infact, Russell speaks positively and advocates Communism as a great ideal for mankind, so its contradictory to put words in his mouth that he is against actual communism. In fact what is meant here is what I replaced it with, but was reverted. Again, there has been no explaination yet given for this. If one is going to claim the T word as what Russell wants to use, then you need a source that supports this claim or by your own standards I can remove it.</dd>
<dd>Now back to the other issue of influence, lets use logic here. We are allowed to make simple inferences and this is not original research. Consider these premises: 1. Russell was a socialist or regarded himself as a socialist. 2. Prior to Marx socialism was not a coherent body of though see Russells own writing here where he says this: <a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/rfree10-a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zpub.com/notes/rfree10-a.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, 3. we can assume that Russell believed that his conception of socialism was coherent. Therefore it logically follows that Marx had some influence on Russell for 1. Russell is a socialist, and his brand of socialism is coherent (even if different from Marx), and that socialism before Marx was not coherent (according to Russell). Even if Russell is mistaken, what he thinks and believes is relevant and evidence of the claim because he is the subject. But if this is all considered OR, then I'm sure I can find a reputable source when I have time to look to make the claim.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 16:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deletion of Quotes</span></h2>
<p>May I ask Andrew Norman what is rationale is for the deletion of quotes that I added earlier today? They are properly sourced. I am adding them back. --172.191.181.251 21:28, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both give undue weight to minor aspects of Russell's views, from his voluminous popular writings. You are not adding them back - go and read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 21:32, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Merely referencing these quotes is not giving them "undue weight." They are useful documentation in a section that already exists, on Russell's controversial views. To hide them is a sort of historical revisionism which is repugnant. --172.195.190.195 22:05, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You said it - <i>a section which already exists</i>. There's no revisionism going on, and there is enough supporting evidence in that section for what are relatively unimportant matters. We are not going back to the days when this article was stuffed full of cherry-picked quotes chosen by supporters of Lyndon LaRouche to make Russell look evil. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 22:15, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I want to know is, who appointed Andrew Norman to be Joe Stalin? It's not as if you are suppressing criticism from some fringe critic, like for example, Lyndon LaRouche. You are suppressing <i>quotes from Russell.</i> You are trying to make this article into an air-brushed, Hollywood bio. You also abused your admin powers by blocking my IP number after my <i>first edit.</i> I would like other editors to have their say as to whether these are "relatively unimportant matters." It looks to me like Andrew is in violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, among other things. Please examine Andrew's deletions here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bertrand_Russell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73468899" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bertrand_Russell&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=73468899" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> --172.192.28.208 13:31, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would encourage other editors to have their say. Is Russell well-known for his views on race? Is inclusion of yet another quote about the LaRouchian hobby-horse of world government giving a balanced view of Russell's opinions and importance? Does the article contain too much stuff about the Theory of Descriptions? --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 09:03, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You are citing <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a> as justification for your deletions. It is not applicable, because it applies to "minority viewpoints," not quotes from the subject of the article. You may wish to argue that these statements from Russell were a momentary indiscretion, an aberration of sorts, but please note that they are from 1923, 1946, 1951, spanning almost 30 years of his published activity. Asking whether the article should include "yet another quote about the LaRouchian hobby-horse of world government" misleads the reader in two ways: firstly, because it implies that there is already a quote about world government, when there are only two unsourced references to it; and secondly, by suggesting that the topic has something to do with LaRouche, when LaRouche is irrelevant to the discussion. Russell's words speak for themselves, and you are insinuating that editors who do not care to join you in burying them are somehow in league with LaRouche.</p>
<p>Finally, one other comment on "undue weight": these quotes, in terms of the space they take in the article, amount to less than half the lines given to the section on praise from Russell's fans.--172.191.75.23 14:21, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>

<dd>Maybe I'm slow, but I didn't quite get the argument for removing the quotes. Is Russell well-known for his views on race? Probably not.

<dl>
<dd>Please read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, carefully. The point of this article is to give a clear, balanced view of Russell, not to cherry-pick trivia. The view that Russell's opinions on race are important <i>is</i> a minority viewpoint. He dashed off articles for the press on many subjects over the years, including an article on the prospects of insects taking over the world, and I'd oppose that being included here, too. (Note to others: ManEatingDonut is pretty clearly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=ManEatingDonut" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=ManEatingDonut" rel="nofollow">a supporter of LaRouche</a>). --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Norman_14f2.html" title="User:Andrew Norman">ajn</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Norman_c12c.html" title="User talk:Andrew Norman">talk</a>) 15:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all, I know the NPOV policy. If we were discussing whether to mention the quotes in the intro, or to include an extensive discussion from secondary sources about the meaning of the quotes, or even discussing where in the article the quotes should go, it would apply. But this is not about the degree of emphasis -- this is about suppressing the quotes altogether. You seem to argue that since you and others agree that Russell was a pretty swell guy, we should just pretend that he never said those things. I don't buy it.</p>
<p>Secondly, as to whether I am a "supporter of LaRouche" (I seem to hear a distant echo: <i>Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?</i>) It seems to be fashionable in some circles at Wikipedia to try to justify pushing a point of view by suggesting that anyone who objects is a "supporter of LaRouche." I've seen SlimVirgin do this a lot. The fact of the matter is that I have made hundreds of edits to Wikipedia without ever registering as a user. I registered after I got interested in the LaRouche articles, which I think have a lot of problems with dubious sources and POV, and an editor named Will Beback insisted that I should get a logon before participating in the discussion on a talk page. So, the edits you see in your link are the ones from recent weeks. They do not reflect many, many edits to articles that have nothing to do with LaRouche.</p>
<p>Now for argument's sake, if I <i>were</i> a "supporter of LaRouche," exactly how would that justify your evading or ignoring the points I raise? --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManEatingDonut_4ec8.html" title="User:ManEatingDonut">ManEatingDonut</a> 23:36, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
