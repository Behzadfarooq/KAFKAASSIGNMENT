<p>I added the bit about his influence over the cinema. I am amazed that this point was missing from the page. Anyway, I'm no Brecht expert (hence reading the article), if you can elaborate on his influence on the cinema please do so. I notice that the Godard article had a point about Brecht, as it must, and was shocked to see no Godard reference on this page. As a side note, if you are a Brecht fan or want to see what the alienation effect is all about check out some Godard films or early Fassbinder films.</p>

<dl>
<dd>You don't know what you're talking about. Brecht served only one purpose (that I believe was his ultimate aim in life), simply to alienate. He did not wish to only alienate the audience but also to get the general public to a state of such boredom with the theatre in general that they would cease to go to it. Brecht attempted to destroy theatre.</dd>

<p>Dear Stefan (pardon me "yo yo yo", Stefan)</p>
<p><br />
I think you will find Brecht's main aim was to distance the spectator (not alienate). He believed theatre should be 'a force for social and political change', reacting against 'culinary theatre': only fit for eating, food that causes indigestion. Any learned human can appreciate the fact that Brecht changed the face of theatre. Without Brecht there would be no political theatre. Brecht stuck two fingers up the fascists without getting caught. So don't be insulting a man who influenced the majority of theatre today. Brecht's theories are practised everywhere, all over the world. Here in Britain the Royal Court's young writers project, was brought about by a group of directors going over to see the Berlin ensemble in the 1940's! London's fresh, 'shocking', provocative writing today exists because of Brecht's alive and kicking direction! Vanessa</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
I don't want to interrupt the name calling and "yo yo yo"s, but I don't understand why there is a redirection from "alienation effect" to this article. Granted, Brecht founded this method, but is it not a subject that can stand on its own? Are there not other uses of the alienation effect employed elsewhere? This is found commonly in many modernist (to include "post-modernist") literary and dramatic works, and certainly not just those written by Brecht. Just a thought. Oh, and did anyone else realize that the Epic Theatre (founded by Brecht to present his plays) is still around? Who would have thought something so counter to the socially acceptable concept of theatre would survive fifty years? Thus proving that "alienation effect" deserves its own Wiki entry. 8)66.245.200.216A Dead Cat</p>

<p>"After the war he moved to Berlin where an influential critic, Herbert Ihering, brought him to the attention of a public longing for modern theater. Already in Munich his first two plays, Baal and Drums in the Night, had had performances, and he got to know Erich Engel, a director who worked with him off and on for the rest of his life. "</p>

<p>"He married the opera singer and actress Marianne Zoff in 1922. Their daughter, Hanne Hiob, born in 1923 is a well-known German actress. One year later they had a son, Stefan. In 1930 he married Weigel, and their daughter Barbara was born soon after."</p>
<p>What Happened to the marriage to Zoff? This makes it sound like he had two wives simultaneously. At least one sentence is needed explaining their divorce, and hopefully a word on why.</p>

<p>This refers to <i>Saint Joan of the Stockyards</i> as "Brecht's first great play", but later on it says "Brecht would later uses elements of <i>Happy End</i> as the germ for his <i>Saint Joan of the Stockyards</i>". That's confusing... unless it means that everything before Saint Joan wasn't great. <a href="../../../t/e/i/User%7ETeiladnam_4b40.html" title="User:Teiladnam">Teiladnam</a> 07:08, 9 October 2005 (UTC) Yeah, that's what it means. From the POV of Brecht's theories regarding the theater, or the POV of Brecht's international reception, it's a valid claim. - Lewis</p>

<dd>well... as the article states, he was a german citizen, and acquired the austrian citizenship only late in his life, and never actually lived in Austria; plus he lived on the US east coast for several years in exile, so he can probably be referred to as kind of american, although his relationship with america was a difficult one. -- <a href="../../../7/9/0/User%7E790.html" title="User:790">790</a> 08:24, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a whole section on the term "Brechtian" (which if I'm not mistaken is spelled "Brechtean" anyway) which says nothing except that it is an adjective comparing things to Brecht. Thanks, Wikipedia. How about someone more familiar with the man than I am edits this section to describe what a person would actually mean when they use that term, so, as a good encyclopedia should, it does not require that the casual reader looking up that word read the entire article on Brecht. Also, the word "Brechtian" when linked to other pages does not link to that particular section, but merely redirects to the top of the article. Thanks. Rufusgriffin 22:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm surprised to see in the list "Herr Puntila und sein Mann Matti". The work is generally known - and often performed - under the title "Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti".

<p>from the article: "After Adolf Hitler won the election in 1933". Hitler won the election in 1932, and became chancellor and dictator in 1933. I don't know which it is supposed to be, but this is wrong. <a href="../../../m/t/i/User%7EMtijn_b74f.html" title="User:Mtijn">Mtijn</a> 00:28, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
A bit hair-splitting, this. According to my Brockhaus, after the election in November 1932 the Nazis held 196 out of 584 seats in the Reichstag. True, they were the largest party, but "winning an election" looks rather different - which is why Hitler didn't become Chancellor until the following year. In March 1933 they won 288 seats.

<p>This section is a bit of a mess. Brecht was not one of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Ten_7a2b.html" title="Hollywood Ten">Hollywood Ten</a>, he was one of the many people to testify at the same time.

<dd>It depends on where you are in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, etc. Some places "ch" is a hard k, others "sh", still others, kh (like you're going to spit--German is such a pretty language). I'm not sure if there's an "official" pronunciation other than High German, which would make it the last option I mentioned (It's like "ich": some say "ick" or "isht" or "ikh" or "ikhsht" or some variation of any of these). Any native or professional German speakers out there? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 13:50, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, actually I'm German and you'd never pronounce "Brecht" like a hard k oder like sh or even kh. The way to pronounce "ch" in German is usually something you can't bring over to English because there's no similiar sound in English. At least I can't think of any and almost all people for an Englisch speaking country have big problems with German words that contain "ch" - e.g. Eichhoernchen (squirrel). The "ch" is more like an hissing sound but not really.;-) The best way would be the sh, every German would understand what you mean even if it's not the right way of saying it.</p>

<p>The article sounds like something Eric Bentley might have written about his hero in the Fifties. Contemporary scholarship investigates his exploitation of women writers ("collaborators") who wrote works under his name. And we are no longer forgiving people who were still Stalinists long after the purge trials, long after the evidence was out. If we are supposed to stop "goggling Romantically" and evaluate the works on political grounds, they're indefensible, post Communist bloc collapse and confessions of what was really going on. He'd better hope we just relax and enjoy Azdak or the Good Woman. What's really carrying Brecht is Weill's great music. This article is way behind the pitch, by 2007.</p>

<dd>Sounds like Tony Calabro's take on Brecht. The problem is, Eric Bentley and others of his time usually deemphasized Brecht's politics, as if politics had nothing to do with what Brecht wrote, seeing it as "unfortunate." It's only been in the last ten years or so that studies of Brecht as a political playwright have appeared, or at least which see his politics as a vital component of his works (this of course takes into account Brechtian theory outside of theatre, such as film, which often foregrounds the politics). There are some serious rethinks of Brecht which consider the darker sides of him, in particular his treatment of women in general and collaborators. But evaluating the works on political ground is really the only way to evaluate them, and "post-communist" is irrelevent because that's a gross simplification. Besides all this, what you are calling for would be original research and not applicable to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 17:34, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
