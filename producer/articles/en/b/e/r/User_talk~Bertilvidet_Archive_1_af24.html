<p>As a wikipedian, I have an obligation to attempt to keep the article NPOV. You admit your bias, which is admirable, but you still are arguing from that biased point of view. You are the only one arguing FOR a label for JP. Step back and think about that. You also say you need to inform people, which is pushing an agenda. We should not be doing that on WP.

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 33% for major edits and 73% for minor edits. (Based on the last 150 major and 99 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<p>Thank you. I just had some time to enhance it visually and form a structured outline more open to contributions. I think the METU article is still very poor regarding content and I totally agree that it should include the events of 70s and 80s. I have a minor suggestion, if I may: you could use the preview feature to try those different layouts for the Devrim picture, without saving the page every time. And a note: I think I have better looking pictures for that, does this one have a special purpose in that composition (the barbed wire above the letters), or is it a coincidence? <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAtilimGunesBaydin_6556.html" title="User:AtilimGunesBaydin">Atilim Gunes Baydin</a> 15:30, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your contribution on hammas are consistantly based on mis quotes. I don't know if you rad too fast to mis what the text does or has any other reason for doing what you do. For examples the demands are from the Int'l comunity and not US and the contributions are what hamas describe as "westren nations". The confusu\ion that resulted from your edit will not fly. Do you want to have ArbCom rule about your constant edit-wars&#160;? So here is my suggestion: If you think the text is not correct discuss it in talk. If you continue to revert the text with mis quotes I will take it to ArbCom. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 09:30, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All I can say to you is: Read the sourcesd carefully. The EU is providing funding until th Hamas goverment takes place. It clearly spelled out the 3 conditions for future aid. I have provided sources for that (easy since it is repeated 100s of times on the web) If you continue to revert I will take it to ArbCom.</p>
<p>If you have other sources, read them carefully, present them <b>accuratly</b> this is not your blog, this is an encyclopedia. All POVs are welcome but need to correctly represent the source. READ and UNDERSTAND the sources. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 09:42, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Cool Cat. It's really a nice user page you have here - hope I manage to leave my message without leaving a mess. I noticed that you are doing an effort to removed references to Kurdishness in articles about Southeastern Turkey. I must say I tend to disagree with you, but my purpose for writing you here is not to embark on a long debate where we probably both in forehand know the arguments of the other.</p>
<p>You seem to be a well-experienced and serious Wikipedian. So my question is whether there has been taken any compregensive decisions for Wikipedia policy on offically non-recognized minorities - as the Kurds in Turkey. There are so many articles related to the area of Turkey, that some, including myself, refer to as Kurdistan, that I believe a comprehensive policy should be developed. Has there been such discussions? If not, where is the place to raise such a discussion? I believe it will be better to discuss and reach some overall agreement instead of continous edit wars on articles such as Batman, Hakkari etc. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 20:36, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I am not against "kurdishness". I also do not remove referances to kurdishness.</li>
<li>As you might know Kurdistan is a proposed country. Refering to Hakkari and Batman belonging to a proposed county is problematic and a breach of NPOV.
<ul>
<li>Refering to provinces in soultheastern Turkey as "Kurdistan" is something done often by Kurdish nationalists who seek an independent kurdistan. Which is fine for them but would not be ok on wikipedia.</li>
<li>Kurdistan literaly means "land of the kurds" or "lands owned by kurds" or "lands belonging to kurds" and is factualy inacurate as the place is owned by Turkey.</li>
<li>This is like refering to Canada being the 51st US state. While many people may agree (especialy up north in the US) this would be bad practice as Canada is an independent nation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-recognized minorities are treated like recognised majorities. They have their own articles such as <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_people.html" title="Kurdish people">Kurdish people</a> or <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_culture.html" title="Kurdish culture">Kurdish culture</a>. Only independent states (Such as <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>) and defacto states (partialy) (such as <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">KKTC</a>) are treated like nations.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>My primary concern is Kurdistan being treated as a country. Recently there has been a movement to portray a non existant Kurdish state and I work against this.</dd>
<dd>My second concern is copyrights. A lot of pages refering to kurds is coppied from the web breaching copyrights of numerous people.</dd>

<p>Merhaba Bertilvidet! Bueno, i'm not sure it so good an idea putting hamas for "article for improvement" but we shall see (i dread seeing tens of biased users with no knowledge of the context - at least Israelis editors do have knowledgeg of the context - and I remember a friend of mine, now in New York, telling me how extremists Jews living in the Jewish district over there can be, so much that they made an Israeli friend of his cry...).

I just thought, and I wonder why i didn't think about it, that maybe you'll be interested in helping on translating the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladio.html" title="Gladio">Gladio</a> article in turkish (it's just has been started), as Gladio has been active over there too. same goes for <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Catli_f48d.html" title="Abdullah Catli">Abdullah Catli</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmet_Ali_Agca_1b98.html" title="Mehmet Ali Agca">Mehmet Ali Agca</a>, both from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_Wolves_f99c.html" title="Grey Wolves">Grey Wolves</a> who have been infiltrated by Gladio.

<p>Hi, I noticed your posts on the above article, which I just edited a few times, and see from your user page that you live in Turkey and knowledgeable about the political situation there.

<p>The problem is my friend, that in order for the Kurds to get independance they are promoting their culture. For sure, this is all great and I promote this. However Iranian culture has been influential on all of middle east, mostly on Persians, to totally DENY this fact, and claim that all of a sudden Norouz is a Kurdish celebration comes as a shocking news to me. Sure, it is now claimed that 'Newruz' is different to Norouz, but as for the article, it needs references to support the idea that it is a different festival. Even Diyako has said that "its not exactly the same", well, if it IS pretty much the same thing, then the article should not have a strong POV toward how Kurdish it is and how its so different to the Iranian one.</p>

<dd>Doroud, are those pictures from a rally/demonstration or just the festival celebration? and what are those yellow flags with flowers on it? --Kash 21:10, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The pictures are from a Newroz celebaration, but these tend to turn quite political among Kurds in Turkey - and resemble thus a rally/demonstration (which is the reason that I argue for a raison d'être of kurdish neworz)...so the distinction is not clear cut. The yellow flags are the symbol of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Society_Party_d94b.html" title="Democratic Society Party">Democratic Society Party</a>. all the best <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 23:27, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your honesty. I really do! it's quite inspirational!

<p>Once again, thank you for the message. I appreciate you style of debate and that you want to avoid pouring more fuel on the fire! I am not sure if I understand exactly what is not mentioned in the article. I wrote this part: " Newroz is however still considered as a potent symbol of Kurdish identity in Turkey. Newroz celebrations are usually organised by Kurdish cultural associations and pro-Kurdish political parties. Thus, the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Society_Party_d94b.html" title="Democratic Society Party">Democratic Society Party</a> was a leading force in the organisation of the 2006 Newroz events throughout Turkey." which I find very essential for understanding the Kurdish Newroz celebration. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 00:15, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well I think the first and most important thing is that it looks like they are totally different celebrations.. you agreed that this is not the case, May I ask are you a Kurd? because I have Kurd friends who were surprised by this article! they claimed, as far as they know, Norouz is all the same. So if my guesses are correct, the whole idea that they are different is a new phenomena and politically motivated..I am quite unsure about what to do about it at the moment. --Kash 00:23, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure you may I ask, and I will even answer. I am not a Kurd....I am a European interested in Turkish politics, and this is how I got interested in the Newroz issue. I dont have much more knowledge about the history of Newroz than what I can read on Wiki. But I have realized that Newroz celebrations is of huge importance for the identity of Kurds (at least in Turkey). <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 00:49, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes you are right. But in fact many times the conflicts on Kurdish-related articles are baseless. Some (not all) people want to annoy... Yes sure I agree with proposal of Jef3000, It is good. I support also an article on the Kurdish version, whether the title of the article is 'Newroz', or 'Kurdish celebration of Newroz' or 'Kurds and Newroz'. I'm sure the article will be expanded by me and other users. We have a user <a href="../../../h/e/j/User%7EHeja_helweda_5867.html" title="User:Heja helweda">User:Heja helweda</a> who has very good info on Kurds, unfortunately just in this time (of debate) he is absent, unlike before that constantly contributed.

<dd>About the celebration of Nowruz by Kurds in Turkey.. I think its definately worth mentioning (if its true) that Kurds in Iran and Iraq (not sure about the ones in Syria) do not follow their Turkish cousins. Although I don't have any sources for this beside my Kurd friends. I think the Turkish party you mentioned has created all this, as I have mentioned before, to create a national+cultural identity between Kurds, and so far it has worked for the Kurd communities in Turkey and England (just London?), but I am not quite sure if its also true for the Iraqi Kurds. My Iraqi Kurd friend said its definately not true, he also went about saying how the Kurds in Iraq see Kurds in Turkey as Turks! but anyway if Wikipedia starts making assumptions such as this that all Kurds celebrate this other version of Nowruz then my suspicion is that it will be used as a propoganda tool..</dd>

<p>Sadly Diyako thinks we are descriminating against Kurds as general.

</dl>
<p>"Norouz - the Farsi word for "new year" - is an ancient Persian festival, celebrated on the first day of spring in several countries, such as Afghanistan, Iraq's Kurdish north and Iran."</p>
<p>This does back up my idea that the Kurds in northern Iraq celebrate <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norouz.html" title="Norouz">Norouz</a> instead of "Newruz".. I don't think there is any reason to find support for Iranian Kurds as all the country celebrate Norouz including the Kurds. This should pretty much mean that there is no need to generalise the whole Newroz or Newruz to be a "Kurd" thing. What do you think? --Kash 14:05, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Kash, first of all sorry for delaying so long in answering you. I simply dont have any ready answer, so I thought I needed to reflect - but still I am not sure what to say...The Kurds in Turkey use the Latin alphabet, and in their language the celebration is "Newroz" (whereas it is Nevruz in Turkish). The Kurds in Iraq and Syria use however the Arabic alphabet - so spellings from these countries do hardly anymore than transliterate the word. Despite this a Google search for "Newroz Iraq" and "Norouz Iraq" gives the impression that the Kurds in Iraq tend to spell it Newroz (when Latin letters are used). So my impression is that the Newroz spelling rather is a Kurdish thing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I deleted the sentence that used your source. The sentence gave the impression that Newroz and Norouz are two seperate things, and that you choose which one to celebrate. I dont think thats what you mean (?) and indeed it wasnt substained by the article.

<p>Just wanted you to know I trust in your good faith. I know you had honest intentions calling other users to the deletion page but what angered me was, you didn't call 2 or 3, you called about 15 people. This to me is abuse of democracy. I am making a very legitimate case there and now it is being shadowed by 20 people who are already fixated on the subject. It is like discussing with Imams, why Allah doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Anyway I am sure you'll have great contributions to WikiProject Turkey. No hard feelings here.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 09:09, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the message. I really do appreciate your tone and style despite our disagreements. The debate on the AfD became quite unpleasant, so I dont find it fruitful to advance my case there. Retrospectively, I can see that my spread of the word about the AfD could seem abusive. However, I want to underline that on purpose I sent it to people who I believe are open for arguments, and I didnt expect a common outcome. Furthermore I avoided to send it to people personally involved in the issue (didn't sent it to people I know as Kurdish or Turkish users). So I find the parallels to Imams and Mujahedeens inappropriate, and indeed it is not appropriate to my consumption of Rakı!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In a short time, there have been several proposals for deletion of categories, stubs and articles related to Kurds - which has become rather trite, and probably created an atmosphere of irritation with lots of inappropriate comments (including personal attacks, semi racist and anti-Turkish comments). I will suggest that we for a time, after the result of this AfD, try to focus our energy on articles that we can expand, rather than stirring new heated debates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We have a lot of work ahead on the WikiProject Turkey, so lets unite our forces and go on. And in this respect I am convinced that our different approaches is a strenght, that will ensure NPOV and a balanced coverage.

<p>Cool Cat, it seems that we have several common points of interest concerning contemporary Turkey and minority issues is in Turkey. It is also clear that we have differing approaches, at least to the quite sensitive Kurdish question. IMHO our differing approaches should be considered as a strength in order to write well-balanced articles on the issues. If we admit our differences, I am certain that we can write really good NPOV articles. This requires, however, a mutual respect for the other's view, willingness to discussions, refrain from personal attacks and mutually assuming good faith. Lots of work is indeed to improve Turkey-related articles. I suggest that we collaborate about this important task. You are hereby invited. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 11:56, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problem respecting other peoples views. It appears large masses do not honor the same concept which is a problem. Your concerns regarding civility is mutual, in any debate I expect nothing less from you. I also do not want to see any other example of vote stacking, there is no good faith in creating an artificial conensus.</dd>
<dd>I suggest we deal with a few problematic users <i>first</i>. I do not want them to interfere with our colaborations on such a sensative set of articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having said all that you must realise where I am standing. I have nothing against the Kurds in general, however I object the portraying of them as if they own the place. Fortunately/unfortunately they don't and even Iraqi Kurds report to Bagdad.
<ul>
<li>Some Kurds do campaign for an independent state and wikipedia has a palce for them at their own article: Kurdish nationalism. Elsewhere it becomes prolematic. (note that this article does not exist)</li>
<li>The region they campaign for also has its own article: <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>. I do not like such a thing being treated as a geographic region in lead and later treated like a proposed nation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I also suggest keeping a {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag on more contraversial articles such as <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a> until article becomes a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_7cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article">Featured article</a> and hence demonstrate NPOV to its fullest extent.</dd>
<dd>Is there a problem with that so far? --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 14:04, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I appreciate your praise of mutual respect and civility, and in continuation of this my edits and opinions are not determined by what you want.</dd>
<dd>I dont understand what you mean by "<i>I suggest we deal with a few problematic users first</i>". Who are they, how are they problematic? We cannot prevent other users from interfering in our collaboration, indeed it is the nature of Wikipedia that anyone can edit and question whatever we write.</dd>
<dd>As long as a large number of people define them as Kurds, and refer to the place they live as <i>Kurdistan</i> or <i>Turkish Kurdistan</i> (which indicate an accept of the Turkish state) it is my conviction that this term deserves an article here - of course an article that outlines the political and geographical facts. I respect that you disagree on this, and will collaborate in improving the coverage whatever the outcome will be.</dd>
<dd>Yes, Kurdish nationalism is notable enough for an article - and so is <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_nationalism.html" title="Turkish nationalism">Turkish nationalism</a>.</dd>
<dd>The {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag should be used with cautiousness. If there are legitimate concerns about the neutrality it is fair to use the tag. In that case, I will however, prefer that the critical points are entered into the article so that it becomes balanced / NPOV. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 15:53, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Look, some middle easterners refer to the US as the devil. We do not move it to Devil (country).
<ul>
<li>Kurdistan is an acceptable term for an article not because what kurds call the place, but because its is citable on a variety of sources as well as being a proposed country otherwise it would be a simple redirect or perhaps a disambiguation page.</li>
<li>However, Turkish Kurdistan is not as acceptable. After all only Kurds (and perhaps only some) referance the place as such and while rest of the nation and planet refer to the place as soultheastern anatolia. Turkey has 7 geographic regions recognised by the goverment as well as the international community hence no one can object. We can use those rather than a contraversial name such as 'Turkish Kurdistan' which means 'Turkish lands owned by the Kurds' as per dictionary definiton. This is a breaches npov. Also why do we have to use the word Kurdistan?</li>
<li>The more accpeted term is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Southeastern+Turkey%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Southeastern+Turkey%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Southeastern Turkey</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Southeastern+Anatolia%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Southeastern+Anatolia%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Southeastern Anatolia</a> not <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Turkish+Kurdistan%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Turkish+Kurdistan%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">Turkish Kurdistan</a>.</li>
<li>It is however notable enough to be a redirect, just not notable enough to be the article. We do not want two articles explaining the same place. That is why redirects exist and that is why they were created. I do not believe I am being unreasonable here.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The point of {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} is to get community attention. It might sometimes be best for unrelated parties to detect bias we may not necesarily see. Let me elaborate using fiction,
<ul>
<li>For an average <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulan.html" title="Romulan">Romulan</a> citizen, <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingons</a> are a brutal and irrational race of savage people who smell bad.</li>
<li>For the Klingons they are a brave race of warriors following Khalesses teachings superior to every other race.</li>
<li>NPOV would be neither of course but a 3rd party would be better in choosing the NPOV way rather than a Romulan or Klingon citizen. {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} does not mean the article is to be ignored but it just means article is biased and needs attention. A third party can only know about the dispute if it is advertised. This may take days or even a month. This is how contraversial topics are processed on wikipedia and sometimes a {{<a href="../../../p/o/v/Template%7EPOV_1e7d.html" title="Template:POV">POV</a>}} tag is intentionaly left such as on <a href="../../../p/k/k/PKK_1685.html" title="PKK">PKK</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>About the problematic users, see: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Diyako_f8bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Diyako">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Diyako</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Heja_helweda_cbf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Heja helweda">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Heja helweda</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Muhamed_ddf9.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Muhamed">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Muhamed</a>.

<p>Hi Bertilvidet - thanks for the comment re: Cool Cat. That's exactly the sort of reason I didn't want to get involved in the argument - it's too wrapped up in individual political viewpoints, and it's virtually impossible to work out where the POV-free line would be. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:56, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bertil, please see the second-last discussion on the talk page. A user has insisted on including inaccurate (destruction of secular palestinian state) and misleading (linking organization to MB in Egypt rather than Palestine) information in the introduction; as long as that information remains there, the factual-accuracy element of the tag needs to stay as well. I can't fix the article as I have already reverted three times trying to do so. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 11:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I don't think I'm going to bother fixing the article when the 3-rr time limit is up, by the way; no doubt it'll just be reverted again.

<dd>The categories help us keep track of such accounts. It is easier to make sure they stay blocked.</dd>
<dd>Also people writing vandal fighting scrits use such usernames on the category to create better ways in detecting and blockıng such accounts often before they are ever used.</dd>

<p>When I made those edits, the page was already moved to "Mustafa Kema Atatürk" by someone else, I just fixed the dead links and double referrals accordingly; but then somebody else re-moved it back against the will of the sensible majority which then created "the mess" you're talking about. Simply moving the article back to "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk" will remove all dead links and double redirects, it's this simple. His name is not a disputed issue and the majority agreed upon the move to be made, it is your turn to respect the decision. I still don't understand what would you ever gain by insisting on the mistake of referring to him with half of his name despite the consensus! <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKertenkelebek_cf40.html" title="User:Kertenkelebek">Kertenkelebek</a> 12:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you might have noticed, I have changed my vote. I really dont care if the "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk" or "Kemal Atatürk". However, let's be patient and wait until the vote is over before we make any moves. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 13:06, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK so let's just wait until the vote is over instead of making any more redirections. Because at the end of the discussion if the result is to move the article then all the errors will be fixed at once without the need of extensive work. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKertenkelebek_cf40.html" title="User:Kertenkelebek">Kertenkelebek</a> 13:42, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am very familiar with fair use law and WP fair use policy. As you review WP:FU, here's some things that you should note.</p>
<p>1) fair use doesn't apply to the image, but to the use. You can not claim that an image is fair use, only a particular use of that image.</p>
<p>2) Billboards (and other media) are only fair use <b>for critical commentary</b> of the media. If this billboard that you've photographed is famous and much talked about, you could go ahead and create an article on this billboard. The image might be fair use in that article.</p>
<p>3) To claim fair use on WP, you must tag it as FU, not as CC.</p>
<p>4) in all cases, you must provide the name of the copyright holder of the original work.</p>
<p>5) Take particular note of WP:FU#Counterexamples number 5.</p>
<p>On a further note, The image is listed on WP:PUI whether you remove the tag or not. By removing the tag you are giving people the impression that you are trying to avoid dealing with the issue, but this will have little effect on whether the image is deleted or not.</p>

<dd>Eh, that wasn't really the kind of answer I expected. We've had some discords, that's sure, but we are here with a common aim: to improve and expand the encyclopedia. So let's try to keep a good atmosphere, settle disputes - and realize that our different approaches are a must for balanced and deliberate articles.

<dd>There is someone who spends his entier contribution just to harras me (Moby Dick) and you are actualy encouraging this. After that come here and lecture me about the common aim. I wonder...</dd>
<dd>I have no dispute to settle with Moby Dick, I settled that with the two arbitration hearings (one for Davenbelle and another for Moby Dick). All I seek now is the enforcement of the arbitration remidies.</dd>

<p>Thanks&#160;:)) I am also trying to contribute positively rather than get dragged down in edit-wars of the most common kind..&#160;:) You know, when I was joining Wiki that's what I imagined I would be doing, writing and contributing to articles about my expertise and etc. I guess Wikipedia is the real democracy out there, everyone gets to put their two cents in, it is kinda like walking in downtown Istanbul, you don't know who you will run into, as such you frequently get dragged into things that you don't want&#160;:) Well, I put a post on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Turkey_Tasks_52cc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Turkey/Tasks">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Turkey/Tasks</a>, we should be putting some effort into coordinated efforts since certain articles might require the attention of many..

<p>I understand there is difficulty in defining a democracy, but for the sake of sheer practicality we have to accept that should nation follow the main tenets of what is considered modern liberal democracy i.e. free and fair elections, electoral choice, private ownership etc, then that nation can be commonly referred to as democratic, as is the case with Turkey.

<p>We clearly disagree on two related issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>I think that <a href="../../../z/e/_/Ze.html" title="Ze">Ze</a> should not include the pejorative acronym for <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_Entity_4aec.html" title="Zionist Entity">Zionist Entity</a> because it is only used by a handful of Iranians and Syrians. You think it should be there.</li>
<li>I think that <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_Entity_4aec.html" title="Zionist Entity">Zionist Entity</a> is a pejorative term, as already explained in the List of political epithets. I think it should redirect to List of political epithets.
