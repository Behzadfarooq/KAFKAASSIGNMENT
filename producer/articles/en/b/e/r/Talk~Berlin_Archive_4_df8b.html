<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gay/lesbian subculture</span></h2>
<p>No mention of the gay/lesbian subculture than thrived during the 1920's and was destroyed by the Nazis. Berlin had more gay/lesbian/trans bars and clubs in the 1920s than Toronto, Ontario, Canada does today. The movie <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bent.html" title="Bent">Bent</a> is about this, but I don't have a book or internet source to quote.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A very good point. We do have an article on <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nollendorfplatz.html" title="Nollendorfplatz">Nollendorfplatz</a>, which is still a gay neighborhood today as it was during the Weimar era. I expect if someone were willing to do the research, a very good article could be written on LGBT culture in Berlin. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 21:57, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV pushing</span></h2>
<p>Making any article on a German subject into an article on the suffering of Jews is POV as well as anti-German <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>. It is totally inappropriate to flood a brief history section with suffering of Jews, when other much more significant aspects of its history are only dealt with in a sentence, if adressed at all (all wartime destruction: one sentence. No mention of large numbers of refugees at all. No mention of massive Soviet war crimes against population of Berlin). This is an article about the city of Berlin. It is not an article about Auschwitz which is in Poland and not in Berlin. It is appropriate for a history section to mention that Berlin had a large Jewish population, and that it was for a large part destroyed. Details on Auschwitz etc. which is unrelated to the history of Berlin are to be left to the holocaust article.</p>
<p>The Soviet photo is a well known, staged war <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> photo (perhaps one of the most famous from the war). It clearly needs to be identified as such, to not give the false impression that the photo was actually taken when Stalin's men actually entered the Reichstag, or taken by a neutral third party for neutral purposes. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_the_way_cb54.html" title="User:Just the way">Just the way</a> 21:33, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not the photo is staged propaganda or not (and I'm far from convinced it is -- if it had been staged there would have been no need to retouch it later to remove the two watches, etc.) is completely irrelevant to this article. There is no benefit to this article for the caption for that picture to scream "Propaganda! Propaganda!" And the idea that the Reichstag was at that time a symbol of "parliamentarian democracy" is simultaneously laughable and revolting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And yet you keep removing the entirely relevant sentence about Nazi propaganda during in 1936 Olympics in Berlin, replacing it with the nonsensical sentence "Berlin arranged the 1936 Olympics". Berlin is a city; cities can't arrange anything. You also continue to remove the entirely relevant sentence about Kristallnacht and the deportation of the Jews from Berlin claiming it to be "POV as well as anti-German racism". No, it's neither. It's a neutral description of the facts of the Holocaust as it affected Berlin. This is an extremely important part of Berlin's history and will <i>not</i> be left out of the article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 05:12, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your vandalism is reverted once again. You haven't even read my comment, or you are a fanatical anti-German POV pusher. It's POV to flood an article with disproportionate description of alleged wrongdoings, and you don't this in articles on the capitals of other countries, or their country articles. In the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> article, the history section is not massively dealing with London's role as capital of a state that was responsible for horrible crimes across the world, trade of African slaves included. It would be POV because London is a city article. What happened in Africa or America is not relevant to the city history of London, just like what happened in Poland is not relevant to city history of Berlin. If you want to write about Auschwitz, then the Berlin article is nothing for you, because anti-German flooding and spamming will be removed. And no, it's not OK to claim that some government "<i>used</i> the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936_Summer_Olympics_a11e.html" title="1936 Summer Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a> in Berlin for propaganda purposes", just as it would not be ok to claim that the Bush regime "<i>used</i> [sports event] for propaganda purposes". This is your opinion, not a neutral fact. The 1936 Summer Olympics was arranged in Berlin, end of story. If you want to describe it further, like some of the innovations, it should be done in a neutral way. You need to make yourself familiar with <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">our NPOV policy</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_the_way_cb54.html" title="User:Just the way">Just the way</a> 20:20, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You want to use 76 words to describe wrongdoings against Jews. Every detail must be mentioned according to you, even what happened to the "last Jews". Similtanously, you want to use 0 words to describe a much higher number of refugees, and 0 words to describe massive Soviet war crimes. You want to use only 25 words dealing with the entire rest of its war-time history and horrible total destruction of a city (which your own country was responsible for). If you fail to see this is disproportionate and thus POV, I cannot help you further. The 20th century section is one page only, and either it must be extremely expanded (which is not a good idea), or everythings needs to be kept short. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_the_way_cb54.html" title="User:Just the way">Just the way</a> 20:43, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The mentioned paragraph about the extinction of the jewish community seems not disproportionate to me. There might be overemphasizing in other german related articles but rather not in this one. In this case the city itself (Nazi government) decided to murder a relevant part of german-jewish culture of their own city society. This cultural life had been built up over centuries and was then ended. It is of significance for world history and especially of the city´s history. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The article is hardly "flooded" with "disproportionate description[s] of alleged wrongdoings" ("alleged"?!? Are you going to deny the Holocaust next?). It has a couple of sentences about what happened <i><b>in Berlin</b></i> making it extremely relevant to the article on Berlin. No mention of the slave trade at <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, because the British never enslaved Londoners, while the Nazis did transport Berliners to death camps. Claiming that to say so reflects a "fanatical anti-German POV" is absurd, because <i>those Jews <b>were</b> Germans</i>! As for the 1936 Olympics, perhaps the neutrality of the sentence can be improved, but no serious historian denies that the Olympics were used by the Nazis for propaganda purposes. If you want to discuss Soviet war crimes that took place in Berlin, go ahead, but focusing on the propaganda potential of one photograph isn't achieving that goal. However, if any substantial addition to the history of Berlin is going to be made, it ought to be made at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Berlin_2009.html" title="History of Berlin">History of Berlin</a>, not here, as the page as already twice as long as it ought to be. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 05:26, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You tell me British slave trade that was carried out from London isn't relevant to London, because only some Black "sub-human beings" were victims, and not the British "masters"? Again we see different rules for Germany-related articles than articles of all other countries. Crimes of the British doesn't need to be mentioned in the article on their capital, while the article on the German capital must mostly deal with wrongdoings.</p>
<p>When you use 75 % of the space to describe wrongdoings against Jews, and 25 % to describe the entire rest of it's war-time history, you are flooding. Appropriate would be, say 20 % of the war-time description, and only thing specifically affecting Berlin (it had a large Jewish community, which was 170,000 and not 160 as you are claiming, that was destroyed). This is not the holocaust article. Things that has nothing to do with Berlin should not be mentioned. What happened in Poland belong in other articles than the Berlin article.</p>
<p>You don't mention the expulsion, are you going to deny the expulsion next? You don't mention terror bombing, are you going to deny that too? If the page is already twice as long as it ought to be, you should be cooperating on shortening it. In your version, one aspect of history is given disproportionate attention. If you want to keep such a lengthy description of wrongdoings, I will have to write ten times as much as the current version on other aspects of war-time history. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_the_way_cb54.html" title="User:Just the way">Just the way</a> 10:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>German Democratic Republic is the correct English name. The colloquialism "East Germany" was carefully avoided in all formal situations. "East Germany" is ambigious, because in Cold War West Germany, "East Germany" was the name reserved for the lost provinces, while the GDR was referred to as SBZ, Mitteldeutschland and finally as DDR. FRG was not used for reasons stated at the article <a href="../../../b/r/d/BRD_545c.html" title="BRD">BRD</a>, the name used in the west was "Federal Republic of Germany", short: Germany, and informal/colloquial: West Germany. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_the_way_cb54.html" title="User:Just the way">Just the way</a> 11:10, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm with the "tosh" crowd on this. The GDR was perfectly happy to refer to itself as "East Germany" at the Olympics and elsewhere. It's irrelevant what ex-Nazis living in West Germany in the 1950s meant by "Ostdeutschland" <i>in German</i>. "East Germany" in English means the country that styled itself the "German Democratic Republic" — although, as many pundits pointed out, it was none of these things. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions"><span style="color:white;background:#700">&#160;<span style="background:#800">Pr<span style="background:#900">oh<span style="background:#a00">ib<span style="background:#b00">it<span style="background:#c00"><b>O</b></span><b>ni</b></span><b>o</b></span><b>n</b></span><b>s</b></span>&#160;</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProhibitOnions_b4f5.html" title="User talk:ProhibitOnions"><font size="-2">(T)</font></a></sup> 13:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The GDR was, by the way, never perfectly happy being referred to as "East Germany" (which it also wasn't). From the GDR point of view, this was a way to deny the GDR recognition as an independent state, implying it was part of another state. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_the_way_cb54.html" title="User:Just the way">Just the way</a> 14:00, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your assertion that the term "East Germany" was never used to refer to the GDR is, quite frankly, nonsense. We are talking about English usage here, not German or French.

<dd>You referred to victims of genocide and ethnic cleansing, and almost the entire German population as "ex-nazis". If you referred to all Jews living in Israel in the 1950s as "ex-Bolsheviks", that would be racism too. It is a complete lie on your part that Ostdeutschland was used by "ex-nazis in the 50s". It was used by social democrats, liberals and christian democrats, and it always meant the provincens under Soviet and Polish administration until the beginning of the 1970s when SPD changed its foreign policy, however the CDU opposed that change and the term was used until German reunification. Today it is mostly used by the victims of ethnic cleansing and genocide organized in the Bund der Vertriebenen. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_the_way_cb54.html" title="User:Just the way">Just the way</a> 12:15, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree on topic (1.),(4.),(5.). On (2.): A few more sentences in `setting´ may be in zoo,parks...are ok.Its not an important aspect. On (3.):LGBT is highly represented through picture and sentence,every other extention in new articles. On (6.): Citation has to be kept short. book template is not acceptable. On (7.): The lead is comparable to most of the city articles and covers the relevant parts. Details can be discussed. On (8.): Total disagreement.Length is widely tolerated because of exceptional article-status (also length of country-articles). Major City-articles vary from 50-80kb, Berlin has 63kb.The history section is very short in comparison and has very high relevance, especially 20th century Berlin.

<dd>Perhaps we have different goals for the article. I would like the article to become a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a> someday, but it won't make it unless at least points 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are addressed. It could probably make it to FA without 2 and 3, and possibly without 4, although I personally couldn't support it unless all 8 points were addressed. But if featured-article status is not your goal (and given the crappy quality of a lot of recent featured articles I wouldn't blame you if it weren't), then you needn't worry about all the points. I would ask you not to delete anything from the to-do list, however, in case other people <i>are</i> interested in bringing the article up to FA standards. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 22:05, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>FA - Status is a desirable goal. I watch the development of around 40 global cities(city-articles) in engl.Wiki towards this aim.I also compare the development in 10 other Wiki-languages concerning city-articles.By now only 3 midsize cities/articles gained FA status&#160;; <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>. Given these ´models` (1.) and (5.)is a problem (6.) and (8.) is not,(7.) could be questioned. BUT, through my investigation I learned that FA status is very difficult to gain and to keep for the majority of global cities/articles for a number of reasons.One is a typical dilemma. How to present a city reasonable and based on facts AND show the relevance and the city´s character without exaggeration or disproportion. I like to develop a combination of both, without compromising one to much.To aim FA is not a contradiction. The Berlin-article is in many respects one of the very finest in the world of city-articles by now, with or without FA. I will support accuracy and expansion (certainly not more than 70kb) but will also keep the complex character of the articles content. Sorry, (7.) and (8.) can´t prevail. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a> all the best</p>
<dl>
<dd>Without 7 and 8 there is no hope of ever achieving FA status. If you insist on reverting all attempts to implement points 7 and 8, the rest of us may as well give up trying to improve this article. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 23:48, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It´s untrue .... watch the mentioned FA - cities, the current length is the smallest problem of all. Same for the leading 4 paragraphs ... what part is it exactly do you worry?

<p>Well, you have seen it for yourself ...The FA-Rules are hardly working on city-articles because of the special premises.Though it is fine goal... As I said, only aiming to FA-status in terms of length will fail in this case.Nobody would have the idea to cut NYC,Paris,Los Angeles down to 40 kb.Even though there is still many room to improvement.And by the way , we didn´t even request FA-candidate, so it doesn´t make sense speculate about the outcome. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>

<p><a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a> in your latest purge, you deleted a Stendahl quotation, Now I´m not against pruning things per se, the quotation wasn´t that important, but you have now suceeded in deleting both mentions of "Märkische Sand" in the article. You seem to have an obsession of standardising everything. I feel your deletions make the article faceless, Berlin is Berlin but Chicago oder "sonst wo" is somewhere else, the articles shouldn´t all be the same. Being built on sand makes Berlin special, what other inland cities have beaches like Berlin?? No mention here!! A polite request from me, when you decide to delete something, think about what has been lost and try and add the (compressed) information somewhere else... --<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 23:02, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a>, good point. Please add a sentence on the inland beaches in #recreation# or about the sandy character in #Geography#. / I can´t share your opinion about standardisation or faceless´article,I feel the opposite. The article improves in complexity,character, quality and dephts in my eyes.<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>

<dd>OK, I´ll do that --<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 10:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
