<p>The bulk of this article's bias is in its "Controversies" section. Authors repeatedly claim that Edward Said hated all western scholarship and that anybody that didn't agree with Muslim political objectives should be discounted. That's absurd. Moreover, the source of that claim is a book written by Bernard Lewis himself! Said, a CHRISTIAN, never made such claims, and they are purposely being distorted in this biography for reasons I don't know why. My professor (Leslie Pierce, UC Berkeley) was actually a student of Bernard Lewis and she taught us Orientalism in a far less biased manner than this. Reasonable people can disagree about western scholarship, but there's no need to distort Said's views in this manner. Moreover, Lewis' response seems to totally misunderstand Said's criticism, which are not based on the fact that Orientalists are critical of the Middle East, but that it's scholarship exists to advance political intellectualism, and is based upon a campaign of self affirmation, rather than study for its own sake. If you take a look at Lewis' books, including his famous "What Went Wrong" the anti-Islamic bias is obvious. Who says things went wrong? Things happened the way they did and blaming culture for it is counterproductive and assumes western institutionals and models are more appropriate for how a "proper society" should exist. Moreover, Middle Eastern soceties have been greatly affected by Western political interference, either through colonialism and the British Mandate, or direct interference like the 1953 coupe in Iran. I'm not suggesting these events in and of themselves caused the Middle East to quote "maldevelop" but if your going to start pointing fingers, lets be honest about our own roles in its development since the rise of our allies, such as the House of Saud. And therein lies the great flaw in Lewis' work, which is that he assumes all blame is internal to Arabs and Muslims, rather than their development existing within a global framework that was at times out of their control. No person or society has complete agency over their futures. What Said objected to was the self-righteousness of Orientalism, not who was being self righteous.</p>

<p>ThinkPink, I thought Orientalism was published in 1979 myself, but Said often said 1978 in interviews, so I wonder whether the first edition was 1978.

<p>Bernard Lewis is a highly biased ideologue who passes for a “scholar” only in Neocon academic circles. For the record, the man is a card-carrying member of Israel’s rightwing Likud party, and owns a deluxe condominium in East-Jerusalem built on lands stolen from Palestinian Christians who were brutally expropriated by the state of Israel in 1967… I’m afraid Lewis is not the most objective analyst you’re likely to find on topics such as Islam, Baathism, and “Arabism” Pan or otherwise! <a href="../../../d/r/v/User%7EDrVictorino_835a.html" title="User:DrVictorino">DrVictorino</a></p>

Why doesn't he own any property in Jerusalem - has he sold it? Property aside - wiki has outwikied itself on this one. In a court room this guy would be rejected as having a conflict of interest. Only someone who screams anti-semtic would use him as a source ( without a footnote - why try to sneak this guy in as unbiased - how wiki of you).</p>

<p>Bernard Lewis's lack of understanding of the Koran and Islam is evident. Throughout the pages of the Koran it is clear that the Prohet Mohammad did not ...."bring any new found religion or doctrine". ......"You (Mohammad) are only a messenger like the messengers of old." and ......"that the Supreme Command is one and one only to all of mankind. Bernard should first then question: Who founded Islam? Answer: Islam ("State of Peace")is another word for the eternal religion from the "Supreme Command" of the heavens and the earth. Its principles can be found in the hearts and minds of all people except the blind.</p>

<dd>I don't think that this article tries to discuss whether BL had a good or poor understanding of anything. This is an article to document his life works. By the way, BL was looking at islam from the standpoint of a historian and a scientist, whereas you look at it from the viewpoint of a believer. The difference in concept might therefore be extreme. If you want to debate who founded Islam on a theological plane, this page is surely not the forum for it.</dd>

<p>That is quite silly when you consider that "Islam" is explicitly not something new, but rather a continuation and a correction of what came before it. So when you say "nearly everyone on earth" you are discounting the billion-plus Muslims. How neutral of you! Actually, on a whim I opened the "Mohammad" link you provided, and it starts with "Muhammad is a major figure in Islam", with extensive debate about only using the term "founder" for non-Muslims' opinions in the talk page, so apparently your own link disowns you.

<p><br />
The point above - no understanding of the Koran or Islam - followed by looking at Islam as a scholar and historian - what a dumb statement, I hope scholars have some understanding of what they are a scholar or historian of. When I read that in 1998 BL had never heard of BinLaden, I wondered where had this guy been - advising the government about what, draperies? He seems to be a classic neocon - his latest on the president of Iran seems almost in the range of astrology. ?</p>

<p>I see Pecher has now reverted my change back to "a professor of English and comparative literature" with the edit summary "this description is factual and neutral". No, it's not, actually. Calling Said "a professor..." etc. is true, it is the case (or was), but as a summary of what he's known for, it's no more factual than describing <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Adams_4bdd.html" title="Douglas Adams">Douglas Adams</a> as "a very tall man" or <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> as "the former Governor of Texas" or "the brother of Jeb Bush". These factoids about these people are true, they are the case, but they don't form a well-balanced summary of what they're known for. They're not how Wikipedia would describe them. Nor is it as any old professor of English and comparative literature that Said is known. Are you saying my description, "the well-known <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a>-<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_theory.html" title="Literary theory">literary theorist</a>" is not factual and neutral? In what way? That he's well-known, that he was Palestinian-American and a literary theorist, and that he's well-known <i>as</i> a literary theorist are utterly uncontested facts, surely. They're not in the realm of opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 01:56, 23 July 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>Valid point. Edward Said may also have been left handed. Would pecher like to add that in as well? His shoe size? "Edward Said, a man with straight greying hair"? In the context of this article, what is notable is Edward Said's role as a Palestinian scholar and academic. That he <i>is</i> a scholar and an academic is easily verifiable. What's notable is Said's books and speeches on Western reviews and interpretations of Islam, not his review of the Sanskrit alphabet. His critiques on orientalism. To merely describe him as a professor of linguistics is a misleading attempt to imply that his relevance in debate doesn't extend past his credentials as a linguist. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 07:02, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

If I didn't know better, I'd say you and Pecher take offense to the notion that this Muslim man is described as a scholar. How can any Muslim be described as anything other than a bloodthirsty jihadi, eh? The sourse I used describes him as a renowned palestinian-american scholar.

For one who finds such discourse 'disgusting', he seems to involve himself in an awful many such arguements. I certainly do not go about editing on topics on Jewish history or topics of Jewish/Muslim conflict, or in this case, on articles on scholars who specialize in Middle Eastern history, in order to edit the article towards tilting in my POV. Nothing personal or attacking about there, merely an observation that the one complaining about how disgusting such discourse is, is in fact generating the offending discourse. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 00:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Neither Pecher nor Meier have replied to my arguments here as you can see. Perhaps because they have no merit? I don't know. Or perhaps because it's so much quicker to just revert. (Timestamps show Pecher taking all of two minutes to consider my contribution, research his own claims of "anachronism", and revert.) OK, I'm shouting into a void, I understand it's meaningless to try to edit this page. I won't spend any more time arguing on this talkpage, and then trying to guess why I got reverted anyway, and the eternal question: do I need to argue more persuasively, or is nobody reading it anyway?

To mention (as briefly as possible--I shortened some over-elaborate locutions) Said, post-colonialism, the concept of Orientalism, and the book <i>Orientalism</i> (are those the "vacuous epithets" and "eulogical addendums"? Have you looked at my latest version, that got reverted twice?) is very helpful in putting Bernard Lewis into the context of a discussion that many people are aware of, some of them only vaguely aware--some to the point that they've heard of Said but not of Lewis.

Read <a href="../../../d/a/s/Das_Kapital_c638.html" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a>; Marx's book is thousands times more "seminal" than <i>Orientalism</i>, but the article is happy without weasel characteristics. The reason is simple: it's sufficient to mention all the relevant facts about <i>Das Kapital</i>, and its importance will become clear to readers. I think if Said were indeed a more heaviweight scholar than Lewis, you wouldn't need to resort to POV terminology to assert his eminence.

<dd>You speak at random. I've never spoken to User:Tickle me before. I've never called Said "renowned". I didn't suggest Said was more heavyweight than Lewis, I said he was more famous. (I said that above only, not in the article.) That's hardly a matter of opinion. You know, if I'd written the original phrase "<a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a>, a professor of English and comparative literature at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_082c.html" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>...", I'd be thanking the person who tried to improve it rather than attacking them. I still don't understand why you reverted my first assay. You could have just removed the (I agree) useless word "well-known"; especially considering that ten days later you <i>inserted my exact phrasing on the ground that it was "more precise"</i>. And it bothers me that you only took two minutes of research and deliberation to decide to revert me the second time. I'd have appreciated a genuine look at it. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 21:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC).

<dd>I agree. There's a case to be made on both sides, but the one presented here strongly favors Lewis and his defenders. The Said critique is presented unfairly. Regardless of politics, these are two important scholars and their debate was not like some kind of Hitchens-Juan Cole snipefest. There was much more subtlety and depth to both of their points of view than we see here. The closing statement, with a bunch of names ripping Said, is simply a pile-on. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 11:05, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In this section the sentence starting with "Lewis meant that it was ..." is rather subjective. Deciding what Lewis really meant, as if it can be decided, should be left to the reader.

<p>The description of the decision of the French court is dubious&#160;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Parisian court interpreted his remarks as a denial of the Armenian Genocide and on June 21, 1995 fined him one franc"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, that court wrote in its decision that it has not juridiction to decide wether the massacre were indeed a genocide. It condemned Lewis because <i>"by concealing elements contrary to his opinion, he failed to his duties of objectivity and prudence"</i>. Furthermore, the fiddling value of the fine is misleading, nominal fees (1F, 1€) being common practice in France for such matters. It should not be mentionned (or one should add that he had been sentenced to 34,000F as fees on top of the 1F). --Geo115fr 22:42, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Regarding OR, you're coming up with your own arguments as to why Lewis was wrong.

<dd>As you can see, it follows none of Wikipedia's conventions, and is completely unencyclopedic and filled with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<dd>If a third party can get a word in here (perhaps not, considering I have had four edit conflicts trying to post this), I would suggest that the whole list of views and predictions in that section of the article be looked at again with a critical eye. I'm not sure that either of the claims sourced back to Fouad Ajami's Wall Street Journal column are terribly good summaries of what Ajami says, nor are they necessarily the most interesting things in the WSJ piece, which is certainly potentially a good source for this article. Neither am I convinced that this article needs to mention Lewis' Iran remarks at all - though it should be remarked that Lewis is by no means the only respected scholar to note with concern the apparent millenarian tendencies of President Ahmadi Nejad.</dd>
<dd>Also, Lewis' column is hardly the best source for determining the importance of this statement as part of an article about Lewis. Are there sources commenting on what Lewis said? They would be more relevant. What we have now would arguably be more appropriate for inclusion in the articles on Mahmoud Ahmadi Nejad or the Iranian nuclear programme. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 22:04, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An interesting comparison: from a note to the epilogue of Nikkie Keddie's well-regarded <i>Modern Iran</i>: "Early in his presidency Ahmadinejad made some mystical statements, possibly suggesting that he was an instrument of the Hidden Imam who is to return as the messianic Mahdi. There were effectively opposed by many influential Iranian clerics who stressed that nobody can know the will or time of the return of the Hidden Imam. The statements do not merit the exaggerated reaction of some US commentators who say, based on little and distorted knowledge, that Ahamadinejad will work to bring on an Armageddon - a charge similar to some made by opponents of U.S. evangelical Christian presidents." Clearly, Keddie didn't think much of the ayatollah-armageddon hypothesis. Now, if we had some case of someone of Keddie's stature taking Lewis to task directly over this issue, it might arguably be worth including here. But as it stands I can't see that it is. Even if we had, we would need to think carefully about how relevant one such case could be said to be in the context of an article discussing the entire career of a scholar of extremely high standing. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 22:28, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In a 13 paragraph WSJ op-ed centering on the claim, that the threat of mutual assured destruction might not work with religious extremists, to which nobody of stature objected (or is likely to ever do), Lewis speculated in two paragraphs on the 22nd August date, concluding that it's "<i>far from certain ... but it would be wise to bear the possibility in mind</i>". Afterwards, some papers and blogs made fun of some conservative's ensuing hysteria, and some misrepresented Lewis vague notion as an exact prediction and stern warning.</p>
<p>Shame and attention, if any, belongs to the media. I fail to see how its short time frenzy will be part of Lewis encyclopedic curriculum, ever.

<p>Thank you Pejman47. I have put the citations into "ref" format, though not quite perfectly. As you can see from the headlines, it really did create quite a fuss at the time. No, it's not very academic, and one could argue that the papers are overstating the case (and if we can cite someone credible saying that, we should), but an encyclopaedia should mention non-academic notability also, even for someone whose main notability is in the academy. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 06:37, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have tried to fix the paragraph in the hope it might be acceptable to both sides. Ashley, the point of the article was not to announce the date that Iran would attack Israel. The point of it was to question whether mutual assured destruction can hold firm when dealing with an apocalyptic culture. Lewis then gave an example of the kind of thinking such a culture might engage in. It was not a sensible example to give and he should have foreseen the reaction, or his editors should have, so granted, it was not a smart thing to say. Nevertheless, it was not the point of his argument, and we shouldn't misrepresent it as though it was. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:44, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ALM scientist, can you say exactly what Engdahl says in his book, please? It's not clear how much is from him and how much from you. Does he mention Lewis in the book, for example? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:18, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've just looked up the source, and I've not been able to find any good reviews. ALM scientist, can you refer us to any? It seems very conspiratorial, and it's not clear what the author's credentials are. As the policy says, extraordinary claims require extraordinary sources. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:25, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
