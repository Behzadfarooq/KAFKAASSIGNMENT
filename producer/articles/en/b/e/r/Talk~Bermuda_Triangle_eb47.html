<dd>I agree. I did a mere bullet-statement type of entry in the list of Triangle incidents page.

<dd>Yeah, and some information needs to incorporated from other articles into this one. Such as dates and times for some disappearances. Yes, they often have their own article with this information. That's not the point. It makes for too much inconsistency when you have to go to three or four different sources for shared information on things that basic.

<p>Doesn't the criticism of Charles Berlitz come a little early in the article? Reading through the article until "<b>Kusche's The Bermuda Triangle Mystery—Solved</b>" you finally encounter a criticism to his work, but there's nothing written about Berlitz himself in the article to warrant it. Isn't it an issue of equality? To provide criticism you first have to have something to criticize, you can't expect the reader to automatically know who you're talking about. Shadowrun 19:22, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would think Berlitz, and every other author writing on this subject has opened themselves to criticism. For example, there's the Bimini Wall, which has been cited by Berlitz and others as evidence of Atlantis, and used by Atlanteans as either a road or a pier. The critics claim (and these critics are perfectly right) that there is absolutely no evidence of structures and other associated buildings either underwater or on land that would support such a road or pier. There are plenty of people who have written on this subject and proposed many outlandish theories to explain everything, and at the very least these theories simply do not stand up to the documented hard evidence that was collected by Kusche, the Coast Guard, the Navy, newspapers, etc over the years. And collecting, documenting, and displaying such evidence for this subject should be the mission of those using this website. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 21:55, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Talk%7EBermuda_Triangle_eb47.html" title="Edit section: Criticism of Lawrence Kusche">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism of Lawrence Kusche</span></h2>
<p>He is criticised for "holding to his claim that 'nothing out of the ordinary' regularly occurred in and around the area, and yet several times admitting certain cases lacked conventional rational explanation (most notably in the Star Tiger and DC-3 cases)". Sorry, but the Star Tiger and DC-3 cases are exceptional, not regular events, proving that 'nothing out of the ordinary' <i>does</i> regularly happen. If Kusche had said that nothing out of the ordinary <i>ever</i> occurred, the critic would have a point. Subsequently, I do not think such evidently weak criticism should be in the article</p>
<p>I corresponded with Kusche in 1977 and he emphasised that publishers only want books that will make them money - they often do not care about facts or accuracy. Because Kusche was dedicated to accuracy and objectivity (regardless of whether he made some errors, or of his research's conclusions), his efforts resulted in a book that was "dull", wasn't "sexy" and therefore had a hard time getting published. He was even told by some publishers that they would not publish "a book of knocks", however well researched, because it might harm the sales of a garbage-ridden pro-Triangle book. To sum up: The BT is a mystery, like a 1000 others, drummed up by the greedy and the gullible and perpetuated by people who are too captivated by claptrap or bored stiff with reality to realise that. If the Triangle doesn't exist, somebody would have invented it. And they did! Sorry (again), but I've been a fan of the paranormal for over 30 years and as much as I yearn - even need - to prove something exists that would get up the noses of stuffy, narrow-minded academics and scientists, all I've EVER come across is the foul-smelling stuff you find in cowsheds. <a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikstar_7ffb.html" title="User:Rikstar">Rikstar</a> 18:41, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say you haven't looked obsessively enough. I'm still waiting for scientists to explain the bleeding walls cases of the 1950s, or some of the stuff <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Fort_e08f.html" title="Charles Fort">Fort</a> compiled. As for Kusche, Berlitz used bibliographic references compiled <i>by</i> Kusche (before the latter's <i>—SOLVED</i> came out) for his own material, so go figure. You can read about it on that link at the bottom of the Triangle page. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 01:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Funny, I've been a skeptic, a freethinker, and a scientifically trained mathematician for damn near as long. Why do I get tired of of being thought a "stuffy, narrow-minded academic and scientist" simply because I reject all spiritual belief and all pseudoscience like the Bermuda Triangle &amp; psychic phenomena? How many times have New Agers screamed at me, "You're not open minded!" The Christians only condemn me to burn in hell for all eternity. Life's rough.</p>

<p><i>(moved from top of page)</i></p>
<p>This article can and should stick to the facts. Incidents that have happened, such as Flight 19 and USS Cyclops, should be mentioned briefly with links to their own, main articles. What I think should happen is:</p>
<p>1) a detailed entry as to the documented history of the area, and if this history is no older than the April 1962 issue of American Legion Magazine (the "Lost Patrol" article), so be it.</p>
<p>2) brief-to-detailed mention of each paranormal reason for the disappearances or whatever else is strange, followed by anything that may refute it. If the article in question is a genuine mystery, such as Joshua Slocum or the loss of the crew of the Mary Celeste, then we state it.</p>
<p>3) why basic facts are missing in many of the incidents, as Kusche has pointed out in his book. For example, it is cited in many Triangle books that a plane crash took place in the surf, in front of hundreds of witnesses, at Daytona Beach, Florida in 1937, but not a trace of the plane was found. Since it would be a major story in the local paper it makes sense to check, but in this case the incident never happened.</p>
<p>4) Links to as much source material as possible, up to and including newspapers from the time it happened; official reports, etc. If we need to order official documentaion from places like the Naval Historical Center, then we do that and post it. It costs $10.00 by the way.</p>
<p>5) brief mentions only of selected incidents, and links to main pages for each one. These pages in turn should just stick to the facts, keeping the whole as balanced as possible. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 20:55, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>be my guest, carajou.</dd>
</dl>
<p>1)and 2) we are trying to do that, give us time. it doesn't help that the page is frequently vandalised.</p>
<p>3) That case isn't in the article. "Why basic facts are missing" from books - well you'd have to ask the authors, but I think we can guess.</p>
<p>4)I can't afford to pay for those documents but maybe somebody else can.</p>
<p>5)This is a good idea, there's a separate article for a more complete list.</p>
<p>Please feel free to improve the article in the ways you suggest. be bold! (but don't forget that Kusche made mistakes too...) <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 21:29, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>make the page off-limits to vandals; I will take a few stabs at it; $10.00 is affordable for a Navy report (who needs cigarettes anyway?); yes, Kusche made mistakes, but they weren't a deliberate attempt to blame the area on paranormal spinning compasses operated by two-headed space aliens looking for scrap metal; and I wont ask the other authors, as one of them is dead, and the others have already had their "facts" refuted!

<p>I think that with all the published material out there on supernatural and ufo-related explanations of the Bermuda triangle, these theories deserve to be mentioned, sourced, and explained (and maybe some information about the people who give these theories too), as Wikipedia includes plenty of information on pseudoscience and mythology.

<p>Just to let everyone know: when a magazine, book, or newspaper is written anywhere, the name is always in <i>italics</i>. Any article within a magazine, book, or newspaper, is written inside "quotation" marks. Such an example here would be "A Lady Vanishes," one of the chapters in <i>The Bermuda Triangle</i>, by Adi-Kent Thomas Jeffrey. I've had historians at college tell the class how they look with distain on Wikipedia, and part of the problem is writing and grammar, in addition to some inaccuracies on various pages. To remove this problem we all have to do our utmost to be as professional as possible. I know some would think this is extremely petty, and they'd be right, but we all have to begin somewhere if we want even the least of Wikipedia's pages taken seriously. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 22:22, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Fogg</a>'s bodies were all recovered by the Coast Guard (in the "Other Responses" section). Reading the report closely, three bodies were recovered, the rest missing. And no body was found with a coffee cup. But I'll tell you what...reading that report was sobering. I could imagine the writer of it, deadpan accurate with the boring personality of a tax man, it was that matter-of-fact. A lot of people are dead because they just didn't get trained in handling a certain chemical; they were pretty much lazy in other things, like lifeboat drills. This crew acted like cleaning benzine out of a tank was like cleaning the algae out of a swimming pool...no big deal.

<p>In this section, the article text claims the following:</p>
<p><i>Laboratory experiments carried out in the Monash University in Australia have proven that bubbles can, indeed, sink a scale model ship by decreasing the density of the water [6], though this would leave a smell and does not account why wreckage would not have bobbed to the surface when water density returned.</i></p>
<p>Leave a smell? According to the article on <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methane.html" title="Methane">methane</a>, it is an odorless gas. I think someone confuses it with <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatulence.html" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I find it reasonable that a ship that sinks in a cloud of bubbles may not rise when the cloud clears, since the sudden onrush of water from all sides may fill it with water very quickly.</p>

<dd>On several shows pertaining to the Triangle on the History, Discovery, and SciFi channels videos were shown of such experiments on scale models; and the same thing was accomplished with a full-sized cabin cruiser.

<dd>At one time on my third ship, a destroyer tender named USS Shenandoah, we had flight deck small arms training, and there was this camera viewing the whole thing, with monitors on the bridge, Combat Information Center, Damage Control Central, and the captain's cabin, and what they saw was everyone and their shipmate brothers wanting a crack at a cartoon that I drew, on a target, of the executive officer! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 20:37, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I had to remove the mild reference to the mid-1950s in the intro paragraph, which led the reader to think that disappearences have been going on since that time. It is claimed by Triangle writers that strange things have been going on there since Columbus, which is explained; it is also explained that the stories, <i>and I stress the stories</i>, by Triangle authors date no older than the mid-1950s. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 11:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

My idea for them, and for each one as it comes up, is to have a separate entry within the page titled "Bermuda Triangle connection" which would be a catch-all for the theories and explanations based on the Triangle stories, separate and distinct from the officialy documented evidence.

<p>The reason I put Stars Tiger and Ariel back in was, according to bermudatriangle.org, their losses, in addition to Flight 19, were responsible for creation of the Bermuda Triangle, even though the name itself would not come to print until 1964. And there still is the genuine mystery surrounding the two planes that has yet to be solved. Maybe someone can get a multi-gazzilion dollar expedition to the mid-Atlantic and drag a sidescan sonar along the route? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 22:29, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is probably not worthy of inclusion; it is my opinion only.</p>
<p>Richard Winer's book "The Devil's Triangle" has a type of writing style which left a "haunted" feeling in me...which was why I read it many times when I was a kid. I felt it better written than any other work on the subject (yes, I believed in the traditional Triangle b.s. back then). But in the author's bio, it stated Winer was at work on a book about the USS Cyclops. The first printing of the book was 1974; it is now 2007, 33 years later. No book on the Cyclops. Could it be that he abandoned it becaause the facts that he might have found got in the way of the theories? I myself would have loved to have read it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 23:52, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps he couldn't find a publisher for it. The triangle is a well-known subject, but individual events connected with it aren't really, apart from Flight 19. I also remember Winer's book, in fact I preferred it to Berlitz. Then I started looking deeper than "ooh, that's a good story"... <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 16:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is just to let everyone know that the article as it stands is DONE! The cleanup tag at the top was removed; the Wikiparanormal page was updated; the whole is now very informative, and tightened and tweaked with regard to spelling and grammar. And if one looks at the history page, and overlooks the bad eggs and their vandalizing ways, you will notice there were a lot of people besides me who attempted improvement (I consider someone who comes in and corrects a single mis-spelling to be just as important as one who supplies a whole article). There are good illustrations throughout. And maybe this will bring the grade up from B to A.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there's no more room for improvement. I still feel wee need a bit more detail in history, natural explainations, and popular theories sections of the article. We should also go into some of the links to the famous losses section and work on each article one at a time (I did Cyclops, Flight 19, Marine Sulphur Queen, etc). Always a way to make it better. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 21:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The statement at the top of the article means just that: there are incidents within the Triangle that are just not confirmed by official sources. What we have to rely on is A) those sources that are readily available from the United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, United States Air Force, NOAA; as well as various news agencies, credible witnesses, and the reports from foreign governments should they become available; and B)the various articles and books specifically about the Triangle from the various authors who have believed the popular stories. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 00:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of my own opinion, I do not believe the Triangle is this paranormal place that caused a lot of problems, which is why I chose the "both sides" route for this page, i.e. briefly list what is written in the Triangle tales and provide anything official which may dispute it. Some incidents are obviously unsolved, and such incidents should still be listed as a question mark. An example is <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Cyclops_1b9b.html" title="USS Cyclops">USS Cyclops</a>, and if one follows the link to its page, they are left with the impression that a) the ship was lost in a storm, or b) the ship was handed over to the Germans, or c) the ship was torpedoed, and all three are based on checks of reliable sources. At no time is there an impression that a space alien took it. Some incidents never happened, so the reader is left with an option that he/she can go to a source listed on the page, or can research a lost vessel through an archived newspaper to see if it actally happened. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 00:51, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is for the individual who made the latest entry in "natural explanations"... If you're going to post something you saw on TV and suddenly post it here, you're going to do several things:</p>
<p>1) You're going to write better English. I didn't work on this article for this long in the way it is now for someone else to place in it something that's written on a 4th grade level.</p>
<p>2) You're going to cite the source exactly. You saw it on TV? What program? What copyright date? Who produced it? And what exactly was the subject you saw? I got a pretty good idea as to which show it was ("Dive the Bermuda Triangle", on A&amp;E), because I knew it was on just a few hours ago...which means he ran to the computer as soon as it was over.</p>
<p>3) The Flight 19 page details what was found in the waters off Florida; there's no need to detail it here, however amateurishly. And what was written just didn't fit in this article in the spot where it was placed. Even your entry on methane bubbles made no sense at all.</p>

<p>I looked at the history page, and there seems to be a few people who's sole purpose is to get into articles and damage them, and it's so nice to see that little padlock at the top of the page. Perhaps it's because there's a lot more people who care about the integrity of what's in Wikipedia then those who don't. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 19:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone did a nice little correction/add-on to the "Atlantis" part of the Popular Theories section. While I don't necessarily object, if they are going to state that a Dr. Greg Little uncovered evidence of Atlantis at Bimini, they are going to write down the FACT that Dr. Little has a well-established connection to Edgar Cayce and the Association of Research and Enlightenment in Virginia Beach, Virginia. And it took me less than thirty seconds to run his name through the Yahoo search engine and establish that connection.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 00:40, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The scientific method demands not only observation, but experimentation to check the results of a hypothesis. Professional archaeologists have been on the Bimini Road site since 1968. How is it that an individual who is connected with a <i>psychic</i> research facility is able to find what an archaeologist couldn't? How is that when this man claims he's finding evidence underwater, at no time did a professional archaeologist of any kind find a support structure on land? Those questions demand answers, and those answers simply cannot come from a bunch of psychics or anyone connected with them. 72.150.123.48 23:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 23:41, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word FOUNDER is an old word meant to describe one specific act: that of a sinking ship. Some may also use it to describe what they discover in their underwear drawer after having an emotional upheaval some months before while describing the same object they have lost.</p>

<p>On this entry, I stated that according to the Triangle writers, there were two distinct crash sites, separated by 170 miles of water. According to Kusche, the second crash site was eventually ruled to be unrelated debris or seaweed (it's been a while since I read his book). The only references I found online were three newspaper articles, and I posted them on the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda_Triangle_source_page_6927.html" title="Bermuda Triangle source page">Bermuda Triangle source page</a>. They were written only a few days apart, and together they would support the two-crash site theory.

<p>I added some new information regarding the first accounts of a Bermuda Triangle. E.V.W. Jones wrote an article for the Associated Press in September 1950; George X. Sand wrote one for <i>Fate</i> Magazine in October 1952. Sand was the first to hint at a triangle (Gaddis was still the first to state "Bermuda Triangle").

<dd>I believe the tag was added because there are those people who "dispute" the official, documented source on a given incident, prefering instead the traditional, "hooey" version.

<dd>The change in the article was justified due to the fact that previous editors had wanted a traditional slant that agreed with the "hooey". Like it or not, the reader is now faced with links to official Coast Guard and Navy reports, newspapers, photographs; as well as the original Columbus log entries Triangle writers seem to cite but never quote; the original article in Argosy Magazine by Vincent Gaddis which was the first mention of Bermuda Triangle and whose entries have been contradicted by official sources...the list goes on.

<dd>If you'd bothered to have read the material, you'd have realized that Quasar has gone over more than 10,000 case files on the Triangle, including the fact that "Missing Aircraft" is not a reference that exists, but rather Overdue...humorous, in that that could be for any number of reasons, and therefore mixes the mundanes in with the utterly bizarre. Likewise, he also mentions at about point #3 or so (might be off on that) that no comprehensive study of the Triangle has ever been done...though frankly, if it was, I'd expect the results to be reminiscent of the Condon Report on UFOs, where the "Pro-UFO People" were kicked out by the "Anti's," and the notion of the subject then thoroughly attacked. Point being: if any study were actually done, I doubt it would be unbiased...which actually means you're right: purely scientific study hasn't been done.

<p>First and foremost, the day I started editing this page there was very little to no documentation or evidence for many of these incidents; in fact, this article was dedicated to the "paranormal" "hoodoo" "mysterious everything" that the Triangle has been popularly known by over the years. In deference to Chr.K., I have also studied this area; I have sailed through this area; I have read the numerous Triangle books that have been published, and frankly most of the incidents contained within do not stand up to the actual documentation of each case. They don't even stand up to visual observation. Show me the clown who claimed Columbus saw freaky lights, and I'll pull out Columbus' actual logbooks to show what he really said (I did that here). Show me the clown who stated a body was found in a sunken ship with a coffee cup in his hand, and I'll pull out the official Coast Guard report (I did that too). It is claimed <i>Raifuku Maru</i> was a Triangle victim; how come the individual who included that article never bothered to pull out and post the newspaper which stated otherwise? I did. It's easy to do. The Coast Guard even documented the facts of a poorly-maintained ship that didn't survive going through a storm, but I would think that those who like the "popular" version would rather have the thing just sail into the unknown, and leave it at that. There's always someone who just can't stand the facts to get in the way of a good story.</p>
<p>Second, just looking at the layout of the page as of an hour ago disgusted me. If you're going to edit something, then do so; don't trash the layout of the page. I want this page to be a featured article. What that means is there will be facts, and only facts, and whatever is written into each heading and subheading is going to be well-written. It's going to be documented and sourced; if there's nothing official backing up what you've just added, don't even bother putting it in.</p>

<dd>Please explain to me the disappearance of the B-52 Stratofortress <i>Pogo 22</i>. I would like an explanation, likewise, of Flight 441's disappearance, one that was carrying no less than <i>111</i> life vests, and 46 exposure suits, along with a very floatable 660 paper cups. The disappearance of the pleasure yacht <i>Witchcraft</i>, which disappeared in the course of 19 minutes, left no trace whatsoever, as was searched for for over a hundred nautical miles out, would also be very appreciated...though, please, no imbecilic explanations of "downed in a storm" or drug trafficking gone bad (or God knows what else), just something actually believable. How about the two C-133 Cargomasters, gone in 1963? The C-119 Boxcar, 1965? The C-119 actually vanished straight off the radar scope, on a single pass; seriously. Explain to me Peter Jensen's vanishing on February 11, 1980, an example <i><b>so</b></i> bizarre that I'll make sure to make a page for it directly, where he was heard 11 hours <i>after fuel starvation</i> (and after already being heard, earlier, 1,000 miles away from where he could be to begin with) asking for permission to land, at a place he (or rather, the call numbers that corresponded to his plane) could never have realistically have reached to begin with? These are some interesting subjects...and usually brushed off by the pseudo-skeptics...like yourself, I suppose. The "freaky lights" of Columbus, incidentally, were seen back around the Canary Islands, long before the Triangle region...you can find that in the logbook, btw, when looked for...it was the erratic compass readings that took place over on this side of the Atlantic. And, if this material as written for your perusal is not written in such a way as to bring you any degree of satisfaction, or in fact brings implicit in your mind the notion that I in fact write as though I'm someone who either reads, or even admires, a volume such as <i>Dick and Jane</i>, then please let it be asserted here and now that in no way have I ever wished for this outcome, and in no way wish you any ill-will simply because of what seems to be a personal attack of some kind on a site well-known for frowning on such activities. Possibly overly-long, there...but then again, perhaps it might be useful to create a 106-word sentence there, for comparisons to <i>Dick and Jane</i>, eh? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 05:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The "freaky lights" you mentioned as being seen by Columbus around the Canary Islands long before his landing I would accept, but not for this article. The reason for it is two: first, the Triangle authors (that's the people who wrote the Triangle books) stated that Columbus saw these "freaky lights" just days before his landing on San Salvador (see the prologue in Richard Winer's book <i>The Devil's Triangle</i>). That brings up the second reason, which is to cite the Columbus log book entries for this incident in <i>the days before the landing</i>. And if the Canary Island lights are cited, wouldn't that again be proof that these lights occured elsewhere, and not as the Triangle authors have stated? It's called proof of fact, Chr.K. Wouldn't you agree that this article and this subject benefits from facts? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 14:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Facts I love: implication that the Triangle (a name I'm coming to hate, incidentally, or at least find annoying, as the Western North Atlantic Region is vastly more factual) is nothing more than "fanciful fiction" is pure POV, plain and simple. You <i><b>cannot</b></i> make that claim: enough people <i>have</i> "lived to tell the tale" of electronic fogs or ships literally invisible with a rope stretched taut into nothingness (<i>that</i> was a strange one, I'll find it for you soon) on programs ranging from Discovery Channel to Unsolved Mysteries (though the latter's episode was rather poor, and rehashing several openly-admitted large fallacies) that you'd basically be accusing thousands of people of all making it up without any knowledge of the frankness, or the quietness (which should be obvious, eh?) of their testimony. Those people sometimes do exist: bermuda-triangle.org itself has exhibited one who claims to have been massively involved in "the Flight 19 drama" (and he coming out on the massive debunking side) and had <i>nothing</i> to do with it, at all. These people do exist. But the unassuming, I Don't Want To Be Another Statistic, individuals exist too. The statement at the beginning (which was, so far as I could tell, the only revision of note that I did, and certainly not of the <i>Dick and Jane</i> variety)...is wrong, period, because it is SUGGESTIVE. Yes...a lot of them are mundane; others are NOT. The military searched 250,000 square miles for <i>Pogo 22</i>...and in a tactical nuclear simulation exercise, no less; I wouldn't be mentioning it if the end result wasn't obvious. <i>Witchcraft</i>...I already mentioned several statistics on. You want the official records on them? I have no doubts they exist...but as mentioned before, the authorities in question have been historically recalcitrant to obsecene levels on it; I suppose they feel it gives them a bad name, to have ships and planes "just go poof" (that is the more rare kind, but has happened easily more than five times under similar circumstances, which moves beyond coincidence)...as such, they have no list of Missing Vessels; Overdue is the term...for freakin' 50 years or something, and quietly adding "presumed lost at sea" to it, keeping it very quiet. It's annoying: if it were up to me? I would give nothing BUT the official transcripts: the Frederick Valentich UFO disappearance is on Wikisource right now because of that mindset. Show me where one finds notoriously hard-to-uncover transcripts (and if I simply have trouble doing it, and it's actually easy, I'll be the first to admit it), and I'll copy entire sections to Wikisource (and by extension accessable to Wikipedia) verbatim, if necessary. That said, I'll tell you right now I won't be "explaining" anything accept the facts as I am also able to cull them on what is known: the tale of the vanishing Cargomasters is as bizarre to me as anyone, and anyone wanting to shout "It's little GREEN MENNNN, lolllllllll...." would be in danger of me threatening to track them down myself, and sue them for birsmirching the human race itself, and that only if in a good mood. What I will do is draw up the cases individually, for their own unexplained disappearance pages, and have the weight of them stand up to the <i>ridiculously stupid</i> affirmation that "overwhelming evidence" shows it to be "made up." Martin Caidin, one of the most respected authors in any technical field in history, culled stories of the place: this information can be found, incidentally, in <i>Ghosts of the Air</i>, an excellent work (which we'll no doubt need to cite alot); a lot of people, in fact, were uncertain what to make of Caidin's "Triangle" stories, because to doubt he meant exactly what he said would be lunacy. In any case: what I wrote, that many ARE unexplained, IS true: they are. Period. You just are willing to warp the page toward POV until I prove otherwise, eh?

On a brief side note, it was you who first used the phrase "freaky lights" regarding Columbus, there, and I was copying your term, per your tastes; "anomalous" would've been much more effective.

<dd>On another side note, but of a technical nature: placing a main article, if there is one, underneath a reference is a practice I learned from <i>Wikiproject Formula One</i>, the most amazingly detailed project I've ever seen; they do it on the featured Formula One article, when alluding to Formula One history: "See main article, History of Formula One." Your removing a similar practice to be developed for Wikiproject Paranormal thus makes no sense to me, as if a more detailed summary of a given event is available, one should automatically link to it in a prominent fashion; I would do the same as I did with NC16002 with each such case, blown out of proportion or not, if the pages existed. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 16:19, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed it because it is me forcing rules on everyone else. That cannot happen.</p>
<p>But I do insist on some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an incident is included in this article as a Triangle victim, it has to include documentation to either back it up or refute it. There are too many incidents right now that have never happened at all.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If there is a story within the Triangle books and no where else, then that fact has to be admitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>How's that? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 16:48, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>We certainly can't leave out a well-known triangle-victim just because there's no official reference to it; people reading the article will expect it. If the paperbacks are the only source, say that. If they conflict with anything official, say that as well. The point is that it's not for Wikipedia to say whether there's a Bermuda Triangle or not - rather it has to say what other people say about it. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 17:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is true, hence the small disclaimer about such-and-such being in a Triangle book and no other...like the minor ref to the single captain being onboard the <i>V.A. Fogg</i> with his coffee cup. That alone was mentioned in one book (the one by Spencer), refuted in another book (the one by Winer), and refuted decisively by the Coast Guard (in its report). These books are full of what Wikipedia calls POV; so it's going to be a <i>he said/she said</i> subject for the most part. So balance on this subject demands the Triangle point of view (the stories) vs. the documentation. This is for the reader of the article; he needs to see that particular incidents are factual, or relegated to just the Triangle stories.</dd>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to checking the facts out, I think on this subject we have to. An example of someone well known would be jocky Al Snyder, who according to the stories vanished in 1948 after riding Citation to the Triple Crown. I wanted to know if A) Snyder was a real person; B), did he in fact disappear as the stories state; and C), did he ride Citation and win the Triple Crown? The first two were borne out as fact, while the third wasn't true at all (he rode Citation, but not in any Triple Crown event)...so it would seam that one Triangle writer (Winer) was guilty of making up his own stuff just to make an incident more dramatic.</dd>

<p>I put a little back into it.

<p>Some of these "possible explanations" for incidents, inferring that they are not what they in fact are, unexplained, are really reaching: how can the circumstances surrounding <i>Star Dust</i> going down "because of possibly not paying attention their instruments" be a conceivable clue to the disappearance of two aircraft under quite different conditions? Was <i>Star Dust</i> in regular communication with a base or airport within minutes of its disappearance, as <i>Tiger</i> and <i>Ariel</i> were? On that sub-section, there is more written about <i>Dust</i> than there is about the Atlantic disappearances. The inference that the reports did not report magnetic problems overlooks the fact that this very lack of focus by the inquiry has seen none-too-little criticism down through the years (most recently by Quasar, who brought my attention to it); the compasses DID go out: obviously on Taylor's, on Powers' as well given the nature of their recorded conversations, and likely on the other pilots' aircaft, since they never reached much consensus on which way was east, either. The batteries on NC16002 <i>were</i> low, but were being <i>recharged during the flight</i> by the plane's generators, unless Linquist didn't do what he said he would. For all the straightforward exposing of the hoax-disappearances (and incidentally, I am all for it), the article seems to be becoming unwilling to state a given case as "cold case unknowns." --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 01:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On <i>Star Dust</i>, that was my call. I added it for comparison purposes: all three planes were in the service of the same company; they all disappeared more-or-less at the same time; and each disappearence was complete, until <i>Star Dust</i> was found in the Andes just a few years ago. <i>Star Dust's</i> accident has human error all over it; someone on the plane or on the ground just wasn't paying attention to detail. It was either <i>Ariel</i> or <i>Tiger</i> that was reported flying just 2,000 feet above the sea, leaving no room for recovery should an accident happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Civil Air Board in it's report cited a number of things with the DC3, but it ended with the obvious fact that determination of the cause of the accident cannot be determined due to a lack of wreckage. So, there's going to be speculation by us, by the official documentation, by the Triangle writers, and since it's still part of the Triangle's history, I think it should be written as such..letting the reader reach his/her own conclusion.</dd>

<dd>The numerous attempts to explain why <i>Star Tiger</i> would've gone down at all was mentioned in the reports (shown in the main article) as being highly questionable no matter which one was suggested; that alone is of note to me, that completely rational and knowledgable men couldn't figure out how it could be lost so suddenly. And on top of that, <i>Star Ariel</i> was at a reported 18,000 ft. instead of 2,000 at time of final transmission: if we're going to mention the one, shouldn't the other be present as well? Likewise, some have indicated 2,000 ft., avoiding the strong headwinds, as further reason why there <i>shouldn't</i> have been a problem, rather than a contributing factor to cause. Also, be aware of something...several of the events you've successfully shown to be hoaxes I had never even heard of to begin with...hence my anger at claims of "the entire affair being bogus"...I would seriously enjoy your help on <i>Pogo 22</i> and the others I've mentioned, finding any and all information on them: if it can be shown without reaching into implausability (human error wouldn't keep floatable items from drifting in the hours after, during S&amp;R) that their vanishing was not that mysterious...fine.

<dd>I believe there are several "cold case unknowns" here: Joshua Slocum and the <i>Spray</i>; <i>Marie Celeste</i>. What I believe I tried to do with this page was to show two versions: the Triangle version and the documented/actual version, and hopefully regardless of what I personally believe, both versions cana and should be written here. In the case where we cannot find source material on a given incident, we should at at least admit it as such...for example, so-and-so was an incident reported in Winer's book, book not verified by newspaper search, etc.
<dl>
<dd><i>Mary Celeste</i> was not a Western North Atlantic incident, as you already know. As for the fake versions, I myself see no use in putting these up, save as to what specific authors...and they in turn identified, errors and all...erroneously claimed.</dd>
<dd>There should be three sections: verifiable (official reports found) hoaxes, verifiable (same method) unexplained disappearances, and not-yet substantiated stories.

<p>The order of the events should be chronologically presented, oldest to newest. Putting Flight 19 first puts undue emphasis on an incident that, while extremely mysterious (how could the compasses have pointed west as being almost due NORTH, per the directional fix by Fort Lauderdale that evening??), seems to have acquired equivalency to Roswell, per the latter's "litmus test for UFOs" position in the modern anomalistical psyche. Also, the NC16002 main article should be under the DC-3 sub-section, since the others have their own. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 03:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A lot of the Triangle writers simply sit at their desks and re-hash what a previous writer had already said. They have also invented quite a bit to make the story sound scarier, more dramatic, whatever. So, admitedly I had my doubts about <i>Pogo 22</i>, the B-52 bomber lost in the Triangle back in 1961. What had to be done first was to establish the fact of the story; prove the plane was real, prove the plane disappeared without a trace, prove the men on it existed, stuff like that, and it had to be done in a way that would avoid the Triangle books...except to give us an idea as to dates.

<dd>I left it on your talk page because this should have been discussed amicably between us; however I note some sarcasm in your response, as well as questioning a link (see below) when the answer is obvious. So my question to you is: do you have every intention of changing this article to reflect only what was written in the Triangle books by removing any established facts which might refute it? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 19:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The reason why the dictionary was linked wasn't obvious to me. And that's why I asked. The link is related to the subject of the article only secondarily -- the article is about a oceanic region, not any ships. More than only US Naval craft have met their demise in this region, and the link isn't to a reference for any specific ship. Per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, it's a bit of a stretch to include it here, though it certainly could be relevant. So, I asked. It's unfortunate that you've decided that my asking was a sign of hostility.</dd>
<dd>If you want to move the discussion to my talk page, that's fine by me. I thought you might have wanted to have the conversation here as that allows more people to find the conversation and participate. On my talk page, you asked me to find some administrators and explain the situation to them, and I also think that more naturally happens here.</dd>
<dd>I haven't read any of the books except for one, almost three decades ago; I'm sure I couldn't recall the title or the author. As such, your question about my intention is completely unfounded. My interest is in trying to assure that Wikipedia dosn't inappropriately use material that's protected by copyright. It's an issue I'm personally passionate about, and a very grave one as Wikipedia content can be (and is!) freely replicated all over the internet. Integrating content into an article, even uploading it into the site, can cause it to be copied again and again, far and wide, making a nightmare for those who own the rights to the violated material.</dd>
<dd>Rather than jumping to conclusions about my intent when I ask an honest question, or looking for sarcasm until you're sure you've found it, I'd thank you to assume good faith in our next steps. It'll make matters easier for the both of us. Please let me know how (and where!) you'd like to proceed. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 20:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I put the article up for review with the paranormal page some time ago, but I don't think anyone reviewed it. As it stands I don't think it's complete; some subheadings could use a little more detail; the writing could be smoother and more polished in places.

<pre>
  I think we should send a psychic out to the Bermuda Triangle.  
</pre>
<p>Maybe we should send a willing psychic out there who doesn't fear the paranormal, because, who knows, it might actually be the "Devil's Triangle". Or, maybe, it is the lost city of Atlantis, or a time warp, or even a way to the parallel universe that scientists are looking for. Why can't we just do that, the person doesn't have to be God-fearing, but maybe a person like that will help us figure out what is going on! We need to know what is happening. I don't fear dissapearing into an unknown area, because, unlike some people in America, I don't fear the unknown! <a href="../../../a/y/l/User%7EAylaRosier_7b2f.html" title="User:AylaRosier">AylaRosier</a></p>

<dd>Atlantis was supposed to be a sub-continent, not just a city; as for sending a psychic, that wouldn't really be the responsibility of an encyclopedia, which merely reports on what has thus far happened, not goes out and finds out for itself...at least, not wholly serparate from members doing it individually, then the papers and science journals reporting on it for WP to reference, anyway. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChr.K._7208.html" title="User:Chr.K.">Chr.K.</a> 10:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, this article needs to be a FEATURED ARTICLE, with that little barnstar in the upper-right corner, so I think there's more that can be done. So, here's some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since this article is about the Bermuda Triangle, the various books on the subject should be treated as primary sources and placed in first position in all subheadings. If one has any of these books, like the Berlitz version, cite it where needed.</li>
<li>A rebuke should follow in second position, and that includes anything which clearly contradicts what the Triangle writers have said, like the newspapers I cited. If there is no separate article on an incident, such as the KC-135 takers, we should go into detail here about it.</li>
<li>If there is a genuine mystery with any given incident (like the <i>Witchcraft</i>), say so. If the incident in question is found only within the Triangle books and no where else, say so. If the Coast Guard has admitted such, say so.</li>
<li>Go into as much detail as you can on any subheading...here's what the Triangle says...here's what the facts say...something like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I'm sure someone has a better idea. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 00:09, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We're not near featured-article status yet, as a large number of the reports have not yet been "digested" with the original source material, as you've said before. Likewise, several WP:Paranormal writers have shared my criticism of the article being biased-POV toward skepticism of the disappearances, which ARE strange . Whether liked or not, there ARE strange events in the region...and point blank, as my own assertion, the military and Coast Guard claims of the region being just as safe as any other can't be trusted not to lie about it, if they lie with ease on other things so blatantly. In any case...a lot more work before any FA talk.

<p>I don't like the recent news on TV or the papers about Wikipedia's image. I don't need to repeat what happened, but it does ulimately reflect on us, the average editor, as to content in any given article. In this particlar article some of you are mad at me because I have insisted on sticking to the facts and insisting on documentation. I think the problem is partially my fault because it alters the Wikipedia policy of neutrality; it makes it lean toward one side at the expense of the other.</p>
<p>But the point is I want this article to be the best it can be, where there's just no questioning its credibility. I want the average student who is doing a research paper on the Triangle confident that he can use this article as a well-written source. It means also that I have to swallow some pride here, drop my own personal beliefs in the subject (I don't believe in it, by the way!), and make it better.

<dd>The problem is that if someone loses their credibility, then anything they say will be tainted. Even if they cite their edits, someone could say it's a selective citation. Ultimately, they would have to leave off editing.

<p>I went through Proquest's newspapers again, looking for the oldest <b>newspaper</b> report on a missing aircraft, ship, whatever, and the incident in question had to have the words "Bermuda Triangle" as part of the story. The search was limited to the New York Times (not much of a choice with Proquest...I would like to see many others), and the search was limited between the dates 01/01/1960 to 01/01/1975. All that came up were advertizements for vacations on Bermuda, as well as the Berlitz book being on the New York Times best seller list for the end of November, 1974. No incidents at all. None. Nada.</p>
<p>That means the oldest newspaper account in which the writer uses the words "Bermuda Triangle" to describe a disappearance has to be the SS <i>Sylvia L. Ossa</i>, which went down south of Bermuda in 1976. I put up references on both the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda_Triangle_source_page_6927.html" title="Bermuda Triangle source page">Bermuda Triangle source page</a> and <a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_Marine_Sulphur_Queen_aab3.html" title="SS Marine Sulphur Queen">SS Marine Sulphur Queen</a>, as they were sister ships. But again, that is limited to dates I entered while searching through the New York Times alone.</p>
<p>The point of all that is I want to see references to the oldest Triangle writings. We have Gaddis listed here; we have George X. Sand referenced, and a few others who have made their marks in magazines. I thought it would be interesting to have the reader see the oldest use of a newspaper entry with the Triangle title directly related to a disappearence.
