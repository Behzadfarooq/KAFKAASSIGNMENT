<p>I have amended the Jam &amp; Jerusalem with the addition of the line:</p>
<p>Some have suggested that the show is based on the actual village of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chagford.html" title="Chagford">Chagford</a> where Jennifer Saunders has a home.</p>
<p>Twice now you have deleted this with the note that it needs referencing. What reference do you need? I am a resident of Chagford and know that Jennifer Saunders owns a house on the edge of the village. And as a resident have been part of the village discussions that 'suggests' the sitcom is based on Chagford.</p>
<p><br />
Below are some link to site showing that JS has a house in Chagford</p>

<p>Hi Berks105. I just wanted to drop you a note of thanks. The first thanks is for being a part of creating pages for both the Joan Hickson and the Geraldine McEwan Miss Marple series. The BIGGER thanks is for being so thorough in changing the links for the actors that were in each series. I know that it was a big job, partly becasue I connected some of these actors to the original Marple page when I was checking and fixing their filmographies before these new pages were started. It is the finest of wikipedia editors that realize the ramifications of their work and the need to check all of the areas that their editing effects. So thanks again. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 01:17, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am trying to gather a small group of people to improve the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastbourne.html" title="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a> article and writing to you as you have edited that page recently. I have set up a <a href="../../../e/a/s/Talk%7EEastbourne_d394.html#Eastbourne_Article_Tidy" title="Talk:Eastbourne"><i>what needs to be done</i></a> section on the talk page, and I am hoping that I will get a few people to start a discussion. It would be wonderful if you could spare a few minutes just to look at the current Eastbourne article and give your opinion. It would be even more wonderful if you could join in with this small project as well.

<p>User 68.82.82.248 -we discussed them already, they vandalised Madonna, Jennifer Saunders etc.- got a blatant warning on Sep. 30 and keep vandalising pages. They vandalised Janet Jackson yesterday and today again. They already got a Blatantvandal warning -way back on Sep. 30- and they got a new one yesterday. I invite you to report them -even though they did not vandalise your articles recently-(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism)" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism)" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> as no action is being taken against them.

<li>The request was made in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_List_of_Television_Episodes/to-do&amp;diff=104300262&amp;oldid=103193555" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_List_of_Television_Episodes/to-do&amp;diff=104300262&amp;oldid=103193555" rel="nofollow">edit</a>. As for the capitalization, I used the standard method that would appear in a TV Guide or similar television listing. Title screens for the show generally cannot be trusted because the show takes artistic licence. In fact, I copy and pasted all the episode titles from TV.com. Have you read the guidelines at <a href="../../../l/o/e/WP%7ELOE_88f8.html" title="WP:LOE">WP:LOE</a>? I still have a problem with the summaries being at 90%, they should be at 100%, it is the main body of text, it should not be de-emphasized. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 19:50, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although you made the text size in some part of the article 100%, the summaries are still 90%. The letters are smaller than those of the episode titles. <a href="../../../l/o/e/WP%7ELOE_88f8.html" title="WP:LOE">WP:LOE</a> guidelines were made by consensus. You should probably raise questions there about any reasonings, you may be acting alone. The guidelines aren't new and being sneaked in, they are older than this episode list. Although TV.com or IMDb.com aren't reliable sources, they do use correct capitalization. Please use the project talk page to ask questions, that way you know it's not just me trying to force you into a personal preference but that there is currently an agreement. If you wish to discuss changes to the format it should be done there. The purpose of the project is to have a standard for all articles within the scope of the project, which does include <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_My_Family_episodes_cb23.html" title="List of My Family episodes">List of My Family episodes</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay32183_af22.html" title="User:Jay32183">Jay32183</a> 19:43, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although there was no new MP for Southgate until the 1964 general election, Beverley Baxter had died several months before (at the end of April 1964), so he didn't quite make it to the dissolution. Normally when I've been writing these succession boxes I have been linking to the general election or byelection article but in this specific case there was no byelection and the general election seemed inappropriate. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 16:44, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

(This is idiotic to say the least.) So your reverting my edits was also unjustified and irrational, in that you weren't supporting any fixed rules, but merely your own personal opinion. <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELaddiebuck_9cc3.html" title="User:Laddiebuck">laddiebuck</a> 19:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Berks. I noticed that you have been editing articles to change date format to your preferred style. This is quite unnecessary and looking at your contribs, it is starting to look disruptive. Please click on <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">Special:Preferences</a>, then click on the tab "date and time", select the British format, then click the "save" button and all dates will appear in your preferred style.

<dd>In response to your message, as I said above, please set your account preferences correctly and this will not be an issue for you. It is unnecessary to edit articles purely to change the dates. I could understand if you were making these changes while making other edits but editing purely to play with dates when you can just set your date preferences in you account setting so they all always appear as you prefer is not necessary and frequently starts edit wars. <b><a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarah_9956.html" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a></b> 12:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please, you're being ridiculous and you even contradict yourself. As for who has started and <i>continued</i>, I might add, an edit war, well, I'm afraid that is a matter of perspective. Additionally, I find your screaming edit summary of "NO" entirely inappropriate. You have absolutely no business screaming "NO" at other editors and it is precisely that sort attitude that starts and continues edit wars. You don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> these articles and I strongly advise to cut your attitude out right now and move on to something else. Screaming "NO" at any editor, whether they be an anon or an administrator is not aceptable.

<dd>I recommend that both of you <b>stop</b> renaming the article about Dorothea Sarah Florence Alexandra, Lady Phillips.</dd>
<dd>These actions are interfering with your common goal: To get the best article on Lady Phillips possible.</dd>
<dd>Until active editting has stopped, treat the name of the article as a placeholder. After active editting has stopped, we can rename it if necessary.</dd>

<p>I just thought you should know I have started an incident report over the recent edit wars you have had with Paul venter. I am officially neutral over the matter and am finding no one at fault and no one in the wrong, but the entire matter needs to cease.

<dd>To be honest do what you like. I have reverted the two articles, to how they look best and to fit in with MofS. Paul Venter doesn't like anyone meddling with his articles, he thinks he owns them. Anyway, as you can see from my user page, I had left Wikipedia, and will therefore leave this. It is petty arguments like this, with people who fail to listen to anyone, that made me leave in the first place. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 10:53, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
