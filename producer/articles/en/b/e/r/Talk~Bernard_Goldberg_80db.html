<p>Is there any particular reason for including the <i>Daily Show</i> appearance? It seems like a rather unimportant sidenote, lacking any real significance to the man or the book.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see no reason not to include it. When a public figure gets publically embarassed by his own hypocrisy, that's notable. 68.47.175.214 23:31, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That seems to be a rather tenuous justification. For one, the information contained in the article does not indicate that Goldberg is a hypocrite; rather it indicates that he is somewhat sloppy in his argumentation and analysis of his chosen issue, but that is hardly noteworthy. This is especially so considering that the criticism comes from a fake-news program. While the <i>Daily Show</i> does have many merits and virtues, in-depth critical analysis is not one of them. But in the end I suppose it comes down to a rather simple question: in a year will anyone care that Goldberg even appeared on the <i>Daily Show</i>, much less what happened there? <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThought_b324.html" title="User:Thought">Thought</a> 02:36, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, the Daily Show cuts through the BS and political correctness of politicians and pundits like Bernard Goldberg a heck of a lot better than any "news" network. Second of all, you're completely missing the point. The point Stewart was making (that you obviously chose to ignore), was that it was highly hypocritical of Goldberg to write a book blaming the ills of America on people who don't have any power in Washington, while giving George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Karl Rove, Richard Perle and their ilk, a free pass. Stewart nailed Goldberg on this hypocrisy, and that's why it's worth mentioning.Ericster08 06:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it really necessary to include in <b>every</b> article about liberalism critics, the standard rebuttal that liberals think it is not <b>they</b> who are biased but really the <b>conservatives</b>?

<p>"Some have criticized Goldberg for his biases though. In "100 People Who Are Screwing Up America", Goldberg ranks President Jimmy Carter (number 6) above the Unknown American Terrorist (number 23). The book is an attack on liberals for the most part."</p>

<p>It's an interesting concept, the guy works for CBS, publishes books, is regarded as some sort of expert on Fox. Yet he can't get his message out.

<p>There's a mini-revert war going on with the first sentence, between those who want to list Goldberg as a conservative and those who don't. The most recent edit, by Irwing, simply says "(this <i>(i.e., his conservatism)</i> was not confirmed)." I'm not certain how one would "confirm" someone's conservatism, but I think Goldberg's conservatism is obvious on its face. Since his spat with CBS, he's literally made a career out of attacking liberals. He may claim to balance, but his latest book attacks liberals at a far greater rate than the few "safe" conservative targets he lists. (He lists <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> high, for e.g., but doesn't choose to mention <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_DeLay_86e9.html" title="Tom DeLay">Tom DeLay</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Cunningham_782e.html" title="Duke Cunningham">Duke Cunningham</a>, or <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Schmidt_af94.html" title="Jean Schmidt">Jean Schmidt</a>.

<dd>Well, sorry that I didn't explain my revert, but it referred to previously revert of the same word done by BigDoginTallGrass which included also some source. Back to my "not confirmed" note - I wonder how can someone imply that man is conservative simply from the fact, that he's criticizing liberals (and vice-versa, of course, but that is not this situation). This is not about the balance - even if all people he's attacking were liberals, only this fact wouldn't make him a conservative. That's why I think you should source such statement based on his opinions, not from what he is doing. Irwing 14:15, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Does it matter? Conservative and Liberal are poorly defined terms, especially in the US. Goldberg considers himself to be a JFK liberal. There's been quite a few prominant conservatives in the GOP (including Reagan, Sen Phil Gramm) who also were Democrats in those days, they often argue that it was the party who changed, not them. So it's possible to simultaneously be a liberal in an old-fashioned sense, and a conservative in the present sense. --Asm71 15:27, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Bozell article cited is written as a mock-jealous swipe at Goldberg's opportunism, and <b>does not literally contain the criticisms stated above</b>.</li>

<dd>I've been at Wikipedia now, for over 5 years. This kind of thing goes on quite a bit.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "NPOV" policy is broken, because enforcement depends of "good faith" contributions. There is not, however, any effective mechanism for distinguishish between good faith and bad faith.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The result is that if 'enough' contributors band together they can 'own' the page and suppress any attempts to make the text conform to stated policy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It ought to be possible to make an immediate appeal to an editorial board, who would extract the disputed text pending resolution. But Wikipedia is geared toward anonymous amateurs and has <b>by design</b> no editorial board. This is the problem that old-timer <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_Sanger_6200.html" title="User:Larry Sanger">User:Larry Sanger</a> tried to address, and which I have also tried to address. In fact, I'm "on probation" because I mistakenly thought the arbitration committee would (or could) serve as an editorial board, but they just said that my attempts to preserve neutrality were "tendentious" and "POV-pushing". Ironically, each edit cited as evidence for this was precisely the opposite: I was removing unsoureced 'original research' assertions and adding contrary "well-sourced" assertions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To the extent that a "Liberal point of view" has become the "consensus" of Wikipedia, its reputation will suffer. I suggest that Wikipedia <b>actually</b> have a policy of scrupulous neutrality on every matter of significant public controversy. Not that a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth.html" title="Flat earth">flat earth</a> has any considerable following of course - that view just gets a single, isolated entry. But on something like <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, which Ellen Goodman of the <i>Boston Globe</i> says US registered voters are split 50-50, I'd expect Wikipedia to tread lightly. At least, they should not endorse the US Liberal POV that the science is settled or that there is a scientific consensus. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 18:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The misquotation which I took to Talk was done by a user who professes counterintent to WP policy and blanked his User:Talk page to hide my notes (look up his User page history and User:Talk history)</li>

<p>I did some moderate editing to the article today. I am by no means a fan of this guy, but I did try to snip some of the POV wording out. I also tried to put in more details about his early career. And I ordered the article so that the awards/recognition and criticism is in the same section - I believe, especially with contentious subjects, that accomplishments and criticism should be grouped together to provide as balanced and NPOV a narrative as possible. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 21:22, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
