<p>I don't know if the fact pattern is right. See: People v. Goetz (68 N.Y.2d 96, 497 N.E.2d 41 (1986)) The court seems to conclude here the fifth shot severed Cabey's spinal cord and that it was after he offered him another shot." _________________________________________________</p>
<p>This article takes an omniscient point of view about events that are in dispute. The editors of this article are not in a position to say what happened, only to say what other people say happened.</p>
<p>Also, the line "It was testified that the final shot occurred..." needs to be more specific. Who testified? Criminal or civil trial? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 07:09, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn't seem that the actual events are disputed at all. The "alternate points of view" seem to be focused on motives, not events. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 08:45, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, consider the basic question of whether the four "asked" for money or demanded money. There's a big difference. Which was it? I believe that was in dispute. Anyway, can you please clarify that "It was testified..." bit? <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 09:42, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would be two ways of interpreting the same event. Initially, it was denied that the four were attempting to rob Goetz; later, one of the four was indiscreet enough to admit that it was true. And no, I can't clarify. It certainly was testified to, though, and I don't think that Goetz denied it - in fact, I rather think he verified it. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 11:04, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To quote Bernhard Goetz on the Opie and Anthony radio show, 6/6/2005 (XM Radio Channel 202), he said the part about "You don't look so bad, have another", in his words, "didn't happen". Of course this is after the fact and on a rather "sensationalist" -type show, but it is his contention.</dd>

<p>"In any country of the world this kind of premediated attempted murder would carry life in prison or even capital punishment. How could he get away with less than a year?"</p>
<p>Did you even read the whole article?</p>
<p>I'm not sure why ..."speed shooting (pulling the trigger before the sights are aligned on the target)." is in the article. The author give weight to this being somehow worse than just saying "He shot as quickly as he could, given that he felt threatened by the fact he was outnumbered." Besides, in all my years of shooting I've never heard of the term "Speed Shooting" used in just this way. With a small gun used for self protection at the distance he was shooting, aiming is not a factor; you just point in the direction of the assailant and pull the trigger. Some small guns do not even have sights on them since they are somewhat unnecessary at close range.</p>

<p>" With a small gun used for self protection at the distance he was shooting, aiming is not a factor; you just point in the direction of the assailant and pull the trigger. "</p>
<p>The above statement is incorrect. You should read a book on basic combat shooting, or try shooting a revolver quickly at several different targets in front of and behind you at distances up to 6 feet. Aiming is crucial, but the trigger is pulled prior to aiming. Note the extremely rapid speed shooting described by Goetz can only be done with a revolver and not an automatic pistol. With an automatic pistol the gun is aimed and then the trigger is pulled as you described. As for premeditation, note that Goetz rented the car after, and not prior to the shooting.</p>

<p>A few sites on the internet state “a subway employee who witnessed the shooting confirmed Morgenthau's suspicion that Goetz had been looking for trouble.” This information is from a NY Daily News interview with the subway employee published prior to the 2nd grand jury. At the criminal trial just prior to testifying this subway employee blurted out “I never said those things in the paper.” The Daily News fabricated fundamental facts and statements in that article.</p>

<p>"In the immediate days after the incident, rumors spread that Goetz was threatened with sharpened screwdrivers. This rumor was published as fact in several newspapers, including the New York Times."</p>
<p>Is this statement accurate? I could not find the Times article stating this, so I'm not sure. Note Goetz turned himself in 9 days after the incident. The previous statement: "Goetz did not say he was threatened with a "sharpened screwdriver", although this was reported in some media." might be more accurate. Can someone clarify this?</p>

<p>The "Yankee are very weird" post is a perfect illustration of public misinformation on the 1984 subway shooting. A reporter who covered this case 20 years ago informed me that the media manipulation by an unethical prosecutor’s office, the NY Daily News, and the NY Times was the worst he had ever seen. The extremely biased partial release of evidence by the prosecutor’s office (Goetz’s confession of shooting Cabey twice) should have resulted in the prosecutor being censured or disbarred. The first grand jury exonerated Goetz. Months later a second grand jury was opened after Goetz made widely reported accusations in the media that New York government was “incompetant, inept, and corrupt.” The prosecutor’s office and the highest levels of the New York courts were aware that Cabey was shot once, but encouraged the racially divisive view that Goetz was looking for trouble, that a helpless Cabey was shot twice, and that the shooting was racially motivated. Proof that the authorities knew Cabey was shot once is shown in the decision People v. Goetz, 68 N.Y.2d 96 (N.Y. 1986) where it is stated Cabey is shot once (but is still slanted in the worst possible scenerio against Goetz as the last shot). The public mindset that Cabey was shot twice was so strong at the time that Goetz’s attorneys assumed this was a mistake by the Court of Appeals, and the media also assumed this, and Cabey being shot once in the left side was not reported.</p>
<p>The NY media considered Rev. Sharpton dishonest and ignored him prior to1985, but the NY Daily News, the NY Times, and NYC TV channel 7 put Rev. Al Sharpton on the map in order to get a “legitimate” black leader’s commentary against Goetz. This backfired as Al Sharpton was expected to disappear after the Goetz case, but he did not, and Sharpton became a big name in NY politics. This has actually improved the cesspool of NY politics greatly: previous to Al Sharpton unethical white politicians would shamelessly exploit the race card, now Al Sharpton has forcefully displaced them, but he has less overall credibility.</p>
<p>At the criminal trial after the lead prosecution witness on the train testified and was totally disredited (Sally Smithern, a prostitute in the adjacent car&#160;!), the prosecutor was asked by the defense team why he was in effect throwing the truth seeking process out the window. DA Waples replied “My job is to get convictions.” All but two other witnesses at the criminal trial supported Goetz: one at the other end of the car who reported he saw and heard Goetz shoot Cabey in the stomach after the initial shooting; and James Ramseur, a convicted rapist who staged his own kidnapping in an attempt to vilify Goetz. All other witnesses said they could not count the shots, but that all the shots occured in the suprisingly brief time of about one second. It might be noted that Goetz, as part of an unsuccesful pistol carry permit application, had significant combat shooting training at a pistol range a few blocks from where he lived.</p>
<p>In the discussion by a contributor above it was stated “you just point in the direction of the assailant and pull the trigger." This is incorrect and would probably result in innocent bystanders being shot. As Goetz stated “A shooting like this requires total concentration. After the first shot, you totally forget the first shot and concentrate only on the second shot. The second shot is all that exists. After the second shot you totally forget it and concentrate only on the third shot. Etc.” This explains why Goetz, who was cooperating with New Hampshire law enforcement, was unable to give exact details of where the shots were fired other than the first shot in Canty’s chest and the last shot “in Cabey’s stomach.” (It could be difficult for people who have not been in close combat to understand this.) The exact detailed description of the shooting given in the Wikipedia article was only determined about a week prior to and during the criminal trial by Slotnick's team and Goetz, who were given the Brady evidence at that time.</p>
<p><br />
70.198.45.81Whoever wrote the above commentary seems to have a very thorough grasp of the facts of the case. I would urge you to include a segment in the article fully explaining the true facts of the case relating to the "here have another" portion of the incident. 1) That Cabey was hit only once (many people never bothered to follow the trial phase, they just remember the initial news.) 2) Whether the rush and trauma of the incident blocked Goetz's memory of the "have another" trigger pull. 3) Did Goetz know, or claim to know, if there was a bullet in the gun for that "have another" trigger pull? 4) That Goetz purportedly pulled the trigger the second time because, as retold in media interviews long after the incident, he thought Cabey might have still been able to attack him at that point; that Goetz didn't know how badly Cabey was actually injured. 5) That Goetz and his lawyer didn't know Caey sustained only 1 shot until 18 months after the shooting when the medical and ballistic evidence was formally discovered by the defense team. 09:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)~</p>

Maybe this will help: Note during the shooting Goetz was forgeting every shot and concentrating on the next shot. He had visual and audio distortion after the first shot, claimed not to hear or feel the kick of the gun after the first shot, lost count after the second shot ("speed and the count ...... initially 4 vertical bars"), forgot about the third shot, didn't know the gun was empty on the "6th shot", and didn't regain normal vision and hearing until seeing the 2 women after the shooting. A victim under an adrenaline rush is not criminally responsible (unless you're a New York liberal!). Goetz tried to shoot Cabey again because Cabey was MOVING while sitting on the subway seat (the other three muggers were lying still on the subway floor). "You don't look so bad, here's another" was a thought pattern in Goetz's mind; a person is incapable of speach while in the combat mode. Keeping track of only 5 bullets and four targets while shooting might sound easy, but is not. You basically can't count targets AND bullets if you are completely focusing on the targets, which is what must be done for responsible shooting. (Note that no innocent bystanders were injured even though one of the woman was located BETWEEN Canty and Allen.) And even though the women denied being shot, Goetz didn't know for sure that the two women weren't shot until he heard it on the radio while driving to New England. Adding all these details to the article might just confuse the average reader and probably doesn't hold much interest except for a few experts. Goetz, his lawyer, and everyone else didn't know Cabey was shot once until the criminal trial, how do you want this explained further? Maybe it should be explained further, it was an OUTRAGEOUS situation. Goetz's conduct is explained in minute detail and shouldn't need further explanation, but the prosecutor's conduct does. There should probably be some more stuff about the 2 grand juries, for the law students. Also the 2 federal civil rights investigations. Maybe Ramseur's phony kidnapping or the plutonium water scare should be added to the article - it might be interesting to many.</p>

<p>This is a rather pro-Goetz article, in my opinion - especially the section dedicated to the crimes committed after the trial (which has nothing to do with the night Goetz shot four men), not to mention statements like "completely disproven". If one person out of four people admits to a crime, that is hardly "complete". Also, the fifth young man being paralyzed as a "consequence" of Goetz's crime? Desperately needs a rewrite.

<ul>
<li>I agree that the section mentioning subsequent crimes committed by 3 of the 4 young men is of questionable relevance in this article (I also question the veracity, because I attended a lecture about this case, where it was mentioned that only 1 of the 4 committed subsequent crimes). Either way, it does more damage to the neutrality of the article than the potential benefit it might give to readers. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoroveus_e102.html" title="User:Moroveus">Moroveus</a> 07:41, 17 April 2006 (UTC)Moroveus</li>

<dd>it is hardly questionable, because it proves a point that many refined people cannot understand. If a strange white man walks up to a white man on the subway and starts asking personal questions, well that is pretty damn weird if it happens to you. I'd think the guy was insane or a potential criminal, end of story (i rode the subway for over 10 years, so I know how to behave on it, though thankfully I have driven everywhere for the past 20). If 4 white guys did the same thing I would know for sure that I was in trouble. I mean for sure. Now what would you do if 4 black guys did the same thing? (assuming that you are white like me. Or if 4 asians, or four Muslims). Obviously, you'd start shooting. Goetz did the right thing, to any normal male. Now the point of my point: subsequent crimes is after the fact evidence that these boys were evil little jackasses, proof not to Goetz or to me or to the cops, but proof to the whiney liberal. <a href="../../../s/e/m/User%7ESeminumerical_378d.html" title="User:Seminumerical">Seminumerical</a> 07:36, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well Seminumerical, really how does for asians or four blacks make them more threatning than for whites. And how does that give you more reasons to starts firing.

<hr />
<p>The NPOV author shows by the above statements that she is biased, careless, and ignorant about the facts, as illustrated in her few phrases “Goetz’s crime”, “the NIGHT Goetz shot”, and “Who shot him again again”.</p>
<p>Other than the above statements, PennyGWoods gives no justification for the NPOV. This is an abuse of the NPOV process and the NPOV should be removed. - 68.175.58.4</p>

<dd>You're hilarious. If I wanted to slant the article, I'd edit it. I haven't touched it. I'm just questioning the crappy writing. If it happens to be YOUR crappy writing, tough. PennyGWoods 05:32, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Its not my crappy writing. The section you object to with “completely” was added by a new contributor roughly a month ago (note I deleted “completely”). This article was written mainly by about half a dozen contributors over a long period of time. When I saw the addition I thought both “completely” and “disproven” were a poor use of logic and words, and the whole sentence should be changed, deleted, or added to, since there are more and better arguements to indicate a robbery was taking place.There are also other areas in the article that could be improved in my opinion. The goal of this article is to be as informative and accurate as possible, not as a platform for any biased viewpoint. If you are “just questioning the crappy writing” on this long article you should give specific examples. Why don’t you present some suggested improvements here? Even better, can you suggest a source with better writing or a source that is more informative or accurate? It looks like Moroveus took down the sentence you objected to. Can the NPOV come down now? And we should probably take down most of the banter we did recently, theres a record of it anyway. Maybe we should briefly say edits, objections, NPOV, etc, issues resolved. - 68.175.58.4</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I've already pointed out some of the things I think make it NPOV. Not only is it very, VERY pro-Goetz, but things like "Racial tensions in New York City have also dramatically declined since 1984" are not only not cited, but aren't even relevant to this article. So what, some dude shot up four black guys and everybody got so scared that they started to get along? Probably not. Since the writer obviously went out of his way to point out that the muggers went on to commmit other crimes, where are the citations pointing to that (and again, what does that have to do with the muggers being shot four times?). I can see where it's relevant, but the way it's presented, it reads (IMO) like "they were thugs anyway, look what they did!" I also notice that the author only lightly touched on the public reactions, using weasely words like "some people" and "others". Goetz wasn't just named a vigilante by the tabloids, he was named a subway vigilante by damn near every media of press! Heck, not only does the NPOV need to stay, but it needs a "doesn't cite sources" tag as well! 68.175.58.4 seems to be insulted that anyone would question his brilliant opus (apparently, shooting four people isn't even a crime, and 68.175.58.4 takes umbrage to anyone suggesting it), but the fact is that it's a very poorly written piece of work that wouldn't cut it if it weren't on Wiki. And as it stands, it SHOULDN'T be here. PennyGWoods 00:42, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is getting to be a hassle. Note there are many authors of this article, just check the history. I wrote very little of the present article - I wrote 8 lines of the present INCIDENT section and 1 line of the COURT CASES section!</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you aware that you have a rather obvious trait of using judgemental (slanted?) language, something you fault others on? Look at your own phrases: “Goetz’s crime”, “apparently, shooting four people isn't even a crime”, and “the muggers went on to commit “. That language concludes: 1. That Goetz’s shooting was criminal. 2. That the four who were shot were committing a mugging.</p>
<p>The article is not “very, VERY pro-Goetz”, and neither is it pro-Canty, Allen, Cabey, and Ramseur. The article is LOADED with relevant facts that you apparently don’t like and feel shouldn’t be printed. You say “the writer obviously went out of his way to point out that the muggers went on to commmit other crimes” and it reads (IMO) like "they were thugs anyway, look what they did!" Thats not the case. The reason violent crimes are considered relevant is because some people alledge a mugging was not taking place, and previous and later violent crimes discredit that point of view. Not everybody is like you and concedes a mugging was taking place. BTW, I’m not thrilled with the word “collared” and a few other phrases in the article, although I understand the point of view.</p>
<p>"Racial tensions in New York City have also dramatically declined since 1984" can be edited out of the article as far as I’m concerned. Many statements have been added and deleted to the article over a few years, and I agree with you that its not particularly relavent. My main concern is the accuracy of the INCIDENT section anyway, and I’m always open to suggestions on improving it. The main reason I got dragged into addressing this NPOV is because I objected to Moroveus's deletion of 1.6 seconds, I mistakingly thought you and he were acting together, and would rather someone else address your NPOV after this. Anyway, to continue.........</p>
<p>Because Goetz was labeled the “Subway Vigilante” by the NY Post and some media does not actually make him a vigilante. If you think so you can/should add a statement to the article to the effect that Goetz was a vigilante and even cite the Post or other media. See if it holds up.</p>
<p>This is the best comprehensive and most informative article on the subject I know of, but if you know of anything better, PLEASE post it here so others can evaluate it. (I bet you don’t know of anything better; its a wasteland out there.) In an article this length every fact cannot be cited, but just about every statement printed has been contested and then verified (attributed/cited/defended) by the different writers at one time or another. There are dozens of accurate under-reported facts in this article, and you’ve contested no reported facts! Instead you want the whole article deleted, which smacks of left-wing censorship. If there are any other facts or claimed facts in the article you contest or object to, please state so here and it will be addressed.</p>
<p>I (and others) can only effectively address specific objections; how can anyone address your general objections like “pro-Goetz”, “slanted”, “biased”, and “poorly written” when you are not more specific? And just repeating them doesn’t make them valid.</p>
<p>You apparently want the whole article deleted; why not start by suggesting a few sentences? There’s always room for improvement.</p>
<p>If you want as a start I’d be happy to take down "Racial tensions in New York City have also dramatically declined since 1984" since its apparently important to you, but it might be somewhat nervy on my part since I didn’t write it or understand it, don’t understand the reason for it, and have seen it several times in the media. What reason should I give? Not relevant? That sounds kind of weak right this instant, I'm sleepy and maybe should give it more thought. I'd really rather stick to the incident section. But whatever, the person who wrote it or others can defend it. - 68.175.58.4</p>

<dd>If I wanted a slanted article...still with me?...I'D EDIT IT. I haven't <b>touched</b> it. It's not my fault that you can't keep your opinions out of your "writing". As long as you do, I'll challenge it. Don't like it? Tough. I never said I wanted the article deleted, either. You should learn to read better, as well as write. Your comprehension skills aren't anything to write home about, either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I hate to break it to you, but...as "slanted" and "biased" as you think my opinion is, as long as it's NOWHERE IN THE ACTUAL ARTICLE, I'm more than entitled to have my opinion. Welcome to the real world, Slick. PennyGWoods 15:53, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>You say: “it's not my fault that you can't keep your opinions out of your "writing". As long as you do, I'll challenge it. “</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that’s the point. You don’t understand where I’m coming from. A lot of people including me welcome suggestions. I have to justify my writing, everyone else has to justify their writing, and you have to justify your NPOV.</p>
<p>Instead of derision, why don’t you get more specific? What wording or sentences would you like changed? What paragraphs should be added to or modified or deleted? You have had only 2 specific objections (so far):</p>
<p>1. "completely disproven" As per your suggestion I deleted “completely”. It was a dumb word, but I didn’t write it. Maybe the whole sentence should be deleted. I also am uncomfortable with "disproven", and after this post I'll change it to "discredited". I think you were right on this one, its better now, nobody should object, but that you are blowing it out of proportion. This sloppy statement was only added recently (March 6, 2006) by a new unknown author who also added many silly (I think) wikifications and the "Cabey became permanently paralyzed" language that Moroveus objected to. Those author's "errors" are not enough to conclude the article is generally biased.</p>
<p>2. You object to: "Racial tensions in New York City have also dramatically declined since 1984" are not only not cited, but aren't even relevant to this article. “ I think your objection sounds correct. I’m not sure if its right to delete it, but I’ll delete it if you withdraw your NPOV. I don't think this statement shows bias, but I also don't know if its relavent or even correct. I'm uncomfortable about deleting this sentence and wish someone else would make a decision on this and justify it.</p>
<p>3. My opinions for changes: I think "Although he was released on parole, he subsequently violated parole and the court reincarcerated him in November 2005." is irrelevant and should be deleted. What do you think about deleting this? It might be a good place to start.</p>
<p>I think Ramseur's phony kidnapping (2 Italian hit men in a green Cadilac ..... hired by Goetz) is relevant (his credibility), interesting, and funny, and could or should be added to this article since he was a "champagne witness", but I don't really care if its added or not. Others can add it if they want and we could judge it then.</p>
<p>I also think some of the rest of the article is a little creepy and most of the EVENTS SINCE THE TRIAL SECTION is irrelevant and could be deleted, but some might find it interesting, I don't know. And I think the whole article maybe should be retitled: "1984 New York City subway shooting", since this is what the article is actually about, but this might go over like a lead balloon with the original author. A lot of the personal stuff about Goetz would be irrelevant then and could be deleted. I wonder what the original author thinks about this. - 68.175.58.4</p>
<p>I also think the following at the beginning of the article should be deleted: “They later admitted to carrying flathead screwdrivers, which they claimed were intended to be used for burglarizing video game machines.”. At the time half the adult males in NYC carried some form of weapon, which says something about the place. And Its stated later.</p>
<p>Anyway, is there anything else in the article you think should be changed? I think I'm going to delete the items I suggested above soon unless I hear otherwise from you or someone else. Note if items 1 and 2 are addressed your NPOV is satisfied by Wiki rules, and anyone can remove it. And I don't think item 2 even has to be removed: very few people would consider it a biased statement, but it could be cited - 68.175.58.4</p>
<ul>
<li>Update: I just deleted: “They later admitted to carrying flathead screwdrivers, which they claimed were intended to be used for burglarizing video game machines.” (printed later anyway) and "Although he was released on parole, he subsequently violated parole and the court reincarcerated him in November 2005.". I don't think anyone will object. I also changed it so their ages are listed one time, no need to list them twice. I'm not ready yet to delete: "Racial tensions in New York City have also dramatically declined since 1984". It seems to make sense in the section. I wish others would weigh in on this. It seems like a touchy subject. - 68.175.58.4</li>

<dd>? The jury knew some facts, you obviosly don't, so your claim of jury nullification is unwarranted at this point. Don't you know Cabey was shot once (in the left side)? That was settled a long time ago. You have 6 shots fired!</dd>

<p>_ _ What "Legal Community" do you represent? _ _ Try to make the Harvard Ogletree talk/discussion on April 24th, 3:00 PM, Langdell South Classroom. It will be an open forum and all points of view will be represented. The following 4 will be speaking: Waples &amp; Kuby vs. Slotnick &amp; Baker. Maybe it will be televised. Then you could legitimately start a "Some Reaction Amongst The Legal Community" section, and it could be a good beginning. Unfortunately it will only be 90 minutes, and there should probably be more time for reasonable audience questions.<br />

<dd><b>(I am</b> Moroveus<b>, and i</b> say<s>s</s><b>:)</b> The "Reaction Amongst the Legal Community" section has multiple errors and should not be reinserted.
<ul>
<li>The fact pattern explaining the shooting is both inaccurate (They dispersed and then he shot them all in the back?) and biased.</li>
<li>New York's self defense statute at the time was not a codified version of the common law self defense doctrine. There are some similarities (the reasonableness standard is effectively the same), but the authorization of force is more liberal in the statute than in the common law.</li>
<li>Reaction within the legal community is hardly uniform, but the section presents it as if it is. It's true that this case is still disputed, but it's not a one-sided dispute. A lot of criminal law text books use this case because there is such room for debate.</li>
<li>The mention of jury nullification is presented as fact. An argument could be made that the jury disregarded the law, but if the argument is there...make it. It's not appropriate to simply state it as if it undisputable.</li>

<p>While I think there's a lot of good stuff here, it really needs to be cleaned up. For example, the article has " (For more clarification see "Explanation for 70.198.45.81" in the Discussion section)" in 'The Incident' which just seems unacceptable. Likewise, I'm not convinced 'The Incident' needs to go as in-depth as it does. Perhaps just a link to a more complete account is all that's needed.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.215.89.6 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.215.89.6_598f.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.215.89.6">contribs</a>) 20:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I agree with your first point but not the second. "The incident" is a famous (notorious?) chapter in U.S. history, particularly in the areas of urban crime and race relations, and I think it is worthy of a Wikipedia account.<br />

<dd>Baloney. This article is mainly for law students and also to correct public misinformation about the case, and is the authoritative reference article on this case. 'The Incident' is the most important section in this article, with accuracy of facts paramount, but if you think any information should be deleted, added, or moved why not make a specific suggestion? Can you suggest a general strategy to make the Incident section and other sections flow better? Maybe there should be a separate article for law students and the public - if you think this article goes into too much depth why don't you write a separate article for the public? There seems to be a lot of misinformation out there! The "Explanation for 70.198.45.81" is important for legal analysis because it explains why Goetz believed he shot Cabey twice. It's included in the Discussion section only because it's tangental to an already cluttered article, and maybe even other material in the Incident section could be moved to the Discussion section. Anyone who wants to add a section about race relations should read 'PennyGWoods' in this section first (and the associated history).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.237.124.118 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.237.124.118.html" title="User talk:207.237.124.118">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.237.124.118_9b83.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.237.124.118">contribs</a>) (01:18, 25 -- 19:20, 30 July 2006) (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Anonymous User:150.108.235.20 deleted the word "black" as a descriptive adjective for the four men who menaced Bernhard Goetz. That user asserted that the inclusion of such an adjective was "irrelevant and prejudicial." In the same vein, I submit that the use of adjectives that disclose age and gender are also irrelevant and prejudicial. Therefore, I have removed the words "young" and "men" in the sentence that refers to the subway incident. Only by their names would a reader be able to prejudicially infer that they were not, for example, elderly, Asian women or middle-aged, Caucasian hermaphrodites.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 15:53, 4 November 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</p>

<p>The introductory paragraph concludes with the following statement, "His other interests include magnetic levitation, plasma nuclear fusion, and vegetarian animals."</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a vegetarian animal. A vegetarian is a human being who <i>chooses</i> not to eat meat for reasons of personal belief or conviction (hence, the origin of the term: vegetable + arian = vegetarian). An animal that eats only plants is <i>herbivorous</i>. Darentig 13:36, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The vegetarian distictions are nitpicking - animals are often referred to as either carnivorous or vegetarian, and I have had "vegetarian" pets that would occasionally eat ice cream or a hard boiled egg, but would still considered "vegetarian" by the Webster dictionary definition. - Pookie <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.148.181.19_9fe6.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.148.181.19">172.148.181.19</a> (talk) 04:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Distinguishing herbivorous animals as such, and refusing to ascribe to them human attributes of which they are incapable, is not nitpicking, it is using the English language correctly. It may be true that people commonly and erroneously refer to herbivorous animals as vegetarian animals, but that does not make the incorrect usage of the word correct, and it does not mean that it is acceptable for an encyclopedia to do so. I do not know off-hand what the Webster's definition of the word is (and I doubt that you do) but the Oxford American says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>vegetarian |ˌvejiˈte(ə)rēən|</dd>

<dd>If an animal can now be properly referred to as vegetarian, then we might also describe it with terms such as Hindu, Republican, or stoic.</dd>
<dd>As for "ice cream or a hard boiled egg," that is precisely the point: animals eat what they eat, and are incapable of vegetarianism. Darentig 12:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, Goetz is white and the others African American? This needs to be noted in the article, not to make a racist or anti-racist point through the article, but for clarity and because it was obviously raised in the public debates regarding this event. I assume racial indicators were removed at some point so as to not skew the article, but it still contains sentences such as this, which now make no sense in the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Some wondered whether the trial result would have been different if the participants' races were reversed. In contrast, Time Magazine correspondent Otto Friedrich pointed out the case of Austin Weeks, a 29 year old African American man who shot a white teenager, yet a New York City grand jury refused to indict Weeks for that shooting."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I was reading through the article, then hit this part, and had to go back to see if I missed what the races were. It also mentions CORE getting involved, and Public Enemy referring to this case in selecting the name for the band, points that need context to make sense. I know race is tricky to present in a non-contentious way, and it appears that it's not the predominant issue here, but it's crucial to the context. I don't live in the US, but I think I'd have heard if race became irrelevant to law, order, and criminal justice in urban America.
