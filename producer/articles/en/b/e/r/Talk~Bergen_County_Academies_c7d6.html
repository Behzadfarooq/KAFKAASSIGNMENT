<p>Anyone wanna fill out the template to the article (i.e., find out BA's average SAT scores and figure out how to upload a picture of the school logo)? --Classwarrior 02:16, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where did those SAT scores come from? Do we have a source? They seem to be way too low.</p>
<p>Response to the SAT issue: they're not all that low from my memory. The best source for a current BCA student to use are the school profile sheets that they send out with college application packets. //Ewalt</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Since profile sheets are sent out based on Academy (rather than for the entire class), I am skeptical that any numbers exist schoolwide. That said, they don't see unreasonably low, especially because 2004-05 was the lowest SAT year the school had ever had. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasileus_Basileon_Basileuon_Basileuonton_e29b.html" title="User:Basileus Basileon Basileuon Basileuonton">4Bs</a> 01:36, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what's changed, but to my knowledge, the SAT averages which were publicized were generally based on CEEB code, so Sci/Eng had one average, Business was separate, Medical was separate, and the Careers had one average. By this split, either my year ('03) or the one before it, Sci/Eng had the highest average in the nation. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonpin_ad98.html" title="User:Jonpin">Jonpin</a> 02:17, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In case you haven't been following the news, we at the Academy have our first notable alumni. Kaavya Viswanathan, a current sophmore at Harvard, has just been accused of plagiarism for her book "How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life", which she wrote while a student at the Academy. It's all over the web, but here's the NYT link (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/26/books/26book.html?ex=1303704000&amp;en=46bf0d6991bad677&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external free" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/26/books/26book.html?ex=1303704000&amp;en=46bf0d6991bad677&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/26/books/26book.html?ex=1303704000&amp;en=46bf0d6991bad677&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss</a>). Should it be put in the article?</p>
<p>Response to the Kaavya issue: I don't think that's really appropriate. Her actions don't reflect (I hope) anything about the school in general. Perhaps if we started a "notable alumni" section, it would make sense to include Kaavya's plight. My next comment is going to raise some bias flags... but I think the media focus on Kaavya's failure is somewhat deplorable. Does envy of people like Kaavya make us happy when they fall? I suppose that's neither here nor there. --Ewalt 02:16, 27 April 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps. Having known Kaavya when she attended the Academies, I could have predicted her fall. She, like, sadly, many others at the Academies, spent much of her time building up the appearance of briliance rather than actually working. And, in her case, it worked for quite a long time. That said... OFF TOPIC. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasileus_Basileon_Basileuon_Basileuonton_e29b.html" title="User:Basileus Basileon Basileuon Basileuonton">4Bs</a> 01:36, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I question whether going to the IMO qualifies someone for inclusion in the "noteworthy alumni" section. We are all proud of Hyun-Soo and the other students who went to the various olympiads. Yet none of the others is included here. Wikipedia articles on schools such as Stuyvesant, T.J., and IMSA do not mention their olympians. Perhaps we should wait until one of ours wins a Nobel Prize. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavost_1226.html" title="User:Davost">Davost</a> 03:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "prestigious" IB programme is nowhere near as big a deal as the schools stellar Math team or student research opportunities, this article (and more importantly and tragically, the schools homepage) need to be rewritten to reflect the strengths of this actually impressive school, in my opinion. Plenty of mediocre schools have IB, and this is no mediocre school. //Jugander</p>
<p>I will maintain that yes, this article was made by students of the Bergen County Academies, amongst those people who cannot be identified as 'unbiased'. As a BCAer myself, I suggest that all BCAers immediately cease boosting or degrading their own or any other academies. The keyword of an encyclopedia article is objective. We only need to provide the most basic information, without any judgments on the levels of education or trivia on certain teachers or random facts. // Kazastankas</p>
<p>Since when is "battlebots" a boy's athletic activity? I thought it was an engineering club/project seeing as they assemble fighting robots. OK, I've been trying to make minor changes here and there, but one thing keeps coming up that has to change: the superlative adjectives, unsubstantiated boasts and general editorializing must stop now. Encyclopedia articles contain facts, not opinions.</p>
<p>I have added a section on the Arts at the Academies. While BCA is an academic institution, I personally have found that the arts program at BCA is quite surprising good and better than most high schools. Therefore, I think it deserves a separate section. Feel free to edit/add info to it.</p>

<p>&gt;"The theater arts deparment puts on professional-grade plays and musicals each year on the school stage, which is a professionally-equipped auditorium that seats 1,300 and is rented out to outside professional groups regularly."</p>
<p>3x "professional" is hardly necessary. "Professional-grade plays" seems inherently POV, "professionally-equipped" changed to "well-equipped" (What, was it equipped by professionals? Uses the same equipment as some professionals? Isn't that a huge range anyways?). "Professional groups" remains, since that's easily verifiable and also meaningful. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcewolf34_9af8.html" title="User:Icewolf34">Icewolf34</a> 14:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added sections on scheduling, math, and academy stereotypes. BCA follows what is already a fairly unusual schedule with several unique modifications, and its math curriculum, for those who place high enough in freshman year, introduces topics that are explored in Columbia University's 40— level math classes. As for the academy stereotypes, I hope I have discussed them as stereotypes, rather than as factual information in the body of the article. This is my first major edit, so please do review my work. 0702034 11:14, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The last edit added Data Structures to the last stage of the calculus sequence, which previously had only Topics in Advanced Mathematics, but in my opinion this is not warranted. Strictly speaking it's not even a math class, but rather AP Computer Science AB with additional topics. 0702034 03:19, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might be wise to rework the parts on the schedule conflict and academy stereotypes. They look a tad unprofessional to me. I like the math rework though - very complete //Davrol</p>
<p>I agree with Davrol in that sections of this article appear unencyclopedic. -- <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_M._Wang_0ba2.html" title="User:Andy M.

<p><small>This section is now obsolete, since "supersets" and "selectivity" are taken out of the article.</small></p>
<p><small>As a Science student at the Academies, I can truthfully tell you that ABF does <i>not</i> enjoy a lighter schedule, especially not in the junior and senior years. Between the IB curriculum and the in-house economics and management classes, the usual Business schedule starts out busier than the Science schedule. Of course, students can and many do compensate by reducing their electives, but that's an option available to everyone. I'll wait a bit, but if no-one objects, I'm going to change this. 0702034 05:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small><small>I'm a little puzzled that anyone would bother to change "highly selective" to "selective," but since it's been done let me point out that in recent years the Academy has accepted 20 - 25% of those who have applied. For purposes of comparison, the Cornell page says "Admission to Cornell is extremely selective. For the undergraduate class of 2010, the admission rate was 24.7%." I'm not sure what "highly selective" means, but it does seem like an appropriate term for Academy admissions. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavost_1226.html" title="User:Davost">Davost</a> 04:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</small></small></p>

<p>First off, sorry about the consistent misspelling of `superintendent.' I noticed you caught that right away. Secondly, all of the information of the original superintendent's cabinet section is from Bart Piela's article in the Academy Chronicle. Perhaps if I preface it all with, ``As Bart Piela discusses in the Academy Chronicle..." I could bring back the point about the selection process? I do think it's important. 72.88.135.171 06:55, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It there a reference on the web about this cabinet? I understand that the group exists, as I read the Academy Chronicle with Bart Piela as the author of the article. Is that a good reference? How do you cite it? If you know how, just go ahead and add it! Just cite it properly if you know how. <small>-- <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_M._Wang_0ba2.html" title="User:Andy M. Wang">A.

<p>For several reasons, I'd like to delete the section 'Academic departments'. First, it doesn't add much at all to the article, since it's really just a list of regular high school course topics. Second, I think it's a stretch to say that BCA has 'departments', in the university sense. For example, Senior Experience is not a department, it's a class. Third, this article is long and needs to be tightened. Objections? Will delete in a few days unless there is opposition. <a href="../../../j/u/g/User%7EJugander_3f9c.html" title="User:Jugander">jugander</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/g/User_talk%7EJugander_69ff.html" title="User talk:Jugander">t</a>) 17:44, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that they are called departments, believe it or not. The section may be deleted. However, it deserves mention somewhere in the article. In other words, go ahead and delete it, but it is best it the department names are mentioned somewhere else, if possible. <small>-- <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_M._Wang_0ba2.html" title="User:Andy M.

<dd>Honestly, I think the entire "Academic Department" bullet does not belong here. BCA does not have departments in the sense a college does. There technically are no department heads, just Program Managers, if I am correct. This list seems arbitrary and out of place. I have never seen a list of these departments in my time at BCA. -- <i><b><a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunctionofxy_5fe2.html" title="User:Functionofxy">f(x,y)</a></b></i> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunctionofxy_e5c4.html" title="User talk:Functionofxy">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_functionofxy_d566.html" title="Special:Contributions/functionofxy">contrb.</a>)</b></sup> 01:53, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Although I don't support keeping the bullet, BCA does have academic departments in this sense. Each academic department has a chair (e.g. Mr. Holbrook in math), and from my discussions with different teachers, the departments do seem to exist as rather separate entities. My larger question: Is such a "Trivia" section fitting for an encyclopedia article in the first place? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky_fa66.html" title="User:Ricky">Ricky</a> 01:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although there are no chairpeople, academic departments do exist. They hold meetings, make recommendations for curriculum and teaching assignments and have clearly defined memberships. AP placements are done by the departments as are the freshman language placements.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavost_1226.html" title="User:Davost">Davost</a> 17:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe that Wikipedia is no longer in favor of trivia sections, so I moved the academic departments blurb to a new "Academics" section. This new section now includes the "Math" content. If there are any other notable departments, they could be mentioned here. I think this also fixes the fact that a department listing is not trivia otherwise worth mentioning. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottalter_abe7.html" title="User:Scottalter">Scottalter</a> 07:52, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think its pointless for students to put a blurb about their pet project/favorite club here. The article becomes fragmented and chunky. Maybe create a new page, BCA Extracurricular Activities? 24.168.146.16 22:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whoa! Creating a new page may be a bit far for now. Only the BCA article would link to that. For now, I think it is best to focus on making the article great. Your suggestion is good and a lot should be removed from the article, I agree. Comments anyone or anyone else? <small>-- <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndy_M._Wang_0ba2.html" title="User:Andy M.

<p>Hello all, and thank you for contributing to this school site. I'm part of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_Assessment_4157.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools/Assessment">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Schools/Assessment</a> team, and, as requested, I'm reviewing this page. I'm currently giving it a grade of Start on the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Assessment_0e4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment">Wikipedia 1.0 Assessment Scale</a> and an importance of High on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Release_Version_Criteria_a3de.html#Importance_of_topic" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Release Version Criteria">this importance scale</a>.</p>
<p>My reasoning is as follows: This article still has a lot of uncited content and falls a bit short of Wiki's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> standards. As stated in the comments it reads like a brochure, not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanbly_4a9c.html" title="User:Alanbly">Adam McCormick</a> 04:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
