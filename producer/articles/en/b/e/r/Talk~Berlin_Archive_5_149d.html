<h2><span class="mw-headline">Second biggest?</span></h2>
<p>The article states that Berlin is the second biggest city in the European Union, but both Paris and London are bigger. Have I missed something?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes; you've missed the article <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_cities_of_the_European_Union_by_population_within_city_limits_4163.html" title="Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits">Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits</a>, which shows that when only city-proper populations are counted, Paris is smaller than Berlin, Madrid, and Rome. However, if you count whole urban areas (see <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_urban_areas_of_the_European_Union_be66.html" title="Largest urban areas of the European Union">Largest urban areas of the European Union</a>) or metropolitan areas John Carroll then Paris is indeed larger than Berlin. Berlin is actually relatively far down those lists. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 17:11, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But this is still misleading, bacause greater Paris is still much larger than greater Berlin. Measuring city populations by (fairly arbitrary) administrative areas is not necessarily helpful or useful and I would wonder why this little fact is helpful or useful to the overall article anyway!! Maybe you should mention thatit is the 9th largest metropolis (see <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_urban_areas_of_the_European_Union_be66.html" title="Largest urban areas of the European Union">Largest urban areas of the European Union</a>), although again it would seem fairly meaningless</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">EU has country status</span></h2>
<p>The EU and its flag got to the point to be mentioned next to the "national" country flag. Several indication lead to this level: Common market, common policies in many fields, election every 5 years and a European parliament as well as a EU court of justice. The currency Euro is adopted by 300 mil inhabitants out of 450 mil. There is a EU-Day (holiday), EU-Licenseplate ,-Passport ,-Drivinglicense ,-Anthem and in the case of Berlin the EU is financing infrastructure, education, social projects ect. In official pressconferences and gatherings the national flag stands next to the EU flag. <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELear_21_ced5.html" title="User:Lear 21">Lear 21</a> 12:08, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This still doesn't make the EU a country. I am against having the EU flag in the infobox. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebesta_2099.html" title="User:Sebesta">Daniel Šebesta</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebesta_0fbb.html" title="User talk:Sebesta">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sebesta_7fde.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sebesta">contribs</a>) 12:19, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, the EU has a lot of structure, but it is <i>not</i> a country, see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries.html" title="List of countries">List of countries</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdinborgarstefan_14d5.html" title="User:Edinborgarstefan">Stefán Ingi</a> 12:35, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To be more precise and clear for everybody; this is not a discussion wether EU is an official country or not. The statement I have made is in favor to show the EU flag in the infobox next to the German flag because of the mentioned reasons.<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELear_21_ced5.html" title="User:Lear 21">Lear 21</a> 12:57, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I´ve been sleeping for rather a long time, but I have to agree with all those that think the flag should be moved. The EU flag has more of a relevance on a national, rather than at city level. In any case, the use of Euros signifies that Berlin IS IN the EU.--<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 19:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree as well. Lear 21 correctly assesses the influence of EU policy on the governance of Berlin, but it is rather misleading to list the EU next to "country". The EU is a supranational union and mentioned in the introduction already. To what extent does the reader benefit from the addition? I reverted. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyw_7c9e.html" title="User:Johnnyw"><font color="#454545">Johnny</font><font color="#999999">w</font></a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnnyw_ea54.html" title="User talk:Johnnyw"><font color="black"><i>talk</i></font></a> 22:15, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section says #Government# and follows a striking logic from highest level of influence to the subdivision level.

<p>I just wonder if the desire to include the EU flag, has something to do with the inability to accept the "Black-Red-Gold" as the official symbol for Germany and Germans?--<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 07:31, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The CIA World Factbook names EU already a country. The first paragraph of this article names Berlin within the EU, also watch WP <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">country</a>. [<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] There haven´t been any contra-arguments concerning the issue, only Njets. As far as I can see most of the Njet-voters are non EU-citizens who are not expected to identify with EU. They should also consider that many do so AND identify with their traditional nation. The EU is economically more integrated than China, but thats a comment not an argument. Stop reverting the flag without a convincing discussion. all the best <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELear_21_ced5.html" title="User:Lear 21">Lear 21</a> 10:09, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Lear21, why did you revert my edits to this article? Union Berlin is definately more relevant than the other non-soccer teams. Compared with ALBA Berlin, for example, Union has over 4,000 members while ALBA only has 500 just to name one statistic. I also bet you that an average German is more likely to know Union than ALBA, further it has had a much greater relevance in history.</p>
<p>Further, why should the graph about the population numbers in Berlin cover only the time since 1880? Is the time before that not just as relevant?</p>
<p>Shouldn't an assertion that obviously contradicts a statement in another article be sourced as is the case with the claim that Berlin is the sixth largest urban area in the EU?--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a><a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarabinieri_f294.html" title="User talk:Carabinieri"><sup>T</sup><sub>T</sub><sup>a</sup><sub>a</sub><sup>l</sup><sub>l</sub><sup>k</sup><sub>k</sub></a> 16:46, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>About the sports teams: I don't think the table of teams is very relevant, it might be better to start a subarticle Sports in Berlin where more could be said about the importance of <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Berlin_6e66.html" title="Union Berlin">Union Berlin</a> etc. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 17:00, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>About the population graphs: I am unhappy with both, as the 1250 one should start at 1650 or have two different scales, while the 1880 one does not give enough context. Can't we remove both and improve <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_population_statistics.html" title="Berlin population statistics">Berlin population statistics</a> instead, which can easily have both graphs?</dd>
<dd>About the x-th largest city by definition y: 7th largest seems correct per our article, so it should be changed. Or it could just be dropped anyway.</dd>
<dd>Generally, Lear21, please do not revert all edits by one editor because you disagree with part of it.

<p>Sorry, I overlooked the urban area change, but then, why didn´t you altered it? Third division sport teams, can hardly be included, they havent even relevance in local media: Berliner Z, Tagesspiegel,Die Welt etc. The table is standard in all american city articles and delivers quick overview instead of lists. The graph is of major value and also provides quick insight, especially starting with 1880 when Berlin started to grow and NOT from 1250 on happening 600 years nothing. You also couldn´t identify the important episode. all the best <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELear_21_ced5.html" title="User:Lear 21">Lear 21</a> 19:41, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think 1880 is a pretty bad cutoff date, as Berlin already had 1 million inhabitants then, and we're missing out on a lot of earlier growth. The name of Berlin's volleyball coach is pretty irrelevant, and I would prefer to remove the sports table - prose is always preferable to tables, especially if the tables are full of not-so-important information. Just because American cities have this as a standard doesn't mean we have to adopt it for Berlin. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusma_9d59.html" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> <a href="../../../k/u/s/User_talk%7EKusma_087e.html" title="User talk:Kusma">(討論)</a> 20:13, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What makes ALBA Berlin more relevant than Union Berlin? Sure they're in the First Division, but basketball as a whole is a lot less notable in Germany and like I said I'm sure Union Berlin is a lot better known. This is not just about the table but also the paragraph about sport in Berlin. Do you think that should be deleted as well? And what makes the population of Berlin in the year, 1999 more relevant than in 1576, for example?--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 21:51, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At Kusma:I also like having a graph starting in 1701. But we haven´t. Stop arguing what is not there.For now its the very best we can get. Same with a sports table. You want to write profound prose.You are welcome...! Stop picking the weakest point in the table. The engl.Wiki standard is acceptable, presenting the issue in a short way.</dd>

<p>At Carabinieri: You convinced me with Union. I expand the table. To both:The article is already very long, all expansion should be in related main articles.all the best <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELear_21_ced5.html" title="User:Lear 21">Lear 21</a> 22:10, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Making a graph starting in that year would not be much of a problem. One could easily do that using excel, creating a new graph would even have the advantage that one could translate the parts of it that are still in German.

<p>Because of readability problems. And the relevant history of the city starts earliest in 1648.<a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELear_21_ced5.html" title="User:Lear 21">Lear 21</a> 22:25, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I would actually prefer removing that photo from MyFest, which doesn't really seem to be illustrating anything and instead making the graph larger. Why is the history before 1648 irrelevant?

<p>As the capital of Germany and an extremely historically important city in its own right, I wonder if there's any interest in setting up a work group or WikiProject dealing with Berlin. It could either be a stand-alone project, like the <a href="../../../s/y/d/WP%7ESYD_52ca.html" title="WP:SYD">WikiProject Sydney</a>, or a work group of <a href="../../../g/e/r/WP%7EGER_2780.html" title="WP:GER">WikiProject Germany</a>. Personally, I think that organizating it as some sort of substructure of Germany might be best, as that would allow for potentially greater interaction between the two and spare the Berlin people the effort of having to create all the templates, departments, and what have you. But that's just my opinion. I would be very happy to hear the responses of the rest of you, positive or negative, to either or both proposals.

<p>Hi, to both of you! I certainly think the Berlin-Issue has the potential for a standalone Wikiproject. But! Right now, I´m not that convinced of enough contributers to make it a fully rolling one. So, some combined forces of Germany project/portal seem more realistic to me.

<p>The name <i>Berlin</i> is connected to the Berlin Bär (English: Bear) (Old High German: <b>Bero</b>, thus the name <b>Berolina</b>, Angle Saxon: Bera , Indo-Germanic-Indo-European: bher-os) emblem, used as Berlin's Sigilum since the 13th century in conjunction with the Brandenburg Eagle. On a document of 1280 two upright bears are depicted. The varying Berlin sigilum over the centuries depict the Brandenburg Eagle together with the Berlin Bear, later usually one instead of the earlier two. This is probably due to the single city, which developed from the earlier twin cities.</p>
<p>In 1231 the <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascanian.html" title="Ascanian">Ascanian</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandenburg.html" title="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> Margraves, brothers Johann I. and Otto III. received at <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravenna.html" title="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> from <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Frederick_II_3e96.html" title="Emperor Frederick II">Emperor Frederick II</a> the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Brandenburg_cb99.html" title="Mark Brandenburg">Mark Brandenburg</a>. At the same time the emperor verified the Brandenburg margraves Lien over <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pomerania.html" title="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>. Since the death of the young margraves father, Margrave Albrecht II. in 1220, the emperor held Brandenburg untill the boys became of age (17 and 16). One of the Margraviate's seats was at the site of the future Berlin at the river <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spree.html" title="Spree">Spree</a>.</p>
<p>The first written mention of towns in the area of present-day Berlin dates from the late 12th and early 13th century. <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spandau.html" title="Spandau">Spandau</a> is first mentioned in 1197, the inner towns of Berlin-Cölln (remembered in Neukölln), in the center Berlin and to the right the estate of the Brandenburg margraves started to be built about 1200. All three are at a different arm of the river and are connected by bridges. <a href="../../../k/%C3%B6/p/K%C3%B6penick.html" title="Köpenick">Köpenick</a> is documented in 1209, though it and Spandau both did not join Greater Berlin until 1920. The central part of Berlin-Cölln is about at todays <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_Island_24f7.html" title="Museum Island">Fisher Island</a>). It was first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin (across the Spree in the area of what is now called the <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolaiviertel.html" title="Nikolaiviertel">Nikolaiviertel</a>) in one from 1244. From the beginning, the twin cities formed an economic and social unit. In 1307, the two cities were united into one. Over time, the twin cities came to be known simply as Berlin, the larger of the pair and the other parts as districts of Berlin.</p>
<p>The name <i>Berlin</i> is connected to the Berlin Bär (bear) emblem, which for the first time was used on a document in 1280. Before that only the Brandenburg Read eagle was shown. Dr. Theodor Zell , <i>Naturforscher</i> scientist studied secret nature trails of wildlife. His book <i>Geheimpfade der Natur</i> placed such a crossing, the only wildlife crossing across arms of the Spree river banks at the very place were first Coelln, then Berlin was founded. 200 other cities or towns in Germany have names relating to bears, over a hundred are named after swine or bore and a number after the wolf. Lately it also has become fashionable to sport the idea , that Berlin may be related to the Old <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polabian_language.html" title="Polabian language">Polabian</a> stem <i>berl-</i>/<i>birl-</i> "swamp".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> +</p>
<p>The fact is, that the Berlin Bär is continuously used as emblem on the sigilum seal of Berlin from 1280 . That showed two upright bears (for the twin cities), and later depictions show one bear. <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:mXfuPPJ7hyUJ:www.berlin.de/sen/inneres/hoheitszeichen/wappengeschichte.html+berlin+stadtwappen+erstmals&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" class="external text" title="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:mXfuPPJ7hyUJ:www.berlin.de/sen/inneres/hoheitszeichen/wappengeschichte.html+berlin+stadtwappen+erstmals&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6" rel="nofollow">Berliner Stadtwappen</a></p>

<p>There is a sentiment of coming back to Berlin, thats why she keeps another suitcase in Berlin.

<dd>To me, translating "ich hab' noch einen Koffer in Berlin" as "I have another suitcase in Berlin" sounds like "I have two suitcases here in Paris, and one more in Berlin", an extremely banal and unemotional statement. (<i>Wo sind meine Koffer -- hier ist einer, hier ist noch einer, und ach ja, in Berlin habe ich auch noch einen.</i>) Translating it "I still have a suitcase in Berlin" on the other hand <i>does</i> capture the longing to return (<i>Ich wohne lange nicht mehr dort -- aber noch habe ich einen Koffer in Berlin!</i>). —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 10:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the problem is that the original statement, without the context, <i>is</i> unemotive and ambiguous. Did she forget her suitcase in the airport there or something?
