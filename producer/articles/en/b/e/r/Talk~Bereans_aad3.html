<p>Emico. I have removed your statements for several reasons. Firstly your own experiences with the Apologetic group is not really relevant. They may not have replied to you, but that is no reason to assume they are guilty of something. Maybe they were on holiday, maybe they are busy. Secondly what you wrote does not conform to the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. Some of what you wrote was also wrong. There is no evidence for the group being based on <i>Roman Catholic theology</i>. In fact it is extremely unlikely - go to the website and see what they say about Roman Catholics! <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 05:05, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>DJ. First, you should'nt remove someone else's statement. else, you'll be in this vicious cycle of one removing anothers contribution. Second, how long of a holiday do you think they should take? Don't you think it is their responsibility to defend their claim? After all, we are talking about another person reputation, that of Mr Manalo. As far as NPOV, you are not observing by putting a link which is crearly against another. As far as the Bereans theology, where do you think they got the doctrine of Christ being God-man? <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 14:18, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The idea that <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> is both Man and God is part of the beliefs of almost all <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a>, certainly not just <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholics</a>. Did you read what the website says about Catholics? <a href="http://www.thebereans.net/prof-romanism.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thebereans.net/prof-romanism.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I know nothing about Mr Manalo, and I'd be quite happy if he wasn't mentioned in the article at all. It's not Wikipedia's job to refute anything the Bereans say. If you want people to know the truth about Mr Manalo (whoever he is) then you should write an article about him, not write about some other organisation. The only link I put in the article was to the Bereans' own website, which is certainly a sensible link to put in an article about the organisation. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 00:40, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you a member of this berean cult? If you are, can you tell me what your source is for making the claim on you website. If you're not a member, then why do you care so much. The link you had had claims that were'nt true. Why do you participate in propagating lies? Do you know what you look like if you cover up for liars? (the above by <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">User:Emico</a>)</p>
<p>I care because I care about the truth. To find the source I used just click on the symbol [1] above and your browser will take you to the Berean website where they talk about Roman Catholicism. This will show you very clearly that they are not Catholic. I am removing what you wrote in the article because it is wrong. Also some of the things you wrote are your own opinion, and so do not belong in an encyclopedia. Please read <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> before you reply.</p>
<p>Please will you also sign your name whenever you write anything on talk pages. You can do so by putting four tilde characters like this ~~~~.</p>
<p>Incidentally you may be right that they are not functioning any more. Their mail server reported that their mailbox was full. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 04:12, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"You care about the truth"! How noble. Well, so do I. And the bereans webpage is not telling the truth. I am putting back my contribution to the article. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 06:24, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me put this as clearly as I can. What you are writing is factually wrong. The Bereans are <b>not</b> Catholic! I ask you again, did you read what the Bereans say about Catholics? They devote several pages to talking about reasons why Catholics are wrong. It is not sensible to write an article about an organisation without reading what they say about themselves! <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 13:51, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>They may not be, but they're still lying about the Iglesia ni Cristo. Tell them to fix their content, or remove your link here. By you keeping their link here, you are propagating a lie. Why do you wanat to keep on lying about another person. And you call yourself a christian? Don't you read? Read and understand my point before taking out my contribution. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 14:06, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have read and understand your point. I'm sorry that you are offended by what the Bereans write, but it is obviously out of my control. What they are writing is a matter of opinion. Many people would agree with what they write, and many would disagree, just as there are there are those who agree and those who disagree with <a href="../../../i/g/l/Iglesia_ni_Cristo_44b9.html" title="Iglesia ni Cristo">Iglesia ni Cristo</a>. Should a Catholic be able to insist that we remove everything about Iglesia ni Cristo because they disagree with it? Of course not. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:15, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, now you are really stretching it. In case you get confused by your own post, the issue is that you put a link that is lying about someone. Take out the link and we won't have this tit for tat. But it looks you are hellbent on lying with them. And you claim to care about truth. As long as you'll keep on propagating a lie, I'll keep on pointing it out. BTW, I got your email. It's bit short on details. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 14:41, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is about the Bereans. The link is to the Bereans' own website. For anyone wanting to know about the Bereans, pointing them to their website is sensible. Maybe you should explain what it is that they are 'lying' about. The only thing I have heard so far is that they say Felix Manalo 'founded' the <a href="../../../i/g/l/Iglesia_ni_Cristo_44b9.html" title="Iglesia ni Cristo">Iglesia ni Cristo</a> (whatever that is) whereas you say he only registered it with the Phillipine government. That's a pretty minor distinction. On the other hand you have written in this article several times that the Bereans are a Catholic organisation when it is clear they are not.</p>
<p>I didn't send you any email, by the way. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 15:48, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And of all the webpages having the name berean in them, you by chance picked this one. Convenient excuse. Pay attention DJ, after these long exchanges you claim to not know what they're lying about? Read man, read. For a man who claims to "care about the truth", you're too quick to support a liar. As far as the Bereans, I said they're daughters of catholicism. Because they believe in a catholic doctrine of Christ being God. This doctrine started in the council of nicea by the catholics. Come on, you got to at least know what you believe in! And I guess the email just so happen to come from the same ip range as yours. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 16:03, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am well aware of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Nicea_d0cb.html" title="Council of Nicea">Council of Nicea</a>. Like I said, almost all Christians believe that Jesus is God, including many denominations that were never part of the Catholic church. I didn't add the link - it was added when the article was created. And I have no idea what email you are talking about. I don't think you even know what my IP address is.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned this is a trivial argument about something not very important. Shall we try for a compromise? Let's leave in the basic facts about the Bereans, take out the link to their home page (since it upsets you so much) and take out all the stuff you are adding about them. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:21, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suggested this to you 7 post before. Go ahead and remove the link. One last thing: Don't take another man's honor as trivial. One day, people will lie about you. We'll see if you think it is still trivial. Another thing, if your church say that the what "founder of the church" mean is not very important, leave that church. It's not of Christ if they don't profess that their founder is Jesus Christ. Have a nice day. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 16:30, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Outside view requested. I'm an atheist, so I have no axe to grind either way about theological theories. I agree with <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> that <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a>'s commentary doesn't adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>; it's also <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are actually <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=Berean+%22Acts+17%3A11%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=Berean+%22Acts+17%3A11%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">many</a> churches and ministries called "Berean" - including this <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/B/Bereans.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/B/Bereans.asp" rel="nofollow">historical one</a> - all named for the Bereans of Acts 17:11, with the belief in common that Christians should actively search the scriptures for verification and reject religious stances that fail this test.</p>
<p>So it does make sense not to single out this particular one for a link. However, I'm coming to this conclusion on the basis of the available information, not on <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a>'s arguments. It's unacceptable for one user to browbeat others into removing a link because he/she doesn't like the theological claims expressed there. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 16:52, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here we go! tag teaming. Anyways, Mr Ray missed the point. Talk about etiquette butting in without first getting the whole story. Here's a summary; Mr DJ put a link of a website whose owner is unknown. I tried to find out who the owner is but there were no replies. I simply wanted the website owner to stand behind what he puts out on the web, put his name on it and be ready to defend. I was asking too much. These liar are never going to back up their claims. The website was spewing lies and me and Mr DJ being lovers of truth finally agreed to remove it. Besides, I did not 'browbeat' anything, the link was there and I simply said they won't stand by their claim. What so bad about that? I don't mind what they believe in, as long as they don't tell lies about another person. How about you Mr Ray? Has anyone tell a lie about you? Did you leave it alone? You're a fool if you did. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 17:17, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Here we go! tag teaming</i>. No: standard Wikipedia procedure for reaching a consensus on editing deadlocks. It would help to know what, precisely, are the lies you talk about. If it has widely agreed factual inaccuracies about religion (eg "the Catholic church was founded in Australia") tell us precisely how. If it's theological - at the level of your disagreeing with their belief that various Christian offshoots are cults, or their take on the triple nature (or not) of God - that's a matter of faith and opinion, and the Wikipedia stance is to report it neutrally. Read <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html#Religion" title="NPOV">NPOV#Religion</a>. As I said, however, the best reason not to include it is that it's one of many, and if the only way to find out more is original research, it's not policy to to include information found that way. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 18:12, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Emico, your edit violates origional research. However the present page is a bit anodynly pro Berean. If you can find one of the groups critisizing the Bereans then by all means quote them here. Certainly I think it needs to be covered that the Bereans see themselves as defending the Nicean Council POV on the Trinity and groups that they label as cults for not accepting the Nicaean council regard the Bereans as non biblical because of it. Finally the Bereans site has evangelical protestant written all over it (even if they don't come out and say so openly) so where do you get the idea they are Catholics?<a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejvid_f1a9.html" title="User:Dejvid">Dejvid</a> 22:56, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep. Problem with this topic is that there doesn't seem to be much written about Berean churches and ministries except on their own sites. I'm just adding some material; maybe others can fill in detail? One aspect I haven't covered is that there appears to be a significant association of the term Berean with anti-Catholicism: Google around for <a href="http://www.bereanbeacon.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.bereanbeacon.org/" rel="nofollow">Berean Beacon</a> and <a href="http://www.thebereancall.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.thebereancall.org/" rel="nofollow">Berean Call</a>. Difficulty is, it's probably original research, as there's no documentation except on other POV sites. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 20:39, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's ok. Most wiki articles are referenced like by other wikipedia articles. And once you drill down, the last referenced document would have reference to an outside source. It genius!

<p>If you'll forgive a little background info, the original Bereans 'examined the scriptures', and are therefore used as a model for a lot of churches that are founded on the principle of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sola_scriptura.html" title="Sola scriptura">sola scriptura</a> (i.e. supreme authority of scripture). <i>Sola scriptura</i> organisations are often in opposition to the Catholic principle of authority (scripture interpreted by the church, plus church tradition). Hence a lot of churches with Berean in the name will probably be more or less anti-Catholic. My apologies if everyone knew that already. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 20:45, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please, let's not get into an edit war. This is a page about Bereans, not Calvinism. Therefore a description of Calvinism is off-topic and unnecessary, since <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> is described at the linked Wikipedia article. Also - <i>You don't just delete other people input!</i> - yes, you do, as long as you have a solid reason and say why.

<dd>He probably was, but what is the evidence? As you've been told more than once, on Wikipedia you have to provide it. "The earliest I know about" or "the earliest I can find on Google" isn't enough. An OED citation for the earliest use of the word would be good.

<p>I have no objection to the stuff about John Barclay being here. However I have removed the stuff about the Trinity. Barclay and the Bereans believed in the Trinity, in which respect they are just like 98% of other Christians, so noting the fact is irrelevant. Much of what you wrote is also just plain wrong. Belief in the Trinity certainly predates the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Nicea_d0cb.html" title="Council of Nicea">Council of Nicea</a>. See <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>.

<dd>Funny how you cry about sources now, but if you look at your previous edits, you kept most of my contributions. The one thing you did'nt like was my reference to the trinity as a catholic doctrine, which it is. And then I noticed that the Bereans of today are taking potshots at the catholics! They actually have a running battle at one of the websites you linked. Very interesting. I think it would help if you admit you're a berean. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 20:36, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For the record, I'm reverting this article - yet again - for the following reasons: the <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> version provides no references or sources; its descriptions of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>, the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a> are unnecessary as they exist in great detail at linked Wikipedia articles; the factual accuracy of Emico's statements about historical belief in the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> has been disputed (see above); and it omits relevant material about the many other modern Berean churches.</p>
<p>As well as refusing to work by basic Wikipedia guidelines such as <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cite_sources.html" title="Cite sources">Cite sources</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> also appears to have POV issues with the topic, having accused editors trying to uphold <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> of being <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bereans.html" title="Bereans">Bereans</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I'm reverting this article to the original submission. User RayGirvan agreed with most of it and even provided sources to my contributions. Except for the one issue of the trinity doctrine. When research showed that the trinity doctrine can be attributed to the catholics, user Raygirvan was quick to remove it. <i>(I'm am now reviewing these sources to make sure copyright is not violated and will add them here as soon as possible.)</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Currently, the Bereans and the Catholics have a running feud, as evident by a website link provided by User:RayGirvan. I think user RayGirvan has a POV against the catholics and cannot accept the fact that the trinity doctrine is indeed from the catholic church. Further, user RayGirvan will not confirm or deny that he is a Berean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My intention for the history part or the article is to show the progression of the Bereans from the time it was first attributed to Mr Barclay up the the present. User RayGirvan is giving me strong indication that the Bereans have forgotten their roots and somehow do not remember their history, whose root is Mr Barclay. I believe my contributions shows clear and concise early history of the bereans and will compliment the whole article once all the pieces are put together. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 23:22, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to add from what I gather, the contention between the Berean and Catholics is the following: the Bereans claim that the doctrine of the trinity is biblical; the catholics maintain that even from their earliest manuscripts, the trinity is a catholic doctrine. One must ask, did Mr John Barclay, the founder of the Berean sect in Edinburg contend that the trinity is a catholic doctrine? If he did not, why then do his followers contend it now? Is this a case of the current Bereans departing from the belief of their founder? Very interesting stuff which I intend to pursue. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 23:34, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have no affiliation with either stance; as far as I'm concerned, Bereans vs anti-Bereans is like aliens arguing whether "Zarg is the son of Quogg" or "Quogg is the son of Zarg". It's interesting as a phenomenon, but that doesn't make me a believer in either position. I came to this because I follow <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_alerts_4982.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts">Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts</a> and an exeternal viewpoint was requested. My sole complaint is that that you are continually reverting the article to a personal viewpoint and a format that fails to obey basic Wikipedia standards. For instance, if you believe in historical continuity between Barclayites and modern Bereans, you must provide a verifiable external source. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 00:07, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then you should'nt find anything wrong with what my research showed concerning the trinity. You, on the other hand, wether intentionally or not, biased or not, are taking the side of the (current) Bereans. Let them and the catholics fight it out on their forum. Wikipedia is not for personal POV. You pointed out my entry in <a href="../../../i/g/l/Talk%7EIglesia_ni_Cristo_e107.html" title="Talk:Iglesia ni Cristo">Talk:Iglesia_ni_Cristo</a>. Did you find anything wrong with that entry. If you want to know, on the Berean website there was profile. I personally asked member of the Iglesia ni Cristo if that particular entry was correct and was told it was not. I tried to have the Bereans correct it but unfortunately, most of the writers on that website do not sign their work. And there were no other ways to contact them but via a web-based form. I did not get a reply nor a correction to the error I pointed out. There is no personal viewpoint in my contributions. I'm simply pointing out in a clear and concise manner details and readers can follow the hyperlinks to other wiki articles. Sources are forthcoming. As I said, YOU already provided the source, I'm just reviewing them right now. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 00:26, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>User Raygirvan, protector of all things fair, what can you say about the second paragraph of this article. Don't you think it a free advertisement for the bereans? POV as plain as day.

<dd>If you're genuinely prepared to cooperate on editing, I'm happy to do so likewise. Yes, I think it's POV by omission. Its inclusion as the sole example makes it central to, rather than an example of, modern Bereans; and it omits details that would show more fairly its controversial nature (ie that it views as cults a variety of religions that most people - religious or not - view as perfectly mainstream}. Therefore, I'm restoring that detail and the details of other Bereans (with the necessary references. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 01:31, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re John Barclay's Bereans. I've removed the sentence about them being the first to have that name, and changed present tense to past. I'm perfectly prepared to believe it true, and that there may be some historical continuity to modern Bereans. But as currently there's no explicit verification, it's against Wikipedia policy to say so. The full Oxford English Dictionary - which I don't have - ought to give a date citation for the term. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 02:07, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Raygirvan, of all the berean congregation all over the world, you just by chance picked one from far away Philippines. You true colors are showing. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 02:20, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>We've been through this before. The fact that <i>you</i> don't believe in the Trinity is no reason to put a paragraph about why you don't believe in it into an article about a group of people who do. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 02:31, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My personal belief has got nothing to do with this. It is factual that it was the catholics who decreed the trinity and it is factual that the trinity is not in the bible. The sources I cited clearly states this fact.</p>
<p>This article is not about the particular berean website you support, who by the way do not believe in the trinity. This article is about the Bereans as they started out to be. Do you evagelizing on your own website. Your bias on the side of one particular berean website cannot be denied. Please take your bias somewhere else. Not on wikipedia. Have a nice day. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> 02:41, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point is that the Bereans did believe in the Trinity, which makes them exactly like 98% of other Christians. I do not support any Berean website, and had never heard of the Phillipine Bereans (which are the ones you seem to object to) until I read about them in this article about a week ago.</p>
<p>Read the article on the Trinity. It is accepted by most Christians that the concept of the Trinity is in the Bible, even if the word is not. I can explain it to you in detail, but I don't want to do so here.</p>
<p>However this is not the point. Even if you believe that the Trinity is wrong, an article about a group that does believe it is the wrong place to explain why it is wrong. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 02:52, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a>: I'm out of here. I don't need this angst.

I think the only thing that would get this article on track would be a ban on <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmico_ee54.html" title="User:Emico">Emico</a> editing the page, on user conduct grounds: messy, time-consuming and rarely conclusive.

<p>I've examined a few more Google searches on Bereans, and I've reached the conclusion that the Phillipine Bereans are just not noteworthy enough in the grand scheme of things to warrant a separate mention.

<p>Too bad. It's a good fight(so to speak) and 4 against 1 is'nt so bad. One of them reverts for another to get around the 3 revert rule. He does'nt even read what he's reverting! loser.

<li>Don't be a sore loser. You did get around the 3 revert rule. and you're not reading what you revert. Here, for your reading pleasure, when I asked you why you removed my entries, you said <b>"I don't know what you are talking about. Nor do I care. I made the revert so that Onlytofind won't get the Bereans article locked."</b>. Wait for a weasel reply. They always do it the same way. The other guy was first very tough, then he went nice while inserting his own view on the article. When I busted him, he called backup. That's the way it was.

<p>For the good of the article, and all its main editors, I feel compelled to bring the full reason for getting involved with this article in the first place. For those who are curious of why I reverted the page: Besides the points I gave to Emico above, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bereans&amp;diff=14404716&amp;oldid=14394930" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bereans&amp;diff=14404716&amp;oldid=14394930" rel="nofollow">look at the differences between the version before and after my reversion</a>, the references, external links and categories were blanked out and omitted. I took it as damage to the structure of the article, and decided to revert it. Since I looked at the history of the page, I wanted to avoid any 3RR problems, since Onlytofind and Emico were in a 3RR situation and I didn't want a freeze on either the article or anybody's posting priviages. So I reverted it instead. After forgetting about it, Emico <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baiting.html" title="Baiting">baits</a> me by sending a message to my talk page, accusing me of being biased: <i>"Do you have a problem with the facts about the trinity being decreed by the catholics? If you claim to be fair and unbiased, then show it. Emico 15:09, 29 May 2005 (UTC)"</i>. I answered his question, not knowing what he was talking about. Soon after, based on his conduct with other wikipedians as well as myself, I planned on issuing a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request for Comment</a> on him. Instead I found out someone already started, but didn't fill out the actual form. I added the template, endorced it and encouraged whoever I though started the RFC to finish it.</p>
<p>From this point on, with the exception of developing a Disambiguation page, I no longer want to be invloved with the Bereans article. I'm sorry for any inconvienience this has caused for anybody. --<a href="../../../l/b/m/User%7ELbmixpro_347b.html" title="User:Lbmixpro">LBMixPro</a><a href="../../../l/b/m/User_talk%7ELbmixpro_de76.html" title="User talk:Lbmixpro"><sup><span style="text-decoration: none;">(Speak on it!)</span></sup></a> 01:56, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Once again LBMixPro is passing blame. You should instead be a man and accept responsibility for what you did. You came on to a developing article and took sides. I did'nt bait you. Out of (misplaced)respect instead of reverting your revert, I called your attention by posting on your talk. You should have investigated instead of lashing out. Again you display here your lack of care for what you do: <b>"I answered his question, not knowing what he was talking about."</b>. Instead of fixing what you did, you lashed out again and complain about my conduct? Do you even read what the juvenile is spewing out&#160;? Good riddance. Next time, think before you act.

<p>You know what Emico? Maybe I can't find the word 'disaffected' in any web reference about Barclay. Doesn't mean he wasn't disaffected of course, and it's very nitpicking, but I haven't got time to argue. However we should write 'former Presbyterian minister' because he obviously wasn't one at the time he founded the Bereans. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a></p>
<p>Fair enough. "Disaffected" doesn't seem an unreasonable description however; he went on to form his own church after disputes with his bosses and being denied promotion within the Presbyterians. <a href="http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/barclay_john1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/barclay_john1.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 10:06, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The presbytery of Fordoun seized this opportunity of gratifying their spleen; they prohibited Mr Barclay from preaching in the kirk of Fettercairn, and used all their influence to prevent him from being employed ... The presbytery carried their hostility against Mr Barclay so far, as to refuse him a certificate of character, which is always done, as a matter of course, when a preacher leaves their bounds. He appealed to the Synod, and afterwards to the Assembly, who found (though he was in no instance accused of any immorality) that the presbytery were justified in withholding the certificate. He had no alternative, and therefore left the communion of the Church of Scotland</i>. <a href="http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/barclay_john1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/barclay_john1.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaygirvan_e1df.html" title="User:Raygirvan">RayGirvan</a> 16:28, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If your employer deliberately makes your working conditions so impossible that you have to leave (ie you're frozen out of the job as Barclay was) it's treated as legally equivalent to being fired: hence my use of the word.

<p>Hi all, I am abuGian webservant of The Bereans: Apologetics Research Ministry I just learned about this controversy so if you would allow me I'll just post my brief comment.</p>
<p>First of all we received no email from Emico. If he did sent us I can't remember receiving it, opening it or reading it. I often get a copy of all emails addressed to this Ministry. Now, regarding a full mailbox, we owe it to the server move we just went through, it doesn't mean we're already stopped serving the public. Thirdly, we have no affiliation to Johhn Barclay's ministry nor are we Roman Catholics. If John Barclay named his ministry "Bereans," it does not follow that we borrowed from John Barclay, after all, a quick look at Acts 17:11 would suggest Barclay and our Ministry both borrowed from the Bible. Lastly, it is not necessarily true that if a ministry is Trinitarian it follows it is a Roman Catholic ministry.</p>
<p>I just couldn't help but laugh at how Emico projected an image of narrow-mindedness in the Editing Talk:Bereans.</p>
