<p>I have a problem with this part...</p>

<p>She also took a school entrance exam just because of their school uniforms, which could mean she completely blew off their academic specifications, which led her still be labeled as a complete idiot, as it is very strange to go to a school simply for the uniforms, let alone some pre-teens, teens and sometimes parents don't positively comment on school uniforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, in Japan, a girl wanting to go to a certain school just because of the uniform is quite common. This is because Japanese schoolgirl uniforms can be seen as "<a href="../../../k/a/w/Kawaii.html" title="Kawaii">kawaii</a>". --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 10:38, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"She also took a school entrance exam just because of their school uniforms, which could mean she completely blew off their academic specifications, which led her still be labeled as a complete idiot,"</p>
<p>Well, this part, I went to some forums relating to Tokyo Mew Mew, and fans a problem with this. I also went to anime news network, and they didn't positivly comment on this.</p>
<p>"as it is very strange to go to a school simply for the uniforms, let alone some pre-teens, teens and sometimes parents don't positively comment on school uniforms."</p>
<p>I also went to some opinion sites about school uniforms, and some parents, and teens ahd a problem with uniforms, therefore I added it. I was talking about non-Japanese fans. Do you have a site where you found out that in Japan it is common to go to a school for the uniforms.</p>

<p>EDIT: would this be the only reason you put that banner? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelofdeath275_0dd1.html" title="User:Angelofdeath275">"THROUGH FIRE, JUSTICE IS SERVED!"</a> 00:33, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I come from Australia where it is compulsory for all schools (private or public) to have uniforms, if I had a choice of going to two similar schools (with similar academic standards) I would choose the one with the cuter uniform. In Japan, it is also compulsory for all schools to have uniforms, and schools in Japan are known for their cute uniforms. You're comparing Berry's decision from an American point of view where most schools don't have uniforms, and I think it is irrelevant when we are talking about a character who is Japanese and lives in Japan, where attitudes towards school and uniforms are different from the US</dd>

<dd>The whole "critisism" section feels a bit biased to me, not just that one part, which is why I nominated it to be checked for its neutrality. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECandy-Panda_1c75.html" title="User:Candy-Panda">Candy-Panda</a> 06:20, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, for starters, I've seen reviwers havin an issue with Berry transferring school soley for the uniforms,("I also went to anime news network, and they didn't positivly comment on this." i said it RIGHT HERE) the quotes are actully from the manga, but since you have never read the manga, you went on assuming its fancruft, just like how you assumed all of it is cruft, when it pretty evident in the manga.</p>
<p>My problem is that since you have never read the manga, you deleted entirely, as opposed to putting the banners (orginal research, weal words, no citations etc.). It is pretty ill-thought if you dont know about the subject, and deem it all cruft if you have no way of verifying it. I've never come across an aritcle, when some decided to delete a whole section, and a discussion on the Anime and Manga when I wasn't told of it, to tell my side of the argument. That particualy pissed me off.</p>
<p>"Many people dislike Berry, because she replaced Ichigo. She also seemed to know everything about being a Mew Mew the second she first transformed. Also, when she first saw a Chimera Anima, she immediately knew it was an alien (this has led to a few labelling her as a Mary Sue).</p>
<p>She also blew her secret to Tasuku a few minutes after she first found out she was a Mew Mew, while Ichigo kept it from Masaya until book 5 (this has led to many labelling her as an idiot)"</p>
<p><br />
This is the orginal cricitsm section. Dont know who added it. Dont go assuming I was the only person who wrote it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelofdeath275_0dd1.html" title="User:Angelofdeath275">"THROUGH FIRE, JUSTICE IS SERVED!"</a></p>

<dd>Ugh, more of the same biased, weasel-worded original research.

<dd>Just a quick injection to say that, among Japanese girls, uniform can be an important factor in choosing a school, particularly if you live somewhere where you are afforded access to several potential schools with similar academic levels.</dd>

<p>Much as I hate Berii and a la mode and believe all that criticism is true, it'll never be allowed on Wikipedia. Might as well start wishing the Japanese Manual of Style away so we can call her Shirayuki Berii instead of Berry Shirayuki, while we're at it. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESana_Jisushi_9b6f.html" title="User:Sana Jisushi">Sana Jisushi</a> 20:58, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look, Angelofdeath, the entire "criticism" section you added to this article was entirely unsourced ranting and nitpicking. You have yet to tell any editors what <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> you got those criticisms from, and unless you do have a reliable source for it (and by the way, forums <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Self-published_sources_.28online_and_paper.29" title="WP:V">don't count</a>), it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> and has to go. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> <font size="1">(<a href="../../../n/e/o/User_talk%7ENeoChaosX_4f26.html" title="User talk:NeoChaosX">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NeoChaosX_878e.html" title="Special:Contributions/NeoChaosX">walk</a>)</font> 00:28, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Now sense when is the manga itself not a reliable source. I guess I gotta break it down for you since you have not read the manga:</p>
<p><i>"...battle outfit and similar attack name, and strawberry-type things, as this is Ichigo's signature (hence her name means strawberry). The two characters' faces even look alike, with the only major difference being their hair styles."</i></p>
<p>The front cover of the manga is a giveaway. I was reading through the manga, and noticed Ichigo and Berry look too similar. Mint and Lettuce look similar to Ichigo and <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringo_Akai_d577.html" title="Ringo Akai">Ringo Akai</a> looks really similar to Ichigo, but Berry compared to the others looks way to similar.</p>
<p><i>"She also seemed to know everything about being a Mew the second she first transformed, having not trouble, which is very strange because the original Mews had trouble getting used to being a Mew. Also, when she first saw a Chimera Anima, she immediately knew what it was."</i></p>
<p>When Ichigo fisrt transformed she was wondering what in the world happened. Mint looked surprised she transformed so just went along with what Ichigo did. Pudding kinda didn't, but then again she is a kid. Zakuro, did not want to join the other Mews. and was rather mean to them. All of the original Mews had no idea what was a Chimera Anima untill Ryou told Ichigo, so then she told the other Mews. So that is when Berry was labeled a Mary Sue.</p>
<p>Now her blowing her secret to pretty ovbious. It is shown clearly in the manga. the quote, "Isn't it cool? I became a Mew Mew!" from the manga.</p>
<p>Already talked about the uniforms.</p>
<p><i>"She also seems to have forgotten why Tasuku Meguro hugs her every morning, which relates to her mom's death."</i></p>
<p>Said in them manga. Tasuku said he knew that she would probaly forget. But how can someone forgot about something relating to the death of a family member? That question popped into my head. Plus it was in the origial section of it:</p>
<p>"She also blew her secret to Tasuku a few minutes after she first found out she was a Mew Mew, while Ichigo kept it from Masaya until book 5 (this has led to many labelling her as an idiot)"</p>
<p><i>"It can be seen as very odd, as she said in a flashback that she loved being hugged by her mom, and yet there is no mention of her dad."</i></p>
<p>It kinda goes back to how when someone dies, the family is more close then usual. Thats a well known thing.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You are not an admin, there was NO consensus, so it was rather dumb to remove the entire section, especially if you cant verify it yourself. I certainly dont go around removing entire sectons of some article and I dont know know about the subject. I've already had an issue similar to this, but the users DID NOT: remove an entire section, actually took a consensus, and sense I was currently the person editing that article, it was more like suggestions to what I should do with that section. You on the other hand, did remove an enitre section, did not take a consensus, and sense you do not know about the subject and I do, you should have said something along the lines of "this and that will need citations, this looks biased so this and that should be reworded or removed".</p>
<p>Me and Panda were first talking about the school uniforms, then I metioned that fans did not like this, reviewers (I already said anime new didnt like this), and I went to those " school uniforms or not?" opinion and informaional sites with parents and students with some sayin they didnt like this. She went on assuming I was talking about the entire section, bypassing that I was specifically talk about the uniform thing, and called me the sole "author" of the criticism section.</p>
<p>"Look, Angelofdeath, the entire "criticism" section you added..."</p>
<p>You blind? I just showed you the orginal section, showing I did not add it enitrely. Now if you assumeing I solely add the other parts, that is rather dumb. It you take a look at the history section beofore my name showed up, other users have added that some people dont like berry. Now when I first began adding to Berry's article and was rather new to editing Wikipedia, I saw the history section and what people have siad about berry and thought "oh ok. I guess people really dont like Berry, so I guess I should exspand bout it."</p>
<p>"You have yet to tell any editors.."</p>
