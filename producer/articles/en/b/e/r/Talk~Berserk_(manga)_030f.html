<p>For the curious... the article on Berserk is now here instead of at <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28anime%29.html" title="Berserk (anime)">Berserk (anime)</a> because the manga came first and is still ongoing. -<a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">Sean Curtin</a> 07:50, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortuantly, he doesn't note here that <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28anime%29.html" title="Berserk (anime)">berserk (anime)</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28manga%29.html" title="Berserk (manga)">berserk (manga)</a> used to be in seperate articles, and for some reason (possibly because the anime was more well known at the time(?), or perhaps because berserk (anime) was more detailed), it was decided to merege into berserk (anime) instead of berserk (manga). -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 21:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk.html" title="Berserk">Berserk</a> is now about the Berserk <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a>. The old article no longer exsists... I think... it was mainly an article that started out about <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserkers.html" title="Berserkers">berserker</a> but, as that aricle already exsisted, was redirected to that aricle, then later to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserker_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Berserker (disambiguation)">berserker (disambiguation)</a> then later to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28manga%29.html" title="Berserk (manga)">berserk (manga)</a> .... I thought it would be good just to cut the garbage and have the berserk article be about the berserk anime and manga.

<dd>Funny nobody had a problem with it from january 12, 2005 to may 2006.... <i>Not one person</i> nominated it for a move.... I'd also like to add a reason for moving that I didn't list back then: quite frankly, I was sick of reverting anon-IP vandals that kept on turning it into a redirect to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserker.html" title="Berserker">berserker</a> -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 21:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>WOW!! First off, I'd like to say I i'm sad I didn't get to post this summary sooner, as things have <i>already changed</i>. I'll explain that part later. I'm going to seperate my summary and my comments on that, so here goes -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 13:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Summary</b>: And then, for a time, there was piece. I didn't have to worry about vandals changing my disambiguation into a redirect, or the article itself moving around at all. There was no complaints about the name durring this time. None at all. If there was, they would have been added to the talk page. But on May 8th, 2006, <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogdangiusca_0433.html" title="User:Bogdangiusca">an admin</a> moved the article which had been at <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk.html" title="Berserk">Berserk</a> sense January 2006 to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28manga%29.html" title="Berserk (manga)">Berserk (manga)</a>. He then make <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk.html" title="Berserk">Berserk</a> into a redirect for <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserker.html" title="Berserker">berserker</a> He did this without (presumably) looking through the talk page's history for this note, without making sure the concenus would agree with the move, (presumably) without checking to see why the editors got it moved to [Berserk]] to begin with, without checking to see "what links here" (or he wouldn't have broken every single link designated for the anime/manga/game article), without talking about it on the talk page, without allowing any debate, or the propper Wikipedia process to go through at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, (presumably, without also looking at the article, or he would have noticed that only a section of the article is about the manga itself; the rest is about the anime and the games) and without even <i>listing a reason for the move</i>. I was at/recovering from <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_Central_afe2.html" title="Anime Central">Anime Central</a> at the time, but the day after I immediatly fixed it to make it a redirect to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk_%28manga%29.html" title="Berserk (manga)">berserk (manga)</a>. I figured this would be a good interm solution, as it would fix the problem of the numerous broken links this admin had created (not to mention the fact that it made going to the manga/anime/game article a 4-step pain in the ass). My edit note stated that I would go to his talk page to explain how that was an un-adminlike move when I had the time, but I didn't have the time for several weeks....</p>

<dd>&lt;my comments on why what he did goes against various guidlines/policies here, citing specific examples&gt; -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 13:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the meantime, there were no complaints from people looking for information about <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserker.html" title="Berserker">berserkers</a> at all for several weeks &lt;bah, i'm tired, i'll finish the summary later.. i'll explain the move attempt, and the reason it failed to achive consensus&gt; -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 13:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>&lt;my comments, i'll point to examples of why i think many of the people voting "oppose" were making an argument of emotion (mainly the fact that my disputing their reasons only caused them to change their reasons, not their choice)&gt; -<a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 13:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was going to make a big prediction here about how this was a very bad move, and will lead to great page instability, vandalism, and edit/revert/move wars, and that <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserk.html" title="Berserk">Berserk</a> will never be a stable place untill this article (manga, anime, games etc), but it appears I have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berserk&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berserk&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">beaten to the punch</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berserk_%28disambiguation%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berserk_%28disambiguation%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">on this one</a> -- not by an anon IP, but by the same admin from before!!

<p>This article has improved a lot since I last saw it, but it's getting way too cluttered. Things need to be split up and removed (including some of the stuff in the infoboxes). Soundtracks don't need to be placed in the infobox (there's a section devoted to that already in the "World of Berserk" section and the links in the infobox are generally reserved for links to wikipedia articles (at least that's my understanding). There is also a size warning on this article. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Ethereal_9efd.html" title="User:Miss Ethereal">Miss Ethereal</a> 17:33, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>too long? yeah, maybe a little bit (all <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Bronx_fe83.html" title="Last Bronx">good articles are too long</a> anyway). BTW the 138KB Japanese article is way longer! LOL (and there's not a single picture there because of a specific legal issue). "cluttered"? Ok i'll remove the soundtrack in the infobox and replace the trading card game URL. I've used the URL instead of a blank wikilink because of the article not being created yet (it definitely needs to be made). In other hand, there should be some grammar mistakes here and there and some approximative ("<a href="../../../f/r/e/Frenglish.html" title="Frenglish">Frenglish</a>") phrases must be rewritten in a proper English, as this is not my language (i also use the French punctuation which is probably slightly different than the English one). The article will be splitted up for sure, the recent extensions were made for it (<b>World of Berserk</b> gives the direction). <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 18:32, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>By leaps and bounds the English Berserk Wikipedia article has improved substantially (inclusion of Berserk globally instead of just in Japan and America). Just fix up the infobox at the end and the article can look truly professional. However, it is indeed very cluttered and needs to be broken down. But it's definitely getting there.

<li>Seconded. The character section needs to move to it's own page, ASAP. A shorter summary of some of the more important characters (guts, griffith, casca, and some of the newer "family" members such as Isidro and whonot) should be kept on the main page, for reasons of nessity, etc. The "world of berserk" part looks like it might make a good template... (‽) Eventually we can do all sorts of other stuff with the characters, such as lists by faction, cronological introduction, or some of the main characters could get their own article <a href="../../../e/2E/g/E.g..html" title="E.g.">e.g.</a> Guts (Berserk), but for now, we should move the character section to it's own article.... <a href="../../../a/k/n/User%7EAknorals_2811.html" title="User:Aknorals">Aknorals</a> 11:56, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So I did some changes and think it looks better. If not, you can always revert my edits. I moved the character section onto it's own page, leaving the main characters on the main article (Guts, Griffith, and Casca ... I moved Puck into the "Secondary Character" section). I've also populated the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Template%7EBerserk_info_a727.html" title="Template:Berserk info">Template:Berserk info</a> with the "World of Berserk" section and replaced the section with the template.

<ul>
<li>All that is too much to do right now: start off small &amp; leave out the immense content, (nations, classes, etc.) for later. Focus on just creating a seperate page for the significant characters of Berserk before branching off. I also fixed a few misspellings (Kushans, not Khusians, etc.) Martisty 22:15, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I mostly agree with you people, i know it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta to do it.</li>
<li>Actually it's not "Kushan" but "Khushian", Kushan is the English pronunciation (this is your own katakana form ^^), i used the original tadjik word as found on the japanese google. I also found "Kusyan" on the japanese official site of Berserk, BUT ^^ even the Japanese uses different romanizations of their katakana, as described in the <a href="../../../h/e/p/Hepburn_romanization.html" title="Hepburn romanization">Hepburn romanization</a> article. Using Kushan for Khushian is like using "Italy" for "Italia", katakana words doesn't have english origins (even if it's probably the majority in the modern Japanese) exemple "Pan" for bread which is the Spanish word. Same thing for "Gilles" (french name) or "Jill" (english name) or "Volkoff" or "Borkov", the translation of the Russian "off" or "ov" or "ev" or "eff" is not same in all countries. For exemple we (French) use "Gorbatchiov" (or "Gorbatchev") when you (English) use "Gorbachev", or "Oussama Ben Laden" when you use "Usama Bin Laden", what i mean, is we both have to take care of this matter of fact and try to be neutral, as the Japanese katakana is independant from both the French and the English or the Italian or whatsever pronunciation. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 04:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I type it in that spelling to conform to the English standards on the English Wikipedia page (<a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushans.html" title="Kushans">Kushans</a> links to the article on the empire, whereas Khushian goes nowhere). By the way パン/Pan is taken from the Cantonese word "Pão," the bun. Martisty 07:09, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>i see your practical use but you can use the write right word and link to another wikilink as ((Kushan|Khushian)) (replacing the parenthesis by brackets). We have to define which word has to be used between the English (true/highly possible) translation, English (comic/anime) official translation or the (thought) original word (talking about the katakana form refers to), this is just like character names. "Khushan" leads to nothing on google, but "khushian" leads to many things including <a href="http://www.khushian.com" class="external text" title="http://www.khushian.com" rel="nofollow">www.khushian.com</a> and in the japanese wikipedia it leads to <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E6%9C%9D" class="external text" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E6%9C%9D" rel="nofollow">クシャーナ朝</a> in the India/Iran/Pakistan area. Khushian is a popular indian name, there are artist and author named khushian (as pointed by google). Here's the "Kusyan" image i mentioned before <a href="http://www.younganimal.com/berserk/world/new/img/kusyan.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.younganimal.com/berserk/world/new/img/kusyan.jpg" rel="nofollow">"Kusyan" on the japanese official site</a>. "Kusyan" is a possible romanization of "Kushian" not "Kushan". The "Kushan" referred sites are english speaking (australia, canada etc.) or french speaking. The Khushian era is designate in Japan as "クシャーン時" with the "シャーン meaning "shian" or shan because of the "シャ" (sya, shia or sha).</li>
<li>パン pan is portugese (and spanish) for "bread", french is "pain" . The cantonese simply use the portugese word as well. "Pão" is the portugese word for bread (with the portuguese accent)... Pan and Pao were both introduced in Asia by the portuguese. As you probably know, the portuguese sailors did trade with Taiwan ("Formose" in europe) and the island was known as "Ilha Formosa" which is the portugese word for beautiful... and the portuguese were trading with the japanese as well, in the kyushu area, and then introduced the "pan" there. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthusiastFRANCE_b4e6.html" title="User:EnthusiastFRANCE">EnthusiastFRANCE</a> 13:42, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>i've added the "100 Years War" reference (historical notion) which is mentioned in the japanese article and has been pointed and kind of studied a while ago in the french article.</li>
<li>I found another Biblic reference "Baptism" in the anime so i've added it, and i've splitted the dictionnary into history/religion/philosophy/geography. I think i've heard "koroshi" (murder) which is closer to "sacrifice" than baptism, but someone pointed before me, the US publisher has taken some liberties with the original work. I'll watch the episode again tomorrow to be sure (i have the US edition w/english sub not the french one). If it's koroshi, it doesn't matter, the theology term will be "sacrifice" instead. In Italia the episode is named "Il Sacrifico" (the sacrifice) i don't remember about the English one, i don't think it's "sacrifice" though. Using "baptism" for "murder" is a vivid exemple of what i've pointed (on a previous topic) as a cultural adaptation (localization) due to religion. I mean it's not a mistranlation... there are japanese (by their name!) pro translators, i mean they know the difference between "koroshi" and "jossen" or "senren" (japanese words for baptism) right? or maybe changing a "violent" word by another one "softer" is part of a mild censorship. I let you make your mind by yourself.</li>
<li>Actually i've used "theology" instead of "religion" (the biblic references i have pointed on a previous topic) mainly because i like "y" ending words ^^ (so there are all sounding the same it's pretty cool!) but also because it's a wider concept allowing us to host not properly "religious" notions such as beherit (look for its hebrew meaning). I repeat i've created the World of Berserk section a few days ago as a stub, i made it quickly, with rough wikilinks etc. It's up to us, to add terms and refine it all together. So don't be shy, you can add your own notions, we'll setting up things later.

I think the overview section on the games itself should use only one or two pictures (like maybe just the ps2 one, because it looks cool). I've been spending more time removing whatever horrible innacuracies have accumliated over time/were added by enthusiastFRANCE, and trying to make the article make some ammount of sense... I'm also thinking about changing the layout slightly, like maybe bumping the list of berserk tv episodes subsection into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Berserk_anime_episodes_8066.html" title="List of Berserk anime episodes">List of Berserk anime episodes</a> or something like that, and putting a section about music in there somwhere, that should help the fact that the the links to the soundtracks are spread throughout the page a bit...

<p>The article makes mention that there is no sequel in production and that many still incorrectly believe there to be a sequel in the works….. but it dose not mention that the shows director (whose name I forget) said that he hoped to continue it, perhaps misinterpretations of that statement lead to much of the confusion regarding the alleged sequel.</p>
