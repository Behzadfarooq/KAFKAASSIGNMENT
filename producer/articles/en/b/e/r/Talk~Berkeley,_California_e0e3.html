<p>The material in the trivia section cannot be integrated with the rest of the article in any way that would shorten the overall article. Nor without disrupting the flow of the other sections. Yes, the article is long, but then again, this is about Berkeley.

<p>In the "Mayors" section I removed the extra information about Tom Bates, but I don't know what political party (Democrats?) he belongs to. Could someone add this? Thx <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkaakt_c993.html" title="User:Skaakt">Skaakt</a> 11:31, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The mayoral race is technically non-partisan by law, although "coalitions" have been used to circumvent this. Since the early 70's, city races have typically been between "radical" and "liberal" Democrats, Republicans and conservatives having vanished. I'm pretty sure Tom Bates is a registered Democrat, but I believe so is his perennial opponent, Shirley Dean. <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmangray_e746.html" title="User:Tmangray">Tmangray</a> 18:46, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bates is definitely a Democrat, as is his wife, former mayor and now state Assemblymember Loni Hancock. The chances of a Republican getting elected to <i>any</i> office in Berkeley is approximately the same as it is in Chicago. +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 18:57, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From the list of past mayors, one can see a long string of Republicans up until Warren Widener. But it should be noted, these Republicans were of the "progressive" variety, what we would call Lincoln Republicans, close to the politics of what are today's "moderate" (conservative) Democrats. The handful of real rightwing Republicans in Berkeley left en masse in the 60s in "white flight" after Berkeley voluntarily integrated its public schools, in the process, helping shift Berkeley leftward. <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmangray_e746.html" title="User:Tmangray">Tmangray</a> 20:31, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A recently submitted article had a few sentences about this building and a paragraph about the role of the housing unit at U Cal Berkeley. I merged the material into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> article. The folks there promptly bounced it back as not worthy of mention in that article, but indicated that the building itself might be notable. I don't believe the building rates an article of its own, so I'm merging the building-related information here.

<dd>Is it at 2400 or 2600 Ridge? <a href="http://www.usca.org/coops/clo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usca.org/coops/clo.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> seems to indicate the latter. This has no bearing on its notability, of course. I'm not sure it is notable enough to require mention at all—it's an off campus co-op dorm based in an old hotel... the people who live there think it is important, but not too many others do. I'm fairly sure it has no impact on a city-wide scale. Anyway, if we are going to start adding historic buildings, the Claremont Hotel needs a mention; it's the only real notable building I can think of besides ones related to the university. -- <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:30, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>text that was there was blandified to: "(The University also once housed a small research <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">reactor</a> which would have been in noncompliance with the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act. This was replaced in the 1990s with a computer laboratory, though the University denies that this had anything to do with the Act)."</p>
<p>First of all Oakland next door is also NFZ, (according to a sign) FYI. Second, "the University denies that this had anything to do with the Act". They did? When? I think it's the other way around. They CLAIMED it's because of the Act, and what great (non-tax paying) lawabiding institution they are, whereas I believe the reason they were happy to get rid of it was that it freed up space for the computer building, which was much more of a growth area than nuclear engineering, and less of a protest draw. Likewise LBL research has been unclassified since the 1970s; NFZ includes "no designing weapons". Another opportunity to tout how benign LBL is. And the reference to the security fence is just to point out a certain mixture of mentalities jumbled together; add a certain feel to the place.</p>
<p>By the way, many Berkeley transients are actually homeful. All those visiting professors. The reasons that the homeless arrive (mild weather etc ) are same as for the homeful.</p>

<dd>Everything I saw said that they claimed it wasn't because of the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act (NFBA). If you have some evidence to the contrary please cite it; I seem to recall this from when I did some research on the history of the Act awhile back. LBL was moved to unclassified research long before the NFBA, of course, but has done "support work" over the years for the weapons labs despite this, including building parts of the <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/DARHT-one.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/DARHT-one.html" rel="nofollow">DARHT</a> at Los Alamos to simulate the conditions of nuclear testing. The University of California -- originally in University Hall, relocated in the 1990s to a newer, nicer building in Oakland, another NFZ -- maintains management over the activities of the two classified weapons labs, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory_d3fb.html" title="Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory">LLNL</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory_3e61.html" title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">LANL</a>, which continue to have weapons design and maintenance programs.</dd>
<dd>If you have a source for me to check where UCB claims they got rid of the reactor because of the NFBA, I'd be happy to track it down (non-internet sources are fine) and check it for myself.</dd>
<dd>I've never seen the University do anything in respect to the NFBA with the exception of alerting the City Manager when they would be transporting radioactive concrete through the city (when they dismantled the Bevatron). There is considerable legal ambiguity as to whether or not a municipal statute of that sort would trump a state university contracted with the federal government, and to my knowledge none of the punishments outlined in the NFBA (fines, prison) have ever been applied to the University even when in flagrant defiance. If you have evidence to the contrary, I'd love to see it, but from my own research I have a very different impression. But I'm willing to say I could be just mixed up, it has been a few years. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 22:11, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Quite interesting. I think we are agreeing that the REAL reason they got rid of Etch. reactor was NOT NFBA; we are only discussing what they SAID about it. I was only saying that they claimed it was because of the act, but that they WERE LYING. They may have said more than one thing. My recollection was that Chancelor Heyman, and this is from the Daily Cal, so it may be totally unreliable, said that the university would bow to the community's wishes, blah blah... Somewhere else it's very possible they said it was NOT because of NFBA, so as to maintain publically their claims of freedom from such kind of annoying laws from lower level entities like the city of Berkeley and its electorate. Don't want the wrong kind of precident, (as described in the LBL article on DARHT above.) So I suppose it is very likely that somewhere along the line they also said that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If it could be verified that Heyman said that, then the factually correct wording in the article would be "the University both claimed and denied it had anything to do with NFBA, depending on whom they were speaking to and what spin was appropriate." (What are the changes THAT statement would be accused of POV?)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as whether NFBA would apply in content, if it applied jurisdictionally, if DARHT is unclassified, then NFBA seems to not apply, and also no contradiction with stated policy at LBL of no classified research" (which I don't see stated anywhere; just in my memory?) Another interesting sidelight is it probably is the case that the Oakland NFZ law doesn't say anyone can't the _paymaster_ of nuke designers. So everything's legal and in conformance with the letter of the law. Which is the only thing that matters. 67.118.116.145 03:52, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC) (FastFission, I've enjoyed talking with you here and elsewhere.)</dd>

<dd>I have worked on political issues with the University of California for thirty years. I cannot recall the University ***ever** acknowledging local government control over their ability to do what they want. I can't remember the specifics on the closing of the Etcheverry reactor, but I doubt they would set a precedent and say they did it to be in compliance with NFBA.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If anyone wants to add it, the reactor was a Triga Mark III (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIGA" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIGA" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIGA</a>) reactor. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmosslee_f97d.html" title="User:Amosslee">Lee</a> 04:00, 5 January 2007 (UTC)amosslee</dd>

<p><a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a>, why are you repeatedly obliterating information from the transportation section of the article on Berkeley, California?

<dd>I'm definitely not pushing a pro-automobile POV (my personal opinion is more of a "The City of Berkeley makes it impossible to use cars within its limits yet doesn't provide adequate or reliable alternatives" take on things), but I don't see anything wrong with softening claims to the statistics which aren't backed up. Do you have evidence to suggest that Berkeley's high level of bicycle and pedestrian fatalies is nothing but a statistical anomaly? Do you have scientific reasons for thinking that a better metric is fatalies per mile (why not fatalies per bicyclist? divided by automobile usage? etc. etc.)? All I did was change the "softening" bit to something which was a little more accurate so far as I understand it (that it <i>might</i> be an anomaly, or it might not) both from the few things I've read about it and my own experience as both a pedestrian and a driver in Berkeley (in my opinion, it is lousy to be either there, but I'm trying to make a NPOV article). Anyway, I hope you'll see that 1. my own POV (which I'm trying to keep out of the article as much as possible) is NOT pro-automobile (it is pro-reliable public transportation), and 2. I'm trying to keep the article from over-stating how "wonderful" the pedestrian/bike situation is in Berkeley, because my own experience doesn't back it up, and more importantly the statistics don't back it up. All I'm trying to do is come up with something which is accurate and NPOV; if you think wording things differently would help that then I'm all ears. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 21:53, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, first you deleted "Berkeley has one of the highest rates of <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">Bicycle</a> and pedestrian commuting in the nation, and the lowest risk of injury for those cyclists and pedestrians.", and then when I added "This is to be expected since Berkeleyans spend a greater proportion of time traveling on foot and bicycle than those in other towns; a ranking by injuries per mile traveled would be more revealing of risk." to your replacement text, you essentially effaced that as well. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Forste_ec22.html" title="User:Eric Forste">Eric Forste</a> 04:20, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>First, I didn't "delete" that line. I changed the "lowest risk" part because it is inaccurate and cited my source; the statistics say exactly the opposite. Second, I didn't delete the second line, I simply changed it to something more honest: that the statistics <i>might</i> be an anomaly, but that isn't known for sure. Which I believe is true. Do you have a degree in something which would give you any real knowledge over what statistics would be useful? I don't. And I'm inclined to keep out things which say, "these numbers aren't revealing, because of X and Y" if I'm fairly sure that X and Y were just made up by the person writing them. I don't think injuries per mile is necessarily more revealing of the risk than would be injuries per cyclist or injuries per cyclist divided by the number of automobiles, etc. (and I have to admit I'm fairly suspicious of <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk_assessment.html" title="Risk assessment">risk assessment</a> as a field, anyway). Anyway, my point is: I didn't obliterate anything, I first removed a completely erroneous statement, and then I made more NPOV and accurate a statement which was trying to negate the cited statistics. If you have a good reason (i.e. a cited study) to think that it should be worded otherwise, I'm all ears! --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:32, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took this out for two reasons. First, I can't find anything to back it up. Property crimes are quite high, and violent crimes are relatively low. Second, it's brought up in the context of a mention of the homeless population (which is itself problematic). It states that the homeless population is the cause of the high crime rate, and I'm certain there are no facts to back up this assertion. Similarly, there is no evidence that the crime is caused by Oakland residents. (The hot spots for crime are south of campus and downtown, not near the Oakland border.) <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagringa_18d2.html" title="User:Lagringa">Lagringa</a> 10:28, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>About me:</b> <i>Billie Joe Armstrong is my name I live in Oakland C.A. with my wife of 11 years,Adrienne Nesser Armstrong, together we have two kids, Joseph and Jakob. My hometown is Berkeley C.A. and Rodeo C.A. where I was born . Mike and I met in the 5th grade, we've been friends eversince. When I was 14 I think, Mike and I formed A band called "SWEET CHILDREN"(yeah I know. shity name but it was cool back then.) We abandoned the name later,when we moved to Lookout Records. Green Day was the new name, no one knew why we called ourselves that.(it meant teens lacking and spending days smoking weed) Later in the past we kick ass and moved to Reprise Records, where we reside with now.We wern't a band for a couple of months since our old drummer quit. We were later introduced to Tre Cool , (Gilman street's little drummer boy) From then on Tre became Green Day's official drummer . School was not my thing back then I dropped out highschool. My hopes were up. Music was and is my thing! wishing my dream would be something great! my dream was and IS....

<dd>I can't believe you consider MySpace a reliable source. There is no reason to think Billie Joe Armstrong had anything to do with writing that. Reliable sources indicate that he was born in Oakland and raised in Rodeo. There is no evidence he ever lived or attended school in Berkeley.

<p>Tmangray, why did you change the climate information? It is simply untrue that spring and fall are the warmest seasons. The fact that summer is the warmest season is really easy to confirm. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagringa_18d2.html" title="User:Lagringa">Lagringa</a> 10:55, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In actuality, mid-summer is bracketed by warmer weather in Berkeley and most coastal locations affected by fog. The warmest weather on average AND by extremes in Berkeley occurs in September, which technically is partly in summer and partly in fall, but is usually thought of as a fall month generally. Hot dry winds also occur in late May and have also caused wildfires in drought years. They are the exact same phenomenom as that which occur in the fall, caused by the proximity of the storm track to the north. It would be misleading to tell people who haven't lived around here for a while that summer is warm in Berkeley. People who have lived here a long time know quite well about the sometimes long sieges of cool, cloudy-foggy weather that occur from June through August. In SF, they call it the "June Gloom". It's a pretty rare 4th of July that isn't socked in with fog and cold ocean winds. And most longtime Berkeleyans know well about those summertime Tilden Park picnics which end midafternoon with cold clammy breezes.<a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmangray_e746.html" title="User:Tmangray">Tmangray</a> 01:19, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The coordinates under the map on the right don't match Berkeley but the ones given in the geography section are better. I suggest changing the coordinates given with the map to match the ones in the article. (For the campanile on UC Campus - 37 degrees 52'19 N, 122 degrees 15'28 W.) Dafoster 03:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC) This hasn't been changed yet. If you go to Google Earth you will find that the coordinates given (37°58′18″N, 122°16′29″W) will put you several miles away out in the unpopulated hills of a different county (Contra Costa). Coordinates should match the ones in the body of the article - 37°52′18″N, 122°16′29″W (37.871775, -122.274603)GR1.</p>

I don't think condition of people has changed in 20 years, although others complain of people (homeless punks and philosophers or whatever); that hasn't changed either. Only one other bookstore closure (that I recall), was Shamballa. They blamed it on the internet sales and chain stores, (Barnes and Noble).

<p>The listing of Berkeley High School as Berkeley's <b>only</b> high school is incorrect. Berkeley has had an "alternative high school" at ML King and Derby Street for several decades. In the past five years (or so), it has gone through a name change to "Berkeley Alternative High School" and now "B-Tech" (can't remember what it stands for). Members of the staff and students do not appreciate it when BHS is called Berkeley's "only" high school. The campus historically was the "continuation school" (for truants), but no longer fills that role (at least explicitly), and has worked hard to get rid of the stigma of being the "school for bad kids." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmosslee_f97d.html" title="User:Amosslee">Amosslee</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/o/User_talk%7EAmosslee_d379.html" title="User talk:Amosslee">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Amosslee_b5ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/Amosslee">contribs</a>) 05:06, 8 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
