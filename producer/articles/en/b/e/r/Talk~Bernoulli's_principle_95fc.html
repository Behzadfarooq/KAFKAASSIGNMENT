Removed "There are other ways of understanding aerodynamic lift that many novices find more intuitive (see <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coanda_Effect_ee54.html" title="Coanda Effect">Coanda Effect</a>)." The Coanda effect is <b>not</b> a valid explanation of airfoil lift - it is completely explained by the existence of a bound vortex, and can be fully explained in the absence of viscosity (i.e., potential flow); Bernoulli's equation is a convenient way of relating the pressure and velocity at one point to another point as an <i>inviscid</i> fluid moves from one place to another (i.e from upstream to above/below a wing). Fluid-dynamic lift is independent of the completely viscous corner-turning Coanda effect, which is actually a type of vectored thrust. --<a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnotnic_e4c5.html" title="User:Knotnic">Knotnic</a> 00:37, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some corrections... 1) the coanda effect has nothing to do with viscosity. A gas will follow a curved surface, because if it doesnt, then it leaves the surface... and as it flows past the surface, it drags out some of the stationary gas between the moving gas stream and the fixed surface. This continues until there is no stationary gas between the two. In reality, we dont have this detached-then-reatached behaviour. Any tendency for the gas flow to leave the surface immediately results in the gas in the stationary pocket being dragged out. Coanda effect only explains why the gas (or liquid) WILL follow a convex surface. That gas diversion and the gas diversion under a wing explains ALL of the effect of wing lift. No other explanation is necessary. Several other mathematical relationships exist, but they do not explain how a wing works. The Bernoulli equation will give a precise relationship between the gas velocity and pressure etc. and this is often assumed to show that it this explanation for wing lift is correct. It is not correct because the assumed cause and effect relationship is invalid. It is the pressure differences that cause the velocity profile, not visa vers.</p>
<p>2) the Bernoulli equation is an energy balance equation. It states that the energy at all points in a steady state flow will have the same energy. It does not say any one item causes the other.</p>
<p>3) No mass EVER accelerates without an applied net force. In gasses, this means that the acceleration (Change in velocity) of any particle of gas is ALWAYS the result of the pressure gradient along the flow path. Common sense (as well as complex physics proof)shows that where the velocity distribution is entirely the result of the pressure gradient, the pressure gradient cannot be the result of the velocity gradient.</p>
<p>The confusion relatated to venturi effect and Bernoulli that has reinforced this plethora of incorrect derived associated theory, is because it is difficult to understand how the lowest pressure in a venturi can be lower than any externally applied pressure. The function is easier to understand if you consider air as a bunch of lumps each having mass, and each being pushed uppon by other surrounding air acting like springs in all directions. Now simplify the model further... a row of masses with springs between them. All springs in compression. If we push one end toward the middle, we would expect the whole assembly to start moving. If we apply a restriction (some drag force) to one of the mass's in the middle, and continue pushing the mass at one end, then we get a build up in the spring compression on one side (increase in prssure). Now allow the restricted mass to escape, grabbing the next one as it gets to your restriction. The released one, jumps away.. and if we kept everything else still, that released one would then jump back and vibrate back and forth. BUT if we were to allow the next mass to go just as the first one was as far away from the second as possible, then there is less spring force difference to make the second one spring back. If we continue this rapidly and continuously we will have each succesive mass moving faster, and having less spring force on both sides of it, than all of the springs started with. This model would gradually reach a state of dynamic equilibreum. If we then added a controlled movement rate to the exit side of this model, we would similarly find that the fast moving middle masses with lightly compressed springs between them would slow and join the exit flow, and the springs between them would compress back to the initial level because it took a certain level of force, and absorbed energy to slow each of the moving masses.</p>
<p>If you want to prove or disprove any of this model of the venturi. Go back to first principles. Consider one atom, or one cubic millimetre of air. Then as WHY will it change speed. Why will it change pressure. If you really think about the cause and effect relationships, your answers will not include the word Bernoulli. F=ma adequately, simply, and completely describes all such gas flows without exception. It also describes all sub sonic wing lift without circulation theory, without using the word Coanda, and without the need for maths. Dave Fowler B.E.(Mech) UNSW M APESMA</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The article has been listed as A class, however I would consider myself to have a reasonably good grasp of Bernoulli's principle and how it applies to general fluid flow, however I must admit the layout and content of the article seemed unclear to me. I was going to mark this with a cleanup tag, then i spotted the A class rating! I was somewhat surprised by this, especially when a reasonably non intuitive effect such as that of a Venturi nozzle was not given a diagram in its section (for example). Also uses/examples appear before an explanation of what it Bernoulli's principle is.</p>
<p>It is also not made clear that Bernoulli's is a way of accounting for the energy components of a fluid, perhaps something (very roughly) along the lines of</p>
<p><b>Bernoulli's principle is an important principle in fluid mechanics, it arises from the consideration of the different forms that energy can take in a fluid. There are several key forms for which a fluid can take, kinetic, pressure and gravitational potential. Bernoulli's principle implies that all these forms of energy (in an ideal fluid) must be conserved. This means that if there is an increase in velocity (kinetic energy, say over the top surface of a wing when compared to the lower surface) the energy must have been obtained from somewhere, and if no work is performed on the fluid, the fluid itself must have converted another form of energy into that increase in velocity, in this case pressure. Furthermore it explains why fluids can flow downhill (but not why, that requires the use of entropy)</b> and so on.. HI72.10.127.110 17:50, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am a physics student and my egineering/physics instructor was talking about how bernoulli's equation is pretty much crap and most of the stuff you learn about it doesn't apply to most cases. He was explaining how just about the only case that it applies to would be something like mercury flowing through a glass pipe because in that situation mercury has very low friction with itself and it doesn't compress easily and the adhesive forces and friction forces with the glass are extremely low. Otherwise you have adhesive forces and friction which completely change how the liquid flows and completely destroy how bernoulli's equation works.</p>
<p>He also explained how it can't be used for airfoil lift at all because the air compresses and is of course viscous and it has adhesive forces with the wing. Rather instead what causes the lift is a high pressure center above the wing toward the front and a lower pressure center toward the back and lower and that pressure difference causes a downward vector force which thus has an equal and oppsite compression on the wing moving the wing upwards. This seemed to explain lift much better than the age old, "The air splits and goes over the wing and because the distance across the top is longer the air has to speed up and this causes a lower pressure at the top and it sucks the wing up." For what reason if any does the air have to speed up? There is no reason what so ever why the same air that splits at the beginning of the wing has to meet up at the end of the wing.</p>
<p>Someone correct me if I am wrong on all this but this seems seriously messed up here. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgzay_4ae0.html" title="User:Ergzay">Ergzay</a> 18:17, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as i understand, the air over the top speeds up argument has been clearly proven incorrect. This is due to the fact that there is no need for a given set of air to "meet up" at the back of the wing, thus there is no need to speed up. So you are correct. There is a more complex analysis, of which I have not got to understanding sufficiently. However what I can say is that when solving the Navier stokes equation for a 2D wing, then calculating the integral of pressure over the wing, you do end up with an upwards force on the wing. The exact reason for this to me is somewhat unclear, but is definitely an effect predicted by Navier-Stokes in a steady state turbulent flow scenario (and is clearly a function of angle of attack).</dd>

<dd>Furthermore Bernoulli's equation is not "crap", but it definitely has assumptions built into it. You can actually take into account viscous losses as a "friction work" factor, which can then be calculated theoretically in the case of laminar flow, or you can work it out using correlations based around Reynold's number. Just remember that many calculations we do are simply a useful model of what is really going on, and this is also true here. Bernoulli's equation is a great way to figure out how much shaft work you need to drive low velocity newtonian fluids up a hill for example, and also predicts the siphoning effect User A1 14:28, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
