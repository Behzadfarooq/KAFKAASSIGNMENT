<p>Hi Beru, thanks for commenting on the Stade Français article. I think what you said about the sports-club (soccer etc) needs to be mentioned, but I think it would work better if there was a <i>Stade Français (disambiguation</i> link at the top of the Stade Français article, as opposed to moving Stade Français to Stade Français CASG, and making Stade Français a disambiguation. The only reason is that no one in the Englishh-speaking media refers to Stade Français as Stade Français CASG or Stade Français Paris, so I think the club name needs to stay at Stade Français. What else do you think we can do to improve the page? Thanks again. <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 06:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Cvene! I think you're absolutely right about the disambiguation link. What should guide us is usage, and as you say, in Britain, it's just Stade Français. In fact, I'm pretty sure that it's the same over here — I doubt many people know it's a much bigger sports club because the rugby is standing above the rest.</dd>
<dd>&gt;What else do you think we can do to improve the page?</dd>
<dd>Not much! I think that the page is real good and that it has reached the point where anything more will be superfluous. I read the page attentively and it looks real nice. I must have edited a couple of things about the squad, but it was just because it felt good to!! If that's OK with you, I'll deal with the disambig + a SF “multisports” page when I get back from holiday. I'm leaving today for 10 days. (Yummy!)&#160;:¬))</dd>
<dd>Any ways, thanks a lot for you msg. I'm new around here as a member although I've been contributing anonymously on the French WP for a year or so. A welcome from the old boys is always appreciated. LOL. BTW Stade won 45-13 last night... Best regards from Paris, Beru91 07:26, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Beru, thanks for replying. Yeah, I guess the page is pretty complete, it just needs full references, and maybe a section on Colours/jersey/logo would make it fully complete. I don't know enough about it, but maybe you could start a section, and describe what their jerseys look like and what the colours and logo represent? That would be fantastic if you get the chance.</dd>

It's great to have a French rugby fan over here on the english version, you guys over there have done a very good job with all the player profiles that have been created! Anyay, enjoy your holiday!

<dd>Hi Cvene! Thanks a lot for your comments. As you may have seen, I added a section on the colours, a hot topic when it comes to Stade, and on the various controversies engendered by the club. Would you proofread it and correct the language if need be? Other suggestions will be appreciated. I also joined the list of contributors at #46... I'm also creating the missing Pro D clubs. I did Oyonnax and corrected several others, but I've got work to do, so it's taking some time... Holiday was fun—thanks!!&#160;:¬))Beru91 17:56, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wow! That was a fantastic effort Beru, you really did a great job. The article pretty much looks complete now, unless there is any info at al that can be added during the 50 years the spent in the lower divisions. Also, do you have any references (website, books) that we can use in the article? But yeah, excellant job, and good work on creating the Pro D2 clubs. Thanks for joining the project as well. Keep up the good work! <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 23:55, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey Beru hows it going? I was wondering if you have any advice on how the SF History section can be expanded and become more detailed? and do you have any images or anything else you could add to the article? Thanks <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 17:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was looking at all the sporting clubs that are featured articles, and I thought it would be a good idea to split off a History article, and then making the history section on the main page more of a summary. The finals results tables could also be moved into a new history article. And the other thing that could be useful is a list of records and statistics...Anyway, have fun at the game! <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 18:34, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Beru, I was wondering if you would be able to help with the creation of two articles, the Coupe de France and the Coupe de l'Espérance. I understand that the Coupe de l'Espérance was played instead of the normal championship during the war? and the Coupe de France was something else played until 1999 or something? Do you know much about these competitions? I can't really find anything on them in English, so I thought maybe you could have a go?

<dd>Hey, I just saw all the pages you created, and they are great, your English is very very good. Thanks a lot for doing that! Sorry you did not get to the Stade-Biarritz game! I did'nt even get it on TV! We only get Heineken Cup in Australia. That is so great that they broke the crowd record again, amazing! Umm, there is something I have been looking for, but havent found yet, which is records for the club? For example, most games, most tries, most points, largest win and largest loss etc? Is there anywhere we can find those? Also, great job with updating the Toulon page, it looks a lo better now! All the French teams are starting to look really good now. Cheers. <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 02:53, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey Beru, I just read the page on Yves, great job! Your contributions here are really appreciated! As for creating clubs on the English wiki, do you mean 5th division as in Federale 3? I think that would be ok. I would not go any lower than Federale 3 though. If you want to creat clubs, please do so, but if you dont want people to try and delete them or anything, just make sure there are always a few pages that link to them so it looks like the article is useful. And always try and write at least a paragraph or so, and be sure to categorize it. But yeah, Federale 3 is fine! Although I dont think we even have a Federale 3 page yet, so we should probably create that first. Also, if you are looking for something to update (like Toulon), check out <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montpellier_H%C3%A9rault_RC_3bfc.html" title="Montpellier Hérault RC">Montpellier Hérault RC</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/_/SC_Albi_93c2.html" title="SC Albi">SC Albi</a>, they are currently the shortest articles for the Top 14 sides. And on SF, I understand what you mean, so dont worry about looking for records etc as that sort of information is not widely available, so I guess its not that important to the article. By the way, Rugby World Cup is going on the Main Page of Wikipedia on Oct. 24, so watch out for that! Just out of interest, are you going to games at the 2007 World Cup? Cheers. <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 11:00, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey Beru, do you think we should write a new paragraph on the SF article about their rivalries with other teams? Kind of like the one in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland_Reds_0693.html" title="Queensland Reds">Queensland Reds</a>? Cheers. <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 16:38, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey again, just wanted t o say that you have done a really great job with the SF page, so thanks a lot for all your contributions, they are really appreciated. And soryr, I did'nt realise you were talking about the french wiki, so in that case I would say it is definantly acceptable, the english wiki has heaps of American, Australian etc clubs that play in low divisions, so I think it is ok. I have also been writing some history sections for some of the other clubs, such as Bayonne and Bourgoin, but they are pretty basic as I'am basically just describing their finals results, so yeah, check those out if you get any time. Cheers. Good luck with the France v All Blacks/Pumas games coming up, are you going to any? <a href="../../../c/v/e/User%7ECvene64_22d8.html" title="User:Cvene64">Cvene64</a> 18:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hey, yeah I read about Umaga's debut. Hopefully Toulon can start winning a lot more games, as there was a lot of hype about the team this season. I'll be watch all the French Tests as well, as basically all the November Tests are on tv, so it should be great, and yeah the French are doing very well in the Heineken Cup at the moment.

<dd>Hi, thanks for fixing the colours, and wow, great work with rewriting the Racing Club history and identity! The page looks fantastic now. I started the Anthony Herbert article as well, and please let me know if there are any other articles you want created. Again, thanks a lot for putting so much work into French rugby articles. I worked on almost all of the Top 14 and some Pro D2 clubs the other day, writing history sections and so on, but there could be a few errors here and there as there is not a lot of resources in english on the internet.
