<p>is that quote from counterpunch truly necessary?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree the <i>Counterpunch</i> quote is superfluous. I myself actually subscribe to <i>Counterpunch</i>, and I might even agree with the quote. But the fact that someone, somewhere, criticized Sanders doesn't seem relevant to his bio... I'm sure we could find a thousand other critical comments from various sources.</dd>
<dd>That said, if someone developed a subsection along the lines of "Sanders' relationship with the American Left" or the like, that might be interesting. As the only self-described socialist in Congress, it's probably interesting to know the range of opinions socialists/leftists have about him, and how he interacts with that group. But a subsection would need more than one snippy comment. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:17, 2005 May 16 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Human cloning is not a "conservative" issue. Most of Congress supports a reproductive cloning ban. If Sanders supports a theraputic cloning ban, then he would be taking the conservative side.

<p>Regarding the recently removed and replaced section on benefits, its original research and POV to find one place where Sanders criticized Bush for cutting benefits in 2005 and then use a White House release from 2006 to say this is untrue. This implies Sanders lied, which is POV unless very well supported. Also, this is bad original research. Bush may have intended to cut benefits and 2005, but, by 2006, the situation changed. Also, the White House likes to use favorable numbers, so I White House press release isn't sufficient for proving Sanders wrong.--<a href="../../../b/k/w/User%7EBkwillwm_a550.html" title="User:Bkwillwm">Bkwillwm</a> 01:39, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The section on benfits has been restored as there is no POV here. The citation of Sanders' critque is from a signed Sanders written peice. The White House release citation is a Budget Report from the White House Office of Budget and Management. These are not "made-up". Wether Sanders told the truth or did not is up to the reader to determine, the entry makes no such claim. What is pure speculation on the editor's part is wether Bush did in fact attempt to cut benefits in 2005, or exactly what may or may not have changed by 2006. Please do not vandalize entries on speculation without proper citation. <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.161.193.55.html" title="User:71.161.193.55">User:71.161.193.55</a></p>

<dd>I offered a link already saying that his plan cuts benefits <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/front/topstories/story/4629906p-4297561c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thenewstribune.com/front/topstories/story/4629906p-4297561c.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The way the facts are presented are also very POV. "Bernie says A, when in fact B" (implication: he's a liar) though all you have provided as proof is a Bush administration White House report. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPasboudin_5716.html" title="User:Pasboudin">Pasboudin</a> 03:34, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Your Link, actually provides the opposite, Pasboudin. The Article there, which is in regard to a common news item of it's time, that the Bush Administration was looking to cut Veteran's Benefits in time of war. However, the article itself says , "At a series of hearings on Capitol Hill last week, administration officials defended their veterans budget, saying it would increase spending by $880 million, or 2.2 percent, even as the federal deficit mounts.". The author of the article apparently is either saying Bush is wrong for cutting benefits, or he is wrong for allowing increases in deficits. Either way, your article itself demonstrates POV and is therefore not valid.</p>
<p>Bernie in fact does have a history of being controversially aggressive in his oppostion to certain policies and people whith whom he does not agree. This is well documented, and if you like, I'd be happy to add 20 examples on the article, instead of three. Or, if you prefer 200.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're confusing cuts to individual types of benefits with cuts to the entire veterans budget. Sanders criticizes the loss of individual benefits and the requirement of enrollment fees. He also says "veterans programs are underfunded." No where does he say Bush intended to cut the entire veterans budget. The article Pasboudin posted lists several examples of cuts to individual benefits. Also, the 2.2% increase in the overall budget you mention would not have covered the 3.2% inflation in 2005<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Econ" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Econ" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which would be an effective overall cut in the budget anyway. Please, feel free to list other examples of people criticizing Sanders for being overly agressive, but this example is bad. For future reference, an article that demonstrates POV can still be used. You White House source definitely has POV. Also, reverting something someone reasonably considers to be POV is not vandalism. You can't use this to avoid the three revert rule. Keep this in mind for your sake.--<a href="../../../b/k/w/User%7EBkwillwm_a550.html" title="User:Bkwillwm">Bkwillwm</a> 05:32, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So then, if you feel additional information is nescessary, add it instead of erasing my, true, correct information. I see no POV which may be reasonably inferred, so therefore, it is vandalism. Once again, refrain from threats. If you beleive there is cause for complaint, make one. I'm sure administrators of Wiki will see things for what they are. User:71.161.193.55 --5 April 2006</p>

Removed ", when in fact, Federal Government benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs increased from 2001 to 2006 by 57%.<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/veterans.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/veterans.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> ". This confuses the issue of benefits per disabled vet with the number of disabled vets as well as that of overall vet benefits and disability benefits. Government disability benefit payments have increased because of a greater number of disabled veterans as a result of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmadeust_8809.html" title="User:Amadeust">Amadeust</a> 16:51, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
As it was, the statement might as well have said, "Bernie Sanders accused the administration of actively trying to cut the price of fruit, when in fact the price of apples increased from 2001 to 2006 by 57%", except that the specificity of apples was left out. One has little to do with the other. The statement assigns motive to a trend and leaving out the specificity behind the statistic makes the statement factually incorrect. The statement in its entirety is misinformation. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmadeust_8809.html" title="User:Amadeust">Amadeust</a> 21:06, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On April 6th, Pasboudin made a heavy edit to the article, erasing a number of factual examples of events in regard to Sanders' positions with the Bush Administration. Pasboudin explained with, "is this a wikipedia entry or richard tarrant's campaign site?" (see history). He gives no further explaination, and thus shows his intent is to inject POV in violation of wiki rules. The examples given are factual, have citations, and are not disputed by Pasboudin. He has erased these examples serveral times, showing further intent to vandalize the article.</p>
<p>The examples given are not only cited, most citations come directly from Sanders' own website, and use direct quotes from him as their basis. I cannt think of any more neutral examples of a person's beliefs and positions than their own words! My suggestion is that should Pasboudin disgaree with the examples cited, he add his own rather than erasing others' work. -- User 71.161.193.55</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Talk%7EBernie_Sanders_8db9.html" title="Edit section: POV dispute">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">POV dispute</span></h2>
<p>I removed sections I saw as POV, but tried to leave what I could in. Generally, the phrasing is a criticism of Sanders that does not belong here. For one this is a section on Sanders's relations with the Bush administration section, not a criticism section. Two, these sections generally imply that Sanders is a liar. This is not good practice. If Sanders has lied, please cite a source making this accusation. Digging up Sanders's comments and then citing information and saying it contradicts Sanders (which in this case is a hard argument to make) violates POV. Also, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/detail.10001007.2005.html" class="external text" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/detail.10001007.2005.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a> does not mention an intention to migrate people from Commodity Supplemental Food Program.</p>
<p>Please do not accuse other users of vandalism over a POV dispute. See <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> for what vandalism is.--<a href="../../../b/k/w/User%7EBkwillwm_a550.html" title="User:Bkwillwm">Bkwillwm</a> 05:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Simply because comments or observations are critical of Sanders does not indicate POV. In fact, exactly the opposite is true, in that, only allowing comments which cast Sanders in a positive light does indicate POV. The editor I refer to, Pasboudin, states the reason for his edit is that the Sanders article resembles Rich Tarrant's campaign website. What I attempted to do in adding additional information regarding Sanders is to present multiple POV's so as to retain neutrality, a wikipedia goal. If information listed indicates Sanders is a liar, yet is accurate, then any reader may reach the conclusion that he is. That's up to the reader.</p>
<p>Take the latest addition regarding Commodity Food Program. Sanders did make the comments attributed to him. He does fail to mention the migration plan, which is cited in the reference. Therefore, remving it because it does not meet with your political approval is vandalism. Hence I call Vandalism when it occurs.---User 71.161.193.55</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reference you provided makes no mention of a Commodity Food Program. I searched the page for "commodity" and that word isn't even used. If Sanders failed to mention it, you should probably find a source that says its true. Anyway, this isn't the place to criticize politicians for failing to mention things. If they are criticized in other sources, it's worth reporting. But Wikipedia isn't the best place for original criticisms. Also, in general, Sanders seems to be speaking of cuts in individual benefits while you are saying that the overall program funding increased. This is VERY misleading. In fact, in the Sanders's HUD article he says "At a time when Congress increased funding for the administration of the Section 8 rental assistance program by 15%, it is unconscionable that HUD unilaterally decided to cut this program for Vermont Housing Authorities by 13 to 19 percent." Otherwise, he acknowledges that Section got a funding increase, but criticized the administration for cutting a specific program. You make it seem like the funding increase for Section 8 contradicts what Sanders said. This exteremely misleading and disingenious. Please do not spread misinformation on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../b/k/w/User%7EBkwillwm_a550.html" title="User:Bkwillwm">Bkwillwm</a> 07:58, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The citation of reference is listed after the note of an increase in Food Stamp spending, and therefore the article does not need to mention the Commodity Food Program. The source does indicate an increase in that program, and therefore is a correct citation. I did not critize Sanders for not mentioning, he simply did not. Therefore, the statement remains correct and unbiased. You are correct in that Sanders use of mentioning cuts in specific spending while failing to note overall increases in general program spending is misleading, which is why it merits notation. I have no issue with the inclusion of additional quotes from Sanders in the article itself, please add them there instead of the talk page.</p>
<p>Your observation that Sanders notes a cut "Since" the Administration cut one specfic program is speculative, and is POV, please do not include it. You have no idea why Sanders chose to say it. I agree misinformation hould not be part of Wiki, that is why I attempt to show a balanced view. --User 71.161.193.55</p>

<dd>You accuse me of being "speculative" about Sanders's reasoning for claiming cuts in the Section 8 program. However, my interpretation is based on reading his article in which he acknowledges that there has been an overall increase in the program but then refers to a specific Vermont program. I am not speculating, just following what the source you provided says. You, however, are speculating when you say "One may conclude Sanders intends to create the belief that Bush has little regard for the welfare of seniors and the poor." This statement follows Sanders's criticism of the Commodity Food Program and implies the purpose of this criticism. This is far worse speculation and it's POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I clarified Sander's argument in the Section 8 press release stating that he never claims an overall decrease in Section 8 funding, and I give one of his stated reasons for criticizing the Bush Administration's management of HUD. Why did you feel that this should be removed? It only clarified what otherwise might come across as POV.--<a href="../../../b/k/w/User%7EBkwillwm_a550.html" title="User:Bkwillwm">Bkwillwm</a> 19:31, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reference to concerns of Vermont Authorities in ths article is inappropriate, as the article is on Bernie Sanders, and the section itself is relations with Bush Adminstration, not with Vermont Officials. The Sanders' quote regarding the Section 8 program is that Bush is dismantling it, and does not speak about any specific program, therefore later comments by Sanders do not alter that. As stated before, by all means add additional information you regard as relevant, without vandalizing others' work. The note that Sanders is trying to frame Bush as uncaring is noted directly in the text of the article, and therefore is not speculative. What one concludes is up to them, and is not POV.</p>
<p>Actually Bkwillwm, you do not provide any stated reason, as the quote referenced, "cannot comprehend what goes on in the mind..." was added by me. I did not remove any quote from Sanders placed by anyone. Please refrain from additional vandalism. --User 71.161.193.55</p>

<dd>The program Sanders talks about is a Vermont part of Section 8. He claims that they have gotten a funding cut while Section 8 has increased funding nationally. The article which is the source for your quote is entitled <a href="http://bernie.house.gov/documents/releases/20040520150051.asp" class="external text" title="http://bernie.house.gov/documents/releases/20040520150051.asp" rel="nofollow">"SANDERS BLASTS BUSH’S HOUSING SECRETARY ON HOUSING CUTS IN VERMONT"</a> This article obviously deals with the state cuts, and not including the information takes the quote out of context. As for the speculation that Sanders is trying to frame Bush as uncaring, what article do you mean? You do not cite an article but instead a video as the source of the quotation.</dd>

<p>Saying something is a NPOV dispute, does not make it so. If I had said "Bernie lies about Bush", that would be POV. If you had changed the items in question in a way that you felt more neutral, that would be a fair edit, perhaps. However, simply yanking half the paragraph in such a way that it removes both the overall context of the statement, and only presents Sanders point of view without that of his target, IS POV, and is [Vandalism]. You are not adding anything, you are simply removing it, and one the parts you don't like.</p>
<p>I appriciate your effort to actually edit, rather than remove, the Supplimental Food Program item, and I have further reivsed the language, taking into account your specific concern.

<p>Great, now you're editing my talk here, too. Bottom line is, you love Sanders, and don't wish anything critical said about him. Too bad, start your own blog. All you've done so far is remove what I've added, claiming it is biased or makes Sanders look bad. I'm using direct quotes from Sanders, backing up each comment with a verifiable source, and giving both sides of the issue. If that makes Sanders look bad, tough. He is what he is, he is confrontational and controversial, and proud of both. What I see as vandalsim is repeatedly removing the same lines time after time, despite explainations that these lines are accurate and why. There is no personal attack, however you are rsponsible for what you do.</p>
<p>Criticism of Sanders, or any public official is fair game. However, what I've written is balanced, and sourced. The quote from Sanders regarding Food Stamp cuts does not reference Vermont. If you wish to add a Vermont quote to the appropriate section, do so, by all means. Wether Sanders is a liar or not remains up to the reader, I give facts, not conclusions. My suggestion that Sanders intends to cast Bush as uncaring is referenced BY A SANDERS' QUOTE which indicates this. I go by what Sanders says, not what may or may not be inferred.</p>

<dd>The quote about Section 8 is from a press release in response to cuts to the Vermont Housing Authority. I have tried to put the quote in context, saying that it is, in part a response to this cut, AND also indictating that funding for Section 8 increased this year. Without a reference to the Vermont housing cut, it makes it seem like Sanders is criticizing Bush for cuts that haven't been made. This isn't the case and is selective use (and abuse) of the quotation and information. Also, you speculate, "One may conclude Sanders intends to create the belief that Bush has little regard for the welfare of seniors and the poor." However, nowhere in the quote does Sanders say he intends to create this belief. He only says that he cannot comprehend this situation. Also, your transcription of the quote was inaccurate. I provided another.

<p>Sorry, once again, you insert your opinion (POV) into why Bernie spoke regarding the CSFP, saying it was because of Vermont cuts. You have no idea why he spoke, and there is no supporting reference. Also, the quote refers Sanders accusing Bush of trying to "dismantle the Section 8 rental assistance program one piece at a time", when that simply isn't factual and is misleading. If you beleive it is selective, add to it, don't erase it. Don't accuse me of "abuse of information", whatever that is.</p>
<p>Says you, the quote is inaccurate, I say it is not only accurate, it is precisly verbatim. You repeatedly revert what I added despite my request that you add to, and not erase or replace, what has been written. You continue to claim that my writing is POV, when it actually presents both sides of the issue, and each quote is fully referenced for accuracy. I call you a vandal, because that's what you are. Not only that, I deeply resent you reporting me to wiki for "refusing to this discuss seriously". For that reason, I will no longer explain myself to you, since it appears that is a waste of time. --user 71.161.193.55</p>

<p>In trying to reach compromise on this section, I posted a new verision of the text which I think should be satisfactory. I removed "Sanders fails to mention" since this is POV language, but I included the fact that the Bush administration attempts to migrate some of the CSFP users. I also removed "One may conclude Sanders intends to create the belief that Bush has little regard for the welfare of seniors and the poor." This is also POV, and no where in the quote cited by the anon IP does Sanders say he intends to create any belief. Also, I changed the text of the "cannot comprehend" quote, since the original transcribed verision is inaccurate (the source for the quote is an audio clip).

<p>Claimed non-NPOV in Straightinfo's verision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes the mention of Section 8 benefits out of context. Sanders's press release acknowledges overall increases in funding to the program, but he mainly criticizes the cuts to his state under the program. Leaving this out implies Sanders criticism is unfounded since Bush has increased funding to the program overall.</li>
<li>The Veteran's benefits section contains another criticism by Sanders that Bush has cut benefits to soldiers (this has been cited in past verisions as true), but the supposedly POV verision says that Bush actually increased funding to the program, implying Sanders lied or was wrong. However, this confuses cuts to benefits (specific payments paid out to soldiers) with funding for the entire program.</li>
<li>The section on food supplements also has the pattern of implied contradictions that missuse citations. It also includes POV language like "While it is correct to say that the program is eliminated by the proposed FY2007 budget, Sanders fails to mention the Administration's intention to migrate clients of CSF program to the Food Stamp Program." I have replaced this with other language and a more accurate transcription of the cited source (a Sanders video).</li>
</ul>
<p>Straightinfo has not attempted to compromise on these NPOV policy complaints and has argued that his verision is fine. Straightinfo has solicited comments on this issue. He, and I, would like to know if my complaints of NPOV violations are justified and which verision (including other alternative verisions) of this section is desirable.--<a href="../../../b/k/w/User%7EBkwillwm_a550.html" title="User:Bkwillwm">Bkwillwm</a> 03:15, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Claimed POV in Bkwillwm's version:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Sanders acutally claims that Bush is systematically tearing down section 8, check the referenced link. Sanders does speak about cuts in Vermont, but this section is about relations with Bush, not with Vermont Housing. In fact, Vermont Housing ultimately recieved no such cut. That Bkwillwm admits that Bush increased funding to Section 8 makes it awfully difficult that it may be POV to say so.</li>
<li>I have seen no version which demonstrates that Bush has cut any benefits to any veteran, at least in an objective way, such as a budget document. I have seen concerns that this might be true, but nothing to indicate that it in fact is. Once again, I am making an attempt to be NPOV by presenting both sides. Bkwillwm does not feel presenting both sides is appropriate, which baffles me.</li>
<li>In the section on food suppliments, Bkwillwm feels I "misuse" citations. I don't even understand what that means. Either the citation says what I say it says, or it doesn't. Including accurate citations cannot be a "misuse". I further don't understand what is POV about "It is correct to say.." when , well, it is correct. Bkwillwm does not take issue with the accuracy, only that it one may or may not make conclusions regarding Sanders after reading the information. Oh, and the "more accurate transcription" is that he added another line to the quote. The quote was accurate to begin with.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not really sure what compromise I'm supposed to make when the reverts consist of just erasing comments with little explaination. Would just leaving a list of Sanders' complaints with no alternatate views be a compromise? That sounds like a recipe for NPOV to me. Curiously, Bkwillwm takes no issue with a balanced approach taken in the Relations with House section, which was not written by me. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStraightinfo_a157.html" title="User:Straightinfo">Straightinfo</a> 00:07, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Many</b> citations used by Straightinfo are wrong. They don't apply to the statements at hand and therefore, I have gone through and removed them. Simply citing something doesn't make it useful. The citation has to be in context and actually support the statement. None of the following citations apply. When I challenged Straightinfo about them, I only got reverted with a comment that he was fixing the "vandalism".</p>
<ul>
<li>The latter part of the statement, "<i>In 2004, the Congressman accused President Bush of attempting to "dismantle the Section 8 rental assistance program one piece at a time" [6], despite approval of a budget for that program of $1.8 billion over what the administration had requested that year.[7]</i>" is actually negated by the citation because it shows that the House-Senate Conference Committee approved a budget <i>larger</i> than that requested by the Bush administration. This would support Sanders' notion that the Bush administration was trying to underfund it! Therefore, the word despite makes the statement false. The citation supports Sanders position and not the Bush administration's. I have trimmed the statement back until it was a true statement again.</li>
<li>The statement, "<i>Further, in a piece written for TPM Cafe.com [8], Sanders accused the Bush Administration of "actively trying to cut veterans benefits", when in fact, Federal Government benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs increased from 2001 to 2006 by 57%.[9]</i>" is plain false. The citation is taken completely out of context as it refers to the increase in veteran disability payments over that period and not overall veteran benefits of which disability benefits are only a part. Disability payment increases have been due to the increase in disabled veterans during this period due to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and not due to the Bush administrations work in raising per veteran level of disability coverage. This entire statement has disappeared recently but I will include without the latter part and citation because it supports the "Relations with the Bush Administration" section.</li>
<li>The statement, "<i>However, it should be noted that the suggestion of Bush's involvment comes from indicted former Vice-Presidental aide, Scooter Libby,and there is no wide acceptance of this allegation as fact.[14]</i>" is no longer current since Bush himself has recently stated that he declassified the document in question. Besides that, nowhere in citation 14 did it state that "there is no wide acceptance of this allegation as fact" which is why the citation is there in the first place. This is a citation that does not support its statement.</li>
<li>I am not motivated enough to put in the time to research the Commodity Supplemental Food Program paragraph but given Straightinfo's prior edits, have doubt about his position on this.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issues I raise are not POV issues to me. They are issues of factual accuracy. There is simply no support in the citations given and in one instance the citation actually supports the opposite of what was stated. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmadeust_8809.html" title="User:Amadeust">Amadeust</a> 01:10, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No challenge was issued to me or anyone else that I know of about the citations I listed for the Sanders Article. Simply, when I read the article, it was noted by [User:Amadeust|Amadeust] that the citations were "bad", and portions of the article just disappeared. Therefore, I felt the article had been vandalized, and restored the missing portions.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>As the citation in Section 8 comment does not in any way refer to the House-Senate commitee, what they did or did not do is not relevant to that section. Also, had they in fact, passed a larger budget than had been recommended, that fact would not change in any way wether Bush been tring to dismantle anything, and therefore the comment remains true and acurate in its' entirety as was posted prior to the erasure.</li>
<li>Sanders did say Bush was actively trying to cut veteran's benefits, as Amaduest points out, but then claims the statement regarding increases in benefits is untrue. However, his explanation says that increases are related to payments made were made to Afghanistan and Iraq War veterans. If this is true, then we both agree that benefits <i>Italic text</i>were<i>Italic text</i> increased, and therefore the statement erased is quite accurate.</li>
<li>The statement about the disclosure and Libby's claim that Bush was involved say Sanders says Bush did so "to discredit an Iraq War critic". Since Bush did not indiciate that to be the case, and no court has made any determination as to why Bush may have declassified that information, it is not generally accepted that Sanders' statement is factual.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As I have stated above to BKwillwm several times, each statement in the Relations with Bush Administration are well cited and each citation relates directly to, and clearly demonstrates the accuracy of, the statement it supports, as anyone reading them will plainly see. The statements are there to indicate both sides of each controversy and maintain NPOV. It appears Amadeust is not an advocate of the Bush Administration, and does not enjoy seeing statements which may serve to support it, however, in order to maintain the neutrality of Wikipedia, it is essential that they be included. To Amadeust, I would suggest, that you contribute to, rather than eliminate, portions of an article with which you disagree, in that way, Wikipedia becomes a more useful source of information to all. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStraightinfo_a157.html" title="User:Straightinfo">Straightinfo</a> 15:54, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've consolidated it with the equally misnamed "relationship with house democrats" section. -- FRCP11 19:55, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for the slow response.</p>
<p>In regards to "User:Straightinfo, who only recently created an account and edited the page with dynamic IPs, has been restoring the older verision, which myself and others have found to not be NPOV." -- I have a dynamic IP and I regularly do not sign in to Wikipedia thus I don't find this bad in and of itself, but opinions vary.</p>
<p>From this diff I was pointed at (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernie_Sanders&amp;diff=48039154&amp;oldid=47846014" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernie_Sanders&amp;diff=48039154&amp;oldid=47846014" rel="nofollow">this link</a>) I can make the following comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>This passage is original research: "While it is correct to say that the program is eliminated by the proposed FY2007 budget, Sanders fails to mention the Administration's intention to migrate clients of CSF program to the Food Stamp Program, with a budget increase from 3.4 Billion to 3.6 Billion from FY2006 to FY2007.<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/detail.10001007.2005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expectmore/detail.10001007.2005.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> One may conclude Sanders intends to create the belief that Bush has little regard for the welfare of seniors and the poor." It would be best to find a quote in an outside source which makes this argument rather than making it yourself.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The portion of the sentence after "but" isn't supported by a citation in the following sentence: "The program is eliminated by the proposed FY2007 budget, <b>but</b> the administration says it will use the Food Stamp Program to cover cases similar to those under the CSFP." (emphasis added)</li>
</ol>
<p>In regards to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The statement, "<i>Further, in a piece written for TPM Cafe.com [8], Sanders accused the Bush Administration of "actively trying to cut veterans benefits", when in fact, Federal Government benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs increased from 2001 to 2006 by 57%.[9]</i>" is plain false. The citation is taken completely out of context as it refers to the increase in veteran disability payments over that period and not overall veteran benefits of which disability benefits are only a part. Disability payment increases have been due to the increase in disabled veterans during this period due to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and not due to the Bush administrations work in raising per veteran level of disability coverage. This entire statement has disappeared recently but I will include without the latter part and citation because it supports the "Relations with the Bush Administration" section."
<dl>
<dd>I can see the problem with the sentence at issue -- the second part of the sentence is just plain disengenious as written. I would mention something like "NET benefits have increased by X but, because of the increasing pool of veterans, benefits per capital have decreased by X." If you mention both the reader gets to understand the full context.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In regards to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The statement about the disclosure and Libby's claim that Bush was involved say Sanders says Bush did so "to discredit an Iraq War critic". Since Bush did not indiciate that to be the case, and no court has made any determination as to why Bush may have declassified that information, it is not generally accepted that Sanders' statement is factual."
<dl>
<dd>It would be best to say "critics A, B and C claim that Bush disclosed D to discredit E because E was a critic of the Iraq War" -- thus it is clear who is making the claims about Bush's disclosure. Also be sure that the people you mention are credible individuals (even better if they have Wikipedia entries you can link to so others can get background info to determine their reliability) who are making the claim in reputable sources -- i.e. New York Times, WSJ, WashPost, etc.</dd>

<p>Please be aware that I pretty much have no prior background in this subject or an opinion. The trick to Wikipedia is to find high quality sources and string them together in an organized fashion with as little editorializing or distortion as possible.

<p>Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>One may conclude</b> Sanders intends to create the belief that Bush has little regard for the welfare of seniors and the poor. <b>In fact</b>, Sanders says so in that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who is this "one"?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it should be noted that the suggestion of Bush's involvment comes from indicted former Vice-Presidental aide, Scooter Libby,and there is <b>no wide acceptance</b> of this allegation as fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citing one source does not substantiate such a claim as to dictate what is wide acceptance and what isn't.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, immediately endorsed Sanders. Schumer's backing was critical, <b>as it likely means</b> that any Democrat running against Sanders cannot expect to receive any significant financial backing from the national Democratic party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fun assumption. Has anyone said anything to substantiate this claim?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sanders is heavily favored to win, especially after Republican governor Jim Douglas, <b>widely believed</b> to be the only Republican who could possibly defeat him, decided against a Senate run. Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie, who had previously planned to challenge Sanders, withdrew from the race October 26, 2005.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another "wide" smudgy phrasing.<br />
These are the major ones. There are a few lesser indefinite wordings that lend themselves weasel wording.<br />
On a related POV note: what is this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the <b>leftist</b> magazine In These Times,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is awfully close to the usage of the word "liberal" as a slur. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmafactor_4c75.html" title="User:Sigmafactor">sigmafactor</a> 00:38, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In response:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The "one" you refer to, should be interpreted to mean "anyone".</li>
<li>There is no wide acceptance as to why information was released, either in a way which would make Sanders' statement correct or incorrect.</li>
<li>That there will be no strongly supported Democratic Senate Candidate in Vermont has been reported time and again in Vermont newspapers, and no such candidate exists at this time. In fact, as Howard Dean, the National Chairman of the Democratic Party has endorsed Sanders, it is not only likely that there will be no widely supported candidate, it makes it almost impossible.</li>
<li>It has been reported, again, many many times, that a Jim Douglas candidacy would be problematic for Sanders.</li>
<li>In These Times Magazine refers to itself as a leftist magazine, and has no problem with this.</li>

<p>I tend to agree that the first 4 cited examples contain unnecessary editorializing -- I wouldn't be able to get away with this on the Middle East related articles I've been editing. To the individual who did this: The trick is the find reputable sources that make these arguments and then just string quotes from those sources together to make the case rather than trying to make the argument yourself.</p>
<p>It would be best to describe <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_These_Times_4e54.html" title="In These Times">In These Times</a> in the manner it is described in its lead sentence on its Wikipedia page -- this moves the fight over how to characterize ITT to its own page rather than blending it into this article.

<p>Bernie came to speak to a class of 30 or so of us students when I was in high school back in 1993/94. I don't have exact quotes from the discussion, but I got a sense of what he stood for.

<p>Please stop removing the infobox on Senator-elect Sanders. Every piece of information in it is a fact, it makes the page look more professional, and it is not misleading in any way. If you guys want to keep changing the picture, then whatever, but stopping removing the box. <a href="../../../v/i/t/User%7EVitaleBaby_5a6d.html" title="User:VitaleBaby">VitaleBaby</a> 02:09, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why should it be kept? He is currently a member of the House of Representatives, he is in the future to become a member of the Senate. Having a form template that says he is a Senator-elect but says nothing about his current position is misleading. These templates are not to be in place of providing accurate information. If you want the article to look more professional, do so, but that does not entail presenting false information in a uniform mass template. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 02:14, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is nonsensical. The information about his current House term ("current" only in a strictly formal sense, as the House of Representatives will not reconvene again until 2007, by which time Sanders will be gone) is already included in the article lead. See also the infoboxes of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherrod_Brown_d21f.html" title="Sherrod Brown">Sherrod Brown</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Cardin_8e34.html" title="Ben Cardin">Ben Cardin</a>.

<dd><i>All</i> the information is already included in the article lead. The infobox is totally unnecessary for anyone who reads the introduction. Someone who reads only the infobox, however, gets a false impression. It can be okay to have an infobox, but not a misleading one. If you want, add both the current information about him being Congressman, and the information about him being Senator-elect, but having only the information about the Senator-elect is wrong. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 02:42, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you think it's important to note both that Sanders is a current Representative and a Senator-elect, the way to proceed is to add that to the infobox instead of obliterating it completely. Infoboxes are there for the readers' convenience, even though the information is <i>almost always</i> duplicated in the article, and longstanding convention for American members of Congress (and Canadian and British MPs) is that they should use them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 02:56, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't obliterate it completely. Two days ago, I changed it back to the old one, then it was changed back and, because of the nature of a current events article, it seemed likely that it was revised by random passers-by such that removing the alluring target of those changes would diminish the likelihood of inaccurate information being added to the article. Then it was reverted by someone with no edit summary or user page, such that it could have been an accident, random vandalism, or ignorance, and the user talk page of which now on further inspection has several admonitions for making the same sort of changes. Changing the infobox to include the Senator-elect information and still be accurate would require creating a whole new template. Also, keep in mind that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a newspaper; it is not essential that the article reflect—badly—the latest developments. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 03:06, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your claim that you <i>"didn't obliterate it completely"</i> seems to be at odds with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernie_Sanders&amp;diff=87065092&amp;oldid=87064934" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernie_Sanders&amp;diff=87065092&amp;oldid=87064934" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernie_Sanders&amp;diff=87063478&amp;oldid=87059541" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernie_Sanders&amp;diff=87063478&amp;oldid=87059541" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. Secondly, it is not necessary to create a new template, you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Senator&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Senator&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">do this</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Congressman&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Congressman&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">do this</a> to add the appropriate optional parameters. And thirdly, I'd say it's pretty essential that the infobox be up-to-date. Encyclopedias are not newspapers, but they are expected to be timely, especially since people often search Wikipedia to find quick info on names in the news. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 03:22, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

Are you suggesting that I make Infobox Congressman into an infobox for senators and Infobox Senator into an infobox for congressmen? The information in the article is timely, but the infobox implies he is not currently a congressman. What do you propose should be changed for the infobox to include the proper information? If one were to put "Senator-elect" under the "Member of the U.S. House of Representatives" and then also have the term expiry, would also be misleading. What is wrong with having the infobox be the primary, current position, and the election to senator be in the article? —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 03:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You could try tinkering with <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_Template%7ETest_51be.html" title="User:Andrew Levine/Template:Test">this</a> until it comes out looking the way you prefer, with cells that only appear if the "term in senate" parameter is used, and then copy it onto the main Congressman template. However you get the information about him being both a Representative and a Senator-elect across, just don't remove the infobox completely and then deny having ever done it. That's my main problem here. I'm not sure of the relevance of the two oldids you just provided, but the fact is that in addition to those two edits you did remove the template from the article completely, twice, and that is what I do not agree with. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 04:24, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I see it, he was "independent" on the ballot, so listing his party affiliation as "socialist" would be incorrect. So I reverted it. I won't get into a revert/rerevert battle over this, but my 2 cents.<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmccabe_3ee0.html" title="User:Dmccabe">Dmccabe</a></p>

<p>I remember reading somewhere that Bernie is an atheist - is this true? If it is, it would be worth mentioning. Even if there are other atheists in congress, as the most under-represented group in the US it would be a significant fact to put on the page. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESad_mouse_6053.html" title="User:Sad mouse">Sad mouse</a> 05:15, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Doing research, I can't find anything where Sanders publicly declares he is an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a>, although this doesn't necessarily mean he isn't one. He has always listed his religion on candidate's questionares and house databases as <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and until a reputable source emerges to suggest otherwise, his faith should be listed as <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> here as well. <a href="../../../w/g/b/User%7EWgbc2032_3283.html" title="User:Wgbc2032">Wgbc2032</a> 13:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If he's a TRUE socialist/Marxist, then YES he would be an atheist per pure Marxist/Communist doctrine, believing religion to be an "<a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium_of_the_People_3b91.html" title="Opium of the People">opiate of the masses</a>" and counterproductive to the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_struggle.html" title="Class struggle">class struggle</a>. However, it's not confirmed that he is an atheist so we better not start speculating, even though there's a good chance that he is since he's a socialist. It's important to note that his HERITAGE is Jewish though; this is more about ethnicity than religion, however. He is a JEW but doesn't follow Judaism, the traditional religion of the Jews. --172.132.53.161 00:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sanders is a democratic socialist, which is not the same thing as a Marxist. While a follower of a hardline Marxist Communist line would probably be an atheist, Sanders is not a Marxist Communist. Many socialists are religious (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_socialism.html" title="Christian socialism">Christian socialism</a>) for one. Considering Sanders lists his religious affiliation as Judaism, I don't see any reason to speculate that he's an atheist based on his political orientation.--<a href="../../../b/k/w/User%7EBkwillwm_a550.html" title="User:Bkwillwm">Bkwillwm</a> 01:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bernie Sanders is a socialist, as you say, but because he doesn't belong to any political party, he's officially styled an Independent.

<p>I don't like the tone of the comment that was just reverted about "having many detractors ...especially outside of liberal Chittenden County." Not at all in the spirit of of "neutral point of view." What public official does not have many detractors? Bernie has far fewer than many.</p>
<p>That said, the "honeymoon" is documented. Bernie is a notorious workaholic, and it was a working trip to set up the sister city relationship between Yarolsavl in the then USSR and Burlington Vermont. He writes about it in his book "Outsider in the House". Handy excerpt here from Google, wherein he says "...it was a strange honeymoon..." <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_2YjBm2_JGUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=bernie+sanders+honeymoon+soviet+union&amp;source=web&amp;ots=SSrDL0_a6l&amp;sig=Gi0_PL_e3brDvasQG0z3nPR9Iuk" class="external free" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=_2YjBm2_JGUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=bernie+sanders+honeymoon+soviet+union&amp;source=web&amp;ots=SSrDL0_a6l&amp;sig=Gi0_PL_e3brDvasQG0z3nPR9Iuk" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=_2YjBm2_JGUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=bernie+sanders+honeymoon+soviet+union&amp;source=web&amp;ots=SSrDL0_a6l&amp;sig=Gi0_PL_e3brDvasQG0z3nPR9Iuk</a></p>
<p>Also mentioned in this generally lauditory Rutland Herald article "Is Bernie the next Aiken?" (non-vermonters, this would be Sen. George Aiken, not the guy from American Idol&#160;:-) )</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061217/NEWS/612170367/1024/NEWS04" class="external free" title="http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061217/NEWS/612170367/1024/NEWS04" rel="nofollow">http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061217/NEWS/612170367/1024/NEWS04</a></p>
<p>I think that the Wiki way to deal with these kinds of critiques would be to have a "controversy" heading, but I'm afraid to set that up because I'm an inexperienced wikipedian. Also because my own bias in favor of Bernie would make it hard for me to write neutrally about this ("...some ignorant cusses have criticized Bernie...."). I'll leave this for my conservative friends to write.</p>
<p>I will, however, add links to both the Rutland Herald and the Google Books pages. --Russell 01:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
