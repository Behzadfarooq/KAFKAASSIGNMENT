<dd>You're right to be skeptical - most modern historians think they came from East Africa, not the Middle East. I have updated it to that effect. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 22:43, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Both Ibn Khaldun and Averroes were Andalusi, not North African, and other sources describe them as Arab; until someone can provide evidence to the contrary, they have been removed from the list. The same goes for Ibn Tufayl. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 05:14, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

Ibn khaldoen is born a Tunisie en Averoes was a dokter of de berber Emir (almohaden) en he is dead in morocco.</p>
<p>True, but that doesn't make either of them Berbers. Both Ibn Khaldun's parents were from Seville, and Averroes was born in Cordoba. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:32, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Mauris are not Arabs .The Mauri were de most peolpel of Andoloesie , abdel Er Rahman was a son of a Berber women. The Almoravid and Almohad were a Berber in Andalusie. -No problem. They are Arab.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Moors are not pure Arabs or pure Berbers (or pure Spaniards), but a mixture of the two (in Spain, the three). Many medieval authors make a three-way difference between Arabs and Berbers in the countryside and "Moors", or حضر, in the cities. However, most "Moors" spoke Arabic.</p>

<dd>For North Africa, I'd have to track down what Ibn Khaldun says in the Muqaddimah - he considered the language of the towns to be a form of Arabic "corrupted" by foreign influence and city life, if I recall rightly. But for Spain, I have an answer right here - all the muwasshahat موشحات are written in Spanish darja, and Federico Corriente has even published a dictionary of the dialect, and a grammar<a href="http://amman.cervantes.es/Biblioteca/Catalogo/Ficha_4229.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://amman.cervantes.es/Biblioteca/Catalogo/Ficha_4229.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It had many words from Berber and Spanish, but still Arabic grammar and mostly Arabic words. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:42, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Almoravids and Almohads did conquer Andalusia, but they didn't come from there; their empires began in Mauritania and Morocco, and went north. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:53, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC) - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:53, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>the berber was there firstly with tarik ibn ziyad in 711( 8000) the arabs are komed in 712 (1200).</p>
<p>That's absolutely true. However, a lot more Arabs came when the Umayyad dynasty was overthrown. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:42, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is Ibn Khaldun a arab or athers?</p>

<p>I'm not akkord with ibn khaldun , but you chould these see (I think that you kan speak arab and french).sorry sire mustafaa.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think he considered himself neither Arab nor Berber, since he uses both terms only to refer to nomads and country people. I'll look for his exact quote, and have a look at the links you mention. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:46, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm... So far, he describes the dialects (basically دارجة!) in chapter 47, "Why the modern language of the Arabs is different". Here it is:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"وإنما وقعت العناية بلسان مضر، لما فسد بمخالطتهم الأعاجم، حين استولوا على ممالك العراق والشام ومصر والمغرب، وصارت ملكته على غير الصورة التي كانت أولاً، فانقلب لغة أخرى.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"But change came upon the language of Mudar, as it was corrupted by their mixing with non-Arabs, when they conquered the kingdoms of Iraq and ash-Sham and Egypt and the Maghreb, and it became other than what it was, and turned into a new language."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And then he says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"ولعلنا لو <b>اعتنينا</b> بهذا اللسان العربي لهذا العهد واستقرينا أحكامه، نعتاض عن الحركات الإعرابية التي فسدت في دلالتها بأمور أخرى وكيفيات موجودة فيه، فتكون لها قوانين تخصها. "</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"And if <b>we</b> had preserved this Arabic language to this day and stabilized its rules, we would still be using the case endings that have gone in other matters and the potentials within it, for it would have the rules needed."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That seems like good evidence that he spoke Arabic natively. However, he never calls himself an "Arab" or a "Berber", as far as I can see. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 21:21, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And for the towns speaking mainly Arabic:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"وعندهم أنه إنما يتميز العربي الصريح من الدخيل في العروبية والحضري بالنطق بهذه القاف."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"And you can distinguish an original Arab from an Arabized person or a townsman (حضري, which much later European writers started translating as Moor) by their pronunciation of <i>qaf</i>." - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 21:32, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You see, in Ibn Khaldun's time "Arab" only meant nomads and Bedouin. People didn't consider themselves "Arabs" just because they speak the language, as people usually do now. If you asked him whether he was Arab or Berber, he would have said that he was حضري. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 21:35, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hey, this is cool. A whole chapter about the language of the towns:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"في أن لغة أهل الحضر والأمصار..</dd>
</dl>
<p>لغة قائمة بنفسها مخالفة للغة مضر. اعلم أن عرف التخاطب في الأمصار وبين الحضر ليس بلغة مضر القديمة، ولا بلغة أهل الجيل، بل هي لغة أخرى قائمة بنفسها بعيدة عن لغة مضر وعن لغة هذا الجيل العربي الذي لعهدنا، وهي عن لغة مضر أبعد. فأما أنها لغة قائمة بنفسها فهو ظاهر، يشهد له ما فيها من التغاير الذي بعد عن صناعة أهل النحو لحناً. وهي مع ذلك تختلف باختلاف الأمصار في اصطلاحاتهم، فلغة أهل المشرق مباينة بعض الشيء للغة أهل المغرب، وكذا أهل الأندلس معهما، وكل منهم متوصل بلغته إلى تأدية مقصوده والإبانة عما في نفسه. وهذا معنى اللسان واللغة. وفقدان الإعراب ليس بضائر لهم كما قلناه في لغة العرب لهذا العهد. "</p>
<dl>
<dd>"About how the language of the townsmen and the cities is a language in its own right, different from the language of Mudar. Know that discourse in the camps and among the towns is not in the old language of Mudar, nor in the language of this generation (?), but it is another language in its own right, far both from the language of Mudar and from the language of this Arab generation in our time, but furthest from the language of Mudar. It's obvious that it's a language in its own right, as witnessed by the amount of change in it which makes it far from the constructions of the grammarians. Nonetheless, it varies according to the city in its expressions, so the Mashriq differs somewhat from that of the Maghreb, and likewise that of Andalus with both of them, and each of them uses its language for the expression of its meanings and what is within them. And that is the meaning of "tongue" and "language". And the disappearance of case endings is not peculiar to them, because it happened, as we have noted, in the modern language of the Arabs." - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 22:00, 16 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>okké, mustafaa, who spoked about arabisc is arab. (I don't think so, because if ibn khaldun a arab was, did he not so writed about the arabs). but kussala is a arabic name , I hoop that aksil is not arab.</p>
<p><br />
It is realy funny that&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>the mauri are arabs.</li>
<li>the berber komed from arabia.</li>
<li>the berber language is old arabic.</li>
<li>Ibn khaldun is arab.</li>
<li>averoes is a arab.</li>
<li>dihya have a arabic name (al-kahina)</li>
<li>aksil have a arabic name (kussyla)</li>
<li>the arab broucht the civilisation to north-africa.</li>
</ul>
<p>(realy ...)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Mauri of Roman times were certainly Berbers. But later Europeans used the term to mean the people of North African cities - people of partly or mostly Berber origin, but who speak Arabic. And until Arab nationalism was invented, most city people of North Africa didn't think of themselves as Berber nor as Arab - just as "city people".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But Berbers did not come from Arabia; Ibn Khaldun discusses that idea, but ultimately says it isn't true, and I think he was right. Dihya and Kusayla both got their Arabic names from Arabs, not from their own people, and if anyone brought civilization to North Africa it was the Phoenicians. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:57, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thinks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No guarantees of accuracy - this is difficult language - but: "The entry of the Arabs of Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym into the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maghreb.html" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>: The tribal groups of Hilal and Sulaym of Mudar were still apparent throughout the Abbasid period around Hijaz and Najd, with Hila around al-Madina and Sulaym in Mt Ghazwan near Ta'if. Their migratory round took them as far as the borders of Iraq and Syria, where they would pillage and destroy and attack travellers and sometimes Sulaym would even attack the Hajj caravans in their season. Sulaym and many of Rabia b. Amer allied with the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmathian.html" title="Carmathian">Carmathians</a> when they appeared, and fought for them in Bahrain and Oman."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"And when the party of Ubayd Allah al-Hamadi had won in Egypt and Syria and the Carmathians had been defeated in the towns of Syria, he exiled them to the Sa'id and the east bank of the Nile. And when the king of the Senhaja turned to al-Mu`izz ben Badis ben al-Mansour in the year 408, ad-Dhahir li-Din Illah gave authority over Africa to Ali b. al-Hakim bi-Amr Illah b. (etc.), an untried youth with no experience or authority.</dd>
</dl>
<p>you can say that he was a berber. same as i am a berber.</p>
<p>Not everyone born in North Africa - let alone Spain! - was Berber; there were large communities of Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, Spaniards, and Arabic-speakers who didn't call themselves Arabs. It is no more safe to call all North Africans Berber than to call all Arabic-speakers Arabs - and as I keep saying, Ibn Khaldun would have considered himself neither Arab nor Berber, but hadhri or even Andalusi. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 20:24, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>you can say that everybody born in North afrika is a berber until you have the contrary. ibn khladun was not a foenicians, not romans ,not spaniards. if a another one could learen the scriptie of ibn khaldun would say that he is anti-arab. it mean he is not arab. if you leared the scriptie of ibn khaldun you could thiscovered that he say that the most of the sheres were not arab&#160;: he sayed&#160;:if anybody was shere with the arab, he was not a arab of origine . he sayed also that the body that maked the grammatica of the arabs ware (ajam) not arabs lijk: sibawayh and al-zajaaj. the ather sheres were not arabs but arabised lijk: saad ad-din ataftazi ,Ibn alkhatib. nasr ad-din. -i know athers&#160;: "avecinna and ibn tufayl and ibn ruchd (averroes) and alkhawarismi and albokhari and moslim and ibn horayra and ibn khaldun and ibn baja and ibn maja and albaqri and alrrazi and alghazali ......" everybody of them was not arab. "the arab wanted just to be a king and having the power not learen". (that sayed ibn khaldun)</p>
<p>you don't have it to translated because i understand good arabic.</p>
<dl>
<dd>He's anti-Arab, certainly - in the sense that Arab was used at the time; "Arab" only referred to bedouins back then. That doesn't imply that he was Berber; in his definition of Arab, I'm not Arab, and neither was <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourguiba.html" title="Bourguiba">Bourguiba</a>, nor Gamal Abd el Nasser, and certainly not <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Aflaq_19d9.html" title="Michel Aflaq">Michel Aflaq</a>!

<dd>Moreover, most of the people listed are firmly known to be Berber, on the basis of their immediate origins and their own claims. There's no mystery about it; if someone's nisba is "as-Sanhaji" or "al-Bejawi" or "al-Kutami" or the like, they're Berber!

<p>Septimus sevirus and his son were imazighen (berber) and apuleuis was a (amazigh). they were not arab not punic. you should chek it!!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apuleius' nephew spoke Punic, according to his own words - and Punic remained official in Lepcis Magna for much longer than most of Africa; practically all the city inscriptions are bilingual in Latin and Punic. That's pretty strong evidence that they were Punic. What's your evidence that they were Berber? Just the fact that they came from North Africa? - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 18:29, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which you added yourself! I will now admit that Apuleius was Berber, since he apparently described himself as "half-Numidian, half-Gaetulian". But Septimius Severus is another matter. ". His paternal great-grandfather, who had moved from Lepcis Magna to Italy and become an equestrian, was most likely of Punic origin and his mother, Fulvia Pia, was from a family which had moved from Africa to Italy. Little is known of Severus' father, Publius Septimius Geta, other than that he had two cousins who became consuls."<a href="http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/sept-severus.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/sept-severus.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:24, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do you know where is septimus severus born? Do you think that al carthago were punic? If you don't know I'll tell you but tomorouw because I don't have nou enogh time.</p>
<p>Yes, he was born in the extremely Punic city of Lepcis Magna - which was founded by the Phoenicians, and was one of the last areas in all Africa to continue to speak Punic. Look at the names in <a href="http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/roman_africa/LEPINSCR.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/roman_africa/LEPINSCR.HTM" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - do they look Berber to you? Carthage was not all Punic - there were many Latin, Berber, and Greek immigrants - but it certainly isn't safe to assume someone from a city like that was Berber.

He cites several Phoenician words, such as <i>salus</i> for three. Even in Al-Bakri's time some Libyan towns spoke a language neither Berber nor Arabic nor Coptic nor Latin, according to him. Even the Romans didn't go so far as to massacre <i>every</i> Phoenician; they destroyed Carthage - and repopulated it with Romans when they refounded it - but not the many other Phoenician towns. And every one of the sources you mention merely claims that he was a Berber, without giving any evidence - except the Arabic one, which doesn't even claim he was Berber, just that he was Libyan. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:14, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's not totally inconceivable. The strict stipulations of the Sharia about how much tax you can charge Muslims (and how you can't enslave Muslims) often posed an inconvenience for medieval monarchs; they sometimes got around it by arguing that, even though a given people had converted, they had initially rejected Islam and were thus still to be treated as if they were non-Muslims. (I know, I know... political sophistry is nothing new.)

<p>The Shafiq article you link to doesn't offer any evidence for Tertullian being Berber, he just asserts it.

<p>the reason is not because you the truth want, but because i told for them (peopel) that ibn khaldun and averroes were not arabs. you diden't even see in the artikel aboud apleuis and you did say that he was probably not a berber. so there is a onother reason. afer is the name of the father of grootfather of septimus severus, and you have the enough links. and tirtullian was a berber same us the links and chafik sayed. the name of vibia perpitua was a latin name , so not punic. and de source that about vibia spoked told that a berber women was arrested. so there is no reason to say that she was a punic. but that is not a problem. <a href="../../../a/z/i/User%7EAziri_7e0a.html" title="User:Aziri">Aziri</a> 14:47, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Averroes I haven't looked into yet, but for Ibn Khaldun I've seen two sources that say he was not just an Arab, but specifically South Arabian - as I pointed out. Who claims he was a Berber?

As for Vibia Perpetua, <a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian24.html" class="external text" title="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian24.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the original source - it doesn't mention "Berber" once, so what are you talking about?

<p>You give two links supporting your claim that Septimius Severus was Berber; one is about Terence, who was no relation to Septimius Severus (though Terence was Berber), and the other just says: Afer: Overgrote oom van Septium de Strenge, Romeins heerser afkomstig uit Tripoli, Lybie. Betekent de Afrikaan. In fact, it was his uncle's name that was A<b>p</b>er, and considering they don't even spell Septimius properly or get his home town's name right, I can't place much confidence in that source in any case. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 20:34, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>okke, they were punic, and macrinus also (you didn't see it) and augustinus and all of them. but ibn khaldun and averroes were not arab. <a href="../../../a/z/i/User%7EAziri_7e0a.html" title="User:Aziri">Aziri</a> 10:32, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is one valley, somewhere in East Africa, where the first humans lived. People from that valley can claim that they came only from that valley, maybe. Everyone else on Earth comes from somewhere else - and your (and my) Berber ancestors are no exception.</p>

<p>The map is great, but that doesn't mean anything unless combined with a population density map. As for 2 - I have every intention of continuing to write about the Berbers. They are part of my heritage as well as yours, and I certainly wouldn't want to abandon these articles to ill-informed, ungrammatical, ethnic chauvinist propaganda. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:24, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>yes, they are apart of your heritage. i beleave you , i think ven that you are an algeian (i'm not sure). but if you are north african the, late my to say to you that you hate yourself and that is the reason why you hate the berber. that is number one. but your claim about my, is absolutly wrong. you was here before i komed to En. Wiki. and i didn't go to the Fr. wiki because there are not counterfeiters (like you) , who say that tifinagh have an arabic or punic origine who clain that the arabs brought the civilisation to north africa who claim who don't say that couscous is a berber speciality , and didn't say that the zirids were berber and also the hammadid ...</p>
<p>but if you are careful against my , then i will go, but you don't have to write about the berber. let others say that the berber live in the sahara in midden east. but i don't accept it ifv any arab write negatif about the berber.<a href="../../../a/z/i/User%7EAziri_7e0a.html" title="User:Aziri">Aziri</a> 11:37, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your fantasy that I hate the Berbers is entirely in your own head. I like Kabyle music, I've learned a fair bit of Kabyle, and some of my relatives are Berber; and I'm proud to have people like <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masinissa.html" title="Masinissa">Masinissa</a> and al-Ajurrumi and Lalla <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatma_n%27Soumer_b483.html" title="Fatma n'Soumer">Fatma n'Soumer</a> in my national heritage. But - unlike you - I don't feel an urge to pretend that Berber history is more ancient and more notable than it actually is, and don't feel that the mere fact that someone was Berber, or Arab, or Vietnamese, or Martian is so important as to deserve a prominent mention in every article. You feel so hurt because <a href="../../../z/i/r/Zirid.html" title="Zirid">Zirid</a> didn't have the word "Berber" in it? Look at <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> and tell me if it says that the Abbasids were Arab. You feel so hurt that the article (or, rather, O'Connor) says that Tifinagh <i>may</i> have a Northern Arabic or Punic origin? Look at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a> and tell me if it claims that Arabic didn't have an Aramaic origin. You're offended to think that the Berbers came from somewhere other than North Africa? Well, here's a news flash - <i>everybody</i> on this planet <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution_of_Homo_sapiens_7ceb.html" title="Evolution of Homo sapiens">comes from somewhere other than North Africa</a>. The problem with you, Aziri, is that you take offense at anything that might even vaguely imply that the myths you've been fed about Tifinagh and Ibn Khaldun and Septimius Severus and all the rest aren't true, and then are willing to accept any source - no matter how obviously ignorant its author - as long as it confirms your view, and reject any source - even the Muqaddimah or Monde Berbere - if it says anything against your view. Take a lesson - I know perfectly well that <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizar_Qabbani_5e56.html" title="Nizar Qabbani">Nizar Qabbani</a> and <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar_ibn_al-Khattab_e197.html" title="Umar ibn al-Khattab">Umar ibn al-Khattab</a> were Arabs, but do I feel compelled to go and advertise that fact in the first paragraph of every article? No. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:44, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Is the number of non-Muslim Berbers important enough to be so remarked?" In my opinion, no. The Guanches were almost certainly Berber; there is still room for some doubt, but the toponymic evidence is very much in favor. However, I doubt that most Canary Islanders have any Guanche blood; they were nearly wiped out except on a few islands, and the remainder were culturally assimilated. Whether Berber Jews count as Berbers is a debate that frankly I don't want to get into; restoring the original wording of that sentence would suit me fine... - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 08:53, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
