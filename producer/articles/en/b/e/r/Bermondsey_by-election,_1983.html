Peter Tatchell circa 1999, his hair was much longer in 1983</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, Bermondsey Labour Party selected <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Tatchell_6e4b.html" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a>, its Secretary, as prospective Parliamentary candidate. Tatchell was a leading member of the left-wing faction that had taken control of the local party the previous year. He was also a contributor to <i>London Labour Briefing</i>, a magazine that circulated among the London left, and had written an article suggesting the use of extra-Parliamentary <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a> by the Labour Party. This article came to the attention of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wellbeloved_7390.html" title="James Wellbeloved">James Wellbeloved</a>, a London Labour MP who had defected to the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_%28UK%29_9a0a.html" title="Social Democratic Party (UK)">Social Democratic Party</a>; Wellbeloved then referred to it in a Parliamentary Question to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">December 3</a>.</p>
<p>Labour Party leader <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Foot_cf4a.html" title="Michael Foot">Michael Foot</a> denounced the article and declared "the individual concerned is not an endorsed member of the Labour Party and as far as I'm concerned never will be". (It was suggested by some that Foot had confused Peter Tatchell with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Taaffe_0497.html" title="Peter Taaffe">Peter Taaffe</a>, then the leader of the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyist.html" title="Trotskyist">Trotskyist</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant_Tendency_8f9d.html" title="Militant Tendency">Militant Tendency</a>, and that his denunciation was so strong that he could not later retract it without appearing weak.) Foot later changed "endorsed member" to "endorsed candidate", and at the next meeting of the Labour Party National Executive Committee, Tatchell was narrowly rejected as a candidate. Mellish was not reassured about the future direction of the Labour Party and resigned from it on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, a clear preliminary to resigning his seat, which he did by taking the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiltern_Hundreds_6515.html" title="Chiltern Hundreds">Chiltern Hundreds</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>. The left-wing of the Labour Party, defending the right of Bermondsey to select a candidate of its own choosing, managed to get agreement that Tatchell would be eligible for selection, and he was duly selected again in January 1983.</p>
<p>Tabloid newspapers opposed to the Labour left had begun investigating Tatchell's background when he was denounced by Michael Foot, and in particular his activities with the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_Liberation_Front_b854.html" title="Gay Liberation Front">Gay Liberation Front</a> in the early 1970s. Several stories were published which made it inferentially clear that he was <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">gay</a>.</p>

<p>The right-wing former Labour leader of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Southwark_9d8c.html" title="London Borough of Southwark">Southwark Borough Council</a>, John O'Grady, who had been a target for the left-wing faction locally, also decided to stand under the banner 'Real Bermondsey Labour' with Robert Mellish's support and encouragement. His campaign was dominated by personal opposition to Tatchell and defence of his leadership of the Council. Twelve other candidates stood, including <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screaming_Lord_Sutch_89af.html" title="Screaming Lord Sutch">Screaming Lord Sutch</a> and Dowager Lady <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Birdwood_eaf6.html" title="Jane Birdwood">Jane Birdwood</a>.</p>
<p>Esmond Bevan intended to stand as an independent Labour candidate, but erroneously entered his occupation in the section on the nomination papers headed 'description', thus appearing on <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballot_paper.html" title="Ballot paper">ballot papers</a> as "Systems Designer".</p>

<p>The Labour campaign started disastrously when it was discovered that the first leaflets had been printed at Cambridge Heath Press, owned by the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant_Tendency_8f9d.html" title="Militant Tendency">Militant Tendency</a> (a far left group practising <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entryism.html" title="Entryism">entryism</a> in the Labour Party which the party leadership was determined to remove; its five key members were expelled two days before polling day). The leaflets were all pulped and reprinted, but the cost of the first printing still counted against the limit for election spending.</p>

<p>There was much controversy over Tatchell's homosexuality. The Labour party persuaded Tatchell to keep quiet about his sexual orientation, although he had previously declared himself 'out', while various campaigners for opposition candidates as well as many within the Labour party, made homophobic comments about Tatchell. More press stories attacking Tatchell inspired widespread <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a> throughout the constituency which referred to him in derogatory terms. Some of those putting up posters in his support found their windows attacked. Tatchell himself received hate mail, including a live bullet, and was attacked when out in the street.</p>
<p>Some of the other byelection candidates joined in: John O'Grady (<a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwark.html" title="Southwark">Southwark</a> Council leader and promoted for the 'official' Labour candidacy by the previous MP, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Mellish_629e.html" title="Bob Mellish">Bob Mellish</a>) was filmed touring the constituency on the back of a horse and cart singing a song which referred to Tatchell 'wearing his trousers back to front'. Since then, it has been claimed that Mellish was bisexual or gay <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_westminster_hour/2761985.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_westminster_hour/2761985.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC Audio link</a>. On the last weekend of the campaign, an anonymous leaflet was sent round the constituency headed "Which Queen will you vote for?" and contrasting the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republicanism.html" title="Republicanism">republican</a> Tatchell (pictured looking very effeminate) with <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. The leaflet gave Tatchell's home address and telephone number.</p>
<p>However, a more straightforward analysis of why Tatchell lost was given - ironically - by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sutch_520b.html" title="David Sutch">David Sutch</a>, the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_Monster_Raving_Loony_Party_733c.html" title="Official Monster Raving Loony Party">Official Monster Raving Loony Party</a> candidate in his 'autobiography' (much of it ghost written by journalist Peter Chippindale, whom included fantasy sections that were supposed to be funny) '<b>Life As Sutch'</b> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-00-637805-6</a> - published 1991), who said to Tatchell when both were being interviewed on TV at the by-election count how horrified he was at the treatment he received, but "what I did not tell him was that he had been so bad a candidate that he had largely brought it on himself", criticising Tatchell's marked preference for press conferences and press releases rather than the traditional "barnstorming" (ie. meeting the public in the streets whilst going about their every day business) which was still regarded as the accepted manner to win hearts and minds at a by-election. In a later interview when the subject of Bermondsey came up, Sutch said Tatchell "seemed to think all he needed to do to become the MP was turn up at the count."</p>

<p>During the by-election, members of the Liberal Party were accused of having joined in homophobic attacks on Tatchell, which <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Hattersley_23da.html" title="Roy Hattersley">Roy Hattersley</a> criticised at a Labour news conference: male canvassers for the party were seen wearing badges reading "I've been kissed by Peter Tatchell".

<dl>
<dd>As a member of the Liberal Gay Action Group which produced and wore the 'I have been kissed by Peter Tatchell' and 'I haven't been kissed by Peter Tatchell' badges, I think I should explain why the badges were produced and worn. (Although I wasn't there on the day that they were worn and had I been, mine would have read 'I wouldn't want to be kissed by Peter Tatchell').</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We were furious at the way in which Peter was attempting to go back into the closet (something which he has since admitted was wrong). This was our protest.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In an interview with Simon Edge of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> published on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">December 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, the Liberal agent in the by-election, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Ellis_6e23.html" title="Andy Ellis">Andy Ellis</a>, was asked whether he approved of the homophobic attacks on Peter Tatchell undertaken by the Liberal Gay Action Group and by other parties, and replied "Nothing went on in Bermondsey that we were unhappy with".</p>
<p>Though Liberal campaigners criticised Tatchell for being 'in the closet' it emerged during campaigning for the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Democrats_leadership_election%2C_2006_586e.html" title="Liberal Democrats leadership election, 2006">leadership of the Liberal Democrats</a> in January 2006 that Hughes had had homosexual relationships himself, and had used a gay chat service known as 'Man Talk' (see interview with <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Kavanagh_301f.html" title="Trevor Kavanagh">Trevor Kavanagh</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29_f6cd.html" title="The Sun (newspaper)">The Sun</a></i> <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006040287,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006040287,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.) Hughes apologised in the interview for not being honest about his sexuality, having denied that he was gay in an interview a week earlier <a href="http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200601/49043f67-f051-49ab-93aa-2d1e66600be5.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200601/49043f67-f051-49ab-93aa-2d1e66600be5.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, admitting that he "gave a reply that wasn’t untrue but was clearly misleading."</p>
<p>Hughes also apologised for the actions of Liberals in the campaign, saying that "I regret that in a campaign, actually run often by agents and organisers, the candidate does not have nearly as much say as perhaps they should have, but I take responsibility". "I have never been comfortable about the whole of that campaign, as Peter knows, and I said that to him in the past.... Where there were things that were inappropriate or wrong, I apologise for that."</p>
<p>The one controversial issue that was linked to Hughes was a leaflet <a href="http://5thnovember.blogspot.com/2006/01/simon-hughes-straight-choice.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://5thnovember.blogspot.com/2006/01/simon-hughes-straight-choice.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> describing the contest as a "STRAIGHT CHOICE" between Liberal and Labour. The same slogan went on to be used by Liberal candidates in other byelections, in an attempt to suggest to the electors that the party was the only credible challenger to the incumbent party <a href="http://www.geocities.com/byelections83/brecon85/libbre852b.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/byelections83/brecon85/libbre852b.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/byelections91/kincardine91/libkin919.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/byelections91/kincardine91/libkin919.jpg" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. However, when challenged on Newsnight about it in 2006 Hughes admitted that it was 'an unacceptable form of language', and 'those are the sort of things that shouldn't have happened' <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=374935&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=374935&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ct=5" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, appearing to acknowledge that the slogan had acted as an inadvertent slur against Tatchell.</p>
<p>When asked for his opinions on the Liberal Democrat leadership candidates in 2006, Tatchell, by then a member of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales_ccee.html" title="Green Party of England and Wales">Green Party</a>, said that he had forgiven Hughes, saying "Simon benefited from these dirty tricks, but that was 23 years ago - I don't hold a grudge. It's time to forgive and move on." <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16633380&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=i-forgive-simon-for-his-gay-slurs-against-me--name_page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16633380&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=i-forgive-simon-for-his-gay-slurs-against-me--name_page.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> He added "if I were a Lib Dem member, I would vote for Simon Hughes as party leader".</p>

<p>Bermondsey was one of the first byelections to be extensively polled. The polls showed, at first, that the Labour vote was substantially down on the 1979 election figures, but that none of the rival candidates were particularly close. As the campaign went on, the Liberal candidate began to move into a clear second position and the other candidates faded. Later in the campaign, there were rumours which claimed that the right-wing of the Labour Party nationally wished to lose the seat, as it would prove that left-wing Labour candidates were unelectable. By the eve of poll, it was clear that large numbers of previously Labour voters were defecting to other parties, and that non-Labour voters were lining up in support of the Liberal candidate as the one most likely to beat Labour.</p>

<p>The Liberals made huge gains and took the seat, with a majority of votes cast. Tatchell came a distant second, while O'Grady took third. The Tories managed only fourth place, for the first time since the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newham_South_by-election%2C_1974_389a.html" title="Newham South by-election, 1974">Newham South by-election, 1974</a>, and the last in Britain until the <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_Walton_by-election%2C_1991_d830.html" title="Liverpool Walton by-election, 1991">Liverpool Walton by-election, 1991</a>.</p>
