<p>My father is Norwegian and told me stories passed down from his father and his father before him. He used to call them barezaks. That is not the correct spelling, that is just how the word sounded to me. He used to say that they used to go into battle and would often attack allies in their fury. The article seems to imply that this didn't occur often and therefore negates one possible cause. I just wanted to point that out. I'm sure stories get warped through the ages but I have as much reason to believe the stories passed through my family as I have to believe stories passed through others.</p>

<p>Some of the writing in this article is very poor. For example: From an evolutionary-genetic viewpoint, in many cold Nordic lands it helps to be a bit hyperactive to deal with the cold. [citation needed] Under highly dispersed living conditions, where people have to store food to make it through the winters, it also helps to be able to explode with fury to fend off people who might come to steal one's food. Hence, one of the simplest explanations for the beserk phenomenon is (a) there is a valid tactical requirement in battle for "shock" warriors to use their fury to create breaches in enemy lines and (b) within a Nordic population there is a certain hyperactive percentage of the population who can cultivate turning on their natural proclivity towards rage and fury (as in what the Romans called "furor Germanicus") at strategic moments for military use.</p>
<p>It is written as a explaination to a question, and it seems to be directly addressing the reader. Also the writing quality is just very poor. If I have time I will rewrite it, but it would be nice if someone else would seeing as I am quite busy.</p>

<p>Although I can not pin point the source of this, I have a distinct feeling this is the case...</p>
<p>The bearserks are warriors somehow linked to the goddess Freya, while the ones in wolf skin are linked to Odin. This makes sens for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half of the fallen warriors go to Freya, half to Odin.</li>
<li>Both deities have mystic/shamanic powers.</li>
<li>Odin is closely linked to wolfs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to buy this argument one also has to see Freya as a wild (as the nature is wild), passionate, mystic and magical person, rather than the "ornamental" Aphrodite/Barbie kind of person.</p>
<p>One also has to accept that the frenzies of berserkagang was a sort of shamanic trance (sejd), which is not that easy to do since there are accounts of involuntary bearserkagang. One way around this is to attribute the berserkagang to something else, but accept the shamanic trance as a "marketing scheme".</p>
<p>Please comment (I didn't want to add it to the article since I don't have a source).</p>

<dd>Comment by RuediiX:</dd>
<dd>I would like to add consistancy to the use of trance state or meditation for berzerkaganging, as you put it. somtimes called berzerkering for simplicity. Similar techniques are used in some variants of martial arts. It seems to be general knowlege, but I don't have a source. I'm sure some Martial Arts expert should have one for that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also on the appreciation of nature by strike warrior classes is nothing unique as they have a tendancy to have to spend long times in the Wilderness hidden, and considering what has been verified about Norse culture the worship of a female god by warriors is not surprising either. Not to sound biased by my gender being male, but I would consider that to be motivating.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, these statements are not unfounded, and I provided some cross refrence data that might help. Timestamp: 2005.03.03.03:37 EST</dd>

<dd>Comment by Maximilius:</dd>
<dd>The "trance states" do indeed exist in martial arts, however I believe the "Berzerk" trance state is probably unique to Berzerkers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oriental martial arts usualy have some sort of mental training that allows practitioners to be more perceptive, ignore pain, heighten reflex, and increase concetration in general. A really good example of this is Kendo (Japanese fencing) which work towards producing state of "Zen" (adopted from budhist practice). A state which one's awareness is so high that one no longer thinks, but perform moves and reacts instantly out of pure instinct (simplified description, this is much more complicated in practice).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, using mental conditioning to improve fighting ability exists in many warrior culture. However, berzerkaganging is likely an extreme form that is exclusive to Berzerkers. Like mentioned in the article, berzerkaganging can get out of control, harming allies as well as enemies. This is very shunned upon in every culture. In oriental marial arts, where control and dicipline is emphasized, there is simply no room for berzerking.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Extra note: I do, however, know of a Chinese martial practice that is similar to berzerking. Students are often taught to concentrate all one's willpower to defeat his enemy in a duel (or sparring), this results in very agressive attack patterns and greatly heightened threshold of pain. However, students are also taught to control this state to distinquish between friend and foe (and to not harm sparring partner). --Maximilius - March 17, 2005</dd>

<p>There is a significant lack of information on Norse culture in general, before the Monarchy took over.</p>
<p>The consequence of this means that we know little about the warrior class variants that weren't theives, raiders and other unethical outlaws that would get themselves noticed.</p>
<p>It is noted that some bezerkers may have even been defenders of the weak, and would often use various tactics of using a falsely appearing weak member to face and use a block defense against the oponents that were raiding the village, while they waited in ambush. These techniques are remarkably similar to modern SWAT and other Special Ops tactics.</p>
<p>Similar tactics have also been used for quite some time in Far East martial arts. It is known how these tactics are done. Meditations are used to enchance the body's abilities through the nervous system. Such martial artests have been recorded as having the ability to use biofeedback to learn how to directly control even they're heartbeat rate quite easily.</p>
<p>Technically the tactics were not what was outlawed, but instead the rituals assosiated with them. The tactics are still used today in many SWAT, Special Ops, Strike Ops, and Rouge Ops tactics.</p>

<dd>Comment by Maximilius:</dd>
<dd>I'd like to add some additional comment about using mental conditioning to control physical ability. Using meditation to increase physical ability and using mental state to alter/improve fighting pattern are two different effects. Chinese martial art and medicine ultilized Qi Gong system, which include meditation and breath control. Long term practice can boost stamina and power significantly, and alter metabolism and heartbeat. This is what I believe the above poster is talking about. I have practice Qi Gong for 4 years, and martial arts for 6 years, however my mental state during fighting has not changed from before I practice Qi Gong (for example, I am not more agressive nor more percetive). Berzerkaganing involves altering mind state of a fighter, and the fighter becomes extra agressive (gaining strengh and stamina is a side-effect of this state, like how one can write more neatly when concentrating). Therefore, the two are fundamentally different.</dd>

<dd>It may also be worth noting that at the heart of budo is a state of mind known as 'mushin no shin', or 'mind no ::mind' in which, as stated above, the conscious level of the mind switches off and the body simply reacts. As ::anybody who has trained regularly over several years in a technique-based system will know, after a while the ::movements become as natural as breathing.

<p>April 2005: The german wikipedia entry for "Berserker" shares the bear-shirt explanation about the word itself, but explains that berserkers were merely aged germanic warriors (beyond 35 years, which was regarded as very old at that time), who feared to die peacefully in bed, i.e. berserkers were old veterans fighting in the first line in order to seek an honorable death in combat. It is discussed that they drugged themselves in order to prevent themselves to retreat because of pain before being mortally wounded. However, facing a veteran who does not fear death itself is certainly fearsome, contributing to the term berserker as commonly understood today.</p>
<p>I do not know whether this explanation is better or worse, but I just thought to mention the differences.</p>

<dd>Hmmm, if I understand the German page correctly, it also mentions that the word could be interpreted as bers-erkr which would mean something like "bear's anger". I haven't heard that theory before, but if it's a serious theory, I guess it could be added to the page.</dd>

<dd>What would point against the theory is that the second element of the alleged theory is that the second element (erkr/<a href="../../../e/r/g/Ergi.html" title="Ergi">ergi</a>) usually meant something like effeminate or pansy in Old Norse, which was quite a hard insult in the Norse macho culture. The explanation on the German Wikipedia giving "Ärger" is a cognate to "Ergi". --85.226.122.237 16:24, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sentence <i>Those who believe in the existence of spirit possession favor a theory that the berserk rage was brought on by possession by an animal spirit of either a bear or a wolf. According to this theory, berserkers were those who had cultivated an ability to allow the spirit of a bear or wolf to take over their body during a fight.

<dd>I disagree. Whether or not there was any spiritual possession (if one believes in such things or not is, of course, a different matter), the beliefs of the berserkers may well have had a great influence on their actions in battle and reactions to pain. In this light, the statement that the berserkers were those who had 'cultivated an ability to be possessed' has its place here if only as a theory that the berserkers derived their strengths and behaviours from self-induced manias and delusions.</dd>

<p>Regardless of whether or not you consider it to be scientific, it is still a popular theory regarding berserkr rage and should be duely noted as such. SynthesiseD 23:01, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since i was a child i had a serious rage issues brought on by a stressfull enviroment. I would become chilled and then my blood pressure would increase when i was younger i would lash out and it wasnt till later when i joined the military that i realized how to control my anger. I was simply searching the net on anything of interest when i stumbled onto this site. Everything makes perfect sence. I beleve that the berserker's rage or berserkage is totaly psychological which if you look into organic chemistry you will find that simply chemical mixtures create the functions in our brains there is even an area in modern psychology that is devoted directly to chemical interaction. Perhaps the combination of the chemicals injested and the rituals performed by the nordic berserkers pushed them into the "trance" you speak of. Also if you look at the reactions of people at a rock concert it almost takes control of the people and sends them into a rage. I cant seem to find any information on berserkers and the rituals they performed to back my theory if you could send me info i would appreciate it. Also the previous comment on the SWAT and SF units using berserker like traits is very true. However the rangers use extream exhustion to enduce rage. That is one of the ways i learned to manage my anger issues. my email is Jared_Peterson1986@hotmail.com.</p>
<p><br />
I beleive that there is another modern explaination (I do not have a source) that involves super-adrenalin states that people may enter. There are numerous verifiable stories about average persons confronted by emergency situations and exhibiting super-human strength (such as a mother lifting a car to rescue her child). It is believed that this is the result of excesive adrenalin in the body, and virtually all the blood being sent to muscles, leaving little left for the brain (causing the crazy and irrational behaviour). Vastly increased blood pressure and muscle tension would make these wariors less susceptible to damage. It is likely that the beserkers were a class of wariors that had learned techniques of entering these states at will (whether through the use of drugs or psychological effects). This may also be a recessive gene or heriditary trait.</p>
<p>Contemporary sources also describe the beserkers also smell extremely. Others were capable of smelling them from many feet away. This appears to indicate that the beserker's metabolism had been induced to an extremely high state.</p>
<p>The physical aftermath symptoms of excessive fatigue and inability to think clearly are familiar to anyone who has entered a super-adrenalin state. This is due partially to overloading of the nerves, in fact there is sometimes a buring sensation in the head as well as muscles which could be explained by nerve degredation. I apoligize for not having any sources for this theory.</p>

<p>This seems really long. I'm going to condense it. For instance, the use of "Berserker" as a character class in console RPGs doesn't need individual references for every game.</p>
<p>In addition, I'm going to edit several of the listings which identify characters as berserkers to indicate that those characters exhibit berserk rage, but are not necessarily operating within the Norse cultural tradition of the berserker. --<a href="../../../z/a/b/User%7EZabieru_0f7c.html" title="User:Zabieru">Zabieru</a> 12:20, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, my changes were more extensive than I'd planned, so here's a listing.
<ul>
<li>Condensed video game references into two bullet points instead of eight, trimming several explanations of game features from those listings. It's my opinion that the in-game behavior of a class, ability, or unit is not relevant to its status as a pop culture reference. If you disagree, could you rework the descriptions that were here, rather than just putting them back in? Several of them were very clumsy.</li>
<li>Removed references to use of the word "berserk" in its normal usage. I don't think that when an anime or a game describes a character or unit as "berserk" in order to indicate that it is out of control and enraged, that constitutes a meaningful reference. If the usage seemed to be referring to the cultural context of the Norse berserker, I left it.</li>
<li>Removed two references to characters (Marvel's Wolverine and Guts, from the anime Berserk) stating that they were berserkers, when this doesn't seem to be the case. I left the references to Wolverines' rages and to the anime itself, but to the best of my knowledge neither character ever wore a bear skin or engaged in any form of Norse spiritual practice, nor were they known for entering battle unarmored, and so on.</li>
<li>Trimmed out a note about the rarity and sought-after status of Black Label Society berserker badges. The badge is a reference, but discussion of the significance to the fan community should go on the band's page, not here.</li>
<li>Re-wrote the reference to Beorn from The Hobbit to remove weasel words. --<a href="../../../z/a/b/User%7EZabieru_0f7c.html" title="User:Zabieru">Zabieru</a> 13:02, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is rabies really a possible explanation for berserkers?

<p>Berserkergang as stated by some sites i checked out in the past seems to be more of a hate-trance, a self-invoked state of combined euphoria and anger. As such, the body would secret adrenaline and endorphines enhanching the person's fighting abilities but leaving it drained of energy when it's over. Some present-day Berserkers spoke about laying in bed for days after entering berserkergang due to lack of physical energy. Death might intervene during recovery, i think! So i don't think rabies should be considered here! Ulfednar 06:50, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Berserkir and Ulfhednar were said to be as rabid dogs, but I think that the description that was more about the way they acted rather than about them actually having rabies. SynthesiseD 18:10, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following text is not encyclopedic, is unsourced, and jovial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside from what was seen on the outside, going berserk required a significant motive most of the time. A fanatic sense of duty, justice, and honor were possible motives for inflicting this insanity upon one's self. Family, religion, and particularly love in general can spark irrational behavior, and under some circumstances, radically violent behavior. Every member of humanity is capable of being cursed with this degenerative state of being. All who come across descriptions that are related to going berserk, should not take the term lightly. It is a very extreme state of being which is unnecessarily hard on the persons involved. The resulting consequences are very possible: Heart attacks, strokes, burst veins and arteries, sometimes even squirting blood(yes..squirting) through your tear ducts, breaking of teeth, tendons, ripping muscles, having blood be excreted from your pores, going blind!, ...basically anything the human body is capapble of doing to itself(without psychological limitations)...by simply holding your breath, and increasing the preasure made by the organs and muscles. Advice: If you have any intelligence in you at all! Do not cultivate this state of being. For the sakes of those who are important to you, and if not them, then yourself.</p>

<p>From an evolutionary-genetic viewpoint, in many cold Nordic lands it helps to be a bit hyperactive to deal with the cold. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Under highly dispersed living conditions, where people have to store food to make it through the winters, it also helps to be able to explode with fury to fend off people who might come to steal one's food. Hence, one of the simplest explanations for the beserk phenomenon is (a) there is a valid tactical requirement in battle for "shock" warriors to use their fury to create breaches in enemy lines and (b) within a Nordic population there is a certain hyperactive percentage of the population who can cultivate turning on their natural proclivity towards rage and fury (as in what the Romans called "furor Germanicus") at strategic moments for military use.</p>

<p>As a suggestion for enlarging the article, it would be interesting to read more of what beserks meant in Scandinavian culture (ie relationship to paganism, Chrisitanity, the gods and spirits, etc). I am always bemused by so-called explanations offered by modern authorities to explain away such phemomena (eg physiological conditions, artificial stimulants, etc), which explain away the power of belief, or rationalise any supernatural elements.
