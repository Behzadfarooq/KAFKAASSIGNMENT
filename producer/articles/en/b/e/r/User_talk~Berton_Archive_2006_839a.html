<p>Hi Berton - I think this is best if the Lauraceae genus has first place to the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassytha.html" title="Cassytha">Cassytha</a> page, as it is an accepted genus, whereas the other name is just a synonym - I'll start a quick page about it now (it is easy to change).

<p>Hi Berton - thanks for the compliment! The idea of Categories:Flora by country or region has already been thought of, there are several around (interestingly, all southern hemisphere: Category:Argentine flora, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Category%7EFlora_of_Chile_6540.html" title="Category:Flora of Chile">Category:Flora of Chile</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Category%7ETrees_of_New_Zealand_c7ae.html" title="Category:Trees of New Zealand">Category:Trees of New Zealand</a>, Category:Australian plants). It has never been coordinated before (note that they all have different formats! - "X flora", "Flora of X", "Trees of X", "Xian plants"). The main problems with them are that (1) national / political boundaries do not match floristic boundaries (so e.g. Chile and Argentina share many species as the Valdivian rainforests extend a short way across the border); (2) the size of some floras (e.g. <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emei_Shan_ca86.html" title="Emei Shan">Emei Shan</a> in China has over 3000 species on just one mountain); and (3) conversely, some species have huge ranges so would have to be in about 30 or 40 or more national categories (e.g. <i>Juniperus communis</i>, found throughout most of Asia, Europe and North America; native in about 50 countries). So the idea has not been used very much. I guess it would be best to raise it at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_7339.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Plants_7183.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants</a>, and see what others think, too. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 14:39, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Berton - the reason I put this into <a href="../../../r/o/s/Category%7ERosales_2951.html" title="Category:Rosales">Category:Rosales</a> is that there are so few articles written for taxa in Urticaceae (only about 6), not enough to make it a useful category. The ideal is to have 100-200 articles in each category, so that clicking on 'Related changes' in the category gives a useful large list of recent changes made to articles for the minimum of working through lots of subcategories. Maybe one day when there are over 100 Urticaceae taxa with articles, then Category:Urticaceae would become more useful, but at the moment, it merely hinders checking for recent changes by making one more tiny subcategory to have to check. - Thanks! <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 20:25, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Berton,</p>
<p>I'm sure your page moves are well intentioned, but please stop. For one thing, it looks like you are doing the page moves in the wrong way. You should use the 'move' tab at the top of the page rather than using cut-n-paste, this is in order to preserve the contribution history - see <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPage_move_167f.html" title="Wikipedia:Page move">Wikipedia:Page move</a>. Secondly, I think you are going against consensus in moving plant articles to their scientific name. This sort of thing is organised by groups of editors such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_65b4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> (a project you might like to join). In general we put articles at their common English name where possible - there is also some policy discussing article naming at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 17:32, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Solipsist, thank you for info about move process (I don't know to using cut-n-paste, the contribution history would not be preserved).</dd>
<dd>However, I am not going against consensus in moving plant articles to their scientific name, since genus is a taxonomic category, not must be like species with a common name widely in use.</dd>
<dd>Even because there are several common names in several languages (there is no consensus). <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 18:01, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, I might not have picked up on that subtlety. I certainly wondered about restoring the article at <a href="../../../g/o/l/Goldenhead.html" title="Goldenhead">Goldenhead</a>, given that although that is where it was originally created, it never seems to have actually used the name 'Goldenhead' in the article text.</dd>
<dd>However, with <a href="../../../n/e/t/Nettle.html" title="Nettle">nettle</a> the article should surely be at the common English name. The main reason for putting articles at their common name (and not just on taxonomy related articles), is to try and ensure that when someone guesses an internal link, they get it right without needing to disambiguate it. If you check the 'What links here' link on the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Nettle.html" title="Nettle">nettle</a> page, you'll see that there are already quite a few articles linking to it quite naturally. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 18:18, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Berton,</p>
<p>I revised the entries on <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombacaceae.html" title="Bombacaceae">Bombacaceae</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malvaceae.html" title="Malvaceae">Malvaceae</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterculiaceae.html" title="Sterculiaceae">Sterculiaceae</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tiliaceae.html" title="Tiliaceae">Tiliaceae</a>, aiming for a more balanced whole. Of course, it is inevitable that any taxonomic circumscription is a point of view, and the use of any botanical name (especially at higher-levels) will likely be a PoV as well. Since Wikipedia tries to be neutral (NPoV) I tried to smooth these entries out.</p>
<p>Some notes: a ‚Äúvalid taxon‚Äù is not really a good way to describe anything. Names are valid, but by definition any botanical name is valid(ly published): it is a requirement (by <i>ICBN</i>). The fact that IPNI lists a name only means that it has been published, not whether it has been accepted, or by who.</p>
<p>A listing of authors who used a name in the past is of limited usefulness: the de Candolle‚Äôs recognised lots of taxa that are no longer accepted (they probably used <i>Cupuliferae</i>, and nobody will use that these days). A balanced view means documenting who will use a name today (or in the past decade). A separate segment on the historical usage is OK of course, if designated as such.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you will take a careful look at what I have done. Higher level systematics is not very interesting reading for the users: most people do not look further than species and genus. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 08:54, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Berton - lists do actually recognise things, because those lists are compiled by taxonomists and the list is therefore a reflection of the taxonomist. The only way we know that a long-dead taxonomist recognised something, is because the list he/she published recognises it. The reason I made those edits is that including a complete who's who of who recognised what a hundred years ago is completely out of place on these pages; it doesn't add anything useful, clutters the page up horribly and makes it read like a poorly-concealed editorial fight (which is exactly what it is!). Linking to a list of those same taxonomists on a separate page makes for a much more readable page. We've got to produce an encyclopaedia which can be read and understood by Joe Public, not produce a page of arguments that no-one will find any interest in reading. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 21:48, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks!&#160;:-) that pine was not so very difficult to identify, there are only two species of pine native in that area of eastern China; <i>P. hwangshanensis</i> is very recognisable <a href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;rls=RNWE%2CRNWE%3A2004-34%2CRNWE%3Aen&amp;q=huangshan+pine" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;rls=RNWE%2CRNWE%3A2004-34%2CRNWE%3Aen&amp;q=huangshan+pine" rel="nofollow">(google pics)</a> and the other (<i>P. massoniana</i>) is very different in appearance (and is also a lowland species, not growing on those mountains). If the location was not given it would not have been so easy, as there are several other pines similar in appearance elsewhere in the world (<i>P. nigra, P. thunbergii, P. luchuensis</i>, etc) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 16:49, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Berton, my primary request is that if you don't like the way I have edited an article, rather than simply revert it to a previous version, edit it to your liking. I have tried very hard to provide additional, relevant, and accurate information to all of the articles I have worked on. I did revert the Sterculiaceae and Bombacaceae articles to my versions because I put a lot of work into editing them, and all that was lost when you reverted to your own, older version. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 15:55, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Berton, this looks like good advice to me. Move forward, do add information. Reverting is usually not a good idea, unless an edit was really bad (introduced errors, was plain silly, etc). Reverting back and forth is not going to make for a good atmosphere. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 21:41, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Berton, I am at least as opposed to the Phylocode as you are, but the citation of the Taxon letter to the editor that is otherwise not mentioned, discussed or cited in the article, has dubious relevance out of context (and the context is not clear from the citation itself), and is inaccessible to most Wikipedia users in the first place, is quite pointless. It simply adds no new information to the article. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 16:41, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Brya, congratulations on last edits (De Candolle system and Bentham &amp; Hooker system). I have the Hutchinson's system (but only the 1st. Edition) and the one of Goldberg, do you find convenient to add them? BTW, Dalla Torre &amp; Harms system is not system, but list, according to Woodland, D. W.

<dl>
<dd>Dear Berton, thank you for the kind words on de Candolle, etc. At this stage I am in favour of adding all the extra systems we can find, perhaps even several different versions of one particular system.</dd>
<dd>As to the Dalla Torre &amp; Harms system, I must admit I am not closely familiar with it, so I cannot say how distinct it is (taxonomically) from the Engler system. What I do know is that it has a special status in nomenclature, and therefore stands out: in a way it is more prominent than the Engler system. Sooner or later it should gets its own entry, in which the details can be explained. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBrya_6276.html" title="User:Brya">Brya</a> 13:50, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem with something like that on a page like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_8c56.html" title="Talk:Evolution">Talk:Evolution</a> is that basically all that ever happens is that you spend time answering the same complaints that "evolution didn't happen" or "evolution is a lie", over and over, and it runs for pages and pages...and any attempts to discuss the article and its content get lost. In addition, arguments like that get heated and lead to more bad feeling (as if there isn't enough). There are fora available for discussing things like that, but turning a talk page into a discussion forum puts an unnecessary (and often, unacceptable) burden on people who are trying to write an encyclopaedia. How many times do you want to interact with yet another aggressive person saying "there are no transitional fossils" or "the probability of proteins assembling by chance is too low to have happened" or "evolution has never been observed"?</p>
<p>On a more positive note...Lauraceae? Wow. They are bane of a field ecologist! Even fertile they can be impossible to ID. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:27, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Cassytha filiformis</i> was actually the only Lauraceae in my field sites in Puerto Rico (unless there are some among my unknowns), but in Trinidad they are some of the most common forest trees - a few easy ones, the rest just leave you scratching your head (easy to get to family even without being able to reach the leaves, but beyond that, nothing). I like Rubes as a whole - easy to get to family, again. I like dry forest rubes - <i>Guettarda</i>, <i>Exostema</i>, <i>Antirhea</i>, <i>Randia</i> - but I am less fond of them in rainforest understoreys - <i>Psychotria</i> is a headache, <i>Palicourea</i>, and the rest I can't remember. But yeah, I picked my user name because it was one of my favourites. It does cause confusion about my gender though (which can be quite amusing). <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 15:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Berton! Which of Rautavaara's works do you like best? Mine is Symphony No. 3. Gorgeous, especially the finale. However, I consider <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_Leyendecker_2a80.html" title="Ulrich Leyendecker">Ulrich Leyendecker</a> to be the greatest contemporary composer. (Of course, Rautavaara is still very good!)</p>

<p>Hi Berton - it depends on the wording of the category. The wiki software treats <a href="../../../f/l/o/Category%7EFlora_of_Brazil_fbc1.html" title="Category:Flora of Brazil">Category:Flora of Brazil</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Category%7EFlora_of_Brazil_fbc1.html" title="Category:Flora of Brazil">Category:flora of Brazil</a> as the same, as the first letter is auto-capitalised. The preferred format is also Category:Flora of Xxxx, so they will be alright. The problem to watch for is something like Category:Brazilian Flora, which is <i>not</i> the same as Category:Brazilian flora - but since they don't fit with the preferred format (I'm expecting them to be redlinks when I save the page!), any like that should be changed from "Xxxxian F/flora" to "Flora of Xxxx" style anyway. Hope this answers your query! - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 15:45, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again - so far they seem to be mixed. I found a <a href="../../../a/r/c/Category%7EArctic_flora_8ce6.html" title="Category:Arctic flora">Category:Arctic flora</a>, and a Category:Neotropical Flora. I think before adding any more pages to these categories, it would be best to post a query at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Tree_of_Life_7339.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Plants_7183.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Plants</a>, so that the format can be standardised - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 16:54, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IPNI is generally not a good reference to use for family circumscriptions. IPNI does not follow any particular taxonomic classification scheme as it is compiled from several different databases that often treat the same genera in different ways, and often using seriously outdated classifications. While IPNI consistently places <i>Lomandra</i> itself in Lomandraceae, if you search on the other genera you will find a variety of familial placements, including Xanthorrhoeaceae, Agavaceae, Liliaceae, etc. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarwin_f401.html" title="User:MrDarwin">MrDarwin</a> 17:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>MrDarwin, I agree that IPNI is not a reference source for family circumscription. However it is, no doubt, the most important source of nomenclatural reference, which many people consult and they obtain taxonomic information. If it refers Lomandra as Lomandraceae, I find this important.Other people will have this information and why will wonder at Wikipedia it is Laxmanniaceae and at IPNI (this immense database, of sources highly reliable like Kew) it is Lomandraceae. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerton_d054.html" title="User:Berton">Berton</a> 17:58, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Berton - thanks for the note, seems US Govt people are not above breaking copyright! (I originally found it in an USDA website, which is why I thought it was OK).

<p>Hello Berton, I've just been admiring your article on Engler and hope that you don't mind my putting in his full name. Like you and Linnaeus I also regard botany as <i>scientia amabilis</i> and have done quite a few pages on South African botanists like Galpin, Marloth (busy), Bolus etc. I think your photo of Engler is an excellent one . Was he ever married with a family? Cheers <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_venter_0ade.html" title="User:Paul venter">Paul venter</a> 15:25, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suspect it is because English is not your first language, but many of your comments on the issue of blocking Brya come across as personal attacks. I advise you to choose your words more carefully; some of the things you have written, had they come from a native English speaker in other contexts, could be taken as vile insults. Brya faced the same issue, and in fact some of those who supported his blocking did as well, despite being native speakers of English. Everyone should stop, and you can do your part by not responding in kind.--<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurtis_Clark_2ae7.html" title="User:Curtis Clark">Curtis Clark</a> 14:54, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>you had posted your email adress on Bryas talk page. Brya was concerned about your privacy, and asked me to remove it, which I have done. I hope you don't mind, Brya has read your message.</p>
