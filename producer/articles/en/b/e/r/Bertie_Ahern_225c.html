His Father was a supporter of the '<a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_IRA_3c50.html" title="Old IRA">Old IRA</a>' for decades after the War of Independence, and Ahern claims he can remember guns being hidden around the house, and the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garda_S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na_1ce6.html" title="Garda Síochána">Garda Síochána</a> coming to question his father when he was a child.

As there is no legal definition in Ireland of the term <i>accountant</i> this is technically correct. But he is not a qualified chartered, certified or public accountant.

<p>By 1972 Ahern had met his future wife, Miriam Kelly, a bank official who lived near to the Aherns and they married in 1975. Ahern has two daughters from his marriage: <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgina_Ahern_8784.html" title="Georgina Ahern">Georgina</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecelia_Ahern_607f.html" title="Cecelia Ahern">Cecelia</a>, the former the wife of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westlife.html" title="Westlife">Westlife</a> member <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicky_Byrne_ed42.html" title="Nicky Byrne">Nicky Byrne</a> and the latter a best-selling <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_novel.html" title="Romance novel">romantic</a> novelist. The pressure of being <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Mayor_of_Dublin_1155.html" title="Lord Mayor of Dublin">Lord Mayor of Dublin</a> in 1986 allied to the stresses involved with holding a Cabinet position contributed to their separation in 1992. They remain on good terms despite a protracted court battle on the terms of separation. Until 2003, Ahern maintained a relationship with <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celia_Larkin_d06d.html" title="Celia Larkin">Celia Larkin</a>, a <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> activist whom he met in the 1980s. His daughter Georgina's marriage to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westlife.html" title="Westlife">Westlife</a>'s Nicky Byrne stimulated controversy. The decision by the couple to marry in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> instead of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the cost of the wedding, the show-business aspect and the selling of the wedding pictures to the magazine <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello%21.html" title="Hello!">Hello!</a>, all caused controversy.</p>

However, he was publicly criticised by the then <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_of_Ireland_2593.html" title="Primate of Ireland">Archbishop of Dublin</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desmond_Cardinal_Connell_5b22.html" title="Desmond Cardinal Connell">Desmond Cardinal Connell</a> for the public nature of his relationship with Celia Larkin. In the Archbishop's view, a separated father living with a mistress was a bad example to young people aspiring to a leadership position. Larkin was appointed to the board of the National Consumer Agency in July 2005, on the recommendation of Ahern's department.</p>

<p>Ahern's first became involved in a Fianna Fáil <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a> campaign in 1965 climbing lamp posts to hang election posters in Drumcondra. During the campaign, Ahern met his political mentor and future Taoiseach, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Haughey_c0f7.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a>. Ahern became a member of <a href="../../../f/i/a/Fianna_F%C3%A1il_a8d8.html" title="Fianna Fáil">Fianna Fáil</a> at the age of 17 and in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_general_election%2C_1969.html" title="Irish general election, 1969">1969 General Election</a> he helped in the election campaign in his constituency.</p>
<p>Ahern's first run for elected office was during the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landslide_victory.html" title="Landslide victory">landslide</a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_general_election%2C_1977.html" title="Irish general election, 1977">1977 General Election</a>, when Fianna Fáil formed the last single-party government with a 20-seat <a href="../../../d/%C3%A1/i/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_8259.html" title="Dáil Éireann">Dáil</a> majority, the largest ever. Ahern received 4,000 first preference votes and was elected with transfers from other candidates. In subsequent elections Ahern became one of the highest vote-getters in the country.</p>
<p>During his first years as a TD, Ahern was an anonymous backbencher, but did display ambition. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> when Charles Haughey and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Colley_4e03.html" title="George Colley">George Colley</a>, both constituency colleagues, fought a divisive battle for the position of party leader and Taoiseach, Ahern is believed to have backed Haughey. Ahern had served on a health committee with Haughey in the mid-1970s and was impressed by him even then.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> Haughey called an early general election in the hope of achieving the elusive overall majority which had evaded him so far.

The <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Democrats_3859.html" title="Progressive Democrats">Progressive Democrats</a> seemed the most likely partners and negotiations were led by <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Reynolds_78d3.html" title="Albert Reynolds">Albert Reynolds</a> and Ahern.

<p>In early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> Charles Haughey resigned. Ahern was encouraged by Haughey and others to bid for the position. He was apprehensive, however, and remained out of the contest, allowing Reynolds to become party leader and Taoiseach. It is believed that Reynolds and Ahern struck a deal in which Ahern would withdraw and thus remain in the Cabinet, to succeed subsequently. Ahern and Dr. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Woods_09d3.html" title="Michael Woods">Michael Woods</a> were the only two senior members to remain in the new Reynolds Cabinet, with Ahern retaining his Finance portfolio.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_General_Election%2C_1992_7738.html" title="Irish General Election, 1992">1992 General Election</a> Fianna Fáil formed a coalition government with the Labour Party.

Ahern briefly succeeded Labour leader <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Spring_1137.html" title="Dick Spring">Dick Spring</a> as acting Tánaiste. However the government fell and Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader.</p>
<p>During 1993, while he was Finance Minister, Ahern accepted payments of IR £39,000 from various businessmen: <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertie_Ahern_225c.html#Admission_of_undeclared_payments" title="Bertie Ahern">see below</a> for details.

<p>Negotiations for a resumption of Government with the Labour Party began immediately. It was expected that the coalition would continue and that Ahern would become Taoiseach.

<p>Ahern's first government saw some teething problems during its first six months.</p>
<p>Firstly, Ahern tried to nominate <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Andrews_f318.html" title="David Andrews">David Andrews</a> as <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_for_Defence_%28Ireland%29_0bb9.html" title="Minister for Defence (Ireland)">Minister for Defence</a> and as <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_State_%28Ireland%29_8728.html" title="Minister of State (Ireland)">Junior Minister</a> at the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_%28Ireland%29_1ed2.html" title="Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)">Department of Foreign Affairs</a>.

<p>Secondly, in July, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Haughey_c0f7.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a> gave evidence to the <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCracken_Tribunal_e70d.html" title="McCracken Tribunal">McCracken Tribunal</a> on corruption confirming that he had received IR£1.3 million (€1.7 million) in gifts from businessman <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Dunne_69d6.html" title="Ben Dunne">Ben Dunne</a>, which he had previously denied. This damaged Haughey's reputation more than the Government's.</p>
<p>Thirdly, earlier allegations resurfaced about Ahern's Foreign Minister, <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Burke_31e0.html" title="Ray Burke">Ray Burke</a>. Burke eventually admitted to receiving IR£30,000 (€38,000) in a corrupt payment and was forced to resign.

<p>Another controversy during Ahern's first term in office was the selection of the Fianna Fáil candidate to contest the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_presidential_election%2C_1997.html" title="Irish presidential election, 1997">Presidential elections of 1997</a>.

<p>In November 2004, Ahern celebrated ten years as leader of Fianna Fáil. In April 2006, he became the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Taoisigh_by_important_facts_48a5.html" title="List of Taoisigh by important facts">second longest serving</a> Taoiseach, after <a href="../../../%C3%A9/a/m/%C3%89amon_de_Valera_5d90.html" title="Éamon de Valera">Éamon de Valera</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, American use of Shannon Airport returned to haunt Ahern. The government learned the previous year that US plane N379P, which transported prisoners from Sweden to Egypt for torture, was spotted at Shannon on numerous occasions.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Ahern refused to investigate despite several eye-witness accounts by anti-war protesters and statements from individual deputies and senators demanding an inspection of such planes on Irish soil.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, the media joined in the calls for inspection; the US ambassador was called to appear before a Dáil committee (he refused) and a Seanad committee to investigate the matter was discussed. Government senators subsequently blocked the establishment of the committee, citing fears of offending a friendly state.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Among other criticisms of Ahern's term of office were Ireland's entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace without a referendum, ratification of the Nice Treaty by the holding of a second referendum when it had been rejected in an earlier one, and the curtailment of the Freedom of Information Act after the war in Iraq had begun.</p>
<p>Ahern's government has spent €52 million on a Nedap <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_voting_in_Ireland_ba21.html" title="Electronic voting in Ireland">electronic voting</a> system, that is insecure that could have been tampered with in order to change results.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ahern was criticised by the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moriarty_Tribunal_2c01.html" title="Moriarty Tribunal">Moriarty Tribunal</a> for signing blank state cheques for the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey, without asking what those cheques were for. Ahern told the tribunal that a policy of signing blank cheques was used on the Fianna Fáil party leader's account for reasons of <i>"administrative convenience"</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> In September 2006 <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Irish_Times_e693.html" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a></i> printed claims allegedly leaked<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup> from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mahon_Tribunal_d8bb.html" title="The Mahon Tribunal">The Mahon Tribunal</a> that Ahern had received money from a millionaire businessman while Minister for Finance in 1993.<br /></p>
<p>The editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> defended the publication as being in the public interest at a hearing of the tribunal, saying that it was not a party to the Supreme Court case which restrained the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> from publishing leaked documents. This order was directed against the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> but its interim order purported to restrain all media outlets from publishing confidential material from the inquiry.</p>
<p>Ahern has admitted that he did receive money but said on being interviewed that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>What I got personally in my life, to be frank with you is none of your business. If I got something from somebody as a present or something like that I can use it.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Ahern said in 1996, while in opposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The public are entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, their officials and above all of Ministers. They need to know that they are under financial obligations to nobody.</i> (Dáil Éireann transcript, December 1996)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contradiction has been criticised in editorials in both the <i>Irish Independent</i> <a href="http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=44&amp;si=1693811&amp;issue_id=14686" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=44&amp;si=1693811&amp;issue_id=14686" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and <i>The Irish Times</i><a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/front/2006/0923/1158590929587.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/front/2006/0923/1158590929587.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>Six days after the payments were publicised Ahern admitted in a soft<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup> television interview<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> that he had received two payments totalling IR£39,000 (€50,000) in 1993 and 1994. Ahern regarded the money as a loan, but he conceded that no repayments had at that time (September 2006) been made and no interest has been paid. He said that he had attempted to repay it, but that his friends would not accept repayment. He claimed that he had <i>broken no codes - ethical, tax, legal or otherwise</i>. A previous Taoiseach <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Haughey_c0f7.html" title="Charles Haughey">Charles Haughey</a> who was in receipt of money from friends and businessmen paid tax and penalties on gifts received while in office.</p>
<p>In the same interview, he also admitted to receiving a payment of £8,000 from a group of 25 businessmen in Manchester on one occasion. He claimed that this money was again unsolicited, that it was a gift and therefore not subject to tax as it had been received when abroad, and that it was paid to him after he gave an after-dinner speech at an <i>ad hoc</i> function. He claimed that the money was given to him as a private citizen, not to him in his then role as Minister for Finance, and that no other payments were received by him after speaking at other similar functions. The Irish Times reported on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">30 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> that part of this payment was actually a cheque drawn on NCB Stockbrokers, a large Irish company. A number of his benefactors have received appointments as directors of State boards.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup> Insisting that no favours had been offered or received, Ahern said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I might have appointed somebody but I appointed them because they were friends, not because of anything they had given me.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the Standards in Public Office Commission's rules,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>The bewilderment caused to the public about recent revelations has been deeply upsetting for me and others near and dear to me. To them, to the Irish people and to this house, I offer my apologies.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further questions were raised about IR£50,000 (€63,300) which he had lodged to his bank account in 1994. He claimed this was money he had saved over a substantial period of time (1987–1994) when he had had no active bank account. During this period he was Minister for Labour and subsequently Minister for Finance. He was asked by the leader of the Labour party, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Rabbitte_f8fc.html" title="Pat Rabbitte">Pat Rabbitte</a> whether, in the absence of a bank account, he had kept the money in a <i>sock in the hot-press</i> and by <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Higgins_36f5.html" title="Joe Higgins">Joe Higgins</a>, the leader of the Socialist Party if he had kept the money <i>in a shoe-box</i>. Ahern replied that he had kept the money <i>in his own possession</i>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> further information emerged<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[16]</a></sup> in the Dáil that Ahern had bought his house in Dublin from Manchester based Irish businessman, Micheál Wall, who was at an event in Manchester in 1994 where the Taoiseach received a payment of £8000 (€11800). This caused further tensions within the Government coalition parties.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_10.html" title="October 10">October 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> the Taoiseach<sup id="_ref-expands_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-expands" title="">[17]</a></sup> again told the Dáil, that it was an <i>error of judgment</i> for him to accept loans and gifts for personal purposes in the early 1990s. Ahern expanded on his apology to the Dáil of the previous week, which he described as unqualified. Ahern said there would now be a change in the ethics law requiring office holders offered a gift from friends to consult the Standards in Public Office Commission<a href="http://www.sipo.gov.ie/en/CodesofConduct/OfficeHolders/File,729,en.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sipo.gov.ie/en/CodesofConduct/OfficeHolders/File,729,en.pdf" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and to accept their ruling.</p>
<p>Allegations had been made that he had taken IR£50,000 (€63,300) from a property developer, Owen O'Callaghan, in return for favours at this time. Ahern won a libel action against a Cork business man "Starry" O'Brien defending himself against this allegation.</p>
<p>In March 2007, it was revealed that one of Ahern's Manchester benefactors Paddy 'The Plasterer' is organising a election campaign in the Taoiseach's constituency. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ahern's reputation has been damaged by the revelation of cash gifts received that have transmuted to loans from businessmen. His reputation as the <a href="../../../t/e/f/Teflon.html" title="Teflon">Teflon</a> Taoiseach (no allegation of unethical behaviour has stuck to him until September 2006) has been damaged.

Some commentators however, maintained that they showed the Irish people drew a distinction between the Ahern affair and previous financial scandals involving Irish politicians, both on the basis of sums received and the fact that the Taoiseach had used them to repay loans, rather than for self-enrichment, unlike former Taoiseach Charles Haughey for example.</p>
<p>Ahern wants to win a third general election in 2007 and opinion polls, in October 2006, place him in a position to succeed. If reappointed Taoiseach, he would be the second person to hold that office three times in succession. He has stated<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> that he hopes to remain in politics until he is 60, whether as Taoiseach, backbencher or otherwise.</p>
<p>Polls in January 2007 showed his coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats at 37% and 1% respectively against the Fine Gael / Labour alternative government figure of 37%. A promise by Labour, at their February 2007 party conference of a cut in the basic rate of income tax, paid by 80% of workers, from 20% to 18% created some excitement in political and media circles. Income tax cuts by the FF/PD government had concentrated on the top rate of tax and Labour were able to portray their proposal as progressive to the discomfiture of Fianna Fáil.</p>
