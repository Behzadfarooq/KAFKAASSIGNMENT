<p>He was born at Fontaines, near <a href="../../../d/i/j/Dijon.html" title="Dijon">Dijon</a>, in <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, into the noble class: his father Tescelin was a knight of the lower nobility; and his mother, Aleth, was a daughter of the noble house of Montbard. She was a woman distinguished for her piety, and died while Bernard was a boy. Constitutionally unfit for a military career, his own disposition, as well as his mother's early influence, directed him to the church. His desire to enter a monastery was opposed by his relations, who sent him to study at <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2tillon-sur-Seine_9e2a.html" title="Châtillon-sur-Seine">Châtillon-sur-Seine</a> in order to qualify him for high ecclesiastical preferment. Bernard's resolution to become a monk was not, however, shaken, and when he at last definitely decided to join the community that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_of_Molesme_314f.html" title="Robert of Molesme">Robert of Molesme</a> had founded at <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citeaux.html" title="Citeaux">Citeaux</a> in 1098, he took with him his brothers and many of his relations and friends.</p>

<p>The little community of reformed <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictines.html" title="Benedictines">Benedictines</a> at Cîteaux, which would have so profound an influence on Western <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monasticism.html" title="Monasticism">monasticism</a>, grew so rapidly that it was soon able to send out offshoots. One of these monasteries, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvaux.html" title="Clairvaux">Clairvaux</a>, was founded in 1115, in a wild valley of a tributary of the Aube, on land given by Count Hugh of Troyes. There Bernard, a recent initiate, was appointed abbot.</p>
<p>By the new constitution of the Cistercians, Clairvaux became the chief monastery of the five branches into which the order was divided under the supreme direction of the abbot of Cîteaux. Though nominally subject to Cîteaux, Clairvaux soon became the most important Cistercian house, owing to the fame and influence of Bernard.</p>

<p>Before long the abbot, who had intended to devote his life to the work of his monastery, was drawn into the affairs of the outside world. When in 1124 <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Honorius_II_959d.html" title="Pope Honorius II">Pope Honorius II</a> was elected, Bernard was already reckoned among the greatest of French churchmen; he now shared in the most important ecclesiastical discussions, and papal legates sought his counsel.</p>
<p>Thus in 1128 he was invited by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_%28Catholicism%29_84c0.html" title="Cardinal (Catholicism)">Cardinal</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew.html" title="Matthew">Matthew</a> of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albano.html" title="Albano">Albano</a> to the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synod_of_Troyes_06df.html" title="Synod of Troyes">synod of Troyes</a>, where he was instrumental in obtaining the recognition of the new order of <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Templar_f717.html" title="Knights Templar">Knights Templar</a>, the rules of which he is said to have drawn up; and in the following year, at the synod of Châlons-sur-Marne, he ended the crisis arising out of certain charges brought against Henry, Bishop of Verdun, by persuading the bishop to resign.</p>

<p>The European importance of Bernard, however, began with the death of Pope Honorius (1130) and the disputed election that followed. In the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conclave.html" title="Conclave">conclave</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipope_Anacletus_II_38a3.html" title="Antipope Anacletus II">Anacletus II</a> was elected by a narrow margin, but many influential cardinals favored the contender, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Innocent_II_a0b4.html" title="Pope Innocent II">Pope Innocent II</a>, a disciple of Bernard and the Cistercian reforms. In the synod convoked by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_VI_of_France_bd57.html" title="Louis VI of France">Louis the Fat</a> at Etampes in April 1130, Bernard successfully asserted the claims of Innocent II against those of Anacletus, and from this moment became Innocent's most influential supporter. He threw himself into the contest with characteristic ardour. While Rome was held by the faction that supported Anacletus, France, England, Spain and Germany declared for Innocent, who, though banished from Rome, was—in Bernard's phrase—"accepted by the world." The pope traveled from place to place, with the powerful abbot of Clairvaux at his side; he stayed at Clairvaux itself, humble still, so far as its buildings were concerned; and he went with Bernard to parley with <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lothair_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_d21d.html" title="Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor">Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, at <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge_%28city%29.html" title="Liège (city)">Liège</a>.</p>
<p>In 1133, the year of the emperor's first expedition to Rome, Bernard was in Italy persuading the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa.html" title="Genoa">Genoese</a> to make peace with <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisa.html" title="Pisa">Pisa</a>, since Innocent had need of both. He accompanied Innocent to Rome, successfully resisting the proposal to reopen negotiations with Anacletus, who held the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castel_Sant%27Angelo_f117.html" title="Castel Sant'Angelo">Castel Sant'Angelo</a> and, with the support of <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_II_of_Sicily_7ac9.html" title="Roger II of Sicily">Roger II of Sicily</a>, was too strong to be subdued by force. Lothair, though crowned by Innocent in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Peter%27s_Basilica_85be.html" title="St. Peter's Basilica">St. Peter's</a>, could do nothing to establish him in the Holy See so long as his own power was sapped by his quarrel with the house of <a href="../../../h/o/h/Hohenstaufen.html" title="Hohenstaufen">Hohenstaufen</a>. Again Bernard came to the rescue; in the spring of 1135 he was at <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bamberg.html" title="Bamberg">Bamberg</a> successfully persuading <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_II%2C_Duke_of_Swabia_37af.html" title="Frederick II, Duke of Swabia">Frederick Hohenstaufen</a> to submit to the emperor.</p>
<p>In June, he was back in Italy, taking a leading part in the council of Pisa, by which Anacletus was <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunicated.html" title="Excommunicated">excommunicated</a>. In northern Italy, the effect of his personality and of his preaching was immense; <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a> itself, of all the Lombard cities most jealous of the imperial claims, surrendered to his eloquence, submitted to Lothar and to Innocent and tried to force Bernard against his will into the vacant see of Milan.</p>
<p>In 1137, the year of Lothar's last journey to Rome, Bernard was back in Italy again; at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Cassino_3751.html" title="Monte Cassino">Monte Cassino</a>, setting the affairs of the monastery in order, at <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salerno.html" title="Salerno">Salerno</a>, trying in vain to induce Roger of Sicily to declare against Anacletus, and in Rome itself, agitating with success against the antipope.</p>
<p>When Anacletus died on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/1/3/1138.html" title="1138">1138</a> and the cardinal Gregory was elected his successor, assuming the name of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipope_Victor_IV_%281138%29_0a47.html" title="Antipope Victor IV (1138)">Victor IV</a>, Bernard's crowning triumph in the long contest was the abdication of the new antipope Victor, the result of his personal influence. The schism of the church was healed and the abbot of Clairvaux was free to return to the peace of his monastery.</p>

<p>Clairvaux itself had meanwhile (1135–1136) been transformed outwardly—in spite of the reluctance of Bernard, who preferred the rough simplicity of the original buildings—into a more suitable seat for an influence that overshadowed that of Rome itself. How great this influence was is shown by the outcome of Bernard's contest with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Abelard_a004.html" title="Peter Abelard">Peter Abelard</a>. Bernard was the prosecutor in Abelard's trial for heresy. Bernard had been hostile to the scholars at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Paris_9ce6.html" title="University of Paris">University of Paris</a>, the center of the new learning based on Aristotle, suspecting those who learned "merely in order that they might know" for the vanity of a learned reputation. For Bernard, the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_arts.html" title="Liberal arts">liberal arts</a> served but a narrow purpose: to prepare the priesthood. In intellectual and dialectical power, the abbot was no match for the great schoolman; yet at <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sens.html" title="Sens">Sens</a> in <a href="../../../1/1/4/1141.html" title="1141">1141</a>, Abelard feared to face him and when he appealed to Rome, Bernard's word was enough to secure his condemnation.</p>

Between 1130 and 1145, no less than 93 monasteries in connection with Clairvaux were either founded or affiliated from other rules, three being established in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and one in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. In 1145, a Cistercian monk, once a member of the community of Clairvaux—another Bernard, abbot of Aquae Silviae near Rome, was elected pope as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Eugene_III_f55d.html" title="Pope Eugene III">Pope Eugene III</a>. This was a triumph for the order; to the world it was a triumph for Bernard, who complained that all who had suits to press at Rome applied to him, as though he himself had become pope.</p>

<p>Having previously healed the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipope.html" title="Antipope">schism</a> within the church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languedoc.html" title="Languedoc">Languedoc</a> especially had become a hotbed of heresy and at this time the preaching of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_of_Lausanne_b452.html" title="Henry of Lausanne">Henry of Lausanne</a> was drawing thousands from the orthodox faith. In June 1145, at the invitation of Cardinal <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberic_of_Ostia_f4f8.html" title="Alberic of Ostia">Alberic of Ostia</a>, Bernard traveled in the south.

<p>Far more important was his activity in the following year, when, according to Odo of Deuil, Bernard was asked by Louis VII, as if he were a divine oracle, whether it would be right to raise a crusade (Odo of Deuil, <i>De Profectione</i>, trans V.Berry 1948). Odo writes that Bernard reserved judgement until Pope Eugene III commanded him to preach the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Crusade_dfbe.html" title="Second Crusade">Second Crusade</a>. The effect of his eloquence was extraordinary. At the great meeting at <a href="../../../v/%C3%A9/z/V%C3%A9zelay.html" title="Vézelay">Vézelay</a>, on March 21, after Bernard's sermon, King <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_VII_of_France_6da2.html" title="Louis VII of France">Louis VII of France</a> and his queen, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine_9952.html" title="Eleanor of Aquitaine">Eleanor</a>, took the cross, together with a host of all classes, so numerous that the stock of crosses was soon exhausted.</p>
<p>Although Bernard had indeed preached at Vézelay, Louis had already made his plans to embark on the Second crusade at his Christmas court at Bourges of 1145, where <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_of_Freising_ef98.html" title="Otto of Freising">Otto of Freising</a> records that Louis wished to make a crusade to fulfil his brother Philip's obligation, after his death had prevented him from making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Bernard continued through northern France, and also preached in <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> and the Rhine provinces. One reason for his extended preaching tour into Germany was the rabble-rousing of an itinerant monk, Radulf, who had stirred the German populace to anti-Semitic attacks, as recorded by Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn. Radulf preached and was, according to Otto of Freising, living in the Rhineland "in greatest favour of the people" (<i>Gesta Friderici</i>, trans. C.Mierow 1994), and it took Bernard's eloquent preaching to persuade the populace that the Jews were not to be killed "but scattered." At <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speyer.html" title="Speyer">Speyer</a> on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_Day_0d60.html" title="Christmas Day">Christmas Day</a> he succeeded in persuading <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conrad_III_of_Germany_a621.html" title="Conrad III of Germany">Conrad</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_the_Romans_2ca5.html" title="King of the Romans">king of the Romans</a>, to join the crusade.</p>
<p>The disastrous outcome of the crusade was a blow to Bernard, who found it difficult to understand why God would move in this way but ascribed it to the sins of the crusaders (Episte 288; <i>de Consideratione</i>. ii. I). The news of the defeats of the crusading host first reached Bernard at Clairvaux, where <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Eugene_III_f55d.html" title="Pope Eugene III">Pope Eugene III</a>, driven from Rome by the revolution of <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_of_Brescia_82fd.html" title="Arnold of Brescia">Arnold of Brescia</a>, was his guest. Bernard had in March and April 1148 accompanied the pope to the council of Reims, where he led the attack on certain propositions of the scholastic theologian <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_de_la_Porr%C3%A9e_8b45.html" title="Gilbert de la Porrée">Gilbert de la Porrée</a>. From whatever cause—possibly the growing jealousy of the cardinals, or the loss of prestige owing to rumours about the crusade, the success of which he had so confidently predicted—Bernard's influence, previously a danger to those suspected of heterodoxy, on this occasion had little effect.</p>
<p>On the news of the disaster that had overtaken the crusaders, an effort was made to retrieve it by organizing another expedition. At the invitation of <a href="../../../s/u/g/Suger.html" title="Suger">Suger</a>, abbot of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Denis_Basilica_538a.html" title="Saint Denis Basilica">St Denis</a>, now the virtual ruler of France, Bernard attended the meeting at Chartres in 1150 convened for this purpose, where he himself was elected to conduct the new crusade. An important religious figure of the time, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_the_Venerable_748d.html" title="Peter the Venerable">Peter the Venerable</a>, had been invited to this meeting but had declined to attend, and the meeting was perceived by some as a bad idea in light of Bernard's age and frailty, and the theological issues raised by having an abbot lead a fighting army. Eugene III held back from fully endorsing this project which eventually came to nothing, and Bernard himself wrote to Eugene making clear his unsuitability for the task and that he never intended to lead such a crusade. Bernard was aging, broken by his austerities and by ceaseless work, and saddened by the loss of several of his early friends. His intellectual energy remained undimmed. He continued to take an active interest in ecclesiastical affairs, and his last work, the <i>De Consideratione</i>, written to Eugene III and describing the nature of papal power, shows no sign of failing power.</p>

<p>Bernard expanded upon <a href="../../../a/n/s/Anselm_of_Canterbury_7924.html" title="Anselm of Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>'s role in transmuting the sacramentally ritual Christianity of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Middle_Ages_a977.html" title="Early Middle Ages">Early Middle Ages</a> into a new, more personally held faith, with the life of Christ as a model and a new emphasis on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_the_mother_of_Jesus_3bac.html" title="Mary, the mother of Jesus">Virgin Mary</a>. In opposition to the rational approach to divine understanding that the scholastics adopted, Bernard preached an immediate faith, in which the intercessor was the Virgin Mary—"the Virgin that is the royal way, by which the Saviour comes to us." "Bernard played the leading role in the development of the Virgin cult, which is one of the most important manifestations of the popular piety of the twelfth century. In early medieval thought, the Virgin Mary had played a minor role and it was only with the rise of emotional Christianity in the eleventh century that she became the prime intercessor for humanity with the deity." <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The greatness of Bernard is generally regarded as being his character. The age saw him as the embodiment of its ideal: that of medieval monasticism at its highest development. The world had no meaning for him save as a place of banishment and trial, in which men are but "strangers and pilgrims" (Serm. i., Epiph. n. I; Serm. vii., Lent. n. I); the way of grace, back to the lost inheritance, had been marked out, and the function of theology was merely to maintain the landmarks inherited from the past. He had no sympathy with the dialectics of many teachers. Bernard's vision was clear. With merciless logic, he followed the principles of the Christian faith as he conceived it. For all his overmastering zeal, he was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. Even when preaching the crusade, he interfered at <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainz.html" title="Mainz">Mainz</a> to stop the persecution of the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a>, stirred up by the monk <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radulf.html" title="Radulf">Radulf</a>.<a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=879&amp;letter=B&amp;search=bernard_of_clairvaux" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=879&amp;letter=B&amp;search=bernard_of_clairvaux" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> As for heretics, "the little foxes that spoil the vines should be taken, not by force of arms, but by force of argument." However, if any heretic refused to be thus taken, he considered "that he should be driven away, or even a restraint put upon his liberty, rather than that he should be allowed to spoil the vines" (Serm. lxiv). He was troubled by the mob violence that made the heretics "<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyrs.html" title="Martyrs">martyrs</a> to their unbelief." He approved the zeal of the people, but believed that "faith is to be produced by persuasion, not imposed by force;" adding that "it would without doubt be better that they should be coerced by the sword than that they should be allowed to draw away many other persons into their error." Finally, he ascribes the steadfastness of these "dogs" in facing death to the power of the devil (Serm. lxvi. on Canticles ii. 15).</p>
<p>Bernard at his best displays a nobility of nature, a wise charity and tenderness in his dealings with others, and a genuine humility, that make him one of the most complete exponents of the Christian life. His broad Christian character is witnessed to by the enduring quality of his influence. The author of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Imitation_of_Christ_04fe.html" title="The Imitation of Christ">Imitatio</a></i> drew inspiration from his writings; the reformers saw him as a medieval champion of their favourite doctrine of the supremacy of the divine grace. His works have been reprinted in countless editions. This is perhaps due to the fact that the chief fountain of his own inspiration was the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> itself. He was saturated in its language and in its spirit; and though he read it, as might be expected, uncritically, and interpreted its plain meanings allegorically—as the fashion of the day was—it saved him from the grosser aberrations of medieval Catholicism. He accepted the teaching of the church as to the reverence due to Mary and the saints, and on feast-days and festivals these receive their due respect in his sermons. But, in his letters and sermons their names are at other times seldom invoked. They were overshadowed by his idea of the grace of God and the moral splendour of Christ; "from Him do the Saints derive the odour of sanctity; from Him also do they shine as lights " (Ep. 464).</p>
<p>Bernard's popularity as a preacher cannot be judged by the sermons that survive. These were all delivered in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, to congregations more or less on his own intellectual level. Like his letters, they are full of quotations from and reference to the Bible and they have all the qualities likely to appeal to men of culture at all times.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Divine_Comedy_73d7.html" title="The Divine Comedy">The Divine Comedy</a></i>, Bernard is the last of Dante's spiritual guides and offers his prayer to the Virgin Mary to grant Dante the vision of the true nature of God, which is the climax of the story.</p>
<p>"Bernard," wrote <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus_of_Rotterdam_7a78.html" title="Erasmus of Rotterdam">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a> in his <i>Art of Preaching</i>, "is an eloquent preacher, much more by nature than by art; he is full of charm and vivacity and knows how to reach and move the affections." The same is true of the letters and to an even more striking degree. They are written on a variety of subjects, great and small, to people of the most diverse stations and types; and they help us to understand the adaptable nature of the man, which enabled him to appeal as successfully to the uneducated as to the learned.</p>

<p>In August 2006, speaking during a Sunday address at the summer papal palace in <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castel_Gandolfo_1bcd.html" title="Castel Gandolfo">Castel Gandolfo</a>, a lakeside town in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alban_Hills_e6ea.html" title="Alban Hills">Alban Hills</a> southeast of Rome, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> quoted from one of the writings of Bernard, his <i>Five Books on Consideration: Advice to a Pope</i> (<i>De Consideratione</i>), Bernard's last work, written about 1148 at the pope's request for the edification and guidance of <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenius_III_12a2.html" title="Eugenius III">Eugenius III</a>. Eugenius was one of Bernard's own monks, who had been raised to the papal throne. Bernard served as the new pope's political and spiritual counselor.</p>
<p>Benedict quoted Bernard as advising pontiffs to "watch out for the dangers of an excessive activity, whatever ... the job that you hold, because many jobs often lead to the 'hardening of the heart,' as well as 'suffering of the spirit, loss of intelligence."' "We have to guard ourselves, the saint observed, from the dangers of excessive activity, regardless of the office one holds, because too many concerns can often lead to hardness of heart," the Pope said.</p>
<p>"This warning is valid for every type of job, even those concerned with the government of the church," Benedict said. He said one should always make room for "prayer and contemplation."</p>

<li>(f) sermons--divided into <i>Sermones de tempore</i>; <i>de sanctis</i>; <i>de diversis</i>; and eighty-six sermons, in <i>Cantica Canticorum</i>, an allegorical and mystical exposition of the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_of_Solomon_43d3.html" title="Song of Solomon">Song of Solomon</a>;</li>
<li>(g) hymns. Many hymns ascribed to Bernard survive, e.g. <i>Jesu dulcis memoria</i>, <i>Jesus rex admirabilis</i>, <i>Jesu decus angelicum</i>, <i>Salve Caput cruentatum</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these the three first are included in the Roman breviary. Many have been translated and are used in Protestant churches.</p>

<p>The first time Bernard's works were published in anything like a complete edition was in 1508 at Paris, under the title <i>Seraphica melliflui devotique doctoris S. Bernardi scripta</i>, edited by André Bocard. The first really critical and complete edition is that of Dom <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Mabillon_5434.html" title="Jean Mabillon">J. Mabillon</a>, <i>Sancti Bernardi</i> opp. etc. (Paris, 1667, improved and enlarged in 1690, then again by <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%C3%A9_Massuet_c876.html" title="René Massuet">René Massuet</a> and Texier in 1719), reprinted by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Paul_Migne_565c.html" title="Jacques Paul Migne">JP Migne</a>, <i><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrologia_Latina_cdf9.html" title="Patrologia Latina">Patrolog. lat.</a></i> (Paris, 1859).</p>
<p>The modern critical edition is edited by Leclerq, Talbot and Rochais (8 vols., Rome, 1958-1975). There is an English translation of Mabillon's edition, which includes, however, only the letters and the sermons on the Song of Songs, with the biographical and other prefaces, by Samuel J. Eales (4 vols., London, 1889--1895). More recent (1970s-1990s) English translations of many of Bernard's works can be found in the <b>Cistercian Fathers</b> series, published by Cistercian Publications.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
