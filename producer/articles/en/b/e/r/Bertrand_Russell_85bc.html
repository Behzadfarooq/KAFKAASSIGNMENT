<p>Russell had two siblings: <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Russell%2C_2nd_Earl_Russell_544c.html" title="Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell">Frank</a> (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diphtheria.html" title="Diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, followed shortly by Rachel, and in January 1876 his father also died of <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronchitis.html" title="Bronchitis">bronchitis</a> following a long period of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_morality.html" title="Victorian morality">Victorian</a> grandparents, who lived at <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembroke_Lodge%2C_Richmond_Park_d181.html" title="Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park">Pembroke Lodge</a> in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond_Park_d8a9.html" title="Richmond Park">Richmond Park</a>. The 1st Earl Russell died in 1878, and his widow the Countess Russell (née Lady Frances Elliot) was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth. The countess was from a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> family, and successfully petitioned a British <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court.html" title="Court">court</a> to set aside a provision in Amberley's <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_%28law%29.html" title="Will (law)">will</a> requiring the children to be raised as agnostics.

However, the atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression and formality - Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.</p>
<p>Russell's <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a> was very lonely, and he often contemplated <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in sex, religion and mathematics, and that only the wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide. He was educated at home by a series of tutors, and he spent countless hours in his grandfather's library. His brother Frank introduced him to <a href="../../../e/u/c/Euclid.html" title="Euclid">Euclid</a>, which transformed Russell's life.</p>

He fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, who was connected to several educationists and religious activists, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, he married her in December 1894. Their <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> began to fall apart in 1902 when Russell realised he no longer loved her; they divorced nineteen years later.

<p>Russell began his published work in 1896 with <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democracy_235d.html" title="Social Democracy">Social Democracy</a></i>, a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896, he taught German social democracy at the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_School_of_Economics_2cfc.html" title="London School of Economics">London School of Economics</a>, where he also lectured on the science of power in the autumn of 1937.

<p>Russell became a fellow of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_0bd4.html" title="Royal Society">Royal Society</a> in 1908. The first of three volumes of <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Mathematica_bdd5.html" title="Principia Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a></i> (written with Whitehead) was published in 1910, which (along with the earlier <a href="http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics" class="external text" title="http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics" rel="nofollow"><i>The Principles of Mathematics</i></a>) soon made Russell world famous in his field. In 1911, he became acquainted with the Austrian engineering student <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Wittgenstein_69e0.html" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, whom he viewed as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair. The latter was often a drain on Russell's energy, but he continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic.html" title="Academic">academic</a> development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_29f9.html" title="Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a></i> in 1922.</p>

<p>In 1920, Russell travelled to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Revolution_of_1917_c160.html" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a>. During the course of his visit, he met <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenin.html" title="Lenin">Lenin</a> and had an hour-long conversation with him. (In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin rather disappointing, and that he sensed an "impish cruelty" in him.) He also cruised down the Volga on a steam-ship. Russell's lover <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dora_Black_c6ae.html" title="Dora Black">Dora Black</a> also visited Russia independently at the same time - she was enthusiastic about the revolution, but Russell's experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for it.</p>
<p>Russell subsequently lectured in <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beijing.html" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> on philosophy for one year, accompanied by Dora. While in China, Russell became gravely ill with <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_premature_obituaries.html" title="List of premature obituaries">incorrect reports</a> of his death were published in the Japanese press. When the couple visited <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> on their return journey, Dora notified journalists that "Mr Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists".</p>
<p>On the couple's return to England in 1921, Dora was five months pregnant, and Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised. Their children were <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Conrad_Russell%2C_4th_Earl_Russell_42c6.html" title="John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell">John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katharine_Russell_40d9.html" title="Katharine Russell">Katharine Jane Russell</a> (now Lady Katharine Tait). Russell supported himself during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a> to the <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layman.html" title="Layman">layman</a>. Together with Dora, he also founded the experimental <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beacon_Hill_School_%28England%29_9572.html" title="Beacon Hill School (England)">Beacon Hill School</a> in 1927. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.</p>
<p>Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell. He once said that his <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title.html" title="Title">title</a> was primarily useful for securing <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel.html" title="Hotel">hotel</a> rooms.</p>
<p>Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griffin_Barry_b96d.html" title="Griffin Barry">Griffin Barry</a>. In 1936, he took as his third wife an <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> undergraduate named Patricia ("Peter") Spence, who had been his children's <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governess.html" title="Governess">governess</a> since the summer of 1930.

He was appointed professor at the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_College_of_New_York_8e2f.html" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> in 1940, but after a public outcry, the appointment was annulled by a court judgement: his opinions (especially those relating to <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_morality.html" title="Sexual morality">sexual morality</a>, detailed in <i>Marriage and Morals</i> ten years earlier) made him "morally unfit" to teach at the college.

<p>In 1952, Russell was divorced by Peter, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Peter, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother). Russell married his fourth wife, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Finch_Russell_b741.html" title="Edith Finch Russell">Edith Finch</a>, soon after the divorce, in December <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>.

<p>Russell is generally recognised as one of the founders of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analytic_philosophy.html" title="Analytic philosophy">analytic philosophy</a>, even of its several branches. At the beginning of the 20th century, alongside <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._E._Moore_fc0d.html" title="G. E. Moore">G. E. Moore</a>, Russell was largely responsible for the British "revolt against <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealism.html" title="Idealism">Idealism</a>", a philosophy greatly influenced by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Hegel_16e4.html" title="Georg Hegel">Georg Hegel</a> and his British apostle, <a href="../../../f/2E/_/F._H._Bradley_8496.html" title="F. H. Bradley">F. H. Bradley</a>. This revolt was echoed 30 years later in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna_Circle_49ab.html" title="Vienna Circle">Vienna</a> by the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_positivism.html" title="Logical positivism">logical positivists'</a> "revolt against <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>". Russell was particularly critical of a doctrine he ascribed to <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealism.html" title="Idealism">idealism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/h/Coherentism.html" title="Coherentism">coherentism</a>, this he dubbed the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine_of_internal_relations.html" title="Doctrine of internal relations">doctrine of internal relations</a>, which, Russell suggested, held that in order to know any particular thing, we must know all of its relations. Based on this Russell attempted to show that this would make <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space.html" title="Space">space</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> and the concept of <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">number</a> not fully intelligible. Russell's logical work with <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_North_Whitehead_a6bd.html" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Whitehead</a> continued this project.</p>
<p>Russell and Moore strove to eliminate what they saw as meaningless and incoherent assertions in philosophy, and they sought clarity and precision in argument by the use of exact <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a> and by breaking down philosophical <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propositions.html" title="Propositions">propositions</a> into their simplest grammatical components. Russell, in particular, saw formal logic and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> as the principal tools of the philosopher. Indeed, unlike most philosophers who preceded him and his early contemporaries, Russell did not believe there was a separate method for philosophy. He believed that the main task of the philosopher was to illuminate the most general propositions about the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World.html" title="World">world</a> and to eliminate confusion. In particular, he wanted to end what he saw as the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_of_Ockham_3735.html" title="William of Ockham">William of Ockham</a>'s principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>, as a central part of the method of analysis.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

This work was heavily influenced by <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>. Russell soon realised that the conception it laid out would have made <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s schema of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time.html" title="Space-time">space-time</a> impossible, which he understood to be superior to his own system. Thenceforth, he rejected the entire <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kantian.html" title="Kantian">Kantian</a> program as it related to mathematics and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometry.html" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, and he maintained that his own earliest work on the subject was nearly without value.</p>
<p>Interested in the definition of <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">number</a>, Russell studied the work of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boole_832a.html" title="George Boole">George Boole</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Cantor_a504.html" title="Georg Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_De_Morgan_5fca.html" title="Augustus De Morgan">Augustus De Morgan</a>, while materials in the Bertrand Russell Archives at <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMaster_University_8276.html" title="McMaster University">McMaster University</a> include notes of his reading in <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebraic_logic.html" title="Algebraic logic">algebraic logic</a> by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_S._Peirce_5627.html" title="Charles S. Peirce">Charles S. Peirce</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Schr%C3%B6der_24c9.html" title="Ernst Schröder">Ernst Schröder</a>. He became convinced that the foundations of mathematics were to be found in logic, and following <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gottlob_Frege_683c.html" title="Gottlob Frege">Gottlob Frege</a> took an extensionalist approach in which logic was in turn based upon <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">set theory</a>. In 1900 he attended the first <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Congress_of_Philosophy_d6da.html" title="International Congress of Philosophy">International Congress of Philosophy</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> where he became familiar with the work of the Italian mathematician, <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Peano_c13c.html" title="Giuseppe Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a>. He mastered Peano's new symbolism and his set of <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axioms.html" title="Axioms">axioms</a> for <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic.html" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>. Peano defined logically all of the terms of these axioms with the exception of <i>0</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>successor</i>, and the singular term, <i>the</i>, which were the primitives of his system. Russell took it upon himself to find logical definitions for each of these. Between 1897 and 1903 he published several articles applying Peano's notation to the classical Boole-Schröder algebra of relations, among them <i>On the Notion of Order</i>, <i>Sur la logique des relations avec les applications à la théorie des séries</i>, and <i>On Cardinal Numbers</i>.</p>
<p>Russell eventually discovered that Gottlob Frege had independently arrived at equivalent definitions for <i>0</i>, <i>successor</i>, and <i>number</i>, and the definition of number is now usually referred to as the Frege-Russell definition. It was largely Russell who brought Frege to the attention of the English-speaking world. He did this in 1903, when he published <a href="http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/" class="external text" title="http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/" rel="nofollow"><i>The Principles of Mathematics</i></a>, in which the concept of class is inextricably tied to the definition of number. The appendix to this work detailed a paradox arising in Frege's application of second- and higher-order functions which took first-order functions as their arguments, and he offered his first effort to resolve what would henceforth come to be known as the Russell Paradox. Before writing <i>Principles</i>, Russell became aware of Cantor's proof that there was no greatest <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinal_number.html" title="Cardinal number">cardinal number</a>, which Russell believed was mistaken. The Cantor Paradox in turn was shown (for example by Crossley) to be a special case of the Russell Paradox. This caused Russell to analyze <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_%28set_theory%29.html" title="Class (set theory)">classes</a>, for it was known that given any number of elements, the number of classes they result in is greater than their number. In turn, this led to the discovery of a very interesting class, namely, the class of all classes, which consists of two kinds of classes: classes that are members of themselves, and classes that are not members of themselves, which led him to find that the so-called principle of comprehension, taken for granted by logicians of the time, was fatally flawed, and that it resulted in a contradiction, whereby Y is a member of Y, if and only if, Y is not a member of Y. This has become known as <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell%27s_paradox.html" title="Russell's paradox">Russell's paradox</a>, the solution to which he outlined in an appendix to <i>Principles</i>, and which he later developed into a complete theory, the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_types.html" title="Theory of types">Theory of types</a>. Aside from exposing a major inconsistency in <a href="../../../n/a/i/Naive_set_theory.html" title="Naive set theory">naive set theory</a>, Russell's work led directly to the creation of modern <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set_theory.html" title="Set theory">axiomatic set theory</a>. It also crippled Frege's project of reducing arithmetic to logic. The Theory of Types and much of Russell's subsequent work have also found practical applications with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_science.html" title="Computer science">computer science</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_technology.html" title="Information technology">information technology</a>.</p>
<p>Russell continued to defend <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logicism.html" title="Logicism">logicism</a>, the view that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic, and along with his former teacher, <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_North_Whitehead_a6bd.html" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, wrote the monumental <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Principia_Mathematica_bdd5.html" title="Principia Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a></i>, an <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiomatic_system.html" title="Axiomatic system">axiomatic system</a> on which all of mathematics can be built. The first volume of the <i>Principia</i> was published in 1910, and is largely ascribed to Russell. More than any other single work, it established the specialty of mathematical or symbolic logic. Two more volumes were published, but their original plan to incorporate geometry in a fourth volume was never realised, and Russell never felt up to improving the original works, though he referenced new developments and problems in his preface to the second edition. Upon completing the <i>Principia</i>, three volumes of extraordinarily <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstraction.html" title="Abstraction">abstract</a> and complex reasoning, Russell was exhausted, and he never felt his intellectual faculties fully recovered from the effort. Although the <i>Principia</i> did not fall prey to the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradox.html" title="Paradox">paradoxes</a> in Frege's approach, it was later proven by <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_20cb.html" title="Kurt Gödel">Kurt Gödel</a> that neither <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, nor any other consistent system of primitive recursive arithmetic, could, within that system, determine that every proposition that could be formulated within that system was decidable, i.e. could decide whether that proposition or its negation was provable within the system (<a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/d/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem.html" title="Gödel's incompleteness theorem">Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a>).</p>
<p>Russell's last significant work in mathematics and logic, <i>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</i>, was written by hand while he was in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">jail</a> for his <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-war.html" title="Anti-war">anti-war</a> activities during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. This was largely an explication of his previous work and its philosophical significance.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Edit section: Philosophy of language">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophy of language</span></h3>
<p>Russell was not the first philosopher to suggest that language had an important bearing on how we understand the world; however, more than anyone before him, Russell made language, or more specifically, <i>how we use language</i>, a central part of philosophy. Had there been no Russell, it seems unlikely that philosophers such as <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Wittgenstein_69e0.html" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_Ryle_4776.html" title="Gilbert Ryle">Gilbert Ryle</a>, <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._L._Austin_0da5.html" title="J. L. Austin">J. L. Austin</a>, and <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._F._Strawson_b0e9.html" title="P. F. Strawson">P. F. Strawson</a>, among others, would have embarked upon the same course, for so much of what they did was to amplify or respond, sometimes critically, to what Russell had said before them, using many of the techniques that he originally developed. Russell, along with Moore, shared the idea that clarity of expression is a virtue, a notion that has been a touchstone for philosophers ever since, particularly among those who deal with the philosophy of language.</p>
<p>Perhaps Russell's most significant contribution to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_language.html" title="Philosophy of language">philosophy of language</a> is his <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_descriptions.html" title="Theory of descriptions">theory of descriptions</a>, as presented in his seminal essay, <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Denoting_0983.html" title="On Denoting">On Denoting</a></i>, first published in 1905 in the <i><a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_%28journal%29.html" title="Mind (journal)">Mind</a></i> philosophical journal, which the mathematician and philosopher <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_P._Ramsey_0858.html" title="Frank P. Ramsey">Frank P. Ramsey</a> described as "a paradigm of philosophy." The theory is normally illustrated using the phrase "the present King of France", as in "The present <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_king.html" title="Germanic king">king</a> of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> is bald." What object is this <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposition.html" title="Proposition">proposition</a> <i>about</i>, given that there is not, at present, a king of France? (Roughly the same problem would arise if there were two kings of France at present: which of them does "<i>the</i> king of France" denote?) <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexius_Meinong_d33c.html" title="Alexius Meinong">Alexius Meinong</a> had suggested that we must posit a realm of "nonexistent entities" that we can suppose we are referring to when we use expressions such as this; but this would be a strange <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory.html" title="Theory">theory</a>, to say the least. <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gottlob_Frege_683c.html" title="Gottlob Frege">Frege</a>, employing his distinction between sense and reference, suggested that such sentences, although meaningful, were neither true nor false. But <i>some</i> such propositions, such as "<i>If</i> the present king of France is bald, <i>then</i> the present king of France has no hair on his head," seem not only truth-valuable but indeed obviously true.</p>
<p>The problem is general to what are called "<a href="../../../d/e/f/Definite_description.html" title="Definite description">definite descriptions</a>." Normally this includes all terms beginning with "the", and sometimes includes names, like "Walter Scott." (This point is quite contentious: Russell sometimes thought that the latter terms shouldn't be called names at all, but only "disguised definite descriptions," but much subsequent work has treated them as altogether different things.) What is the "logical form" of definite descriptions: how, in Frege's terms, could we paraphrase them in order to show how the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> of the whole depends on the truths of the parts? Definite descriptions appear to be like names that by their very nature denote exactly one thing, neither more or less. What, then, are we to say about the proposition as a whole if one of its parts apparently isn't functioning correctly?</p>
<p>Russell's <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solution.html" title="Solution">solution</a> was, first of all, to analyze not the term alone but the entire proposition that contained a definite description. "The present king of France is bald," he then suggested, can be reworded to "There is an x such that x is a present king of France, nothing other than x is a present king of France, and x is bald." Russell claimed that each definite description in fact contains a claim of <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existence.html" title="Existence">existence</a> and a claim of uniqueness which give this appearance, but these can be broken apart and treated separately from the predication that is the obvious content of the proposition. The proposition as a whole then says three things about some object: the definite description contains two of them, and the rest of the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentence_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Sentence (linguistics)">sentence</a> contains the other. If the object does not exist, or if it is not unique, then the whole sentence turns out to be <a href="../../../f/a/l/False.html" title="False">false</a>, not meaningless.</p>
<p>One of the major complaints against Russell's theory, due originally to Strawson, is that definite descriptions do not claim that their object exists, they merely presuppose that it does. Strawson also claims that a denoting phrase that does not, in fact, denote anything could be supposed to follow the role of a "Widgy's inverted truth-value" and expresses the opposite meaning of the intended phrase. This can be shown using the example of "The present king of France is bald". Taken with the inverted truth-value methodology the meaning of this sentence becomes "It is true that there is no present king of France who is bald" which changes the denotation of 'the present king of France' from a primary denotation to a secondary one.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/t/Wittgenstein.html" title="Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</a>, Russell's student, achieved considerable prominence in the philosophy of language after the posthumous publication of the <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_Investigations_b717.html" title="Philosophical Investigations">Philosophical Investigations</a></i>. In Russell's opinion, Wittgenstein's later work was misguided, and he decried its influence and that of its followers (especially members of the so-called "Oxford school" of <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinary_language_philosophy.html" title="Ordinary language philosophy">ordinary language philosophy</a>, who he believed were promoting a kind of <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a>). Russell's belief that philosophy's task is not limited to examining ordinary language is once again widely accepted in philosophy.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Edit section: Logical atomism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Logical atomism</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps Russell's most systematic, metaphysical treatment of philosophical analysis and his empiricist-centric logicism is evident in what he called <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_atomism.html" title="Logical atomism">Logical atomism</a>, which is explicated in a set of <a href="../../../l/e/c/Lectures.html" title="Lectures">lectures</a>, "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism," which he gave in 1918. In these lectures, Russell sets forth his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept.html" title="Concept">concept</a> of an <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideal.html" title="Ideal">ideal</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isomorphic.html" title="Isomorphic">isomorphic</a> language, one that would mirror the world, whereby our knowledge can be reduced to terms of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atomic" class="extiw" title="wikt:atomic">atomic</a> propositions and their <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth-function.html" title="Truth-function">truth-functional</a> compounds. Logical atomism is a form of radical empiricism, for Russell believed the most important requirement for such an ideal language is that every meaningful proposition must consist of terms referring directly to the objects with which we are acquainted, or that they are defined by other terms referring to objects with which we are acquainted. Russell excluded certain formal, logical terms such as <i>all</i>, <i>the</i>, <i>is</i>, and so forth, from his isomorphic requirement, but he was never entirely satisfied about our understanding of such terms. One of the central themes of Russell's atomism is that the world consists of logically independent facts, a plurality of facts, and that our knowledge depends on the data of our direct experience of them. In his later life, Russell came to doubt aspects of logical atomism, especially his principle of isomorphism, though he continued to believe that the process of philosophy ought to consist of breaking things down into their simplest components, even though we might not ever fully arrive at an ultimate <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atomic" class="extiw" title="wikt:atomic">atomic</a> <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">fact</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Edit section: Epistemology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Epistemology</span></h3>
<p>Russell's <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemology.html" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a> went through many phases. Once he shed <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Hegelianism_bac1.html" title="Neo-Hegelianism">neo-Hegelianism</a> in his early years, Russell remained a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical_realism.html" title="Philosophical realism">philosophical realist</a> for the remainder of his life, believing that our direct experiences have primacy in the acquisition of knowledge. While some of his views have lost favour, his influence remains strong in the distinction between two ways in which we can be familiar with objects: "<a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge_by_acquaintance.html" title="Knowledge by acquaintance">knowledge by acquaintance</a>" and "<a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge_by_description.html" title="Knowledge by description">knowledge by description</a>". For a time, Russell thought that we could only be acquainted with our own <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sense_data.html" title="Sense data">sense data</a>—momentary <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perception.html" title="Perception">perceptions</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colours.html" title="Colours">colours</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sounds.html" title="Sounds">sounds</a>, and the like—and that everything else, including the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature.html" title="Nature">physical</a> objects that these were sense data <i>of</i>, could only be inferred, or reasoned to—i.e. known by description—and not known directly. This distinction has gained much wider application, though Russell eventually rejected the idea of an intermediate sense datum.</p>
<p>In his later philosophy, Russell subscribed to a kind of <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_monism.html" title="Neutral monism">neutral monism</a>, maintaining that the distinctions between the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matter.html" title="Matter">material</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind.html" title="Mind">mental</a> worlds, in the final analysis, were arbitrary, and that both can be reduced to a neutral property—a view similar to one held by the American philosopher/psychologist, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_James_2cca.html" title="William James">William James</a>, and one that was first formulated by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baruch_Spinoza_f87e.html" title="Baruch Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>, whom Russell greatly admired. Instead of James' "pure experience", however, Russell characterised the stuff of our initial states of perception as "events", a stance which is curiously akin to his old teacher <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_North_Whitehead_a6bd.html" title="Alfred North Whitehead">Whitehead's</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process_philosophy.html" title="Process philosophy">process philosophy</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Edit section: Philosophy of science">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophy of science</span></h3>
<p>Russell frequently claimed that he was more convinced of his <i>method</i> of doing philosophy, the method of analysis, than of his philosophical conclusions. Science, of course, was one of the principal components of analysis, along with logic and mathematics. While Russell was a believer in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>, knowledge derived from <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical_research.html" title="Empirical research">empirical research</a> that is verified through repeated testing, he believed that science reaches only tentative answers, and that scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. Indeed, he believed the same was true of philosophy. Another founder of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_age.html" title="Modern age">modern</a> philosophy of science, <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernst_Mach_9043.html" title="Ernst Mach">Ernst Mach</a>, placed less reliance on method, per se, for he believed that any method that produced predictable results was satisfactory and that the principal role of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientist.html" title="Scientist">scientist</a> was to make successful <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predictions.html" title="Predictions">predictions</a>. While Russell would doubtless agree with this as a practical matter, he believed that the ultimate objective of <i>both</i> science and philosophy was to <i>understand</i> <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality.html" title="Reality">reality</a>, not simply to make predictions.</p>
<p>The fact that Russell made science a central part of his method and of philosophy was instrumental in making the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_science.html" title="Philosophy of science">philosophy of science</a> a full-blooded, separate branch of philosophy and an area in which subsequent philosophers specialised. Much of Russell's thinking about science is expressed in his 1914 book, <i>Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy</i>. Among the several schools that were influenced by Russell were the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_positivists.html" title="Logical positivists">logical positivists</a>, particularly <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_Carnap_5018.html" title="Rudolph Carnap">Rudolph Carnap</a>, who maintained that the distinguishing feature of scientific propositions was their verifiability. This contrasted with the theory of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>, also greatly influenced by Russell, who believed that their importance rested in the fact that they were <i>potentially</i> falsifiable.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that outside of his strictly philosophical pursuits, Russell was always fascinated by science, particularly <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a>, and he even authored several popular science books, <i>The ABC of Atoms</i> (1923) and <i>The ABC of Relativity</i> (1925).</p>
<p>Some of Russell's more controversial writings on the impact of science on society (and of an active role that science should play in controlling the population) are often quoted; such as the following:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>"I think, the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology....Its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda. Of these the most influential is what is called 'education.' Religion plays a part, though a diminishing one; the press, the cinema, and the radio play an increasing part.... It may be hoped that in time anybody will be able to persuade anybody of anything if he can catch the patient young and is provided by the State with money and equipment. The subject will make great strides when it is taken up by scientists under a scientific dictatorship.... The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be arrived at. First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark gray. Although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Edit section: Ethics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ethics</span></h3>
<p>While Russell wrote a great deal on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethical</a> subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to philosophy or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by <a href="../../../g/2E/e/G.E._Moore_6dac.html" title="G.E. Moore">G.E. Moore</a>'s <i><a href="http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/" class="external text" title="http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/" rel="nofollow">Principia Ethica</a></i>. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">objective</a>, but known only through <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuition_%28knowledge%29.html" title="Intuition (knowledge)">intuition</a>; that they were simple properties of objects, not <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equivalent.html" title="Equivalent">equivalent</a> (e.g., pleasure is good) to the natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalistic_fallacy.html" title="Naturalistic fallacy">Naturalistic fallacy</a>); and that these simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analyzed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to agree with his philosophical hero, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hume_69a6.html" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>, who believed that ethical terms dealt with <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subjectivity.html" title="Subjectivity">subjective</a> <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_%28personal_and_cultural%29.html" title="Value (personal and cultural)">values</a> that cannot be verified in the same way as matters of fact.</p>
<p>Coupled with Russell's other doctrines, this influenced the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_positivists.html" title="Logical positivists">logical positivists</a>, who formulated the theory of <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotivism.html" title="Emotivism">emotivism</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitivism_%28ethics%29.html" title="Cognitivism (ethics)">cognitivism</a>, which states that ethical propositions (along with those of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysics.html" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>) were essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitude_%28psychology%29.html" title="Attitude (psychology)">attitudes</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preferences.html" title="Preferences">preferences</a>. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not construe ethical propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that ethical considerations are not only meaningful, but that they are a vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patron_saint.html" title="Patron saint">patron saint</a> of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to ethical considerations.</p>

<p>Russell's ethical outlook and his personal courage in facing controversies were certainly informed by his religious upbringing, principally by his paternal grandmother who instructed him with the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical.html" title="Biblical">Biblical</a> injunction, "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil" (<a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> 23:2), something he says influenced him throughout his life.</p>
<p>For most of his adult life, however, Russell thought it very unlikely that there was a <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>, and he maintained that <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> is little more than <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstition.html" title="Superstition">superstition</a> and, despite any positive effects that religion might have, it is largely harmful to people. He believed religion and the religious outlook (he considered <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a> and other systematic <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideologies</a> to be species of religion) serve to impede knowledge, foster fear and dependency, and are responsible for much of the war, oppression, and misery that have beset the world.</p>
<p>In his 1949 speech, "Am I an Atheist or an Agnostic?", Russell expressed his difficulty over whether to call himself an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a> or an <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think that I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because, when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.</p>

<p>About two years later, I became convinced that there is no life after death, but I still believed in God, because the "First Cause" argument appeared to be irrefutable.

<p>As a young man, Russell had a decidedly religious bent, himself, as is evident in his early <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonism.html" title="Platonism">Platonism</a>. He longed for <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternal.html" title="Eternal">eternal</a> truths, as he makes clear in his famous essay, "A Free Man's Worship", widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came to dislike. While he rejected the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a>, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.</p>
<p>Russell's views on religion can be found in his popular book, <i><a href="../../../w/h/y/Why_I_Am_Not_a_Christian_3c8b.html" title="Why I Am Not a Christian">Why I Am Not a Christian</a> and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-671-20323-1</a>).

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Edit section: Influence on philosophy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence on philosophy</span></h2>
<p>Russell had a major influence on modern philosophy, especially in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>-speaking world. While others were also influential, notably Frege, Moore, and Wittgenstein, Russell made analysis the dominant methodology of professional philosophy. The various analytic movements throughout the last century all owe something to Russell's earlier works.</p>
<p>Russell's influence on individual philosophers is singular, perhaps most notably in the case of <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Wittgenstein_69e0.html" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, who was his student between 1911 and 1914. It should also be observed that Wittgenstein exerted considerable influence on Russell, especially in leading him to conclude, much to his regret, that mathematical truths were purely tautological truths. Evidence of Russell's influence on Wittgenstein can be seen throughout the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_29f9.html" title="Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus</a>, which Russell was instrumental in having published. Russell also helped to secure Wittgenstein's <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctorate.html" title="Doctorate">doctorate</a> and a faculty position at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge.html" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, along with several fellowships along the way. However, as previously stated, he came to disagree with Wittgenstein's later linguistic and analytic approach to philosophy, while Wittgenstein came to think of Russell as "superficial and glib," particularly in his popular writings. Russell's influence is also evident in the work of <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._J._Ayer_cddc.html" title="A. J. Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolph_Carnap_5018.html" title="Rudolph Carnap">Rudolph Carnap</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_20cb.html" title="Kurt Gödel">Kurt Gödel</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>, <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._V._Quine_18db.html" title="W. V. Quine">W. V. Quine</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_R._Searle_c965.html" title="John R. Searle">John R. Searle</a>, and a number of other philosophers and logicians.</p>
<p>Some see Russell's influence as mostly negative, primarily those who have been critical of Russell's emphasis on science and logic, the consequent diminishment of metaphysics, and of his insistence that ethics lies outside of philosophy. Russell's admirers and detractors are often more acquainted with his pronouncements on social and political matters, or what some (e.g., biographer <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Monk_ebfb.html" title="Ray Monk">Ray Monk</a>) have called his "<a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a>," than they are with his technical, philosophical work. There is a marked tendency to conflate these matters, and to judge Russell the philosopher on what he himself would certainly consider to be his non-philosophical opinions. Russell often cautioned people to make this distinction.</p>
<p>Russell left a large assortment of writing. From his adolescent years, Russell wrote about 3,000 words a day, in long hand, with relatively few corrections; his first draft nearly always was his last draft, even on the most complex, technical matters. His previously unpublished work is an immense treasure trove, and scholars are continuing to gain new insights into Russell's thought.</p>

<p>Political and social <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activism.html" title="Activism">activism</a> occupied much of Russell's time for most of his long life, which makes his prodigious and seminal writing on a wide range of technical and non-technical subjects all the more remarkable.</p>
<p>Russell remained politically active to the end, writing and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes. Some maintain that during his last few years he gave his youthful followers too much license and that they used his name for some outlandish purposes that a more attentive Russell would not have approved. There is evidence to show that he became aware of this when he fired his private secretary, <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Schoenman_5993.html" title="Ralph Schoenman">Ralph Schoenman</a>, then a young firebrand of the radical left.</p>

<p>Russell was never a complete <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a>; in his 1915 article on "<a href="http://fair-use.org/international-journal-of-ethics/1915/01/the-ethics-of-war" class="external text" title="http://fair-use.org/international-journal-of-ethics/1915/01/the-ethics-of-war" rel="nofollow">The Ethics of War</a>", he defended wars of colonization on utilitarian grounds when the side with the more advanced civilization could put the land to better use. However, Russell opposed nearly all wars between modern nations. His activism against British participation in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> led to fines and the loss of his fellowship at <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge_7df5.html" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. He was sentenced to prison for counselling young men on how to avoid conscription. He was released after six months, with the curious stipulation that he must not go within one mile of England's shoreline. In 1943 Russell called his stance "relative political pacifism"—he held that war was always a great <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a>, but in some particularly extreme circumstances (such as when <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> threatened to take over Europe) it might be a lesser of multiple evils. In the years leading to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, he supported the policy of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeasement.html" title="Appeasement">appeasement</a>; but by 1940 he acknowledged that in order to preserve democracy, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> had to be defeated. This same reluctant value compromise was shared with his acquaintance <a href="../../../a/2E/a/A.A._Milne_5e21.html" title="A.A. Milne">A.A. Milne</a>.</p>
<p>Russell was opposed to the use and possession of nuclear weapons for most of their existence, but he may not have always been of that opinion. On November 20, 1948, <a href="http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582" class="external text" title="http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582" rel="nofollow">in a public speech</a> at <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_School_ce9b.html" title="Westminster School">Westminster School</a>, addressing a gathering arranged by the New Commonwealth, Russell shocked some observers with comments that seemed to suggest a <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_strike.html" title="First strike">preemptive nuclear strike</a> on the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> might be justified. Russell apparently argued that the threat of war between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> would enable the United States to force the Soviet Union to accept the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baruch_Plan_5b45.html" title="Baruch Plan">Baruch Plan</a> for international atomic energy control. (Earlier in the year he had written in the same vein to <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_W._Marseille_44a5.html" title="Walter W. Marseille">Walter W. Marseille</a>.) Russell felt this plan "had very great merits and showed considerable generosity, when it is remembered that America still had an unbroken nuclear monopoly." (<i>Has Man a Future?</i>, 1961). However Nicholas Griffin of McMaster University, in his book <i>The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell: The Public Years, 1914-1970</i>, has claimed (after obtaining a transcript of the speech) that Russell's wording implies he didn't advocate the actual use of the atom bomb, but merely its diplomatic use as a massive source of leverage over the actions of the Soviets. Griffin's interpretation was disputed by <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Lawson_c817.html" title="Nigel Lawson">Nigel Lawson</a>, the former British Chancellor, who was present at the speech and who claims it was quite clear to the audience that Russell was advocating an actual First Strike. Whichever interpretation is correct, Russell later relented, instead arguing for mutual disarmament by the nuclear powers, possibly linked to some form of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_government.html" title="World government">world government</a>.</p>
<p>In 1955 Russell released the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell-Einstein_Manifesto_c1d7.html" title="Russell-Einstein Manifesto">Russell-Einstein Manifesto</a>, co-signed by <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and nine other leading scientists and intellectuals, a document which led to the first of the <a href="../../../p/u/g/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs_156a.html" title="Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs">Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs</a> in 1957. In 1958, Russell became the first president of the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament_1b48.html" title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a>. He resigned two years later when the CND would not support <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_disobedience.html" title="Civil disobedience">civil disobedience</a>, and formed the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_of_100.html" title="Committee of 100">Committee of 100</a>. In 1961, when he was in his late eighties, he was imprisoned for a week for inciting civil disobedience, in connection with protests at the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Defence_%28United_Kingdom%29_f84c.html" title="Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)">Ministry of Defence</a> and <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_Park%2C_London_cc60.html" title="Hyde Park, London">Hyde Park</a>.</p>
<p>Increasingly concerned about the potential danger to humanity arising from nuclear weapons and other scientific discoveries, he also joined with Einstein, Oppenheimer, Rotblat and other eminent scientists of the day to establish the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Academy_of_Art_and_Science_0c47.html" title="World Academy of Art and Science">World Academy of Art and Science</a> which was formally constituted in 1960.</p>
<p>Russell made a cameo appearance playing himself in the anti-war <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollywood.html" title="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film "Aman" which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_Peace_Foundation_9ee3.html" title="Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation">Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation</a> began work in 1963, in order to carry forward Russell's work for peace, human rights and social justice.

By the autumn of 1966 he had completed the manuscript of "War Crimes in Vietnam". Then, using the American justifications for the Nuremburg Trials, Russell, along with <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Paul_Sartre_c20d.html" title="Jean-Paul Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, organised what he called an international War Crimes Tribunal, a.k.a the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Tribunal_016b.html" title="Russell Tribunal">Russell Tribunal</a>.</p>

<p>Russell wrote against <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_morality.html" title="Victorian morality">Victorian</a> notions of morality. <i>Marriage and Morals</i> (1929) expressed his opinion that sex between a man and woman who are not married to each other is not necessarily immoral if they truly love one another, and advocated "trial marriages" or "companionate marriage", formalised relationships whereby young people could legitimately have sexual intercourse without being expected to remain married in the long term or to have children (an idea first proposed by Judge <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Lindsey_742f.html" title="Ben Lindsey">Ben Lindsey</a>). This might not seem extreme by today's standards, but it was enough to raise vigorous protests and denunciations against him during his visit to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> shortly after the book's publication. Russell was also ahead of his time in advocating open <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_education.html" title="Sex education">sex education</a> and widespread access to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a>. He also advocated easy <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a>, but only if the marriage had produced no children - Russell's view was that parents should remain married but tolerant of each other's sexual infidelity, if they had children. This reflected his life at the time - his second wife Dora was openly having an affair, and would soon become pregnant by another man, but Russell was keen for their children John and Kate to have a "normal" family life.</p>
<p>Russell's private life was even more unconventional and freewheeling than his published writings revealed, but that was not well known at the time. For example, philosopher <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Hook_7b58.html" title="Sidney Hook">Sidney Hook</a> reports that Russell often spoke of his <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual.html" title="Sexual">sexual</a> prowess and of his various conquests.</p>

<p>Some critics of Russell have pointed out racist passages in his early writings, as well as his initial praise for scientific <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a>. On November 16, 1922, for instance, he gave a lecture to the General Meeting of Dr. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Stopes_3204.html" title="Marie Stopes">Marie Stopes</a>'s Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress on "Birth Control and International Relations," in which he described the difficulties keeping the "coloured races" in their home countries and pointing out that at some point the pressure would become too great and immigration barriers would fall. His remarks anticipated the population control movement of the 1960s and the role of the United Nations.</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>This policy may last some time, but in the end under it we shall have to give way--we are only putting off the evil day; the one real remedy is birth control, that is getting the people of the world to limit themselves to those numbers which they can keep upon their own soil... I do not see how we can hope permanently to be strong enough to keep the coloured races out; sooner or later they are bound to overflow, so the best we can do is to hope that those nations will see the wisdom of Birth Control.... We need a strong international authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">"Lecture by the Hon. Bertrand Russell", <i>Birth Control News, vol 1, no. 8 (December 1922), p.2</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another example, in early editions of his book <i>Marriage and Morals</i> (1929) he asserted:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>In extreme cases there can be little doubt of the superiority of one race to another.... It seems on the whole fair to regard negroes as on the average inferior to white men, although for work in the tropics they are indispensable, so that their extermination (apart from questions of humanity) would be highly undesirable.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">Bertrand Russell, <i>Marriage and Morals (1929)</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russell did, however, criticize eugenic programs for their vulnerability to corruption, and, in 1932, he condemned the "unwarranted assumption" that "Negroes are congenitally inferior to white men" (<i>Education and the Social Order</i>, Chap. 3). It may be possible to reconcile these two points of view, separated by only three years, by pointing out that in the former, Russell was speaking about the current state of the world -- in which racism and poverty had acted to remove the means for education and advancement among the 'non-white' inhabitants of the British Empire -- while, in the latter, he was speaking about congenital, genetic differences. He did not think that 'blacks' were <i>necessarily</i> inferior to 'whites', only that they had not had nearly the same opportunities and thus, through no fault of their own, were generally unable to compete.</p>
<p>Racism rapidly declined, at least in terms of public acceptance, throughout the second half of the 20th century. In fact, Russell seems to have been one of the leaders of change in this sphere. He wrote a chapter on "Racial Antagonism" in <i>New Hopes for a Changing World</i> (1951), which clarifies his views in this sphere a great deal:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>It is sometimes maintained that racial mixture is biologically undesirable. There is no evidence whatever for this view. Nor is there, apparently, any reason to think that Negroes are congenitally less intelligent than white people, but as to that it will be difficult to judge until they have equal scope and equally good social conditions.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Edit section: Technology and overpopulation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technology and overpopulation</span></h3>
<p>While the popular, public Russell was associated with a "pity and love of humanity", many of his more esoteric writings paradoxically suggest a Malthusian perspective on the threat of overpopulation. Some of his more controversal writings were on the nature and solutions to this perceived problem:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>"At present the population of the world is increasing at about 58,000 per diem. War, so far, has had no very great effect on this increase, which continued throughout each of the world wars.... War ... has hitherto been disappointing in this respect ... but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective. If a Black Death could spread throughout the world once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.... The state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant, but what of it?"</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite style="font-style:normal;">Bertrand Russell, <i>The Impact of Science on Society (Routledge Press: New York, 1951)</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russell and H.G. Wells had a mutual admiration. Like Wells, Russell often warned about the dangers of technological advancements. While one school of thought sees technology as the solution to diminishing limited resources, Russell offered the opposite perspective:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>"Science can abolish poverty and excessive hours of labor. In the earliest human communities, before agriculture, subsistence was precarious, and death from starvation must have been frequent. At that stage, man had the same mixture of misery and carefree enjoyment as still makes up the lives of other animals. Agriculture was a technical advance. The way it was used should be an awful warning to our age. It introduced slavery and serfdom, human sacrifice, absolute monarchy and large wars. Both industry and agriculture, to a continually increasing degree, are carried on in ways that waste the world's capital of material resources. The indisputable fact is that industry and agriculture, insofar as it is used to make artificial fertilizers, depend upon irreplaceable materials and sources of energy. If bad times come, it must be inferred that industrialization characteristic of the last 150 years will be rudely checked..."</p>

<p>Note: This is a mere sampling, for Russell also authored many pamphlets, introductions, articles and letters to the editor. His works also can be found in any number of anthologies and collections, perhaps most notably, <i>The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell</i>, which <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMaster_University_8276.html" title="McMaster University">McMaster University</a> began publishing in 1983. This collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works is now up to 16 volumes, and many more are forthcoming. An additional 3 volumes catalogue just his bibliography. The Russell Archives at <a href="../../../m/c/m/McMaster_University_8276.html" title="McMaster University">McMaster</a> also have more than 30,000 letters that he wrote.</p>
