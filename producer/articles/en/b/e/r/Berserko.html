<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserko.html" title="Edit section: Character Profile">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character Profile</span></h2>
<p>Berserko is an absolute dim-wit, a very stupid man (possibly the reason why he gets arrested many times) who is also <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Boss_and_Scratch_a1aa.html" title="Big Boss and Scratch">Big Boss</a>’ <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nephew.html" title="Nephew">nephew</a>, which is the real reason why Big Boss never bothered to get rid of him - He's family! According to the comic adaptation, Berserko is the son of Big Boss' deceased brother who years ago was sent to prison by Bulletproof, where he died. However, that does not make him less dangerous. Berserko is a <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_subculture.html" title="Punk subculture">punk</a> with short, spiky, blond hair, a blue jacket, white pants with suspenders, a crazy-looking grin, and two huge guns he fires in a trigger-happy manner at any target at will. In the cartoon, his shirt is <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_%28colour%29.html" title="Orange (colour)">orange</a> and wordless; in the comics and toys, his shirt is <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow.html" title="Yellow">yellow</a> and bears the inscription “BAAD IS GOOD!” in red text. Berserko is a very dangerous crook who talks in a high, squeaky voice and laughs at his own jokes - even if the jokes are not funny - and unleashes violent behavior, causing trouble just for fun. He must be approached with extreme caution.</p>

<p>Berserko’s buffoonery usually brings no comfort to Big Boss, but in this episode, Berserko was able to steal a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headband.html" title="Headband">headband</a> type of a device from the 1990's that, when put on his head, made Berserko much more intelligent, making <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._BadVibes_and_Buzzbomb_86f4.html" title="Dr. BadVibes and Buzzbomb">Dr. BadVibes</a> very jealous of him. He makes a deal with Big Boss saying that if he captures the C.O.P.S. team, then Big Boss will make him his partner. With that, Berserko lures <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardtop_%28C.O.P.S.%29_0ed5.html" title="Hardtop (C.O.P.S.)">Hardtop</a> into his hideout with the help of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mace_and_Nightshade_3caf.html" title="Mace and Nightshade">Nightshade</a>, who disguised herself as Whitney Morgan and posing as her being in distress and held captive at an amusement park. Hardtop raced to the park hoping to save Whitney only to be lured into one of Berserko's traps and get captured by "Teddy", Berserko's robotic <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_bear.html" title="Teddy bear">teddy bear</a> and be forced to watch Berserko's "educational" programs. Berserko plans to use him as a pawn to lure Bulletproof and Longarm, who are investigating the looting of the city's public <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a>, into a trap. Berserko stole the books and hordes them in his hideout for him to read and cram everything he reads into his brain. As they investigate the library robbery, suddenly LongArm and Bulletproof had to dodge out of the way of an oncoming clown <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a> that blasted inside the precinct and shows to the 2 C.O.P.S. a photo of Berserko and a film projector reel depicting Hardtop in Teddy's clutches. Bulletproof and LongArm raced to rescue Hardtop at Berserko's hideout which is an old abandoned <a href="../../../a/m/u/Amusement_park.html" title="Amusement park">amusement park</a>, where he had a bunch of clownish cronies by his side and a huge robotic teddy bear, which he uses for added <a href="../../../s/e/c/Security.html" title="Security">security</a>, to help him carry out his crooked schemes. Like Hardtop, they too fall into Berserko's traps and find themselves inside Berserko's hideout. But just as Berserko has Bulletproof and LongArm in his clutches, envious Badvibes arrives to confront him and pulls the machine off Berserko's head. Thus, bringing him back into his old moronic self again. Bulletproof frees Hardtop by using his cybernetic disks to short circuit Teddy and release Hardtop from his clutches. BadVibes tries to escape but LongArm uses his powercuffs to force him off the Crooks <i>Jailbird</i> air vehicle and fall right on top of Berserko's desk. The C.O.P.S. then quickly arrest the two and threw them both into the slammer.</p>

<p>In this episode, Berserko was sent by <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squeeky_Kleen_1737.html" title="Squeeky Kleen">Squeeky Kleen</a> to steal some items for Big Boss' surprise <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthday.html" title="Birthday">birthday</a> party including some party favors, food, and a birthday cake. He is able to do this while escaping from the C.O.P.S. team which are following behind in hot pursuit. Afterwards, Berserko learns of a brand new <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridge.html" title="Bridge">bridge</a> being dedicated today. Known as The <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornucopia.html" title="Cornucopia">Cornucopia</a> Bridge, which is located right next to Berserko's amusement park hideout, Mayor Davis performed the ceremony, then snips the ribbon in half, dedicating the bridge and opening it to the public. Berserko decides to steal the bridge and give it to his uncle as a birthday gift even though Big Boss, after he heard about what Berserko is giving him for his birthday, is none too pleased about it. Big Boss shouts out telepathically, "BERSERKO, YOU BUMBLING BUFFOON!!!!" But his idiotic nephew assumes he's much happy with this "gift" Berserko is giving him and proceeds to use the world's largest <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balloon.html" title="Balloon">balloon</a> to haul the bridge up to Big Boss. However, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Mirage_%28C.O.P.S.%29_8044.html" title="Mirage (C.O.P.S.)">Mirage</a>, disguised as a spy for Big Boss, after Berserko won her trust and allowed her to help with the operations, switched the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Explosives.html" title="Explosives">explosives</a> Berserko is using to loose up the bridge with <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firecrackers.html" title="Firecrackers">firecrackers</a> and set it off, causing chaos and scattering the crooks everywhere. Then, Mirage reveals her true self and tries to arrest Berserko. But a light spark from one of the firecrackers covered Berserko's escape. He dived into the water and swam away. He then ran all the way back to Big Boss' <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penthouse_apartment.html" title="Penthouse apartment">penthouse</a>, where Big Boss ungratefully throws the birthday cake at him for his latest buffoonery.</p>

<p>In this episode, Berserko accidentally injected himself with Addictem's Crystal Twyst and is seen dying from the deadly <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_overdose.html" title="Drug overdose">drug overdose</a>, Big Boss had no choice but to beg the C.O.P.S. team to help save his nephew, which they did.
