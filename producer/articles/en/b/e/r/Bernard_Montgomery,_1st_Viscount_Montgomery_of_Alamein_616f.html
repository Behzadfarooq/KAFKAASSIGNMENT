<p>Montgomery was born in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennington.html" title="Kennington">Kennington</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> in 1887, the fourth child of nine, to an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_8ba2.html" title="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicanism.html" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>, Revd. Henry Montgomery. The Montgomery family came from <a href="../../../m/o/v/Moville.html" title="Moville">Moville</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Donegal_c69a.html" title="County Donegal">County Donegal</a>, near <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londonderry.html" title="Londonderry">Londonderry</a>, and maintained their home, New Park, there. Montgomery considered himself Irish and a County Donegal man.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In 1889, the family moved with his father when he was made <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Bishop</a> of <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. His father was kind, but ineffectual in the house, and often away on missionary work. His mother was a martinet, who allowed her husband 10 shillings a week from his salary and beat her children. Montgomery said that he had an unhappy childhood, often clashing with his mother and becoming the black sheep of the family to such an extent that he declined to go to his mother's funeral. His father died at Molville in 1932.</p>
<p>In 1901, Bishop Montgomery became secretary of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_for_the_Propagation_of_the_Gospel_ff8a.html" title="Society for the Propagation of the Gospel">Society for the Propagation of the Gospel</a>, and the family returned to London. Montgomery went to <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_School_4268.html" title="St Paul's School">St Paul's School</a> and then the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_Academy%2C_Sandhurst_cd39.html" title="Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst">Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst</a>, from which he was almost expelled for setting fire to a fellow cadet during a fight with pokers. He joined the 1st Battalion, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Royal_Warwickshire_Fusiliers_cd31.html" title="The Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers">The Royal Warwickshire Regiment</a> in 1908, first seeing service in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_bca4.html" title="British India">India</a> until 1913.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> began in August 1914 and Montgomery moved to France with his regiment that month. He saw service during the retreat from <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mons_617b.html" title="Battle of Mons">Mons</a>, during which half the men in his battalion became casualties or prisoners. At <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteren.html" title="Meteren">Meteren</a>, near the Belgian border at <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bailleul%2C_Nord_489d.html" title="Bailleul, Nord">Bailleul</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">13 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, during an allied counter-offensive, he was shot through the right lung by a sniper and was injured seriously enough for his grave to be dug in preparation for his death. He was awarded the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">DSO</a> for gallant leadership.</p>
<p>After recovering in early 1915, he was promoted to a brigade-major training <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitchener%27s_Army_f5f3.html" title="Kitchener's Army">Kitchener's New Army</a> and returned to the Western Front in early 1916 as an operations staff officer during the battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Somme_%281916%29_72c7.html" title="Battle of the Somme (1916)">the Somme</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Arras_%281917%29_1af9.html" title="Battle of Arras (1917)">Arras</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passchendaele.html" title="Passchendaele">Passchendaele</a>. During this time he came under the command of General Sir <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Plumer_31d5.html" title="Herbert Plumer">Herbert Plumer</a>, in charge of training for the 9th Corps. Through his training, rehearsal, and integration of the infantry with artillery and engineers, Plumer's troops were able to achieve their objectives with a minimum of casualties.</p>
<p>Montgomery served at the battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Lys_dd1c.html" title="Battle of the Lys">the Lys</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Battle_of_the_Aisne_8dd2.html" title="Third Battle of the Aisne">Chemin-des-Dames</a> before finishing the war as General Staff Officer 1 and effectively chief of staff of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_47th_%282nd_London%29_Division_8e2f.html" title="British 47th (2nd London) Division">47th (2nd London) Division</a>, with the temporary rank of <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant-colonel.html" title="Lieutenant-colonel">lieutenant-colonel</a>. A photograph of 1918 shows the then unknown Lt-Col Montgomery standing in front of Winston Churchill at a parade.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_616f.html" title="Edit section: Between the Wars">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Between the Wars</span></h2>
<p>After the war Montgomery commanded a battalion in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_of_the_Rhine_ecc0.html" title="British Army of the Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a>, before reverting to his regular rank of captain. He wrote up his experiences in a series of training pamphlets and manuals. He then attended the army's Staff College at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberley.html" title="Camberley">Camberley</a>, before being appointed brigade-major in the 17th Infantry Brigade at the end of 1920. The brigade was stationed in <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Cork_4166.html" title="County Cork">County Cork</a> during the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_War_3972.html" title="Anglo-Irish War">Anglo-Irish War</a>. A cousin of Montgomery's had been assassinated by the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html#The_Old_IRA" title="Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> in 1920 (see the <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo_Gang_38af.html" title="Cairo Gang">Cairo Gang</a>) and he was a half-Irish Protestant. However, though he was effective, he did not employ methods as brutal as those of his contemporary in Cork, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Ernest_Percival_0380.html" title="Arthur Ernest Percival">Arthur Percival</a>. On his arrival he urged units of his brigade that their "behaviour must be beyond reproach" although later he stated that it "never bothered me a bit how many houses were burnt" (a reference to the government policy of burning the homes of suspected <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_republicanism.html" title="Irish republicanism">republicans</a> and sympathisers). IRA officer <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Barry_7881.html" title="Tom Barry">Tom Barry</a> said that he "behaved with great correctness". Montgomery increasingly came to see the conflict as one that could not be won, and withdrawal of British forces as the only feasible solution. In 1923, after the establishment of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Free_State_628e.html" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> and during the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Civil_War_de5a.html" title="Irish Civil War">Irish Civil War</a>, Montgomery wrote to Percival that in order "to win a war of that sort you must be ruthless" and 20th century democratic Britain would not do that, and so "the only way therefore was to give them [the Irish] some form of self-government and let them squash the rebellion themselves".</p>
<p>In 1923 Montgomery was posted to the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Army_c362.html" title="Territorial Army">Territorial</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_49th_%28West_Riding%29_Infantry_Division_26f8.html" title="British 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division">49th Division</a>, eschewing the usual amounts of drill for tactical training. He returned to the 1st Royal Warwickshires in 1925 as a company commander and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a>, before becoming an instructor at the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staff_College%2C_Camberley_42ed.html" title="Staff College, Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a> and a major (<a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet.html" title="Brevet">brevet</a> lieutenant-colonel). He met and married Elizabeth Carver, a widow, in 1927 and a son was born in August 1928. He became lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Battalion of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Royal_Warwickshire_Regiment_f5ad.html" title="The Royal Warwickshire Regiment">The Royal Warwickshire Regiment</a> in 1931, and saw service in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Mandate_of_Palestine_86c7.html" title="British Mandate of Palestine">Palestine</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. He was promoted to full colonel and became an instructor at the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Indian_Army_4a5e.html" title="British Indian Army">Indian Army</a> Staff College in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quetta.html" title="Quetta">Quetta</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. As was usual, Montgomery maintained links with the Royal Warwickshires, taking up the honorary position of Colonel-of-the-Regiment in 1947. As throughout his career, Montgomery stirred up the resentment of his superiors for his arrogance and dictatorial ways, and also for his disregard of convention when it obstructed military effectiveness. For example, he set up a battalion <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brothel.html" title="Brothel">brothel</a>, regularly inspected by the medical officer, for the 'horizontal refreshment' of his soldiers rather than forcing them to take chances in unregulated establishments. He became commanding officer of the 9th Infantry Brigade in 1937, but the year also saw tragedy for him. His marriage had been a very happy and loving one, but his wife was bitten by an insect while on holiday in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnham-on-Sea_b792.html" title="Burnham-on-Sea">Burnham-on-Sea</a>. The bite became infected, and his wife died in his arms from <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septicaemia.html" title="Septicaemia">septicaemia</a> following an amputation. The loss devastated Brigadier Montgomery, but he insisted on throwing himself back into his work immediately after the funeral.</p>
<p>In 1938, he organised an amphibious combined operations landing exercise that impressed the new commander-in-chief, Southern Command, General <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Wavell%2C_1st_Earl_Wavell_4204.html" title="Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell">Wavell</a>. He was promoted to major-general and took command of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_8th_Infantry_Division_f673.html" title="British 8th Infantry Division">8th Infantry Division</a> in Palestine.

The 3rd Division was deployed to Belgium as part of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Expeditionary_Force_ffa2.html" title="British Expeditionary Force">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF). Montgomery predicted a disaster similar to that in 1914, and so spent the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phony_War_7643.html" title="Phony War">Phony War</a> training his troops for tactical retreat rather than offensive operations. During this time, Montgomery faced serious trouble from his superiors after again taking a very pragmatic attitude towards the sexual health of his soldiers. His training paid off when the Germans began their invasion of the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">10 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> and the 3rd Division advanced to the River <a href="../../../d/i/j/Dijle.html" title="Dijle">Dijle</a> and then withdrew to <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkirk%2C_France_b430.html" title="Dunkirk, France">Dunkirk</a> with great professionalism, returning to Britain intact with only nominal casualties. During <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Dynamo_2ab1.html" title="Operation Dynamo">Operation Dynamo</a> — the evacuation of 330,000 BEF and French troops to Britain — Montgomery assumed command of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_II_Corps_be47.html" title="British II Corps">II Corps</a>.</p>
<p>On his return Montgomery antagonised the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Office_e75c.html" title="War Office">War Office</a> with trenchant criticisms of the command of the BEF and was briefly relegated to divisional command and only made <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Bath_2ec6.html" title="Order of the Bath">CB</a>.

Montgomery in North Africa, November 1942. His aide (shown behind him looking through binoculars) was killed in action in 1945.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1942 a new field commander was required in the Middle East, where Auchinleck was commander-in-chief. He had stabilised the allied position at Alamein, but after a visit in August 1942, the Prime Minister, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, replaced him with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Alexander%2C_1st_Earl_Alexander_of_Tunis_e624.html" title="Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis">Alexander</a>, and was persuaded by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Brooke%2C_1st_Viscount_Alanbrooke_2b05.html" title="Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke">Alan Brooke</a> to appoint Montgomery commander of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Eighth_Army_8206.html" title="British Eighth Army">British Eighth Army</a> in the North African campaign after Churchill's own preferred candidate, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Gott_f753.html" title="William Gott">William Gott</a>, was killed flying back to <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>.</p>
<p>Montgomery's peremptory assumption of command of the Eighth Army was deeply resented by Auchinleck and his departing staff, but transformed the Eighth Army. Taking command two days earlier than authorised on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">13 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, Montgomery ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, joined the army and air headquarters together in a single operating unit, and ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when they visited on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">19 August</a>.</p>
<p>Montgomery also managed to transform the morale of the Eighth Army quickly, though at the expense of denigrating Auchinleck. Montgomery made a concerted effort to appear before troops as often as possible, frequently visiting various units and making himself known to the men. A criticism of the 8th Army up until this point had been that the constituent units tended to fight their own separate battles. Montgomery was determined that the Army should fight its battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan.</p>
<p>German commander <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Rommel_b47d.html" title="Erwin Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> attempted to encircle the Eighth Army at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Alam_Halfa_ed8b.html" title="Battle of Alam Halfa">Battle of Alam Halfa</a> from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">31 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra.html" title="Ultra">ULTRA</a> decryption had confirmed Montgomery's initial decision to defend the area, and Rommel was halted with very little gain. After this engagement, Montgomery was criticised for not attacking the retreating German forces; however, in Montgomery's judgement, the 8th Army could not defeat the Germans in mobile, fluid mechanised battles and choosing to engage in such a battle, therefore, would play to German strength.</p>
<p>The reconquest of North Africa was essential for airfields to support <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> and for <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Torch_30e2.html" title="Operation Torch">Operation Torch</a>. Ignoring Churchill's demands for quick action Montgomery prepared meticulously for the new offensive. He was determined not to fight until he thought there had been sufficient preparation for a decisive victory, and put into action his beliefs with the gathering of resources, detailed planning, the training of troops, especially in night fighting and in the use of over 300 of the latest American-built <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherman_tank.html" title="Sherman tank">Sherman tanks</a>, 90 <a href="../../../m/7/_/M7_Priest_88d3.html" title="M7 Priest">M7 Priests</a>, and visiting every single unit involved in the offensive.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_El_Alamein_4175.html" title="Second Battle of El Alamein">Battle of El Alamein</a> began on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">23 October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, and ended 12 days later with the first large-scale, decisive allied land victory of the war. Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of the battle and the number of casualties (13,500).</p>
<p>Montgomery was <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Bath_2ec6.html" title="Order of the Bath">knighted</a> and promoted to full <a href="../../../g/e/n/General.html" title="General">general</a>. The Eighth Army's subsequent advance as the Germans retreated hundreds of miles towards their bases in <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunisia.html" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> used the logistical and firepower advantages of the British Army while avoiding unnecessary risks. It also gave the Allies an indication that the tide of war had genuinely turned in North Africa. Montgomery kept the initiative, applying superior strength when it suited him, forcing Rommel out of each successive defensive position. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">6 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> Rommel's attack on the over-extended 8th Army at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medenine.html" title="Medenine">Medenine</a> (<a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Capri_6e2a.html" title="Operation Capri">Operation Capri</a>) with the largest concentration of German armour in North Africa was successfully repulsed. At the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mareth_Line_7bf3.html" title="Mareth Line">Mareth Line</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/_/20_March_0a8d.html" title="20 March">20</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">27 March</a>, when Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than he had anticipated, he switched his major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> fighter-bomber support.</p>
<p>This campaign demonstrated the battle-winning ingredients of morale (sickness and absenteeism was virtually eliminated in the Eighth Army), co-operation of all arms including the air forces, first-class logistical back-up and clear-cut orders.</p>
<p>The next major Allied attack was the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily_69c4.html" title="Allied invasion of Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> (Operation Husky). It was in Sicily that Montgomery's famous tensions with US commanders really began. Montgomery managed to recast plans for the Allied invasion, in general making the plan more cautious. Inter-allied tensions grew as the American commanders <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_S._Patton_9651.html" title="George S. Patton">Patton</a> and <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Bradley_64e9.html" title="Omar Bradley">Bradley</a>, took umbrage at what they perceived as Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness. They resented him, while accepting his skills as a general.</p>
<p>Montgomery continued to command Eighth Army during the landings on the mainland of Italy itself. Montgomery abhorred the lack of coordination, the dispersion of effort, and the strategic muddle and opportunism and was glad to leave the "<i>dog's breakfast</i>" on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_23.html" title="December 23">December 23</a>.</p>

<p>Montgomery returned to Britain to take command of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_21st_Army_Group_e392.html" title="British 21st Army Group">21st Army Group</a> which consisted of all Allied ground forces that would take part in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Operation Overlord</a>, the invasion of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a>. Preliminary planning for the invasion had been taking place for two years, most recently by <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force_df3c.html" title="Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force">COSSAC</a> staff (Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander). Montgomery quickly concluded that the COSSAC plan was too limited, and strongly advocated expanding the plan from a three-division to a five-division assault. As with his takeover of the Eighth Army, Montgomery travelled frequently to his units, raising morale and ensuring training was progressing. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">7 April</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">15 May</a> he presented his strategy for the invasion at St Paul's School. He envisaged a ninety day battle, ending when all the forces reached the <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seine.html" title="Seine">Seine</a>, pivoting on an Allied-held <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caen.html" title="Caen">Caen</a>, with British and Canadian armies forming a shoulder and the U.S. armies wheeling on the right.</p>
<p>During the hard fought two and a half month <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a> that followed, Montgomery was not able to follow the original campaign plan, but in a series of improvised offensives the Allied armies under his command inflicted one of the biggest defeats of the war on the German army in the west. The campaign that Montgomery fought was essentially attritional until the middle of July with the occupation of the <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotentin_Peninsula_495c.html" title="Cotentin Peninsula">Cotentin Peninsula</a> and a series of offensives in the east, which secured Caen and attracted the bulk of German armour there.

<p>The increasing preponderance of American troops in the European theatre (from two out of five divisions at D-Day to 72 out of 85 in 1945) made it a political impossibility for the Ground Forces Commander to be British. After the end of the Normandy campaign, <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_449c.html" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">General Eisenhower</a> himself took over Ground Forces Command while continuing as Supreme Commander, with Montgomery continuing to command the 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units. Montgomery bitterly resented this change, even though it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> had Montgomery promoted to <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_marshal.html" title="Field marshal">field marshal</a> by way of compensation.</p>
<p>Montgomery was able to persuade Eisenhower to adopt his strategy of a single thrust to the <a href="../../../r/u/h/Ruhr_Area_6349.html" title="Ruhr Area">Ruhr</a> with <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Market_Garden_d364.html" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a> in September 1944. It was the most uncharacteristic of Montgomery's battles: the offensive was bold and poorly planned. It ended in failure with the destruction of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_1st_Airborne_Division_67b1.html" title="British 1st Airborne Division">British 1st Airborne Division</a> at <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnhem.html" title="Arnhem">Arnhem</a>. Montgomery's preoccupation with the push to the Ruhr had also distracted him from the essential task of clearing the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scheldt.html" title="Scheldt">Scheldt</a> during the capture of Antwerp, and so after Arnhem, Montgomery's group were instructed to concentrate on <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Scheldt_b9eb.html" title="Battle of the Scheldt">doing this</a> so that the port of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> could be opened.</p>

He grouped the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_XXX_Corps_e9b9.html" title="British XXX Corps">British XXX Corps</a> as a strategic reserve and reorganised the U.S. defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sankt_Vith_63d1.html" title="Sankt Vith">St Vith</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>The operations of the American 1st Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions. Montgomery's contribution to restoring the situation was that he turned a series of isolated actions into a coherent battle fought according to a clear and definite plan. It was his refusal to engage in premature and piecemeal counter-attacks which enabled the Americans to gather their reserves and frustrate the German attempts to extend their breakthrough.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Eisenhower had then wanted Montgomery to go on the offensive on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> to meet Patton's army that had started advancing from the south on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">19 December</a> and in doing so, trap the Germans. However, Montgomery refused to commit infantry he considered underprepared into a snowstorm and for a strategically unimportant piece of land. He did not launch the attack until <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">3 January</a>, by which point the German forces had been able to escape. A large part of American military opinion thought that he should not have held back, though it was characteristic of him not to want to throw troops away owing to inadequate preparation.

<p>After the war, Montgomery was created 1st <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_dba3.html" title="Viscount Montgomery of Alamein">Viscount Montgomery of Alamein</a> in 1946. He was <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_the_Imperial_General_Staff_0c5c.html" title="Chief of the Imperial General Staff">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a> from 1946 until 1948, but was largely a failure as it required the strategic and political skills he did not possess. He was then supreme commander or chairman of the western union's commanders-in-chief committee. He was an effective inspector-general and mounted good exercises, but out of his depth politically, and was pleased to become Eisenhower's deputy in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (<a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a>) forces from 1951 until his retirement in 1958. His mother died in 1949; Montgomery did not attend the funeral, claiming he was "too busy".</p>
<p>Montgomery was chairman of the governing body of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_John%27s_School_f65d.html" title="St John's School">St John's School</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leatherhead.html" title="Leatherhead">Leatherhead</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a> from 1951 to 1966 and a generous supporter.</p>
<p>In 1953, the Hamilton Board of Education in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_Ontario_a636.html" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, Canada, wrote to Montgomery and asked permission to name a new school in the city's east end after him. <a href="http://vmbruins.com/" class="external text" title="http://vmbruins.com/" rel="nofollow">Viscount Montgomery Elementary</a> was billed as "the most modern school in North America" and the largest single-storey school in Hamilton, when the sod was turned on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_14.html" title="March 14">14 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>. The school officially opened on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">18 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, with Montgomery in attendance among almost 10,000 well-wishers. At the opening, he gave the motto "Gardez Bien" from his own family's <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_arms.html" title="Coat of arms">coat of arms</a>.</p>
<p>Montgomery referred to the school as his "beloved school" and visited on five separate occasions, the last being in 1960. On his last visit, he said to "his" students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's make Viscount Montgomery School the best in Hamilton, the best in Ontario, the best in Canada. I don't associate myself with anything that is not good. It is up to you to see that everything about this school is good. It is up to the students to not only be their best in school but in their behaviour outside of Viscount. Education is not just something that will help you pass your exams and get you a job, it is to develop your brain to teach you to marshal facts and do things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before retirement, Montgomery's outspoken views on some subjects, such as race, were often officially suppressed. After retirement these outspoken views became public and his reputation suffered. His memoirs were broadly judged to be self-serving and arrogant. He criticised many of his wartime comrades in harsh terms, including Eisenhower (whom he accused, among other things, of prolonging the war by a year through poor leadership — allegations which ended their friendship). He applauded <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> and Chinese communism under <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_Zedong_ee10.html" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, and argued against the legalisation of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, arguing that the <i><a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_Offences_Act_1967_1d99.html" title="Sexual Offences Act 1967">Sexual Offences Act 1967</a></i> was a "<i>charter for buggery</i>" and that "<i>this sort of thing may be tolerated by the French, but we're British — thank God.</i>"</p>
<p>Perhaps at least in part because of these controversies, Montgomery was never raised to an <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earldom.html" title="Earldom">earldom</a>. (Unlike his wartime contemporaries <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Alexander_1f77.html" title="Harold Alexander">Harold Alexander</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Mountbatten_dd05.html" title="Louis Mountbatten">Louis Mountbatten</a> and even <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Wavell_246d.html" title="Archibald Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a>.) An official task he insisted on performing in his later years was bearing the <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_State_7408.html" title="Sword of State">Sword of State</a> during the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Opening_of_Parliament_6b71.html" title="State Opening of Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>. His increasing frailty, however, raised concerns about his ability to stand for long periods whilst carrying the heavy weapon. Ultimately, those fears were borne out when he collapsed in mid-ceremony in 1968 and did not perform this function again.</p>
<p>A favourite pastime of the British press during these years was to photograph Montgomery cashing his old age pension cheque at the local social security office. Because of his eminence, many assumed Montgomery was wealthy and did not need the money. In fact, he had always been a man of modest means and it caused him great anguish that many believed he was taking taxpayer money he did not need.</p>
<p>Another blow was a break-in at his home. Despite making a heartbreaking televised appeal for the return of his possessions, many of which bore only sentimental value, the items were never recovered.</p>
<p>Montgomery died in 1976 at his home in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alton%2C_Hampshire_26a4.html" title="Alton, Hampshire">Alton</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampshire.html" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, and was interred in the nearby Holy Cross Churchyard, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binsted.html" title="Binsted">Binsted</a> after a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_funeral.html" title="State funeral">state funeral</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_George%27s_Chapel%2C_Windsor_6be3.html" title="St George's Chapel, Windsor">St George's Chapel, Windsor</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_616f.html" title="Edit section: Character and controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character and controversy</span></h2>
<p>Montgomery was a complex person. On the one hand, though far from flawless, he was a great and successful general through hard work, a refusal to conform to dead tradition, and an open, clear and alert mind. He was a humane man and was capable of inspiring great loyalty among his staff and his troops. Montgomery believed that in the 20th century it was essential to explain to troops why they were fighting and that orders and plans must be clear. He therefore tended to appeal more to the common soldiers under his command than to many of the officers who had more direct dealings with him. These men defended him with great passion even after the war, as the British historian <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Holmes_%28military_historian%29_46cf.html" title="Richard Holmes (military historian)">Richard Holmes</a> discovered when he was critical of Montgomery.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was personally a difficult man. Montgomery did not get on with his contemporaries and mostly associated with junior officers. He was insensitive, conceited, and boastful.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> He was not an easy man to know socially and not loyal to the staff officers serving immediately under him. His dismissive and occasionally insulting attitude to others often soured opinions about his abilities and personality. It can be argued that his failures happened when he allowed his desire for personal glory to taint his planning, causing him to abandon his usual caution.</p>
<p>Often it was Montgomery's statements about battles, as much as his actual conduct of it, that have formed the basis of the controversy. In his career, Montgomery's orders to his subordinates were clear and complete, yet with his superiors his communications would be opaque and incomplete.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> So, in Normandy he gave the impression to Eisenhower and others that he was attempting a breakout, while playing down this possibility in his actual orders to his subordinates. For example, shortly before <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Goodwood_6405.html" title="Operation Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a> he removed Falaise as an objective, but did not forward these new orders to <a href="../../../s/h/a/SHAEF_3fd5.html" title="SHAEF">SHAEF</a>. Throughout his career he enraged his superiors and colleagues, partly because he would not allow convention to disrupt military effectiveness, partly because of a contempt for authority and an unwillingness to be in a situation where he was not in control, and partly because he could be quite a strange person. <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Bedell_Smith_ad27.html" title="Walter Bedell Smith">Walter Bedell Smith</a> once said to him "<i>You may be great to serve under, difficult to serve alongside, but you sure are hell to serve over!</i>".<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> He also found it difficult to publicly admit his operations had not gone to plan, irrespective of whether they were ultimately successful (Normandy) or unsuccessful (Market Garden, where he claimed that it had been a 90% success).</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, Montgomery is remembered particularly for his victorious campaign in North Africa, which, with the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Stalingrad_f1b5.html" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a>, was very much seen as the turning point of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The different nature of the war for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> means that his reputation there is very much coloured by the controversies in the later stages of the war in Europe, especially around the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Bulge_17b4.html" title="Battle of the Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>. These brought into relief both his virtues and failings.</p>
<p>At the end of 1944 there was tension between the Allies owing to a campaign by the British press for Eisenhower to appoint a deputy and for him to be the Allied ground commander. Immediately after the Battle of the Bulge, on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">7 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> Montgomery held a press conference in which he downplayed the role of the American generals, especially Patton, in the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge and focused on his own generalship. Many of his comments were ill-judged, particularly his statement that when the situation "began to deteriorate", Eisenhower had placed him in command in the north, and they were inflammatory to Patton, implying that he needed to be rescued by Montgomery "<i>with a bang</i>". In the press conference Montgomery said that he thought the counter-offensive had gone very well and did not explain his delayed attack on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">3 January</a>. According to Churchill, the attack from the south under Patton was steady but slow and involved heavy losses, and Montgomery claimed to be trying to avoid this situation. Montgomery also gave the impression that substantial British forces had been involved in the fighting that repelled the German attack (an impression explicitly corrected by Churchill within the House of Commons). A slanted version inserted by Germany within an Allied radio broadcast added to American resentment.</p>
<p>In a memo to Eisenhower, Montgomery proposed that he should again be made Commander Ground Forces and implicitly criticised recent conduct of the war while American confidence had been shaken and nerves were raw. Eisenhower, encouraged by the Deputy Supreme Commander, Air Marshal <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Tedder%2C_1st_Baron_Tedder_7302.html" title="Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder">Tedder</a> (another person with a long running feud with Montgomery), was on the point of dismissing Montgomery, when Bedell Smith and Montgomery's chief-of-staff, Major-General <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_de_Guingand_a97c.html" title="Freddie de Guingand">Freddie de Guingand</a>, pointed that this would be both politically unwise and difficult to justify. de Guingand was able to convince Montgomery of the impact of his words (of which he was apparently unaware) and Montgomery wrote an apology to Eisenhower. The moment passed. Eisenhower commented in his memoirs: "<i>I doubt if Montgomery ever came to realise how resentful some American commanders were. They believed he had belittled them — and they were not slow to voice reciprocal scorn and contempt</i>".</p>
<p>On the other hand, during the same press conference Montgomery showed his respect for ordinary troops and eulogised the American soldier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I first saw him in battle in Sicily and I formed a very high opinion of him. I saw him again in Italy. He is a very brave fighting man, steady under fire and with that tenacity in battle which marks the first-class fighting soldier. I have a great affection and admiration for the American soldier. I salute the brave fighting men of America. I never want to fight alongside better soldiers. I have tried to feel that I am almost an American soldier myself so that I might take no unsuitable action or offend them in any way ... <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerd_von_Rundstedt_7c06.html" title="Gerd von Rundstedt">Rundstedt</a> was really beaten by the good fighting qualities of the American soldier and by the team work of the Allies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Eisenhower, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The captain of our team is Eisenhower. I am absolutely devoted to Ike; we are the greatest of friends. It grieves me when I see uncomplimentary articles about him in the British press; he bears a great burden, he needs our fullest support, he has the right to expect it and it is up to all of us to see that he gets it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Montgomery later wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think now that I should never have held that press conference. So great were the feelings against me on the part of the American generals that whatever I said was bound to be wrong. I should therefore have said nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brooke was perhaps near the truth when he said of Montgomery,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is probably the finest tactical general we have had since <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley_5915.html" title="Arthur Wellesley">Wellington</a>. But on some of his strategy, and especially on his relations with the Americans, he is almost a disaster.</p>

<p>Any assessment of Montgomery is immediately entangled in his sometimes difficult, boastful personality, harshness towards those he felt did not measure up, and issues of Anglo-American national pride. Nevertheless this section attempts a balanced summing up of his general leadership from a military perspective. Was he primarily a ponderous set-piece general or was he indeed one of the most brilliant commanders of recent history, a true heir to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Churchill%2C_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough_221e.html" title="John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough">Marlborough</a>, at least from the British perspective?

<p>Montgomery deserves his due as an outstanding trainer of men. His record in Palestine, North Africa, Sicily and Northern Europe shows this. His meticulous preparation of his troops, ranging from the usual physical necessities, to painstaking explanation of his vision and plans down to relatively low levels, to well articulated exercises and drills, to his insistence that formations like divisions "should fight as divisions" (i.e. gain proficiency in "big picture" coordination and integration) show the mind and skill of a keen organiser. None of this is earth-shattering for any competent military commander, but Montgomery demonstrated a great level of proficiency and made it one his special trademarks.</p>
<p>Montgomery was a keen advocate of physical fitness and hard training: in the desert he had all ranks from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier.html" title="Brigadier">brigadier</a> down doing daily physical training; any man, no matter what rank, was expected to be fit to fight, and if any officer could not keep up on daily runs, he was sent home.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Montgomery was also a critic of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_drill.html" title="Battle drill">Battle Drill</a> Training, which he felt was a crutch used by unit commanders. His personal view, put into action during the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phony_War_7643.html" title="Phony War">Phony War</a> and afterwards, was that company and battalion training in the phases of war—relief in place, passage of obstacles, hasty attack, etc. — was ignored in favour of simple drilling at the section and platoon level.</p>
<p>Montgomery had a deep technical understanding of how the Army operated, at all levels from the infantry company to the Army Group. He helped to shape the Canadian army through assisting the formation of the fledgling <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Canadian_Army_c124.html" title="First Canadian Army">First Canadian Army</a> while they were under his command in South-Eastern Army. Montgomery personally visited most Canadian units, down to the battalion level, and assisted Canadian Army commander <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Crerar_670c.html" title="Harry Crerar">Harry Crerar</a> in weeding out poor officers, giving direct criticism of battalion commanders, company commanders, and even regimental sergeants-major.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Montgomery indirectly shaped the Canadian Army that saw action in Italy and NW Europe.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_616f.html" title="Edit section: As a strategist and tactician">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">As a strategist and tactician</span></h4>
<p>Montgomery's hallmark as a strategist was a detailed analysis of his enemy and development of a clear vision as to how that enemy was to be fought and defeated. Two words sum up the approach of the British commander: clarity and organization. These were put into practice through careful preparation of what he termed a "master plan", to which all subsequent effort was to be subordinated. The "master plan" embodied the vision, and the strategic and tactical approaches that would be used. Far from being rigid, Montgomery held that the flexibility or "balance" was one of the keys to his overarching structure. He regarded the German Army as one of hard-core professionalism, and held that wishful thinking and foggy concepts against such an opponent was a recipe for dismal failure.</p>
<p>Montgomery sought changes along these lines in the plan for the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily_69c4.html" title="Allied invasion of Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. His influence however was more limited and his own less-than-spectacular gains in the difficult terrain, were unfavorably compared by some to the thrusting mobility of US General George Patton — a foreshadowing of controversies to come. Operation Husky was a success, but the Germans were able to extract tens of thousands of troops from Sicily to fight elsewhere, indicating that Montgomery's concerns about concepts, planning and execution were not totally off the mark.</p>
<p>His approach can be seen in his insistence on recasting or adjusting the invasion plans of Normandy, generally strengthening initial shock forces and insisting on a clear vision and method of how subsequent battles were to be fought. The success of the D-Day landings owed a great debt to Montgomery's planning. After the war, Eisenhower and his chief of staff, Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedell_Smith_bc8b.html" title="Bedell Smith">Bedell Smith</a> told the American military correspondent, Drew Middleton that "<i>No one else could have got us across the Channel and into Normandy... Whatever they say about him, he got us there</i>".</p>
<p>Montgomery felt his approach vindicated at the Second Battle of El Alamein. His strategic vision ushered in much needed clarity, and his defensive preparations (drawing in part on the prior work of his predecessor Auchinleck) also envisioned a decisive counterattack. During the most critical point of the battle his concept of "balance" or flexibility within the confines of a master plan held, and the British were able to shift forces to see off Rommel's thrust, and mount their own riposte that shattered the back of the Axis formations.</p>
<p>The Battle of Normandy saw similar success. He insisted on more forces for the initial landing and a clear vision for the further campaign against some planners who were primarily concerned with just getting on the beach. Despite the failure of all but the Canadians to gain the ambitious targets on D-Day, and the subsequent improvisations, his strategy of attritional battle on the left drawing in German forces and allowing a breakthrough on the right was successful. This approach could not be broadcast on the nightly news and the public perception of the struggle was typically one that saw both Allies equally attempting to break out of the beachhead, with progress being "slow." Montgomery however persisted, and deflecting pressure from his superiors (who remained in England) for quicker results, retained mastery of the developing battle. Overall, he achieved victory well within the originally planned ninety days. Normandy and El Alamein cement Montgomery's place as one of the greatest of the modern British generals in the view of some historians, and vindicate his concept of "balance" within the overall structure of a dominant "master plan".<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_616f.html" title="Edit section: As a builder of morale">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">As a builder of morale</span></h4>
<p>Montgomery also deserves credit as a builder of morale, both that of his soldiers and that of the general public. A large part of his reputation has been sustained by the people who served under him. After his experiences in the First World War he had determined not to waste soldiers' lives: as <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Haig%2C_1st_Earl_Haig_ea8a.html" title="Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig">Haig</a> persisted in attritional battles, Montgomery wrote to his brother Donald, on seeing Canadians sent to assault Passchendaele Ridge that they were 'magnificent', but 'they forget that the whole art of war is to gain your objective with as little loss as possible', which was a doctrine that Montgomery subsequently lived by.</p>
<p>Further to this, he also displayed a genuine concern for the welfare of the men serving under him: for example, at one time he jeopardised his career by illegally hiring out land to a fair to raise welfare funds;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> he arranged for female nurses at forward casualty clearing centres in the desert war in 1943;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> he took a very pragmatic view towards sexual health;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> directly after the Battle of Medenine he was lobbying Brooke to allow long-serving soldiers to return to England.<sup id="_ref-ham_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ham" title="">[14]</a></sup> Coupled with this was his belief that soldiers must actually understand why they were fighting, and that they deserve to have things properly explained to them. Montgomery thought that one of the most important roles for a military commander was to motivate his men to fight, that military command is "a great human problem". In addition, Montgomery's experiences in the First World War led him to despise generals who led from the rear, well away from any fighting,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup> and so was visible in his campaigns.</p>
<p>The early years of World War II saw a series of humiliating defeats and military reverses for Britain. Montgomery was not the first to unequivocally reverse. His experiences in Ireland had shown him the importance of public support in a war. Montgomery was sometimes ungracious, but he was able to painstakingly articulate a vision for victory and couple with it a good sense for publicity (the use of his distinctive black beret with two badges, for example). He continued these same methods in England prior to the invasion, insisting on a clear concept of battle beyond the beaches, all united under a powerful master plan. Later on, Montgomery was not the only leader who struck a distinctive chord for morale prior to the great invasion, but he was certainly one of the most influential, ensuring not only the troops that stepped ashore on 6 June, were thus men confident in their leaders, their plans, their equipment and their cause, but so were the public. His speaking tour of British munitions factories before D-Day had made Churchill worry that he would be <i>"filling The Mall"</i> with adoring crowds if he was allowed to receive his field marshal's baton at <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckingham_Palace_d404.html" title="Buckingham Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_616f.html" title="Edit section: Criticisms of Montgomery's generalship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms of Montgomery's generalship</span></h3>
<p>Montgomery's record also has been extensively criticised. The criticism of his actions tends to be bound up with his difficult personality and relationships with superiors (see the Character and Controversy Section above) but generally two areas in particular can be separated out, which are summarised here.</p>
<p><a name="Slowness_and_over-caution" id="Slowness_and_over-caution"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_616f.html" title="Edit section: Slowness and over-caution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Slowness and over-caution</span></h4>
<p>Montgomery was often accused of being slow and overcautious. Examples cited include before El Alamein, afterwards in the pursuit of Rommel, the Battle of Normandy, and in the counter-offensive in the Ardennes. In North Africa, prior to Montgomery taking command, the history of the campaign in North Africa had see-sawed as each offensive outran its supply lines: both sides won battles but neither gained a decisive advantage.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, during the Battle of Normandy, the fear of stalemate made the supreme command in Britain pressurise Montgomery (at one point in July 1944, it was thought that Churchill was flying to France to sack Montgomery at Eisenhower's request<sup id="_ref-ham_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ham" title="">[14]</a></sup>), with extra pressure being applied by air commanders wanting French airfields to operate from. Much is made of the fact that many of Montgomery's initial targets were not met, especially the capture of <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caen.html" title="Caen">Caen</a> (criticism that was compounded after the war when Montgomery insisted that all elements had gone "according to plan", which clearly was not the case). However his predictions, the so called "phase lines" on the maps, were never intended to be a rigid guarantee but a guide, as would be clear from previous opposed landings at <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Avalanche_%28World_War_II%29_e750.html" title="Operation Avalanche (World War II)">Salerno</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Shingle_cbc9.html" title="Operation Shingle">Anzio</a>. Much of the criticism resulted from Montgomery giving his superiors and the press the impression that he was trying to achieve large-scale breakouts while actually fighting an attritional campaign.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[18]</a></sup> However, in the end Montgomery's success was achieved in less time than planned.</p>
<p>Montgomery was not a dashing general, and deliberately methodical, usually not willing to sacrifice military effectiveness for other people's agenda. The realities of the wartime Britain must also be remembered. It had seen severe early defeats, an economy almost crippled by German U-boat attacks, and dwindling supplies of manpower to fight on fronts ranging from the Far East to the Mediterranean. There simply were no more big armies to commit wholesale in Normandy or elsewhere. Montgomery thus carefully husbanded the troops he had left.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[19]</a></sup> Furthermore, much of his apparent caution sprang from his regard for human life and a desire not to throw the lives of his troops away in the manner of the generals of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>. Therefore, for El Alamein, Normandy and the Ardennes, he was not prepared to go into an offensive until there was complete readiness of both men, equipment, and logistics. This approach sometimes exasperated his superiors, but it generally brought success, and ensured his popularity with his men.</p>
<p>The criticism of slowness and caution has been taken further with Montgomery being called primarily a "general of <i>matériel</i>":<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[20]</a></sup> one who emerged at the right time and place to take advantage of the massive outpouring of American and British war production, ensuring the Allies local material superiority against their opponents. But this charge is hard to maintain in a war during which material weight counted above almost all factors. It was a mass production war in every theatre, and the same "<i>matériel</i>" criticism of Montgomery must then need to apply to the great Russian commanders of the Eastern Front like <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgy_Zhukov_8573.html" title="Georgy Zhukov">Zhukov</a> or <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Konev_8c70.html" title="Ivan Konev">Konev</a>, as well as to the American effort. Equally, it ignores the successful improvised actions in North Africa, Normandy, and the Ardennes.</p>
<p><a name="Market_Garden_and_the_Scheldt_estuaries" id="Market_Garden_and_the_Scheldt_estuaries"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery%2C_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein_616f.html" title="Edit section: Market Garden and the Scheldt estuaries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Market Garden and the Scheldt estuaries</span></h4>
<p>A second great area of criticism centres around Montgomery's only defeat of the Second World War, the failure of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Market_Garden_d364.html" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a> at Arnhem. It may be significant that this operation was unlike any of Montogomery's successful battles by being bold, but poorly planned and supported. R.W.Thompson writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conception of such a plan was impossible for a man of Montgomery's innate caution... In fact, Montgomery's decision to mount the operation aimed at the <a href="../../../z/u/i/Zuider_Zee_1578.html" title="Zuider Zee">Zuider Zee</a> was as startling as it would have been for an elderly and saintly <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Bishop</a> suddenly to take up safe-cracking and begin on the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_England_ea3c.html" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been suggested that the ambition of the plan may have been a result of interpersonal friction and competition with the American generals, as well as other personality traits<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>A result of the concentration on Market Garden was the failure to clear the Scheldt estuary, which surrounded the vital port of Antwerp. In the autumn of 1944 the Allies required a port to shorten their supply lines and allow supplies to be brought in for the advance into Germany. It also meant that the Germans could reinforce their defensive lines in Holland, blocking one main axis of advance into their homeland. Montgomery pleaded the difficulties of continual fighting in prior weeks and logistical problems, but the result of the distraction of Market Garden was the escape of the German 15th Army and lengthy operations to clear the Scheldt. Thompson calls it "<i>Montgomery's most agonizing failure</i>",<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[23]</a></sup> while Montgomery himself later noted that this was "<i>a bad mistake — I underestimated the difficulty of opening up the approaches to Antwerp ... I reckoned that the Canadian Army could do it while we were going for the Ruhr. I was wrong.</i>"</p>
