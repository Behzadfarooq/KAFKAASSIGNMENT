<p>Someone without a Wikipedia account wrote this:</p>
<pre>
 The miraculous spring of Bernadette no longer flows, and water is being piped in
 from the municipal water supplies.
</pre>
<p>I have written to the Lourdes Bureau to ask about this and get verification, and meanwhile put it here. While I am aware that work was done on the rock from which Bernadette's spring flows back in the mid- to late 80s, this was done to help the spring flow more freely and was very much in the spirit of the masons and millers, including Bernadette's dad, who worked on the original guttering and catchbasin for the water as it came up from the hole she dug, as (she said) at her Lady's request. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 01:13, 17 December 2005 (UTC</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, here's what I got from the Bureau this afternoon: "During the winter we stop few tabs [she means taps], because the temperature are to cold and the risk is the tabs could be frozen .Sincerely Yours, Service Accueil, Dominique" Well, I can certainly understand that. Still looking for verification about the municipal water being substituted for spring water. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 01:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>As a non-believer I found this article, although well-written and interesting, extremely biased, favoring a Catholic believer-in-miracles point of view. Only a devout Catholic would be convinced by the story and by such statements as " her body was found to be "incorrupt" — preserved from decomposition, perhaps by supernatural means." It is sad to see this sort of thing on Wikipedia and adds to the the feeling that is growing in the academic world that Wikipedia cannot be taken seriously. Unfortunately I have only one source to consult--Lourdes: body and spirit in the secular age by Ruth Harris and available through Penguin-and it is not available online. The book is scholarly, impeccably researched, and readable. Above all, it is without either religious or secularist bias, unlike the article here. rvogensen 16:18 18 December 2005 GMT</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I did say "perhaps". You seem to think that my reportage means that I am "convinced" of anything. I am convinced that the events occurred; they're a matter of historic record as you well know. Whether or not any of it was of supernatural origin is a matter of speculation. I have tried to be very careful to say "Bernadette <i>reported</i>" or "she <i>said</i> this happened." I'll go through it again and make sure I've got them all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your concept that "only devout Catholics" (I am nothing of the sort) would fall for what you think is an obviously falsified story shows that while you may have some background info, it isn't enough. The preservation of dead bodies is a historical fact. It's usually something in the ground or climate conditions. Catholics are free to believe or disbelieve that some, not all of these preservations are divine intervention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm getting a little tired of seeing reportage on this type of event denigrated as "sad" or "pathetic". Reporting that some people believe that this event was for real is not an indication that the writer himself believes that way. If you want to take over the article and rewrite it, this is Wikipedia. Be careful not to include your own biases, which have no more place in Wikipedia than mine do. My interest in Bernadette has little to do with religion and more to do with the way women were perceived at the time. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluejay_Young_7c72.html" title="User:Bluejay Young">Bluejay Young</a> 01:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Barbara, you made several changes. I changed the first in the main paragraph to make it more clear. I removed the link because firstly it doesn't deal with the person Bernadette and secondly it is inappropriate to have a critical link in the first paragraph of an article.</dd>
<dd>I deleted the second change because its content was already in that paragraph.</dd>
<dd>I also deleted the part about the body preservation because its content is about preservation in general and not about the preservation of the body of Bernadette Soubirous. The article already says that Bernadette preserved body received a wax mask in 1925. There was no other preservation on her body. That you use the link to hiddenmysteries.org a second time could be considered as spam.

<dd>Dear Barbara, seemingly you are unwilling read my arguments above. In the article it is already stated that Bernadette was herding sheeps and waiting at a restaurant. It is also stated that she was attributed with simple-mindedness but others doubt this. Your insertion is just shallow talk which repeats already written facts together your personal interpretation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the preservation I repeat my argument from above: <i>I also deleted the part about the body preservation because its content is about preservation in general and not about the preservation of the body of Bernadette Soubirous. The article already says that Bernadette preserved body received a wax mask in 1925. There was no other preservation on her body.</i> <b>Barbara, you are always free to write an article about body preservation and link it from this article.</b> Your text is not about Bernadette's body and therefore I deleted it. It makes no sense to list all the means of preservations. What matters are the facts: There was no technical preservation of her body until 1925. The article doesn't say that this was by supernatural means. That's up to the reader. I will revert the article but leave the NPOV and I urge you to discuss before you change the article. I also ask you to make changes in one edit and not in a dozen. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedikt_7630.html" title="User:Benedikt">Benedikt</a> 07:46, 19 February 2006 (UTC)<br /></dd>

The Roman Catholic Church has not revealed what she looked like before.

<dd>I just cleared this part of the article. Apparently B. was sprayed with a film of wax in order to prevent her skin to change color.

<p>I really doubt that it conforms to the guidelines when we link to the miracles article four times. I understand that you are unhappy that such unbelievable (for you, not for me&#160;;-)) facts stand uncorrected in the article. But I don't like the idea of having a link to the miracles page after each paragraph. How should we solve this problem? What about that: After the first paragraph we put in a clause that the dispute about the miracles in Lourdes is dealt with in the other article. Then we can imo delete all the other links to that article.

<p>At the top of the page it says the Catholic Church confirms this apparition and other religions dispute it. Would it be better to say something like "This article is exclusively related to the Catholic Church. It does not pertain to other religions"? Also, why does the Catholic Church confirm it if other religions doubt it? The facts should be obvious in themselves and not be related to one's religion because an event either occured or did not. We here at Wikipedia are supposed to find what DID occur.<a href="../../../j/b/o/User%7EJBogdan_c268.html" title="User:JBogdan">JBogdan</a> 18:50, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is riddled, probably by subsequent editors, with ridiculous attempts to denigrate the subject. Such, for instance, as the goofy and irrelevent suggestion that Bernadette's incorrupt body might have been interpreted as a sign of vampirism in other cultures. Ridiculous and totally irrelevent to the topic. The article has been rendered uselsss as a reference because of these invasions. I suggest instead reference be made to the following:</p>
