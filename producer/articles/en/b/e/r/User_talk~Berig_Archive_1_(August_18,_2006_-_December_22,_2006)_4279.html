<p>I'm having a hard time with Þórvaldr. I can understand all the words but I can't make it into a coherent sequence of speech:</p>
<p>Farið til Fýrisvallar, folka tungls, hverr's hungrar, vörðr, at virkis garði vestr kveldriðu hesta&#160;;</p>
<ul>
<li>"Farið til Fýrisvallar" - go to Fýrisvöllr</li>
<li>"folka tungls vörðr" - guard of the heavenly body of the battle (guard of sword; warrior)</li>
<li>"at virkis garði" - towards the fortress</li>
<li>"vestr" - to the west</li>
<li>"hverr's hungrar" - whoever feels hungry</li>
<li>"kveldriðu hesta" - of the horses of the night-rider (horses of the trollwife; wolves)</li>
</ul>
<p>Presumably the wolves are those who feel hungry for the slain at Fýrisvöllr but what's the warrior doing there? Maybe we're supposed to assume an "ok" in there and get: "Go west to Fýrisvöllr, to the fortress, warrior [and] any wolf who is hungry." But I'm not sure enough about this to put it into the article. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 16:23, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Berig, I'm so glad to see you active again. Please, if (and when) you have a chance, would you mind tackling the problematic lack of sources and/or scholarly discussion in the Sweyn article in more detail? I was so happy to see someone editing there. I have it on my watch list after having noticed it only very recently, and seeing that it consisted of one single, horribly long paragraph. I split it into sub-sections, but I haven't had the time or energy to work on it. The article needs references in the worse way as it seems to have been rocked by serious POV wars, making everybody with expertise abandon it. I think that the sentence you removed may have a place in the article if it is referenced properly, but people need to step up to the plate and source their statements. All sides.

Sigh. Choices, choices. OK, I'll better just put him among the royals and be done with him then.&#160;;) <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPia_L_f99c.html" title="User:Pia L">Pia</a> 19:45, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Absolutely! Statements about historic 'truth', 'evidence' etc are usually POV influenced and superfluous. On a different note: it would be nice if we could locate a reasonably well-argued, peer-reviewed article about his life, written in an easily-graspable style that gives a more general overview of the issues involved, as well as an overview of the contentions about the sources people have used to base biographies about him on. I have to go look for some non-cyber-space related stuff in the archives this afternoon, so I'll do a quick search of recently published articles about him, to see if there's something new out there that we can use as well.

<dd>Berig, I added some sources to fulfill some of the <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> requests, but there's still a lot of stuff needing to be sourced, but, yawn, I'm too sleepy to continue. Please, could you look it over when you get a chance, just to make sure I didn't totally scramble the page and spell things backwards etc? Adam of Bremen is giving me a lot of grief. So many of the sources I have checked seem totally disenchanted by him, but still, their arguments seem to build on his tales to a very large extent. And what to do about the section on religion? Are you able to tell which sources that information has been picked from? I downloaded the Royal Historical Society/History Today dissertation of the year for 2002, but it was basically about the story on Saint Edmund and the memorial coinage after Sweyn's death. Not much use. BTW, I made the beard fashion statement invisible for now, because I haven't been able to find anything about men's facial hair fashion of the era, so far. No, I have got to get to bed now. Best, <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPia_L_f99c.html" title="User:Pia L">Pia</a> 11:42, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hallo, I have noticed your changes, and have to say that these are changes for the worse. 1. You changed descriptions that are fitting into descriptions that are very vague. 2. Your change of the Jastorf mention, is of a logic, that i do not understand. The Jastorf culture ended before the Langobards were mentioned by the Romans, and because of that you claim it to be unfitting to call the Langobards people of the Jastorf culture. That is nonsense in my opinion. The Langobards were people of the Jastorf and later iron age cultures and can be reffered to as such at any given time. 3. It is a proven fact, due to the reasons i listed, that the Langobards settled the Lower Elbe lands in the 1st. Century AD, and not, like you state, a "suggestion". So this change was the worst of all. 4. The citation you needed, is from Dr. Eckert Frey. German Archaeologist and head of the Johann Friedrich Danneil Museum. (User:LOM)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that my changes render the text more vague than your assertions. But, WP is not for asserting what you think is <i>certain</i>, but for presenting what different sources say about the matter. This has to do with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:neutral point of view</a>. Moreover, any assertion, such as the ones you add needs to be referenced according to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:citing sources</a>. The end date of the Jastorf culture is 1 AD, i.e. before your sources talk about the Langobards, and so the labelling is an anachronism.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 07:07, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What, exactly are these assertions that you talk about?</dd>
<dd>Peterculus?</dd>
<dd>Tacitus?</dd>
<dd>The Archaeological sites?</dd>
<dd>Dr. Eckart Frey's works?</dd>
<dd>The Jastorf culture zone?</dd>
<dd>Please be more precise.</dd>
<dd>Further more, i have stated in my previous post to you that, it doesnt matter if the Langobards are mentioned after the end of jastorf culture by the Romans. They were a people from this culture and can be reffered to as such. (User:LOM)

<p>Ok, i have looked at your changes, and must say, that they are good and a definate improvement. So i apologize for the first bits about your intentions, which i misunderstood. As for the Scadinavia island note. I did read on several notes that the Langobards or Winnili (back than) claimed that they came from an island. Wether this island was big or small is not stated. I have this note (concerning the size) from a german book about the migration period. But i am also not very pleased with that and therefor its good that you deleted it. Most historians, that follow the Langobard saga believe that "the Island" of the Langobards was infact a Peninsula of south west Sweden. That was naturally closed by the sea on 3 sides, therefor the Langobards claiming it to be an island.</p>

<p>I had <i>not</i> misrepresented the information from Encyclopædia Britianica, dispite the edit comment you had made. I have been told not to use information verbatim from copywritten sources, so used a river-to-river description (South end of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> is largely a river delta region, visited there last year, quite nice, I highly recommend it to anyone as a place to visit). Would there be a clear policy document on what is permitted?

<dd>I am sorry to say that you had. For some time, I was in awe about the statement that according to Encyclopedia Britannica, the 750 BC Proto-Germanic region went from the Baltic sea down to the border of France (<a href="../../../m/e/u/Meuse_River_1713.html" title="Meuse River">Meuse River</a>), when I usually read that it was bordered by the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Weser_River_1ef6.html" title="Weser River">Weser River</a> and the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Aller.html" title="Aller">Aller</a> in the south around 600 BC.

<dd>My bad&#160;;-) … I meant only the delta region and northeast from there of the <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meuse_River_1713.html" title="Meuse River">Meuse River</a>, not the length or the source of that river, because it is all the way in France (light-years from the North Sea and Baltic costal regions of Germanic inhabitation). France was Celtic at time. The source is relatively recent, but it only stated the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and not the river exiting their.

<p>What do you mean, it states its source? There is no references section, no book listed in which the information could be verified. Please see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for verfiability requirements and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> for guidelines on how to cite an article. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> 16:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand what you mean by that statement. The article says
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Huld</b> was a <a href="../../../v/%C3%B6/l/V%C3%B6lva.html" title="Völva">völva</a> in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavian_mythology.html" title="Scandinavian mythology">Scandinavian mythology</a>.

She "hag-rode" him to death. Later she was hired by Vanlade's grand-children to kill his son <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visbur.html" title="Visbur">Visbur</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This means that it cites <i><a href="../../../y/n/g/Ynglingatal.html" title="Ynglingatal">Ynglingatal</a></i> as a source. You need to explain why the article does not cite its sources.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 17:42, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand that. But it needs to have a references section, and list an edition of the book I buy or find at the library. An internal link is not sufficient.

<dd>This is exactly why I find your objection strange Xyzzy. Have you tried clicking on the <i><a href="../../../h/e/i/Heimskringla.html" title="Heimskringla">Heimskringla</a></i> article? By clicking one more time on <a href="../../../y/n/g/Ynglinga_saga.html" title="Ynglinga saga">Ynglinga saga</a>, you will find that there are online translations of that work to consult, like this one: <a href="http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/000_02.php" class="external text" title="http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/000_02.php" rel="nofollow">Ynglinga saga</a>.

<p>I also understand that. But <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires every article to cite its sources. Relying on other Wikipedia articles <i>which could change at any time</i> is not a recognized method for citing sources.

<p>Hi Berig! I don't understand why he can't be both a legendary and mythological king at the same time? I think he is also a mythological king of the dark ages as he went beyond legend of an ordinary man to become the allegory of 'kingship' who faught with monsters and dragons. I just read a chapter on <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beowulf.html" title="Beowulf">Beowulf</a> in the book "Storytelling &amp; Mythmaking: Images from Film &amp; Literature" by Frank McConnell: McConnell who gives Beowulf as the example of the epic King and mythological king because of the allegorical performed to the people making the world safe from chaos. I will put this on the talk page for people to discuss.<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 19:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, if you insist on categorizing him as mythological, you can do that. I am not impossible. My reasons for objecting to it is the fact that Scandinavian kings from the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a> and onwards enter the realm of semi-historicity. Hygelac is widely accepted as based on a historic figure, and the contemporary Swedish king <a href="../../../o/h/t/Ohthere.html" title="Ohthere">Ohthere</a> is often called the "first historic king of Sweden". You can find older scholarship where Beowulf is held to have been a historic figure as well. Moreover, AFAIK, legend is distinguished from myth due to the fact that legend takes place in real world settings, and was at the time it was composed held to be almost historical if not outright historical, like Beowulf.--<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerig_a10d.html" title="User:Berig">Berig</a> 19:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ok I am not impossible either so I like to give it time for thought before doing more. Historical people and events can become mythological, see King Arthur. On kings, there are going to be grey areas between legend and myth. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldenrowley_47a6.html" title="User:Goldenrowley">Goldenrowley</a> 19:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
