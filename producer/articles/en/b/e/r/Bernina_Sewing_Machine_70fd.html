<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernina_Sewing_Machine_70fd.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>In 1893, Karl Friedrich Gegauf (founder of the Bernina Sewing Machine Factory) constructed the first hemstitching machine in the world.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1890, Karl Friedrich Gegauf moved from Tägerwilen to Steckborn, Switzerland. and in Feldbach Convent established an embroidery shop and a mechanical workshop for the production of a monogram embroidering machine, his own invention. In the embroidering section he had 4-6 machines in operation and up to 10 skilled mechanics were employed in the workshop. But Gegauf was less interested in the operation of the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embroidery.html" title="Embroidery">embroidery</a> shop - that served more as a proving ground where his machines could be tried out: his main concern was the development of new machines of all different types.</p>
<p>He worked intensively on the problem of developing a machine for doing hemstitching, which at that time had to be done painstakingly by hand on countless items of laundry. He found an ingenious solution and in 1892 he was granted Swiss <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent.html" title="Patent">Patent</a> No. 4670 for the world's first hemstitch sewing machine. This machine, and the one that he and his son improved later, were to be the main product of the Gegauf works for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>In 1895 the greater part of the convent was destroyed by fire - and with it the embroidery shop and the workshop. Luckily, among the few items that could be saved was the prototype of the hemstitch sewing machine. Immediately after the fire the workshops were re-established in a barn and equipped with more machinery, so that in future more hemstitch machines could be produced, alongside the embroidery machines.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, about 70 to 80 people were employed in the workshop - it had become a small factory. Karl Friedrich Gegauf was the technical director and his brother Georg looked after the commercial side. The hemstitch machines soon found a wide market and were also being exported. The term "gegaufing" came to be used for the mechanical production of hemstitching. Gegauf's great interest and skill for all kinds of mechanical equipment were evident not only in his inventions and his workshops, which were well equipped for those times.</p>
<p>In the 1890s he astonished the local inhabitants with a pennyfarthing bicycle, and a few years later he was to be seen in his <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimler_Benz_ba7a.html" title="Daimler Benz">Daimler Benz</a> motor car, with the number plate TG 1, driving through the streets of Steckborn and along the lakeside. He also made use of the car's engine to power a fruit press, and down at the lake, his remarkable boat could be seen with a steam boiler mounted on it to provide the power.</p>
<p>However, the upward trend in the fortunes of the Gegauf brothers' enterprise during the first decade of the twentieth century was to be interrupted by two significant events. Following the outbreak of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, no <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machines.html" title="Sewing machines">sewing machines</a> could be exported to foreign customers, which meant that the company had to find other more suitable articles to manufacture. And then in 1917, in the middle of a very difficult period, Georg Gegauf died as the result of an accident. Karl Friedrich decided to continue with his own plans and in 1919 he established new workshops in the "Neue Schloss" in Steckborn, while his late brother's family continued to run operations in the "Grüne Haus", which was also in Steckborn.</p>
<p>Within a few years of the war ending, connections with old customers had been re-established, and contacts with new ones set up, both at home and abroad. Order books filled up, and the production of side-lines — such as thousands of tin-openers — could be discontinued. On 31 March 1919, Karl Friedrich's son Fritz was granted a patent for a new hemstitch sewing machine, and the company's future seemed assured.</p>
<p>However, a development in the textile industry began to pose a threat for the hemstitch <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machine.html" title="Sewing machine">sewing machine</a>. Artificial <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silk.html" title="Silk">silk</a> had started to establish itself, and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Rayon.html" title="Rayon">rayon</a> jersey and other knitted textiles became fashionable, and these were poorly suited to hemstitching.</p>
<p>At first, it did not look as if the rise of artificial silk would be any disadvantage to the factory in the "Neue Schloss" - quite the contrary in fact. In 1923 an artificial silk factory was set up on the site of the Feldbach Convent, and began production the following year. Karl Friedrich was invited to tour the establishment and soon began to wonder how certain operations that were carried out manually could be mechanised. Among other procedures, the hanks of thread had to be tied up into skeins before they went into the dye-plant, a process known in German as "fitzen". Within a few weeks, drawings had been made for a machine that would carry out this operation. The artificial silk factory showed great interest in this device, and Karl Friedrich began to set up a workshop to produce the so called "fitzmachines". Unfortunately, before the first machine had been assembled, its inventor died. That was on the 13th December, 1926.</p>
<p>His sons Fritz and Gustav continued to run the company, and delivered the first "fitz" machine to the artificial silk factory on 27th July, 1927. The machine proved a success, and orders for more came in, the factory in the "Neue Schloss" soon proving too small deal with production of both the hemstitch sewing machines and the "fitzmachines", which weighed over a ton.</p>
<p>Thus in 1928/29, a new factory came into being on the site of the present-day Bernina works, and operations commenced on 5 April 1929.</p>
<p>But the demand for the "fitz" and reeling machines lasted only a few years, and by 1931 the future did not look good, for in fact an economic crisis had begun on that "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Friday_29ef.html" title="Black Friday">Black Friday</a>" in October, 1929.</p>
<p>Demand for hemstitch machines had fallen more and more, and in the course of 1931 new methods of producing artificial silk had made the "fitz" and reeling machines redundant.</p>
<p>Suddenly the new factory in Feldbach had too little work for its skilled labour force and its new machinery. The number of employees had fallen to 35, and even some of these were laid off from time to time.</p>
<p>A new product was urgently needed - but what?</p>
<p>At that time, about 20,000 <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machines.html" title="Sewing machines">sewing machines</a> were being imported annually, mainly from <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Why not produce these in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>? Why not in Steckborn? The company had experience in this specialised area, and a good reputation in the trade. And 20 000 units a year was quite a market.</p>

<p>With the support of Wilhelm Brutsh, a <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machine.html" title="Sewing machine">sewing machine</a> specialist who would take over the retail side, Fritz Gegauf decided to go into manufacturing domestic <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machines.html" title="Sewing machines">sewing machines</a>; he would build a robust, solid, simple model; not in huge quantities, but a Swiss quality product that would be able to stand comparison with the well-known names already on the market.</p>
<p>As the future would show, this decision proved to be of tremendous significance for the company, and indeed for the whole region, but it would hardly have led to the success that it eventually brought about had it not been for the energy, the farsightedness and the tireless creativity of Fritz Gegauf.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>1932</b> the first model of a domestic sewing machine was fully developed. It was given the trade-name Bernina and went into small-scale production. It received considerable attention, for it was a good machine, and it began to sell. The first decisive step towards the production of Bernina domestic <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machines.html" title="Sewing machines">sewing machines</a> had been taken, and the principle of concentrating on a quality product had proved to be correct. The principle of quality was to remain the company's policy, even though the product changed year by year with advances in technology, and the machines became better and better. Soon Bernina had established a place for itself among the very best of domestic sewing machines, but the long-lasting economic crisis and the start of the Second World War prevented any very rapid expansion.</li>
<li><b>1947</b> Gustav Gegauf retired from the company, and the firm changed from being Fritz Gegauf s Sons to Fritz Gegauf Limited.</li>
<li><b>1950</b> Fritz Gegauf Limited took over the retailing of Bernina sewing machines in <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.</li>
<li><b>1954</b> the first model of the 530 Class came off the production line, offering in addition to the usual Bernina advantages new decorative stitches and a button-hole device. From 1963 onwards the subsequent model, the 730, was produced and in the same year, the Bernina <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewing_machine.html" title="Sewing machine">sewing machine</a> was manufactured. The top-seller of all the Bernina models was the 830 class, which came into production in 1971 and continued until 1981.</li>
<li><b>1980</b>, Fritz Gegauf died, at the age of 87. He had been a pioneer of industry, and the present-day size and the reputation of the Bernina Sewing Machine Factory are due to him. He was an entrepreneur in the best sense of the word, showing skill and intuition in development, manufacturing, sales and finance. His guidance and leadership over the years had prepared the way for his successors, and his daughter Odette Ueltschi-Gegauf took over from him as head of the company so that the business would continue true to the family's tradition.</li>
<li><b>1981</b> Bernina took a further step in the development of household sewing machines. The class 930 was born. At this time, Bernina was manufacturing 140000 sewing machines a year and the company had grown in size to around 1100 employees. After the tremendous success of the Bernina 930, Fritz Gegauf ventured into a new age. In 1986, the Steckborn company introduced its first fully electronic sewing machine on to the market, the Bernina 1130. The most advanced electronic features were incorporated in this top model, simplifying many sewing functions, e. g. a fully automatic buttonhole device, but in doing so, the traditional Bernina high quality was retained.</li>
<li><b>1988</b> Hanspeter Ueltschi took over the running of the company from his mother. He is the fourth generation to continue the family tradition.</li>
<li><b>1990</b> Bernina established its own factory in Thailand for the production of sewing machine parts.</li>
<li><b>1992</b> Odette Ueltschi died unexpectedly at the age of 71.</li>
<li><b>2000</b> A thunderstorm turned a little creek into a raging current and flooded the whole cellar system of the BERNINA factory.</li>
<li><b>2003</b> BERNINA introduced the new artista generation. With color touch-screen, access to the internet and features that go far beyond expectations. Driven as the world's first sewing system by Microsoft <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_CE_9235.html" title="Windows CE">Windows CE</a>.</li>
