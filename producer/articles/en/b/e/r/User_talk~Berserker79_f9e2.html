<p>Hello...</p>
<p>You showed an interest in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sentinel_%28TV_series%29_e599.html" title="The Sentinel (TV series)">The Sentinel (TV series)</a> by editting the page. I have recently editted the page to add episodes and to tidy up the characters. All of the work I did was reverted by the original author of the page, and I can not understand why this person refuses to see the good work that was done just because I use html over wiki code. I use html because it is what I know and it allows me a lot more control of the content that I add. The link to the work that I did on the page is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Sentinel_%28TV_series%29&amp;oldid=38987518" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Sentinel_%28TV_series%29&amp;oldid=38987518" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Expand or keep old bios... That's a good question. The whole reworking of WC articles on Wikipedia has been to some extent a study in minimalism: characters, ships, etc only get individual pages if they 1) appear in more than one game or novel (Blair, the Tarawa, etc) or 2) are really, really notable (the Excalibur, arguably the Dragon). Having said that, I too like the older, larger bios. Hmm... We've been doing most of our discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/n/Talk%7EWing_Commander_%28computer_game%29_4626.html" title="Talk:Wing Commander (computer game)">Talk:Wing Commander (computer game)</a>, so if I were you I'd bring it up there. I've ended up being sort of the arbiter (because I've been doing most of the <i>work!</i> *rolleyes*) but I'd rather not be in that position. (The talk page also has a list of redlinks for characters, novels, games etc that we don't have articles on, if you're feeling patriotic. &#160;;) ) <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarblespire_61cf.html" title="User:Marblespire">Marblespire</a> 22:02, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So far, it looks fine to me... The thing is, I've never read <i>False Colors</i>, so I can't give you a textual analysis of "No, don't include that; no, you should include this"; I can only tell you that, so far, the summary looks like it has an appropriate amount of detail.

<p>Hi there Berserker. In response to a recent post on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_F.E.A.R._characters_%26_organizations_d5d4.html" title="Talk:List of F.E.A.R. characters &amp; organizations">Talk:List of F.E.A.R. characters &amp; organizations</a> page, I have a decidedly better screenshot than the current one. However, I have no idea how to upload and license it.</p>
<p>I hate to constantly rely on other people, so I was wondering if you could tell me how to do it myself. I have tried to read the pages on Fair Use and such, but it's all a bit complex and rather confusing from a novice's perspective. Perhaps you could take a little time out of your day to teach me? I understand very much if you cannot. Cheers. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelta759_0b5c.html" title="User:Delta759">Delta</a> 01:27, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there Berserker. As you might have noticed, over the past month or so I haven't contributed terribly to the F.E.A.R. articles and such. I have been away at a camp and haven't had much time for sleep, much less editing on Wikipedia. Right now camp has ended, so I'll have a bit more time to edit, but adverse weather (i.e. heat above 85 degrees Fahrenheit) may cause my computer to shut down. Hopefully you can see now why I wasn't always there. See you around! <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelta759_0b5c.html" title="User:Delta759">Delta</a> 12:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, I mean the MobyGames watermarks at the bottom right and left of the image. If you intend for it to be a FA, the images should be sourced and have a fair use rationale (see <a href="../../../h/a/l/Image%7EHalobox.jpg_f422.html" title="Image:Halobox.jpg">Image:Halobox.jpg</a> for an example). The other image you mentioned is good, but has no source URL, and would be brought up in either a peer review or FAC. You could use this image if you want to: <a href="http://www.gametab.com/pc/fear/2719/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gametab.com/pc/fear/2719/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderbrand_4de8.html" title="User:Thunderbrand">Thunderbrand</a> 14:21, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think even if you properly source it, it still is watermarked (and the <a href="../../../c/v/g/WP%7ECVG_903f.html#Screenshots_and_cover_art" title="WP:CVG">CVG project</a> says not to upload watermarked images). I, personally, do not upload them and believe they look unprofessional. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderbrand_4de8.html" title="User:Thunderbrand">Thunderbrand</a> 16:03, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Berserker, long time no see. Just wondering where that peer review that we had a while back was. I guess they must've moved it or deleted it. Perhaps we could get another one?

<p>The section on media references is also a pain. I considered removing it, but it may be workable. I haven't paid extremely close attention to that section yet.</p>
<p>My editing on the article has mainly just been for kicks up until now, but I'd gladly get serious and help you get it to GA or FA status. As a newer game with a smaller fanbase than <i>Halo</i>, it shouldn't take as long as that article did. It's already in "ok" shape, which is a plus. The real trick is that I've never thoroughly played the game, so I avoid the plot section. Still, I'd be glad to seriously work on it. My Wikibreak was nearly finished, anyway. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 20:15, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Media references might just need to be cut. After giving it a read, it looks like patent <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. Even adding sources couldn't change that. And the box art issue has been taken care of. Sometimes it takes awhile for Wikipedia to fully register that a new image version has been uploaded, so you might have missed it. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 20:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I don't think that would work without a reliable source, and good luck finding one of those on something that would normally be stuck in "trivia" sections. If you can (again, good luck), then by all means, it should be included. Otherwise, it's original research and should be left out. I'll just leave it be until you're done searching for reliable sources. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 09:10, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The first one has some nice info in it, but the second one's purpose is pretty obscure. I get the feeling that some of the first one's stuff could be found at a more reliable source, however, and most, if not all, of it would be best suited to a "development" section, once it gets created. I believe MobyGames follows a system similar to Wikipedia's, so I'm not sure if that would count as a reliable source. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 08:36, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks, it's nice to know that I'm helping a fellow editor and improving Wikipedia at the same time. I find that working on articles from top to bottom, ignoring most things until I reach them, works pretty well for me. In other words, I won't be worrying about the media references section for awhile yet. I get the feeling that "development" is going to take awhile, particularly. The "Making of..." documentary in the Director's Edition would probably help, but I don't have access to it, meaning that I may miss some critical details that aren't covered elsewhere. If you could provide any assistance on that subject, it would be greatly appreciated. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 12:49, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Those should help. I'll start digging around in them and see what I can find. <b>Extending my comment a bit:</b> Unfortunately, I didn't really find anything that could help. There was the bit about <i>F.E.A.R.</i>'s way of "leaving questions unanswered" and "keeping you guessing" to make the experience scarier, but that's already in the Atmosphere section and referenced to much-more-easily accessed text. The other stuff I found was just non-notable development trivia. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 15:08, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks, and thank <i>you</i> for watching the documentary. If there isn't any solid info in there, the "Add to development section" item on the to-do list may as well be stricken out. As to your questions, standard practice with manual citations is just using it in general, instead of specific pages. As for the game's script, I've been digging with no luck, as well. I'm beginning to wonder if it even exists (which would thoroughly complicate matters). I took a quick glance at the first paragraph of the plot section when I stuck that last item in. It appeared to be written in in-universe style, and in need of a copyedit. The section on the whole may not be like that, so maybe I should switch it to "tidy up the plot section". <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyBlackwing_9d7b.html" title="User:JimmyBlackwing">JimmyBlackwing</a> 12:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

It needs a bit of copyediting (begininng -&gt; beginning, for example), but that can be done at another point.

<p>Hi there Berserker! I am interested in helping out with the editing and would definitely like to give it a try. It sounds pretty straight forward and I'll try to get the dialogues to you ASAP. <s>However, I have but one queston: I'd like to know where I can download the F.E.A.R. SDK. I found one with a size of about 82 MB, but I do not know where the 600 MB one is.</s> Nevermind, the one I downloaded is working fine. I'm getting started on it right now and I'll try to get it to you as I have free time. My only remaining question is this: Would you like me to send it to you/upload them in chunks or as a whole? Thanks! <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelta759_0b5c.html" title="User:Delta759">Delta</a> 13:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I've transcribed them all onto notepad and I'll just copy and paste them here:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>There was an uprising. Fettel has taken command of the prototypes. (15003)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This wacko's name is Paxton Fettel. He's the key. If we contain him, we contain the situation. (15007)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What's his story? (15011)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Property of Armacham Technology Corporation. They're working on a military contract to develop an army of clones that respond to a psychic commander. Top secret, of course. Fettel was one of the commanders. (15012)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A battalion? What're we supposed to do against a thousand super soldiers? (15016)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Like I said, we put Fettel down and it's over. Fortunately the whole point of the program is to give commanders first hand knowledge of the battlefield without putting them in danger. That means we should be able to corner the bastard without having to wade through all those soldiers. (15017)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do we find him? (15018)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That's easy. He's got a transmitter embedded in his head that'll lead us right to him. (15019)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well, this confirms the point of Perseus was to train telepathic commanders to work with cloned soldiers, although Paxton Fettel was the only commander of the program. The weird thing is they refer to him as the second prototype. (15596)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here's some more info about Fettel: he's developed as part of a project called Origin. It says the first prototype didn't work out, Fettel was the second, and there was never a third. They just pulled the plug a few years after he was born. (15597)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More info on Origin: the genetic reference they used for the program was apparently a powerful psychic. Makes sense. If you want a telepathic commander, you need a telepath. And it was a woman. Says here she gave live birth to the prototypes. Seems Wade wasn't convinced the psychic characteristics were genetic. He figured there was better chance they'd be passed along if the fetus gestated inside the subject. So they put her in a coma, made her carry a genetically engineered baby to term, then induced labor. That's pretty fucking sick. (15645)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I figured out what a synchronicity event is. There was an incident when they lost control of Fettel, he just suddenly started freaking out. He was only about ten years old at the time, but I guess he killed a few people. In the investigation, they discovered that there had been a telepathic link between Fettel and Alma even though she was in a coma. They concluded that she was influencing him. That's must've been why they pulled the plug on Origin. (15646)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It's starting to make sense. They name of the woman they used for Origin is Alma. That's who Fettel's looking for. (15873)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are brothers, you and I. (14654)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You and I were born from the same mother. (14828)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I-I'm not finished wiping these drives. I need more time! (14692)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oh Jesus. She was just a kid. Says here Alma was eight years old when Origin started up. They used a little girl. No wonder they're so fucking anxious to keep a lid on this mess. Somebody's gonna burn for this. (15876)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Senator. It's Genevieve Aristide. I just wanted to assure you that the Origin situation has been resolved. (15570)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>But so much for discretion. (15571)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It was unavoidable. There is some good news, however: the first prototype was a complete success. (15572)</li>
</ul>

<dd>Hey Berserker! It's been a while. How're things going? I hope you are well. I'm simply dropping by because I noticed on the <a href="../../../f/2E/e/F.E.A.R._f9a3.html" title="F.E.A.R.">F.E.A.R.</a> "To-Do" list, the "citing of the game's script" was <i>mostly</i> done. I would like to finish it up and am more than willing to help out in any way I can. Just leave me a message if you need any help with anything at all.

<dd>Greetings, Berserker! Well, I've added the last three references. I'd like to ask you to check over my work, As I'm not completely sure it's in the right format. As for the last reference, I do believe that it's necessary, as it adds on how Alma still survives. I added it sepereately from the others so it's easier to revert/remove.
