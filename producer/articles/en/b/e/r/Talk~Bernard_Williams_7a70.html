<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/r/Talk%7EBernard_Williams_7a70.html" title="Edit section: Inline lists">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inline lists</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Williams_7e42.html" title="Bernard Williams">Bernard Williams</a> History is getting a bit complicated, and especially with the slowness of the servers today I may be getting it wrong, but I think Taxman changed a rather long and cumbersome parenthetic list to a footnote, and Slim reverted him. I'd like to weigh in on the footnote issue.<br />
OK, there are three possible ways of doing the "extensive inline reference", the mention by name and year of what BW's works of the 70s„80s were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having the list inline like Slim wrote it. Advantage: the reader gets told, immediately and at a glance, what the works were. Disadvantage: flow is interrupted by a long, heavy inline ref.</li>
<li>Having neither list nor footnote. Advantage: no interruption. Disadvantage: the reader has to go to the foot of the page to learn what the works were (the list of works by BW is chronological, so they're admittedly easy to find once you have scrolled down).</li>
<li>Having a footnote like Taxman did it. Disadvantage 1: it interrupts flow. While footnote numbers in the text are visually small, academic writers tend to agree that they interrupt and distract a lot. I'll find a quote about that, if you like. Disadvantage 2: the reader still has to go to the foot of the page to learn what the works were, by clicking on the footnote number. Disadvantage 3: having the same info twice at the foot of the page (immediately adjacent, yet) doesn't look...well, elegant. Smart. Trim. None of those.</li>
</ol>
<p>I strongly recommend choosing one of the first two options, according to which advantage/disadvantage is thought to be the weightiest. (Personally I'd go with 2 any day of the week.) Option 3 doesn't have any advantages, as far as I can see. I hope you don't think I mean to be mean, Taxman, or unappreciative of the good work you do on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>, I just think footnotes are overrated. They're unwelcoming to unacademic readers, for one thing. Sometimes they're the best or only way to go, but IMO you need to consider, for each individual footnote, whether it's worth teasing the reader into looking at the foot of the page. Nothing breaks flow more effectively than that.--[[User:Bishonen|<a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">(talk)</a>]] 00:20, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bishonen. the inline references regarding the works of the 70s and 80s were there as part of the text i.e. I intended them to be part of the paragraph, not just a citation, if you see what I mean. The only reason I did that was that Taxman insisted I find a quote to support the claim that Kantianism was the main rival to utilitarianism. I felt no quote was necessary, because this is a fact no moral philosopher would dispute. However, I went off in search of a quote. I found one in the Nussbaum obit of Williams. She talked about how his works of the 70s and 80s (and she named the books) demolished the . . . I can't recall the phrase . . . two opposing ideologies of Kantianism and utilitarianism, or something like that. My own view is that the paragraph was better without that, and without the references. But once you mention the works of the 70s and 80s, I felt I had to say which ones upfront, and not, as you say, make the reader wander off to a footnote. Not all Williams' works of the 70s and 80s were about Kantianism and utilitarianism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I've written academic papers, I always have footnotes, not inline references, but that's because there are so many citations, the text looks silly with them inside it; and they're being read by other academics, who are often footnote-obsessed. But in Wikipedia articles, which are always relatively short, and where the citations are few in number (even in well-referenced articles), I personally see no harm in having the citations in the text. It's easier for the reader, and the purpose of Wikipedia is to be read. But really I don't mind which is done, so long as it's consistent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The thing I definitely don't agree with is the no-short-paragraphs and no-one-sentence-paragraphs rule. Sometimes short and one-sentence paras are necessary. Often they are elegant. Often they make the most sense. Often they are easy on the eye. Professional writers are usually taught that short is good. I do feel that the Bernard Williams article was improved by merging the paragraphs, because I have a tendency to write in too-short paragraphs, and overdo it. But speaking generally, there is no rule against short or one-sentence paragraphs, and I feel Featured Article candidates shouldn't be told there is. I should stress that this isn't meant as a dig at Taxman, just constructive criticism and dialogue. I've discussed with another editor the possibility of writing a Wikipedia page about this to perhaps lay out how many paragraphs introductions should consist of; how long paragraphs should be, and so on. Perhaps if we get that going, I can let you and Taxman know, and you can both weigh in. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 01:43, Dec 9, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To the anonymous editor, I reverted your changes because the Wikipedia guideline is that articles written in one style of English should not randomly be changed to another style by a later editor. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 02:55, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The change was not random. Wikipedia policy is that articles should be written in the form of English spoken in the country relevant to the article. This is a British English topic (because it is about a British philosopher) so should be written in British English.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The rule against arbitrary changes only applies where there is no one form of English appropriate to an article. In that case you go with the form of English used by the article's first editors.</dd>

</dl>
<p>I don't agree. Please show me where it says that. The only thing I know of is a guideline suggesting that, if an article is about something inherently British, it should not be written with American spelling and vice versa. So the British Labour Party should never be written "labor". But otherwise, the policy is that articles should be continued in the style started by the first major contributer. <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, for example, is written in British English, because it was a British person who started it, even though it is about an American issue. As for Williams being British, he was born and worked in the UK, but he also worked in America, and was an academic there when he died. I don't think he saw himself as tied to any particular nationality.</p>
<p>I created the stub for this, I wrote the entire article, I took it alone through the featured article nomination process. At that point, several other editors (from different countries) joined in the editing process, and the version you currently see is as a result of that consensus. Then it was made a featured article. You cannot come along as one anonymous editor after the fact and change that entire consensus, and I hope you would not try to. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 05:14, Jan 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think you can seriously suggest that Williams was American. He was born in England, lived most of his life there, had British citizenship and bore a Knighthood.

<dd>The use of non-US forms of English on Wikipedia means a lot to some of us but the large majority of American Wikipedians means that we cannot rely on the "first major contributor" rule to protect it. There needs to be a realm reserved for British English (or other relevant dialects) only. This realm comprises a pretty small number of articles already.

<p>Albion, you'll have to show me the policy or guideline you're referring to, then we can discuss it. The only thing I know is that if something is inherently American, say, then British English should not be used to describe it. The key is the word "inherently". Like the U.S. Defense Intelligence Dept, or the British Labour Party. Bernard Williams is just a person, not an institution. I'm not attempting reduce anyone's realm, and I do take your point about BE being important to you, but can you take my point about <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a> attacks being written in British English, even though that is an American event? No one has tried to change that so far as I know, so it does work both ways. Someone tried to change <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Turing_37ec.html" title="Alan Turing">Alan Turing</a> to American English the other day, and I changed it back, not because Turing was British (that was an added reason) but because the article had been started in British English.

<dd>Hi again Albion, I feel I was a bit harsh the other day over the American/British English thing, so I have changed Bernard Williams to British English for you. There wasn't in fact much to change. On The 19th when you wrote, the article was the featured article on the main page, and spent the day being vandalized, which is why I was a bit tetchy with you, for which I apologize. As the issue matters to you, I have changed it. I did retain universalize, rather than universalise, as the former is also used in England (Oxford style), and I very much prefer it, but other than that, any American spelling I spotted has been changed and if I spot any others in future readings, I'll change those too. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 10:17, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi David, Williams wrote a well-known paper in 1980 called "Internal and External Reasons", in which he argued that there are only internal reasons for action. You can find an account of his argument <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=cache:l18phgmQP38J:www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/STAFF/Internal_Reasons.pdf+%22bernard+williams%22+%22internal+reasons%22&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=cache:l18phgmQP38J:www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/STAFF/Internal_Reasons.pdf+%22bernard+williams%22+%22internal+reasons%22&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>I am the anonymous editor. I deleted "analytic" because I have always understood the division between analytic and continental philosophy to have begun after Kant--there was no distinction before him. The wikipedia article on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analytic_philosophy.html" title="Analytic philosophy">analytic philosophy</a> is even more particular, essentially restricting it to the 20th century. I object to "This was a question few Western analytic philosophers had explored since the Greeks" because it implies an anachronism--that there were analytic philosophers between the Greeks and Kant (or worse, between the Greeks and Frege, according to the wikipedia article). Perhaps it would be better to remove the sentence entirely. --Iridius 09:01, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I see what you mean. Perhaps instead of deleting "analytic," it would make more sense to say "a question few Western analytic philosophers had explored"? The point I'm trying to make is Williams' approach was unusual by analytic standards.

<p>I'm slightly worried that Williams is presented as having a (relatively) easily distinguishable moral approach. The one thing that I'd say most philosophers agree on (aside from his cleverness and capacity for – possibly inadvertent – cruelty) is that he was extremnely good at criticising other people's moral positions and arguments, but almost impossible to pin down with regard to hiw own view. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 14:39, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought I'd managed to convey that without getting into specifics. I took the piece through the featured article process, and I guessed it would fail if too detailed, so it's written in very general terms. Also, other editors sometimes object if a biography has too much of the subject's ideas in it, rather than in a separate article. But I felt that phrases like him being a good synthesist, taking us back to the Greeks, leaving a philosophy for real lives being lived in difficult circumstances and so on, signalled that he was hard to pin down. By the way, there have been a few recent edits that I haven't looked at, so there may be turns of phrase in there that I can't be blamed for.

<p>There was a sentence in the article reading:</p>
<p>"However, Margaret Thatcher's first administration put paid to the liberal agenda on sex, and almost put paid to Williams as well, who was not asked to chair another public committee for almost 15 years."</p>
<p>As an American, I stumbled over this sentence. I decided to change it to:</p>
<p>"However, Margaret Thatcher's first administration <b>put an end</b> to the liberal agenda on sex, and <b>nearly put an end to Williams' political career</b> as well; he was not asked to chair another public committee for almost 15 years."</p>
<p>Is this in violation of your current debate over the British English? I think the British English is fine to preserve -- as long as it does not cause confusion among American readers. An expression like "put paid," meaning "ended" or "resolved" is likely to confuse almost all American readers. I hope such a simple change as mine which brings about a universal comprehension would not be looked on disfavorably.</p>

<dd>It's worth noting, though, that the anon. editor is confusing his or her knowledge with American usage in general (always a danger in such a linguistically diverse nation). "Put paid to" is common in the U.S. (it appears in the <i>The American Heritage® Dictionary of Idioms</i> in fact<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/put-paid-to" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/put-paid-to" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>); I've often read it in American novels and (less often) in academic works. A quick Google will indicate its wide usage.</dd>
<dd>Being on Wikipedia has alerted me to this mistake, which I've often made myself; for example, I would have sworn that "theatre" was wholly un-American (as it were), but I've been assured (and been given proof) that it is in fact quite common in parts (geographical and social) of the U.S. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:15, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think that "theatre" is mostly an affectation, imitating British and French spellings. "Olde", "Shoppe", and "Pointe" are somewhat common too, if you include subdivision names and retail stores. I don't hear anyone using "put paid".

<p>Well, yes — you're doing it too. It's a natural response; we tend to assume that our idiolects are in fact standard. I've been told with great authority that in modern English we don't pronounce the "t" in "often" — this by people who seem not to notice that I do pronounce the "t", as do roughly half the population (it's partly a regional thing). The U.S. detective novels that I read (yes, my guilty secret) aren't being affected when they use "put paid to", any more than those whose usage reflects the lingering of the original (pre-Webster?) spelling of "theatre". It's all part of life's rich tapestry. (Interestingly, I asked around, and most people I spoke to assumed that "put paid to" was an Americanism. it probably isn't, but I've not been able to track down its origin yet.)

<p>This page has obviously gotten a lot of work--I thought I'd screen some ideas before changing anything.</p>
<p>First, it's misleading to say that Williams advocates a "self-interested" ethical theory. This aligns him with the ethical egoism assumed by some work in economics -- a view which couldn't be further from his. On the contrary, Williams (following Aristotle) stressed that we can and should care about others <i>for their own sake</i>. He just thought that such concerns have to flower out of an individual's psychology, not from some transcendent external realm, like Kant's pure reason.</p>
<p>Second, I don't know what the Guardian article said, but the paragraph on <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> gets it wrong. I don't think Williams even mentions Derrida in that book--certainly he doesn't discuss him at any length. And while one of his goals is to refute "deniers" like Richard Rorty, he cares just as much about refuting realists and reductionists. <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> doesn't take sides so much as carve out a subtle middle ground.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, it's wrong to say that Williams was "far from" a moral relativist. As one obituary (New York Times?) said, his discussions of relativism are so subtle, it's sometimes hard to make out his own position. Many, including Martha Nussbaum, list him as a target in their attacks on relativism. We could fix this up by saying something like "Williams stressed that we can only work from within a certain culture and within a certain moral point of view. Some critics took this to show that he was a relativist, but Williams insisted that philosphy can uncover significant universal truths about human beings (even if these always must be filled in historically); likewise we can pronounce confidently about ethics: he believed, with..."</p>
<p>Also, his expression is "thick," rather than "fat," ethical concepts.</p>
<p>Finally, it would be nice to say a bit more about his nonmoral philosphy (although I'm no expert in it). His book on Descartes, for example, made a lot of waves in the philosphical community.</p>
<p>If you're agreeable, I'll get to work on all this.

<dd>Please do go ahead. I await your improvements with interest. I've just looked in <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i>, and you're right that the index doesn't mention Derrida. <i>The Guardian</i> article quoted says:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"With his eye for non-academic significance, Williams latterly tackled the contemporary relativist tendency to undermine the notion of truth. His last book, <i>Truth And Truthfulness</i> (2002) analyses the way Richard Rorty, Derrida and other followers of politically correct Foucaultian fashion sneer at any purported truth as ludicrously naive because it is, inevitably, distorted by power, class bias and ideology. It explores "the tension between the pursuit of truthfulness and the doubt that there is (really) any truth to be found", and, unusually for a philosophy book, it makes the reader laugh aloud or want to cry."</dd>

<p>That is a really misleading summary of Truth and Truthfulness: Williams' discussion of what he calls the Critical Theory Principle actually expresses rather a lot of sympathy with the idea that what are purported to be truths are distorted by power, class bias and ideology. It'd be better to describe it as an attempt to give a naturalistic genealogy of the virtues of truthfulness (or something conveying that, but less wordily). Also, it's not his last book any more, with the three posthumous publications. If no-one else wants to, I'll have a go over the weekendRobJubb 00:10, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By all means have a go at it, Rob, but you'll need to supply sources for your edits; also, please don't remove sourced material.

<p>Why shouldn't I remove sourced material if it's misleading - from the blurb of 'Truth and Truthfulness', available on the Princeton University Press page, for example, "Williams approach, in the tradition of Nietzsche's genealogy, blends philosophy, history and a fictional account of how the human concern with truth might have arisen... Truth and Truthfulness presents a powerful challenge to the fashionable belief that truth has no value, but equally to the traditional faith that truth guarantees itself" which rather gives the lie to the idea that it is solely about Derrida et al, as implied by what you changed it back to - and why did you take out the reference to the three posthumous publications, two of which appear in the list of works at the end of the article? If you'd prefer, I'll just quote the blurbs - including those of the three new books - rather than change it back to what I originally wroteRobJubb 00:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You removed material from the Guardian, which is misleading in your opinion, but we simply publish what reliable sources say, and the Guardian is a reliable source. If you like, you can add what some other reliable source has said for balance.

<p>Fine. Sod it. You want to have misleading material because it comes from a reliable source - why a newspaper - not a literary or philosophical periodical, but a newspaper - counts as a reliable source on philosophy, I don't know - fine.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, we want to have material that is sourced, and not just your opinion. Please review our content policies. Also, it would help if you would read articles before editing them; the posthumous material is, as I said above, already mentioned. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fine. How about this:</p>
<p>Williams' last finished book, <i>Truth And Truthfulness: An Essay In Genealogy</i> (2002), attempts to defend a non-foundationalist attachment to the values of truth, which Williams identifies as accuracy and sincerity, by giving a vindicatory naturalistic genealogy of them. The debt to Nietzsche is again clear, most obviously in the adoption of a genealogical method as a tool of explanation and critique. Although as The Guardian noted in its obituary of Williams, describing the book as an examination of those who "sneer at any purported truth as ludicrously naive because it is, inevitably, distorted by <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_%28sociology%29.html" title="Power (sociology)">power</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">class</a> bias and <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a>"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, part of Williams' intention was to attack those who he felt denied the value of truth, the book's blurb cautions that to understand it simply in that sense would be to miss part of its purpose: it "presents a... challenge" to both "the fashionable belief that truth has no value" and "the traditional faith that [truth's] value guarantees itself"<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to put references in, so that reference might not work, but the link is good. I'm sorry about the snark: I just find it very frustrating that, having actually read the book, that can be used as a summary of it. I also realise the posthumous stuff really doesn't help my case, but, really, I struggle to think how anyone could see that as a sensible or objective summary of 'Truth and Truthfulness'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But this is your argument. We need someone else's argument. Do you have source for:</dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Williams' last finished book, <i>Truth And Truthfulness: An Essay In Genealogy</i> (2002), attempts to defend a non-foundationalist attachment to the values of truth, which Williams identifies as accuracy and sincerity, by giving a vindicatory naturalistic genealogy of them.

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"the book's blurb cautions that to understand it simply in that sense would be to miss part of its purpose ...": does the book's blurb actually say that?

<p>for the first:</p>
<p>"Williams's approach, in the tradition of Nietzsche's genealogy, blends philosophy, history, and a fictional account of how the human concern with truth might have arisen. Without denying that we should worry about the contingency of much that we take for granted, he defends truth as an intellectual objective and a cultural value. He identifies two basic virtues of truth, Accuracy and Sincerity, the first of which aims at finding out the truth and the second at telling it" (from the blurb)</p>
<p>also (this does for the second, too, I'd guess):</p>
<p>"Truth and Truthfulness presents a powerful challenge to the fashionable belief that truth has no value, but equally to the traditional faith that its value guarantees itself" (from the blurb again)</p>
<p>I think the Nietzsche claim, and the anti-foundationalist one, are reasonably well justified by those (reading "the traditional faith that its value guarantees itself" as foundationalist, which seems reasonable to me). The vindicatory naturalistic genealogy is the fictional account. By all means change the style: it's a bit awkward and almost certainly over-wordy, but please keep the meaningRobJubb 17:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see that, under the guise of 'restoring deleted material' you have deleted all the changes I made (as well as the assertion, perfectly truthful, that Williams early in his career worked on Personal Identity). I'll be reverting that thenRobJubb 21:23, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course Williams made his name working on the concept of personal identity. Bizarrely there doesnt seem to be any mention of it in the article - although I've just now added a somewhat clumsy sentence to the intro. Williams is still probably most known, at least among english undergraduates, for writing about brain swaps and the reincarnation of guy fawkes. Avaya1 14:22, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
