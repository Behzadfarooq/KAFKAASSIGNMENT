Bertie was not educated in/by UCD- attending a few lectures there given by other bodies would be the extent of it. Nor is he a qualified (Chartered,Certified etc) Accountant [unsigned]</p>
<p>The anonymous contributor is correct. Bertie was not educated at UCD. He just attended a few lectures there. (Following his standard, I have visited the Tower of London so obviously I am King of England!). The lies were finally exposed in Ireland some time ago and his website withdrew them, saying it was all a misunderstanding! Yes indeed. Whoever wrote it misunderstood what the truth is! <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>Ã‰IREANN</b></i></font></font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Ireland coa.png">Image:Ireland coa.png</a>\<sup><font color="blue"><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(caint)</a> 23:25, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</font></sup></p>
<p>Don't know about the UCD claim, but I remember the same question arising with respect to the LSE. It is pretty peculiar to state in someone's biography that they "claim to have been educated at ....". It would be better to remove the "claim" until someone can confirm it is true. There are a number of sources which suggest it is not true, eg. <a href="http://www.limerick-leader.ie/issues/20011208/feehily.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.limerick-leader.ie/issues/20011208/feehily.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> [unsigned]</p>
<p>I think Bertie Ahern was actually born in Cork and family subsequently moved to Dublin. He is therefore a Corkonian.--<a href="../../../e/w/a/User%7EEwanduffy_5461.html" title="User:Ewanduffy">Ewanduffy</a> 19:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The quotes section would be much enhanced if somebody can locate his famous (to me, anyway) quote from a Hot Press interview (must have been the late 80s) regarding his drinking, wherein he said something along the lines that he would be all right to drive after 8 pints of Bass (his favourite tipple of the time). For a while after Hot Press referred to him as Bertie "Mine's a gallon of Bass" Ahern. <a href="../../../b/o/w/User%7EBowsie_Jnr_79d6.html" title="User:Bowsie Jnr">Bowsie Jnr</a> 12:16, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Like all good irishmen &lt;sic!&gt;, Bertie likes his pints or two. But i though he didn't drink during lent,Ror (<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERor_ea65.html" title="User talk:Ror">talk</a>&#160;â€¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ror_f62f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ror">contribs</a>) changed it to November when he abstains from the drink. I dont recall where i hearing it, and with a lack of source, i was pretty sure that it was lent, it would make more sense for it to be over lent as opposed to november anyway. Anyhow, i am going to refrain from chaning it back till either i can find a source, or some one backs it up. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothy443_59af.html" title="User:Boothy443">Boothy443</a> | <a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothy443_50e2.html" title="User talk:Boothy443">trÃ¡cht ar</a> 06:23, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi. Its possible that Bertie doesn't drink during lent as well, but I certainly know he doesn't drink during November, which is a Catholic tradition some people keep "for the Holy Souls". I will try to get a proper source for this from a newspaper (I know the Sunday Business Post mentioned it in a flippant manner this year). However, informally, I can tell you that I happened to have the oppertunity to be in his presence at an event last year and he mentioned it. Not a proper source, I admit.--Ror 12:12, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Ahern abstains both during Lent and in November.</p>

<p>The sentence has been removed as vandalism. I was the one who inserted it, back on Apr 27, 2005. I was accidentially not logged in at the time, but it was not input as vandalism, whatever your POV about it. Personally, I admire the man, don't hate him at all, have no axe to grid. I was simply recording a fact as I see it. Since then one other editor added the 'Bertiespeak' moniker, presumably agreeing with me. Someone added that he stutters, and I removed that. The sentence has survived since Apr 05, presumably been read many times, without anyone feeling the need to remove it.</p>
<p>I meant that his speaking style is not inspirational in the sense of great <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orators.html" title="Orators">orators</a> such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>. Examples are his speech at the opening of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Special_Olympics_507b.html" title="2003 Special Olympics">2003 Special Olympics</a> and the May 2004 <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union_c95b.html" title="Enlargement of the European Union">Enlargement of the European Union</a>. Some of this is due to his accent and tone of voice.</p>
<p>Seperately, I was referring to his style of obfuscation, which he regularly uses in debates and discussions when he does not want to get caught in a corner. I was thinking in particular of a general (ie non-Northern Ireland-related) interview which he did with the BBC some years ago where no-one could interpret what his long-winded response to a particular question meant.</p>
<p>Although he hesitates, uses 'Aah', sometimes repeats a starting word, he does not sutter. But those things do detract from his speaking style.</p>
<p>So, I think the sentence should stay, do you now agree? -- <a href="../../../r/y/e/User%7ERye1967_c954.html" title="User:Rye1967">Rye1967</a> 00:38, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry: I did not mean to imply it was vandalism, and, having forgotten my wording, I almost posted that I had never referred to it as such. I didn't check the history, so I had no idea it was added by an Anon. I removed it on the basis that it seems to be a commentary on his reasons for allegedly avoiding giving straight answers to questions. I am not so familiar with his way of speaking, but presumably he has not admitted to simply skirting awkward questions he does not want to answer, and the implication that he does has little place in an academic encyclopedia article. If it could be re-worded to avoid making any such political accusations, I would have no problem with it being reinstated. <a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvenscout742_266b.html" title="User:Elvenscout742">elvenscout742</a> 13:23, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Have removed Bertie from . There's nothing in the article to support the claim that he is notably pro-life. Maybe he is, but if so, please provide references. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 14:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree - the fact that he supported the most recent referendum (which left a lot to be desired irrespective of pro/anti views on abortion, and just part of the pro-life debate) does not warrant inclusion. He is a politician firstly. <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjegan_c54c.html" title="User:Djegan">Djegan</a> 18:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but the category doesn't say anything about the politicians in question campaigning purely or even primarily on a pro-life platform, it's simply for politicians who are pro-life. Ahern is prominent enough to warrant inclusion, and his pro-life beliefs (and that of his party) are well-known. He didn't just support the last referendum, he initiated it. I also thought the category could do with being a little less amerocentric. But now I see that Dana's there representing Ireland, so that's alright then.--<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDub8lad1_c1b2.html" title="User:Dub8lad1">Dub8lad1</a> 02:07, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is obvious. Tayana I understand you disagreed with my edits, which I disagree were "vandalism", and this is not aimed at you, but I would like to be clear about this section before my edits are written off as vandalism. Just look at this:</p>
<pre>
   * Ahern is a <b>poor</b> public speaker; his tone and style of delivery is mechanical.
When speaking off the cuff, he sometimes speaks haltingly. During debates and interviews, he gives indirect,
vague, ambiguous or meaningless responses, a behaviour dubbed "Bertiespeak". In 2004, Joe Higgins TD described 
</pre>
<p>Ahern's refusal to answer questions as like playing handball against a hay stack. Your hear a dull thud but the ball never comes back to you[27].</p>
<p>While you are correct in saying that Higgins' description of his elocution is cited, the fact that his public speaking is "poor" is not, and is most certainly an opinion.</p>
<pre>
   * Ahern has few close friends among his political colleagues,
but recent revelations [28] show that he has <b>many supposedly non-political friends.</b>
</pre>
<p>The choice of wording here is clearly trying to make a political point.</p>
<pre>
   * Ahern and the Government <b>misjudged the sentiment of the nation</b>
in arranging for a State funeral for Charles Haughey, which was largely ignored by the public.
</pre>
<p>Is this "Trivia about Bertie Ahern", or is it more POV pushing?</p>
<p>In the interest of improving the article and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.

<dd>I entirely agree with you, and I think a number of the entries should be removed. It's hard to argue with material in a 'trivia' section (how can material be considered irrelevant?), but the choice of items displays a clear bias.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Ahern is not an accomplished orator in the grand parliamentry tradition - he tends to speak haltingly, - however he has a skill of successfully avoiding committing himself by giving indirect, vague, ambiguous or meaningless answers to questions by journalists and in the DÃ¡il.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>is utterly blatant, non-factual bias. I've tried (three times) to excise it, but it's been reverted by (another) anonymous editor. Is there consensus that it should go? --21:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>There was no consencus that "trivia" be removed. Much of it has been present from 2005. The Irish radio media refer continually to "Bertigate" and "Bertispeak". Editor "demiurge" seems to delete more than contribute and his edits are negative. He never corrects, just deletes. Of his last 9 posts, 7 are reversions.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the recent history page we have demiurge edits of Bertie Ahern</p>

<p>Should demiurge be blocked as an editor?, on the basis that wiki is creative rather than censorious of others' edits? in accord with wiki philosophy. 194.46.173.253 19:20, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If the media continually refer to "Bertiegate" and "Bertiespeak" then it should be easy for you to find a citation, no? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 21:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are missing on the philosophy of wiki, which is to colaberatively edit, not to criticise others. Acceptable editing is to improve and expand on the work of others, straight deletion without positive activity is a negation of the editorial principles of wiki. Be positive. Straight deletions will usually attract reversionary attention.</li>

<ol>
<li>"Acceptable editing" - as defined by whom? Because your definition sure ain't in accordance with established Wikipedia procedures.</li>
<li>"... to improve and expand on the work of others, straight deletion without positive activity...". Deletion is absolutely necessary where the content does not cross the verifiability threshold. We aren't trying to keep people happy, we're trying to write an encyclopedia. If "the work of others" is rubbish, it should be summarily deleted.</li>
<li>"...a negation of the editorial principles of wiki". No, it's not. Demiurge outlines why. In addition, there are many wikis. You presumably mean Wikipedia. --18.242.7.128 04:12, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The suggestion that Demiurge should be blocked is ridiculous. Specifically, your complaint is that he doesn't act "in accord with wiki philosophy". There <b>is no wiki philosophy</b>. There <b>are</b> <i>Wikipedia procedures</i>, and Demiurge is scrupulously upholding them. The material in the trivia section violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and, more pertinently, is un-sourced in many places, violating <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The anonymous editor that continually re-inserts material in the trivia section is in violation of the three-revert rule, and displays general misunderstandings of Wikipedia in many of his other edits (such as by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fianna_FÃ¡il&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79359856" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fianna_FÃ¡il&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=79359856" rel="nofollow">deleting logos</a>).

<p>The formatting of the trivia section is pretty atrocious. I've changed the italics to quote marks in an attempt to tidy it up.</p>
<p>The quote in the first entry is simply the title of the article referenced for the entry, so I see no reason to have it there, as it distrupts the flow of the article, and can in any case be found in the reference.
