<dd>In my opinion, that one omission isn't enough to kick the article off the "Good articles" list. The lack of references throughout the article, on the other hand, is.

Also, the article currently says that secondary schooling lasts 6 years, but that can't be true across the board: again according to <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Germany_625c.html" title="Education in Germany">Education in Germany</a>, Hauptschulen go to 9th grade, Realschulen to 10th grade, and Gymnasien to 12th or 13th grade. If they each start in 7th grade, then Hauptschule lasts 3 years, Realschule 4, and Gymnasium 6 or 7.

<dd>From the length of this article already, i'd say expanding on it too much might be a bit of overkill, though since it is about a city, i'd say something more specific than education in all of Germany might be called for. Perhaps find a list of some schools, and put "Education in Germany" as a see also or something? Since we're on a specific topic, it doesn't seem to me like going into an explanation of all of Germany's education system should be necessary. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 19:22, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The section already says "See also <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_Germany_625c.html" title="Education in Germany">Education in Germany</a>".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Forests?</span></h2>
<p>I would be in favor of renaming "Zoos, botanical gardens, parks" simply "Green spaces" and discussing Berlin's forests as well. Not many cities have as high a percentage of their land dedicated to forest as Berlin. It's true in both parts of the city, but a friend of mine who grew up in West Berlin said having so much forestland where you felt like you were completely out of the city was "what kept us sane" during the years that West Berlin was walled in and it was impossible to take a day trip outside the city limits. I'll see what I can do myself, but I don't have a lot of free time, so I'll need help if other people agree this would be a valuable addition to the article. I certainly think it's something that makes Berlin different from most other large cities in industrialized countries. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 19:49, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Green spaces" seems not specific to me, a sentence about the forest character of Berlin should be there. Either in "Setting" or "parks".<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Forests are quite different from parks (they're managed differently and used differently), which is why I went for the more general term "Green spaces". I'm not sure to what extent zoos would belong in the section "Green spaces" though, or if it's appropriate to have botantical gardens, parks, and forests under "Culture" at all. Maybe we should leave zoos in "Culture" (to my mind zoos are like more like outdoor museums than they are like parks), and move botanical gardens, parks, and forests to "Setting" (which should perhaps be re-named "Geography"). <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 20:54, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>City bounderies of Berlin include big forest and lakeside areas, I think that should be mentioned in the Setting-section( or Geography, but that would be doubled). Parks and Botanical Gardens are purely cultivated through science ,design and political will, a clear case for me to be in culture.<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>
<p>I also think it would be better to list all parks under "Green spaces", but I think the problem lies somewhere else. English speakers don´t use the "Begriff" "Kultur" in the same way as Germans do. Just to translate it to "Culture" doesn´t mean it sounds right to English ears.. Therefore "Green spaces" seems to me the best way to include forests and parks and the Berliner saying "ins jrüne"!<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a></p>

Not only is the first a much better-quality photo (higher resolution, fewer distracting artifacts), it much better illustrates the Spree in relation to the city, showing as it does such <i>Kennzeichen</i> as the Oberbaumbrücke and the Molecule Men--only in the distant background, granted, but the second photo doesn't have <i>anything</i> distinctly Berlin in it. No one who knows Berlin could possibly mistake the first picture for Warsaw.

<p>Hi Angr, I´d love to have a satellite-photo or at least an aerial view of Spree-Berlin-Characterstics but this here is just to foggy.I can hardly identify Oberbaum or Treptowers. It could be any central european city for non Berliners. The current picture has simply a combination of Spree / Recreational/ and former Industrial areas. By far not perfect but at least crisp and in focus. By the way, very contemporary as well...<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a> all the best</p>
<p>Sashandre, I'm disappointed you felt the need to remove my image - I spent some time considering whether to add it or not, but I felt it worthwhile in the end... The whole article only contains images of "things", there's not a single image that shows a wide view of Berlin. Berlin is a large, flat city, with a huge range of things (residential, commercial, industrial, rail, waterways, roads), all of which were shown in that photo. I added it because I felt the article needed an 'overview' of the setting. And, while I'll admit it could be better in terms of clarity, I felt it sufficiently good for these purposes. I'd be interested in other opinions, but I'm minded to put it back. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanFord_9a9e.html" title="User:AlanFord">AlanFord</a> 22:13, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi AlanFord, you are right! Berlin is flat and Berlin needs a satellite-photo or at least an aerial view. But we need one from the city centre and not from the outskirts. The photo quality (foggy) also can´t meet the high standard on this page, so it lacks on significance and on quality. Both together adds to no appropriate improvement. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a> all the best for you</p>

<p>Well, the body of my parents' relative among the bodies of other 20,000 soldiers rests under that 'insufficient monument'. And every bloody year, I visit the city to pay the tribute to those whom, as I belive, I owe a lot. And the author of this article, since he or she writes about Berlin, must know everything, or at leats a lot about the city. Yet, the huge park, which is not a steet light, was not mentioned in the artice, as if it had never existed. Finally, the fact that such huge monument had not been mentioned in the artice, is called 'insufficient argument'.

<dd>Once again, there is not <i>one</i> author of this article, and if you feel something is missing, it's best to add it yourself. That's what it means to be a wiki. The argument that the article can't be a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good article</a> because it's missing a mention of Treptower Park and the monument is "insufficient" simply because it's so easily fixed. It would have taken much less time and effort for you to write a sentence or two about the park and add it to the article than it took you to delist the article from the Good Articles list and write a complaint here on the talk page about the oversight. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 06:12, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Degrading?</span></h2>
<p>IsarSteve, what exactly is "degrading" about the photo of Klaus Wowereit you removed? He obviously didn't consider it degrading or he wouldn't have posed for it. I think a photograph of the openly gay mayor at a gay pride event standing beside a drag queen who has just been crowned Miss CSD illustrates Berlin's personality perfectly. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">contribs</a>) 23:25, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>1.I agree with Angr on the mayor picture, it is the only people picture anyway... I´m also about restoring the Kiez-Kastanienallee-picture, it illustrates the context and is one of most famous neighbourhoods as well. 2.I have to question the new nightlife paragraph. There is no need telling history or nonexisting clubs in this section.

<dd>3. that´s exactly my point, just because somebody is Gay, he doesn´t have to be shown with a Drag Queen. Would Diepgen have be shown with ""Miss German "Tits &amp; Bum" 1994""? No certainly not.

The fact that a famous personality chooses to take part in such an event and chooses to use it as an opportunity to advertise for (the city|his career|whatever) is interesting and worth mentioning.

<dd>The Kastienallee image just goes to illustrate the East Berlin bias in this article. What is so famous about Kastanienallee??? Not much, I would have thought, Kreuzberg better illustrates "The Berlin situation". I still think the image of Wowi is very clicheed.. exactly what non Gays want to see..

<p>Even not being gay one can reckognise that Wowereit´s attitude is a broader approach to represent the city´s state of mind.Time magazine called him #Glamour Guy#, the picture captures that. Prenzlauer Berg is the focus Stadtteil of german &amp; international immigration in the last 15 years. It is widely regarded as home to the new arts of all kinds, especially Kastanienallee( also known as Castingallee). The picture illustrates the fact of having large Boroughs made of several Stadteile, as described in the text.<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>

<dd>What counts as "trendy" with tourists and self-styled "artists" changes over time. It used to be Kreuzberg, after 1990 it became Prenzlauer Berg for a while, and now it's probably Friedrichshain. It's OK to mention this fact, but between you and me these are the parts of the city to avoid, so they shouldn't be overemphasized that much. The real Berlin takes place elsewhere.

<p>Berlin is a multicentered, multi-lifestyled and multihistoric metropolis; the article should provide a broad view on that.There is no real Berlin. Emphasizing the map is fine for me, but having a Kiez picture is appropriate as well.It covers the typical Gründerzeit housing and is spread in all of the city. There is simply no other other high quality pic available which captures a situation like that.By the way ,Kreuzberg was rather home to counter-culture and not the arts.<a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>

<dd>Hmm, that link you provided is just weird. They don't seem to be mistaking the GDR for West Germany, though. The sentence says "In 1985...in what was formerly East Berlin, at that time still in the German Democratic Republic" which is perfectly true. The confusing part is what follows: "but later part of the communist-controlled Soviet bloc." Perhaps "at that time" refers to the time of the Haymarket Riot (1886), in which case they've confused the GDR with the German Empire. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 11:29, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Both sections need sources to back up their statistics. I also don't understand your removal of all West Berlin nightclubs. The only "nonexisting" nightclub in the section was the LaBelle; the others are still in operation. IsarSteve has already pointed out that this article exhibits a distinct East Berlin bias, and removing the West Berlin nightclubs just makes it even less NPOV. Calling it a "highly volatile section" is just laughable -- I only added that paragraph yesterday, and no one touched it until you deleted it. That's not "volatile". You also removed my request for expansion from the "Schools" section. That section is pitifully small now and contains nothing of interest at all; either it must be expanded or deleted altogether.

Your opinion that the West has a historically low significance is both untrue and insulting. While the historic center of the city is in the former East, the West gained significance during the years of division while the East stagnated. Since reunification, the East has come a long way towards regaining its significance, but it hasn't eclipsed the West.

<p>1. without Germany, Prussia certainly 2. neoclassical 3. see Politics ....all the best</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Unter den Linden is the central axis of the Friedrichstadt which was mostly built under Frederick the Great. So it's connected to Prussia anyway.</dd>
<dd>3. Schloss Bellevue isn't that important historically. There are many castles in and around Berlin with a similar significance, some of them larger and more representative. It has been chosen to be the (at the time, second) seat of the Bundespräsident mainly because of its location, and rather provisionally at first. I guess chance played a role.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Famous Sights</span></h2>
<p>I tried to update Berlin &gt;Famous Sights today, but the edit was almost immediately reversed by some "unknown" person. At the moment Alexanderplatz reads as follows:-</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexanderplatz.html" title="Alexanderplatz">Alexanderplatz</a> is featuring the Weltzeituhr and is a former <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Berlin_ec48.html" title="East Berlin">East Berlin</a>'s shopping area. It was home to the Centrum-Warenhaus, which once was the <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutsche_Demokratische_Republik_5102.html" title="Deutsche Demokratische Republik">GDR's</a> department store.</li>
</ul>
<p>It just makes you cringe to read it.. Whether as square can feature something, is open to debate, but the next sentence that the centrum store was the GDR´s (remember we also agreed to call it East Germany"), department store. So because this "Unknown person" keeps reversing edits..I ask somebody else to re-write Alexanderplatz. I thought maybe on the lines&#160;:- Alexanderplatz named after a Russian Tsar, is about 200years old.. etc., Dominated by the station and two 1920s Buildings desingned by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Behrens_ddd3.html" title="Peter Behrens">Peter Behrens</a> etc.,</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lead picture</span></h2>
<p>First of all it has to be said that the Brandenburg Gate picture is an excellent one which truly meets the criteria of style, quality and significance. But it focuses rather german history and fails to transport the message of an international, multicentered, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_city.html" title="Global city">global city</a>. The half skyline picture including a station, the TV-Tower and a highrise building (center of commerce) can provide that. I can also report that this view is very much shared by an internet and my personal community (living abroad). Up to now I never used this argument in the last discussions , but I think it broadens the view this time.</p>

<dd>The Brandenburg Gate is supremely iconic of Berlin. Friedrichstraße train station isn't. The Friedrichstraße picture can go lower down in the article, but frankly it's just weird to have the first image in the article on Berlin be anything other than the Brandenburg Gate. Look through the other languages' articles on Berlin: more of them have a picture of the Brandenburg gate as the first or only picture than anything else. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 14:37, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I must say, I particularly like the Friedrichstr. image, although for non-German readers, I would imagine that The Brandenburg Gate IS THE SYMBOL of Berlin and of German division. Friedrichstr. station as a "Border Point" has its place in "Deutsch-Deutsche Geschichte", the division of the country and Berlin. So I think it is pertinent to show it as well. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 16:10, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Angr is right. Much of the "historic" center of Berlin is not a decade old. The Brandenburg Gate at least attributes importance to the historical significance of Berlin, which has undeniable shaped the city and its inhabitants forever. The problem remains though, that Berlin is just one of those towns which you are unable summarize using a single photograph, which is why we have to settle for the image with the most significance. If there were a picture of the Pariser Platz, along with the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag and some of the newer governmental buildings, it would be better suited... But I guess in this case, I can't be picky. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyw_7c9e.html" title="User:Johnnyw">Johnnyw</a> 16:33, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Major cities with multiple historical, cultural and architectural heritage can´t be reduced to one symbol. Berlin´s heterogenic landscape especially has many iconic buildings. Thats why a skyline-picture containing various elements is used by most of the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_city.html" title="Global city">global cities</a>.It avoids the focus on one aspect of the city and provides a panorama impression. I have to reject the argument that there is only a trainstation. We do see the TV-Tower which has iconic quality and is dominating the face of the city. The River Spree is also a part of the picture as well as a highrise building which are both shaping the city´s appearance. The Brandenburg Gate in all other languages has been introduced by myself to start with at least one picture.... The English-Berlin WP is a reference language and should be more than that ,providing a cosmopolitan image of the lead picture <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESashandre_eab0.html" title="User:Sashandre">Sashandre</a></p>
<p><br />
First I have to admit I've been the one changing the main image to Brandenburg Gate a few times the last couple of days. Instead I should have begun a discussion about it. Sorry for that. Living abroad and not in Berlin anymore, I can state that people, asked for a symbol of Berlin, mostly name the Brandenburg Gate. It is THE symbol for the division and reunification of Berlin. The picture of Bahnhof Friedrichstraße is definately a quite nice one, but absolutely inadequate as a the needed strong symbol of Berlin. Television towers exist all over the world, and train stations too. Almost nobody outside of Berlin - and even some people in Berlin - would recognize this photo as taken in Berlin. And I have to reject your impression that the television tower "is dominating the face of the city". It dominates surely the borough of Mitte, but not much more. The "cosmopolitan aspect" that you're talking about can surely be elaborated in the article. 82.123.218.171 14:02, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's clear now that the consensus is to have the Brandenburg Gate as the lead picture. Everyone who's expressed an opinion on this has said so, except Sashandre. I'm switching the positions of the Brandenburg Gate and Friedrichstraße photos now. Sashandre, <i>please</i> don't switch back. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 12:49, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no consensus at all I can sum up. Berlin´s heritage is one of the most diverse. This must be expressed in the lead picture. The question for THE symbol is not the appropriate one for the lead picture.

NYC is not showing statue of liberty, San Francisco not Golden Gate, L.A. not the Hollywood sign. Tokyo,Barcelona,Sydney also present not a single icon because there is a reason for it.

<dd>People's names are a completely different matter, since people don't usually have different names in different languages the way cities do. Linking the first occurrence of the word "Berlin" to the sound file implies that the word should be pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bɛɐˈliːn]</span> in English, which it shouldn't. I'd be okay with doing it the way it is at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> though: in the section on etymology we can say something like "The name <i>Berlin</i>, which is pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bɚˈlɪn]</span> in English and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[bɛɐˈliːn]</span> in German, comes from the Slavic root..." and then link the German pronunciation to the sound file. Speaking of etymology, I'd like to see some source indicating that (1) there even <i>is</i> a Slavic root "berl" meaning "swamp" and (2) this is really the source of the name. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">talk</a>) 16:45, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../d/u/d/Duden.html" title="Duden">Duden</a> says that while the origin of the name "Berlin" is uncertain, it presumably originates in a Slavic positional designation, that would be used in connection with 'birl-' or 'berl-' ('swamp').

<dd>Berlin is hardly a name that requires a pronunciation guide in English. It's just too intuitive, and the point of having native pronunciation audio files is to illustrate someting that might actually be new to English-speakers. This is still not a problem in many other city articles but for some reason it's defined as a major problem here. I simply can't picture a situation where someone would listen to the sound file, not understand that it's supposed to be in German and then complain that it doesn't sound English enough.</dd>
<dd>And I don't see why we need to bloat the etymology sections even more by adding rather superfluous English pronunciation info to them.</dd>

<dd>Actually, Berlin does require a pronunciation guide in English, because <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> the capital of Germany is pronounced differently from the various <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Berlin (disambiguation)">Berlins</a> in the United States, most or all of which are pronounced with the stress on the first syllable.
