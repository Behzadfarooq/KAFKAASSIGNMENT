<p>Please link to Berwick, Pennsylvania as it is the sister city to Berwick-Upon-Tweed, there is an annual exchange between the two municipalities and a close relationship between the two.</p>
<p>Berwick is, at present, not part of England or Scotland. As far as I recall, the Wales and Berwick Act simply states that the laws that have effect in England shall have effect in Berwick. That's not the same as being an integral part of England - at best, it is a semi-intergrated territory. I think this article should be amended to reflect that, although due to my inexperience with wiki-editing, I will not be doing it myself.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that exclamation marks were a Wikipedia no-no, as they don't really give a sense of NPOV. I pretty much always remove them when I see them (except when they're in things like quotes), so I'm surprised that there's dispute on this page.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I see how the use is 'perfectly valid' here, as, like the other examples I've found, it makes Wikipedia look like a informal, jokey encyclopaedia, which of course it isn't. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillyH_002d.html" title="User:BillyH">Billy</a><a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillyH_e850.html" title="User talk:BillyH">H</a> 13:16, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Other wikipedians do not share his/her view; they are not phobic (i.e. suggesting an irrational fear of exclamation marks). Insulting people is never a way of winning arguments, and to date you have failed to set out any rationale for the mark. And whilst their talents undoubtedly are employed to good effect elsewhere on wikipedia, that does not diminish the legitimacy of their concerns in respect of this article. Like four others who have to date been involved, I would prefer not to have the exclamation mark. I think the words speak for themselves. I note that to date two users support the mark. --<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a> <a href="../../../t/a/g/User_talk%7ETagishsimon_9445.html" title="User talk:Tagishsimon">(talk)</a></dd>

The use of the exclamation mark imposes your world view on what would otherwise be a neutral treatment of the subject. And that is POV. To answer your question: my views on whether or not it is a bizzare thing are entirely irrelevant. The thrust of your question - what is my opinion of the event - demonstrates your lack of grasp of NPOV. Your repeated allusions to the pokomon articles are completely and utterly irrelevant. Umm.

By leaving a perfectly valid piece of punctuation out, you effectively claim such a situation is normal. You obviously have a good few "points of view" yourself (anyone who wishes to avoid the vulgarity of exclamation marks should, for consistency's sake, avoid abbreviations too.) --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 11:33, 6 October 2005 (UTC) p.s.

<dd>Sigh. I do indeed have point of view. Unlike you, I try to keep them from article pages and take them out for walks only on talk pages. I do not think I have made general claims about wikipedia, so much as pointed to the NPOV policy. I disagree that "the opposite is true". Lack of opinionated comment does not imply normalcy, merely lack of opinionated comment. The fact that Pokemon articles may be shite does not in any way serve as justification for introducing POV in this article: what a cruddy argument that is. Why are you so opposed to letting the words speak for themselves. Why must you qualify words with your opinion?

<dd><i>You still haven't answered the question about whether you think that Russia's "war" with Berwick was somehow normal.</i> I have. I've told you that that is at the heart of this disagreement - that to have a neutral point of view one avoids inputting one's opinion into the article. Techically, the situation - apparant war with Russia - appears to have arisen. And, err, that's it. I'm quote happy to leave it there and seek to ascribe neither normalcy nor extraordinarines to it. You're wasting our time by deploying fatuous arguments such as a) if we should not have exclamation marks then we should not have any punctuation or b) other articles are crap so we should not take exception in this article. Judging by the debate above, we are not going to change your mind. So looking at the debate and the edit history in the article, I find that 5 people are against the exclamation mark and two people are for it. Will you now have the good grace to give way and allow the exclamation mark to be removed without revertion, or are you going to dictate to the rest of us how this article should be?

<p>Just one more against voice. An exclamation mark is punctuation that marks an exclamation and an exclamation is a short, often shouted, complaint or outcry. Stop! Ouch! Shut up! are exclamations. Exclamation marks are not used to highlight odd or bizarre information, a smiley would be better but certainly not encyclopedic. The bizzareness of the 'war' is obvious enough it does not need highlighting with misused punctuation. O.K. I admit it I don't get invited to enough edit wars so I thought I'd try to put this lame one out of its misery. <small><a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMeltBanana_46b5.html" title="User:MeltBanana"><font color="#000000">MeltBanana</font></a></small> 15:59, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed. But you did not consider, and throughout this debate appear not to have considered the context of the writing. It is a wee bit arrogant of you to so ostentatiously ignore the question at issue: will you give way on this matter or do you insist on dictating the form of the sentence under consideration? If you would be so good, at the third time of asking, to respond ... it is getting a little difficult to believe you are in good faith in this matter, and whilst it is your prerogative to jerk us around as you see fit, it is more than a little impolite. --<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a> <a href="../../../t/a/g/User_talk%7ETagishsimon_9445.html" title="User talk:Tagishsimon">(talk)</a></dd>

<p>I've added the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_Arms_of_Russia_8aa0.html" title="Coat of Arms of Russia">Coat of Arms of Russia</a> to the "at war?" section, because something so momentous as to require an exclamation mark surely cries out for an image. I'd actually thought to draw up some "clash of symbols" graphic, but I couldn't find a symbol for Berwick (apart from the river, which I feel would be inappropriate). Despite the temptation to remove the exclamation mark while I was editing, I've left it in. I suspect it would be best for all concerned if, assuming the offending punctuation is to be removed, it were so done by MacRusgail, and not by Yours Truly. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 00:12, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Come on guys, you can't actually be having an edit war over one tiny exclamation point! The situation with the 'war' being 'bizarre' is POV, pure and simple, and thus if an exclamation point is used to illustrate that bizarreness, then the point itself must be POV. And POV has no place in an encyclopaedia. I have chosen to be bold and remove the exclamation point. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 19:05, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I for one think that the exclamation point deserves to be left in there. If such a mark should be anywhere, it is in a situation as this. For what is an exclamation point, if not to designate things deserving of exclamation? And certainly this deserves exclamation.
<dl>
<dd>Exactly, <b>if</b> it should be anywhere in a serious encyclopaedia, which shouldn't. - ulayiti <font color="#226B22"><small>(talk)</small></font> 18:14, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the exclamation mark implies that it is bizarre, and the full stop implies that it is not bizarre, maybe we should invent a new type of punctuation that signifies no emotion whatsoever. But that would be implying that other punctuation marks are not good, wouldn't it(!/.) Damn, it seems we shall never rest. <a href="../../../d/b/m/User%7EDbmag9_1efb.html" title="User:Dbmag9">Daniel</a> 21:13, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have to love wiki. A whole host of individuals visiting this page saying they can't believe there is an argument over an exclamation mark, then proceeding to add thier POV and fuel the arguement. By the way, what is wiki policy on whether it is an axclamation point or exclamation mark? My entirely personal POV is: 1) The exclamtion mark shouldn't be there. 2) It is a mark, not a point. 3) Debates, even as trivial as this one, are an essential part of the value of Wikipedia. It would be better if they were kept civil and avoided buggering about with the main page through sheer cussedness, however. Epeeist smudge 05:45, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Surely if, on Wikipedia, we <i>really</i> needed to call attention to a situation which many people would consider bizarre, you could just write "&lt;whatever it is&gt;, a situation many people would consider bizarre", rather than relying on the vagaries of people's understanding of what an exclamation mark means. But of course we don't need to do that at all. 203.2.218.145 01:42, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Forget about it for 5 seconds, will ya? &lt;unsigned comment&gt;</p>
<p>The exclamation mark is inappropriate. Inflection has no place in encyclopedic writing. Let the reader judge what is bizarre. 208.103.180.154 08:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are we certain that we a) believe b) want the list of local words in this article? Some appear to be common to the north east (e.g. gadgie) and all are unsourced. Might we not be better with a pointer to an article which covers borders dialect - which is what we're really talking about? That said, I guess there is or was a difference between berwick lingo and <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedburgh.html" title="Jedburgh">Jedburgh</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>North east of where? The words listed can be found in both Newcastle and Edinburgh in many cases. The language itself is a mixture of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_language.html" title="Scots language">Scots language</a> and the Northumbrian dialect of English. It shouldn't be written off as slang though - this underestimates its great age and usage.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 16:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article is still very Anglo-centric. The fact that it has been contested by Scots for centuries has largely been written out of it, not to mention the anomalies, or the fact that its true legal status makes it a town which is not fully part of England. Not that the historical legal situation seems to count for much in the eyes of the English council which now runs the area. But then again the "Brits" (if they can be called that) have always been good at putting borders where there were none e.g. Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, or ignoring ones that were already there e.g. Iraq, Palestine, Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is worth pointing out that Berwick's position in Scotland was always far more prominent than in England. In England it has been a provincial town, a minor port, and a garrison. In Scotland, it had a mint, was a major port, and a county town. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 16:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC).</p>

<p>I have added the category "Berwickshire". I hope people don't mind this, I realise it is no longer considered to be in Berwickshire, but it is relevant to it for several reasons, including the fact that the county is named after the town. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 17:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
