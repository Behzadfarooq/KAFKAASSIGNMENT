<p>The Zeta Psi Fraternity of Cornell challenges players from every school, particularly those schools in Maine to come to Ithaca for a challenge or perhaps a tournament. If you are interested, go to the Psi Chapter's <a href="http://www.psiofzetapsi.org" class="external text" title="http://www.psiofzetapsi.org" rel="nofollow">website</a> and e-mail the contact person there.</p>
<p><b>Challenging Colby students to a game of beer die just because your fraternity tosses a bit would be like you guys challenging a Brazilian soccer team to a match because you've been kicking the ball around the quad. Colby students were born to play the game, and we're not going to waste the time, the money, or the energy to come to Ithaca to beat you.</b></p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_Die_219c.html" title="Edit section: Spitting the die">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spitting the die</span></h1>
<p>I've always seen this game played where if a plunk occurs, the victim of the plunk gets a chance to spit the die across the table at his opponents. Though no points can be earned, a plink or plunk from this spit die result in the normal drinking penalty for the other side.</p>
<p>Is this just a local (<a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign_5af2.html" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois</a>) rule, or have others heard of this? --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunmetal_9df8.html" title="User:Gunmetal">Gunmetal</a> 19:38, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>In the version of the game I play, after a plunk the player who's cup was plunked must "chug" their beer and eventually spit the die onto the table. The die must come to rest on the table. If the spitted die falls off the table, then the team who spit the die must refill and chug. If the spitted die comes to rest on the table showing biz, then the team who spit the die must refill and chug. I have never seen anyone try to spit the die into the opponent's cup, but by the rules, wherein "A plunk is a plunk is a plunk", the result would be a bona fide plunk. --Laserpig</li>
</ul>
<p>-Cornell plays the same way for a plunk. The team that was plunked gets a chance to spit out the die on the table (if the die falls out the table they have to repeat the plunk process). If it lands bizz-up, the other team acts as if they have just been plunked, complete with the die-spitting process. In theory, it could go on forever if both teams kept spitting out bizzes. If you plunk yourself, you must spit the die out to see if you have to do it again (hence the rule about spitting it off the table).</p>
<p>-I do recall the spitting of the die after a plunk and if it landed on either a bizz or buzz, there were ramifications. I don't recall the endless back and forth plunk, spit, chug, spit, etc. I recall it ended after the spit and the consequences of the landed die (off table, bizz, buzz, etc.). A major tenet of the game is to consume copious amounts of beer. However, much of the game's spirit and fun comes from throwing and catching...and the tipsy sorority Beer Die groupies.</p>
<p>-Idaho State University- In the variation we play, you don't have to spit the die at all. After a plunk (we call them sinks) both players on the side have to chug their beer. Instead of catching the die in your mouth, you drink all the beer, and then in a gentleman's way, roll the die out of the cup towards the team that just sunk it. In many cases a few tablespoons of beer will also go toward the opposite team, and this style of returning the die is what gives our beer die table a nice beer sheen to it.</p>

<p>I've heard it alleged more than once the Beer Die originated at Colby College, but I've never heard of any evidence of it being true. Considering that Beer Die brings so much happiness to so many people, I would think it proper to have a more thorough exploration of Beer Die's origins. --Laserpig</p>
<ul>
<li>I hadn't heard that before reading it in this very article. I have looked around, but have found no evidence to support the claim. A lot of colleges seem to claim it's invention. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunmetal_9df8.html" title="User:Gunmetal">Gunmetal</a> 22:02, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Any school should be proud to claim their campus as the spot of the first Beer Die game. Having gone to school in New England, I've had the opportunity to play a few Colby kids at Beer Die. Most of them claim that Colby is where Beer Die was first played. To be sure, Colby does have a good Beer Die program as everyone I've ever played who went to Colby is top drawer, but just because they can toss a die doesn't mean they can claim they created it without offering up evidence. --Laserpig</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well, regardless, its an absolute fallacy to have Colby actually NAMED in the article as a place where it was invented. At the very least, the two best claims of it appear to be UMaine AND Colby (and I submit to you - who's more likely to invent a drinking game with dice and cups, spoiled douche rich kids, or state school kids). Regardless of my jab at Colby, its absolute nonsense that they constantly edit this article to have themselves inserted - damned glory hounds. I think a statement something to the effect of, "many Maine schools claim to have invented it, but the claims of UMaine and Colby seem to have the most validity." Or shit - just take out school names all together "many universities in Maine claim to have invented it, but it is impossible to verify where it originated". We are about accuracy in this article, right? Not some glory hound preppies looking for recognition.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_Die_219c.html" title="Edit section: University of Maine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">University of Maine</span></h2>
<p>It wasn't Colby - don't let those elitist pricks tell you any different. Yes, it did originate in New England. Yes, it did originate in the state of Maine - but every peice of evidence proves to the original game coming from the University of Maine (Orono, ME). Specifically it appears to have been played in the student apartments in Old Town and Orono, and especially at the fraternity houses.</p>
<p>I don't even go to UMaine, so I don't even care who really invented it. I do know one thing, the Colby people always claim to have invented it, and never back it up. If you go to the microfilm at the University of Maine library, you will find Maine Campus articles mentioning "a new drinking game taking campus by storm" and specifically stating that it hasn't been seen at other campuses.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that while the Colby kids are respectable at die, the kids from Orono, Farmington, UMPI and Fort Kent can easily embarass them. The students at the Zeta Psi fraternity at Cornell would be more than happy to play (and of course beat) any students from any other college, Colby, Maine, or any other institution.</p>
<p>No my friends, Colby most certainly did NOT invent the game - until I see anything resembling recorded evidence placing the game at Colby before what I saw in the records of Maine, you should stop talking about how impressive it is that Colby invented the game. You didn't do it, you just want to take credit for it (which is basically what the BBC schools (Bowdoin, Bates, Colby) are good for - elitism, and taking credit for stuff the kids at the public universities do.</p>
<p>What we need is a beer die tournament to be held somewhere neutral. Just a suggestion from a Cornell graduate.</p>
<p><br />
I actually attended UMaine and was the originator of the Huff Gambit. I vaguely recall playing Beer Die not only at UMaine but also earlier on in high school. This game carries a lot of significance in Maine and I'd be lying if I told you I knew where it originated. I do know that Mainers take their Beer Die and baseball, especially Red Sox baseball, very very seriously. I agree with the Cornell graduate. Let's be true gentlemen about this and have a tournament in a neutral venue and with a neutral "God", and the winners get to claim origination rights or some other type of booty. Or maybe have a playoff type of tournament as they do in baseball, with x games at home and x games away. That's the Beer Die way of settling scores...sit your @ss down and play (-er drink). At least that's how old schoolers like me settled things.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>This Colby kid would like to submit that Beer Die was indeed invented at Colby, specifically in the 1950s in what was then the Lamda Chi fraternity (now Treworgy Hall). <i>The Dartmouth</i> did a report a few years ago that suggested this as well. A comprehensive history of beer die is indeed necessary and should certainly attempt to trace its roots at Colby, Maine and Dartmouth, among other places. If anyone knows any more specifics (especially dates), those would be helpful. It appears, though, that Beer Die is most commonly a Maine thing, like Moxie and Marden's. --WhiteMule, 25 May 2006</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>See - AGAIN, you have no proof to back that up. I have seen newspaper articles of the Maine Campus dating back to the late 40s mentioning it while I was in the archives writing a paper. You probably are a Lamda Chi kid FROM Colby who just wants to claim credit for something you didn't actually invent. Quit trying to give yourself credit for something you didn't do.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Even if it started at a school in Maine, be it Colby, or U of M, or Bates or wherever, doesn't change the fact that Cornell University is still waiting for someone to respond to our challenge. The guy above agreed, but someone should contact us (visit the website link above) and some sort of "National Beer Die Tournament" should be arranged.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_Die_219c.html" title="Edit section: Dartmouth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dartmouth</span></h2>
<p>I played a Colby kid in Beer Die back in 1998. He agreed the game did not orginate at Colby or even in Maine. He said the game came from Dartmouth college about 30 - 40 years ago. I also have played the game on the Hamilton campus, there are some avid players there. Hamilton College is in Central New York. None of the players knew where it came from, but they played a great game.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_Die_219c.html" title="Edit section: Colby">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Colby</span></h2>
<p>The game was invented at Colby, and that is also where the game is played the most. I do not go to Colby, in fact I go to Cornell, but I know for a fact that at Colby Beer Die is played by nearly every student on Campus, as my brother goes there. They also invented the system of the die name. Every student there has one. Ask a random student who does not party at any school mentioned, be it Cornell, Yale, Dartmouth, or UMaine, and you will see that only a small percentage knows the game. But at Colby every student knows the game and has tossed some die.</p>

<p>Just about everyone in the NESCAC is familiar with the game. I know it is the most popular game at Williams College.</p>
