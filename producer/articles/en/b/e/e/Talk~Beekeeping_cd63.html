<p>As the article stands it now states that hives can "have only one queen," which is important information that hasn't been relayed to the bees. I'm reluctant to go in and just change it because the result will be something like "The first queen to emerge may kill her rivals. Or she may not, depending on whether or not the workers allow her to. This is because the hive usually contains more than one queen, but occasionally has two (or three!). Given that there is a view of multi queen hives as "unnatural" I'm curious what others think before I reword this to recognize that it's not always a battle royale between queens. <a href="../../../x/c/0/User%7EXC0000005_2aa7.html" title="User:XC0000005">XC0000005</a> 16:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are correct that there are some rare instances where a colony will tolerate two queens simultaneously. However, it is a <i>very</i> rare situation for European Honeybees. Furthermore, all the research I've read on the topic determined that the multi-queen situation only occurs as a mother-daughter pairing. I know of no confirmed cases of sisters co-existing for more than a few hours. There is no confirmed research showing why or how the multi-queen scenario arises but one hypothesis is that the old queen prepares to swarm but at the last minute the weather changes for long enough that whatever triggered the swarming instinct is no longer in play.<br />
To be honest, it's such a rare occurence that I'm not sure how you could integrate it into the article without giving the impression that it's more common than it is. It's also so very rare that it has no appreciable effect on beekeeping itself. It might be an aside best discussed in one of the articles about the insects (rather than the profession). <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 17:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Note: It is possible for a beekeeper to deliberately manipulate a "colony" to maintain two queens. The queens are kept separate artificially - such as through the use of a queen excluder. But in that case what you're really doing is maintaining two separate colonies with separate brood spaces but combined honeysupering space. There was an article about this practice in the BeeCulture magazine last year. (Don't remember exactly when, though.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 17:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm aware of the manual manipulation - That would definitely fall under the outside article section in my opinion because there's a lot of things you can get bees (or anything else) to do with enough intervention. You are probably correct though that this would result in making it appear much more common than it is.

<p>I've added the above notice because only the introduction of the article briefly states that bee-keeping is a very old occupation and that it has been practiced for centuries by many cultures all over the world. The article gives the impression that bee-keeping is only relevant in Western contexts. One rough and ready example I can remember is that many East-African hunter-gatherer groups have traditionally used bee-keeping as an additional subsistence method (see e.g. <a href="../../../y/a/a/Yaaku.html" title="Yaaku">Yaaku</a> or <a href="../../../o/k/i/Okiek_language.html" title="Okiek language">Akie</a>). — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 22:32, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The distinction needs to be made between bee-keeping and bee-robbing, which some folks fuzz up. That said, it is definitely a need to have some editors help us from more areas of the world. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 23:10, May 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>From my knowledge, the Japanese and the Chinese both practice beekeeping, as well as several other cultures. Though, what do you mean by: "The distinction needs to be made between bee-keeping and bee-robbing, which some folks fuzz up." Is that in this topic?--<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShark_Fin_101_7698.html" title="User:Shark Fin 101">Shark Fin 101</a> 20:01, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we add a section on becoming a beekeeper (Materials, starter kits, common laws and regulations regarding beekeeping and cities)? I looked this page up for that very reason, and there is not even a single link for that.

<li>We might be able to say a few things here but an in-depth discussion might be better over in Wikibooks since we would be writing a "how-to" for beekeeping. We could, of course, freely link between the two articles. Let's make a start. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 14:35, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And now I discover that an in-depth Wikibook already has been started. See <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Beekeeping" class="extiw" title="b:Beekeeping">b:Beekeeping</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't look like the Wikibook is going anywhere. I get the impression that there was only one person working on it and they lost interest. Unless I see some response here from people who have time to devote to a bigger effort, I'd be more inclined to spend time on the Wikipedia material than on the book. A short section on becoming a beekeeper would be appropriate here. <a href="../../../m/n/s/User%7EMnSteve_5ea4.html" title="User:MnSteve">MnSteve</a> 21:56, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, there is a separate article on <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beekeeping_leading_practices.html" title="Beekeeping leading practices">beekeeping practices</a> which would probably be better for this content. I would move it straight to the Talk page for discussion first, though. I wrote a paper about 2 years ago on Housel positioning. The existence of the theorized center comb has never been independently confirmed. Housel reports finding it in feral colonies but other beekeepers looking at other feral colonies find no such pattern. Furthermore, a 3-D model of such a comb shows that it would either take an inordinately greater amount of wax than the center structure of any other comb or it result in a flat-bottomed cell - which would be a sub-optimal use of volume and different than all other comb. While Housel's theory has been published, it has not been confirmed and is generally considered to be a fringe theory by most bee researchers. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:03, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
