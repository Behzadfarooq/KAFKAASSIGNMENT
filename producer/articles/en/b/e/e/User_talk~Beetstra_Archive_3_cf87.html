<div align="center" style="color:#FF0000"><b>ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL</b></div>
<p>There are several discussions about my link removal here, and in my archives. If you want to contact me about my view of this policy, please read and <b>understand</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, and read the discussions on my talkpage or in my archives <b>first</b>.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">My view in a nutshell:<br />
External links are not meant to tunnel people away from the wikipedia.</div>
<br />
<p>Hence, I will remove external links on pages where I think they do not add to the page (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>), or when they are added in a way that <i>wikipedia</i> defines as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a> (understand that wikipedia defines spam as: '... wide-scale external link spamming ...', even if the link <i>is</i> appropriate; also read <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#External_link_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">this</a>). This may mean that I remove links, while similar links are already there or which are there already for a long time. Still, the question is not whether your link should be there, the question <i>may</i> be whether those other links should be there (again, see the wording of the policies and guidelines).</p>
<p>Please consider the alternatives before readding the link:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the link contains information, use the information to add <i>content</i> to the article, and use the link as a reference (content is not 'see <a href="http://www.example.org" class="external text" title="http://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information').</li>
<li>Add an appropriate linkfarm like {{<a href="../../../d/m/o/Template%7EDmoz_e80e.html" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>}} (you can consider to remove other links covered in the dmoz.</li>
<li>Incorporate the information into one of the sister projects.</li>
<li>Add the link to other mediawiki projects aimed at advertiseing (see e.g. <a href="http://www.aboutus.org" class="external text" title="http://www.aboutus.org" rel="nofollow">this</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the linkspam of a certain link perseveres, I will not hesitate to report it to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">wikiproject spam</a> for blacklisting (even <i>if</i> the link would be appropriate for wikipedia). It may be wise to consider the <i>before</i> things get to that point.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">The answer in a nutshell<br />
Please consider if the link you want to add complies with the policies and guidelines.</div>
<br />
<p>Pertaining links on pages about chemicals: If the link is a regular source of chemicals, consider adding the link to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemical_sources_67a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemical sources">wikipedia:chemical sources</a>, and add the template {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChemicalSources_9571.html" title="Template:ChemicalSources">ChemicalSources</a>}} to the external links sections of the chemicals' page(s) (when not there). If you would like to see my proposed special:chemicalsources be activated, please vote for <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" rel="nofollow">bug 7514 on bugzilla</a>.</p>
<p>If you have other questions, or still have questions on my view of the external link policy, disagree with me, or think I made a mistake in removing a link you added, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">please poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a>.

<div style="margin-top:.1em; margin-bottom:.1em; border:1px solid #8DB9F6; background-color:#E9F2FE; padding:.1em">
<div align="center"><b>Reliable sources</b></div>
<p>I convert inline URL's into references and convert referencing styles to a consistent format. My preferred style is the style provided by <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">cite.php</a> (&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;references/&gt;). When other mechanisms are mainly (but not consistently) used (e.g. {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}}-templates) I will assess whether referencing would benefit from the cite.php-style. Feel free to revert these edits when I am wrong.</p>
<p>Converting inline URLs in references may result in data being retrieved from <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">unreliable sources</a>. In these cases, the link may have been removed, and replaced by a {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}}. If you feel that the page should be used as a reference (complying with <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>!!), please discuss that on the talkpage of the page, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a></p>
<p>Note: I am working with some other developers on mediawiki to expand the possibilities of cite.php, our attempts can be followed <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you like these features and want them enabled, please vote for these bugs.</p>

<div align="center"><b>Stub/Importance/Notability/Expand/Expert</b></div>
<p>I am in general against deletion, except when the page really gives misinformation, is clear spam or copyvio. Otherwise, these pages may need to be expanded or rewritten. For very short articles there are the different {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} marks, which clearly state that the article is to be expanded. For articles that do not state why they are notable, I will add either {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}. In my view there is a distinct difference between these two templates, while articles carrying one of these templates <i>may</i> not be notable, the first template does say the <i>article</i> is probably notable enough, but the <i>contents</i> does not state that (yet). The latter provides a clear concern that the article is not notable, and should probably be {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}ed or {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_4f30.html" title="Template:AfD">AfD</a>}}ed. Removing importance-tags does not take away the backlog, it only hides from attention, deleting pages does not make the database smaller. If you contest the notability/importance of an article, please consider adding an {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">expert-subject</a>}} tag, or raise the subject on an appropriate wikiproject. Remember, there are many, many pages on the wikipedia, many need attention, so maybe we have to live with a backlog.</p>
<p>Having said this, I generally delete the {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}}-template on sight. The template is in most cases superfluous, expansion is intrinsic to the wikipedia (for stubs, expansion is already mentioned in <i>that</i> template).</p>

<p><b>Your comment on my Talk page</b>:</p>
<p>Dear Mbeychok. I have responded to the reactions on theoretical plate, and also to <a href="../../../v/8/r/User%7EV8rik_a2ae.html" title="User:V8rik">V8riks</a> answer on his talk page. Why is it, that when chemical engineers are editing an article, contributions of other chemists are described as 'comic strips' and 'cracking jokes'? Until now I have not seen any of these remarks on any of the 3500 pages on my watchlist (except when made by first-time editors). Could we please get into an open discussion, and try to write an encyclopedia readable for the normal public. If a subject cannot be explained to the normal public (say, a high-school student, though a target person with a lower education is preferable), it may be worth considering to not put it into the wikipedia, but into specialised mediawiki projects. Or otherwise, please tone the subject and the discussions down to give it an entrypoint suitable for the above described public. Thank you. --Dirk Beetstra T C 20:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>My response:</b></dd>
<dd>Dirk Beetstra, when or where have I characterized anyone's edit of Theoretical plate as "cracking jokes" or any such derogatory remarks? As for the discussion on the Distillation page, all I did was ask <a href="../../../v/8/r/User%7EV8rik_a2ae.html" title="User:V8rik">V8rik</a> if he did not consider the "Simple analogy" section to be non-encyclopedic?</dd>
<dd>Your remarks indicate to me a dislike of chemical engineers, so you have stereotyped me as someone you don't like. And you have reverted the edit by Ketankhare purely on the basis of that dislike rather than on the merits of the "Simple analogy" section involved. <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbeychok_616b.html" title="User:Mbeychok">mbeychok</a> 21:16, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please stop removing importance tags without doing anything useful</span></h2>
<p>The way to reduce maintenance backlogs is <i>not</i> to split it up into smaller categories and to say that if there aren't enough pages in each category to be a backlog, then the entire thing isn't a backlog. The backlogs should actually be processed. While yes, that particular tag does say something misleading, the purpose of the category, and all of the other templates that put things into the category (such as {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}) are to question the actual notability of an article. Perhaps, in theory, splitting {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} from the category would be a good thing to do, but in practice, people almost always use it in the same way as {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}} is used, not in the way that it's meant to be used according to the text of the template, so it wouldn't do much good. --<a href="../../../r/o/r/User_talk%7ERory096_912b.html" title="User talk:Rory096">Rory096</a> 03:02, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It feels very nice to get support. My examination will be starting soon and will get over on 12 December 2006. After that there is a lot of work to be done I suppose. I had started the project long back, it is dormant as of now. Anyways, could you be kind enough to write your comments in the relevant sections of the project page.

<p>Oddly, the article page has a lot of external links. Thus, I was a little strapped. I believe most of my template creations are well received by their transclusion sites. I understand that external links may be a problem. Maybe I should remove all external links on the template. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 23:40, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am surprised that you say that the reversion was not due to the external links but because you don't find templates with corporate brand useful. This is unusual. I imagine that you have an active role in some of the pages that the template linked to. We need to coordinate what you think a useful template would be for J &amp; J and discuss what changes need to be made. I would like to replace some sort of template that won't get torn down by you. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 00:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, thanks for the remark. Well .. yes and no .. I have been waiting for some time for someone to chip in and write this, and then started to hack it myself. We do have a properly working copy now since about 3-4 weeks (see <a href="http://chemistry.poolspares.com" class="external free" title="http://chemistry.poolspares.com" rel="nofollow">http://chemistry.poolspares.com</a>). I have asked around to chemists to give their opinion, but have not heard a lot. It feels like there is no need for it, and indeed, I will renew the discussion on the chemicals portal, and otherwise indeed consider to remove the template (well, if it gets implemented, I will also remove the tag, along with a massive number of external links which then get covered by the special:chemicalsources).</dd>
<dd>But, in a way, yes, I do believe it does harm to remove it, there is still a bias when external links are added, in this way they at least go (sometimes) to the list, and external links can be removed without discussion. The only problem is indeed that it is technically not an external link, but I do, for now, not see another solution to get this on all pages. Maybe the template should be cut loose from the external links section, and be a box at the bottom, with a couple of links programmed by CAS, and in there a link to the chemicalsources page (which needs reformatting, then). I percieve that when there is no link to a full list, people will blindly add links again, with all reasons as stated in another discussion on my talk-page. But maybe we have to live with that problem. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 11:34, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dirk, I've not been on wikipedia long, so perhaps you can give me a global perspective about what this chemicalsources is hoping to achieve, and how it fits in with wikipedia generally. I compared your chemicalsources "Water" article with the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> article on wikipedia. As far as I can tell, the point of chemicalsources is to focus only on the chemical elements of that substance. If true would that mean that the chemistry would be removed from the water page and pages like <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromobenzene.html" title="Bromobenzene">bromobenzene</a> (which are all chemistry) would move from wikipeida to chemicalsources? Sorry if this is obvious question! --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuantockgoblin_e360.html" title="User:Quantockgoblin">Quantockgoblin</a> 08:16, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uhh .. obvious .. not at all (I even have to distill out the question, you provide me with a line of thinking which I have apparently, not made clear) .. No, I would like the special:chemicalsources to start to exist on wikipedia, just like the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" title="Special:Booksources">special:booksources</a> (which already exists). Chemical compounds and all stay here, but on the pages of the chemicals all the chemical identifiers get a link (using a parameter) to the special:chemicalsources (so a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/special:chemicalsources?CAS=123-45-6" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/special:chemicalsources?CAS=123-45-6" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/special:chemicalsources?CAS=123-45-6</a>, e.g.). Clicking the link brings up the result page where all the 'search on CAS' links result in searches (within that database/company) on that CAS number. So chemical pages will stay here.

<p>Off the top of my head, it's not entirely clear-cut. Granted it's large, at 5,000-ish, but it's far from being the largest "maintenance" category. I think at bottom it's a matter of what's the best "producer-consumer" relationship: if it were split up, would multiple specialist groups assess notability and clean them up (one way or another) more rapidly. Or would it lead to the same people simply having to deal with more categories? You might ask at some of the larger wikiprojects if they have an interest in "processing" separated-out categories in their area (as you may have noticed I'm trawling around the idea of doing the 'uncategoriseds' on that basis). <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 15:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: edits to the trichloroethylene page</span></h2>
<p>Hello Dirk,</p>
<p>I've added references to the trichloroethylene article for the revised content in the health effects section. Hopefully these address your comment concerning sources and references. Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments about them.</p>
<p>With regard to your comment about the health effects content possibly being in conflict with wp:not: having looked through the guidelines, I'm not clear where the conflict might lie, and we may need to discuss this further. The problems I see with your suggestion (a shorter health effects section, and a separate section discussing physiological effects) are that the sections would be overlapping, or the shorter more discrete health effects section could be misleading. There may be some tightening I could do, but I would encourage maintaining the health effects discussion as the single section, as it's now written. I am interested in your thoughts on this proposed approach.</p>
<p>The story for this compound differs considerably from 1,1-dichloroethylene or 1,1,2,2-tetrachlorothane. There is high interest by the general public about TCE right now, particularly about the controversy over potential human health risks. The potential for human exposure to TCE is much greater than these other two substances. We know so much more about the risks from TCE compared with dichloroethylene or tetrachloroethane, which paradoxically makes the story for TCE less straighforward. TCE has become a very polarized topic, and as befits the Wikipedia concept, I've tried to present it in an objective manner. Again, I am interested in your thoughts here.</p>
<p>Drop me a note in my user talk area if you would like to discuss these matters further.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>The principle for continuous distillation is the same as for normal distillation: when a liquid mixture is heated to its boiling point, the composition of the vapor above the liquid will be different from that of the liquid. If this vapor is then separated and condensed into a liquid, we find that it has become richer in the lower boiling component of the original mixture.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happens in a continuous distillation column. A mixture is heated up, and routed into the distillation column. On entering the column, the feed starts flowing down but part of it, richer in lower boiling component(s), vaporizes and rises. However, as it rises, it cools and while part of it continues up as vapor, some of it (enriched in the less volatile component) begins to descend again.</p>
<p><br />
Sorry Dirk, there is something wrong in the first sentence here.</p>
<p>There IS a great difference between coontinuous distillation and normal distillation, inasmuch as in what you call normal distillation something approaching a <i>temporary equilibrium</i> which is set up, until a differential quantity of the vapour is removed. At that point a new equilibrium is set up and so on. It is therefore also called <i>differential distillation</i>. Every drop coming through to the receiver has a different composition! Of course, the composition of the still changes as well.</p>
<p>In continuous distillation, as mentioned later an equilibium condition is set up which results in the product composition being constant&#160;!</p>
<p>What I said earlier has also needs to be changed somewhat, as rather than saying that 'This is exactly...' we ought to say 'This is more or less...) Here is exactly my point that I keep on talking about: vapour liquid equilibria:</p>
<p>Just listen to this if you please: As Henry will tell you, this used to be measured by taking a batch of liquid and boiling it under total reflux, nothing added, nothing removed for such a time as no change is taking place in the two compositions. There is a very very small receiver the quantity of which is negligible compared with that of the still (if you like) which can be sampled by removing a minuscule fraction to determine vapour composition. It is possible that now other means are used for measuring vapour composition, and which does not need sample takeoff and the receiver size can be decreased even more. (Henry can tell us)</p>
<p>Continuous distillation is much nearer to this setup than to 'ordinary' differential distillation'. (In both cases there is zero change in vapour and liquid composition) This is why I am in favour of mentioning the introduction of equilibria at this stage, not just because its determination is the first step in design calculations. In continuous distillation there is (at least in the simplest binary case) one lower boiling component takeff, and one higher boiling component takeoff.</p>
<p>It would nicely fit to the start of this section with a drawing of an apparatus with 100% reflux.</p>
<p>I am not going to make any changes myself anywhere, you can consult anybody about it, but this is correct! I am sending you a note as well</p>

<dd>I do not concur with this, and I will explain why (but you are right, there the paragraph has something which is unclear). Distillation is the principle, which has different operation modes. Two of these are batch distillation, and continuous distillation (and the more 'exotic ones', like e.g. steam destillation, which require quite an explanation in how they are different from the batch/continuous versions, but that should go in separate articles). Both are distillations working on the same principle, that the vapour above the liquid is different in composition than the liquid (well, except some rare cases). The difference starts indeed when we start taking samples. In continuous distillation the everything is kept at a constant composition, in batch distillation the composition changes.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">expand tags</span></h2>
<p>It's an interesting problem. Here's my take on it. These articles have been in the "unclear importance" category for a loooong time and nothing has changed. The only way these will change is for someone with relevant knowledge of chemistry to expand them and I don't think leaving them in this category will help much. The way I see it, "unclear importance" is a fairly negative category: it expresses concerns that perhaps the article's subject is not suited for inclusion on Wikipedia while the expand category is more positive in that it says "sure, this has a place here but we really wish it wasn't such a poor stub". One way to solve the problem would be to have parameters to the expand tag that allow us to create categories like "chemistry articles to be expanded" so that people from the relevant projects can work on them. I don't think it makes sense to put all of these articles for deletion: although their value is marginal, I think that ideally we would want these articles to exist with some extra content. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with that point, and well, it does not matter whether they are too long in the importance or expand category (switching every now and then does at least result in them not being too long in a category, and they see some other company). But they are now twice in an expand-type category (stub and expand), what about adding importance <b>also</b>, the articles still do not state any importance, anyway? If they get importance, they will also move into more appropriate categories, and chances increase they will get some more attention. I will (and have) fought AfD's on articles with an importance tag, we can't work on all of them all the time, and well, expanding articles about chemicals is not my prime interest, it takes time (every now and then I do one). --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 16:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>*phew* I'm wondering how best to parry the recent comment from User:Manofwar4662 that reads "I'll be adding content and citing the link. I know what I did is right because I did read the rules, but I know I can't win against the establishment. I'll be adding some content and the same links.

<dd>Your welcome. It was my first 'incident' of this kind.

I don't have any competence in this area, so perhaps you can fix the article. All I can tell is that it's not neutral. Here in Mexico my daughter was perscribed the drug, and after she had a bad reaction, I searched around on the Internet, and found that pedeatric use of it is forbidden in many places.

<dd>I saw your post on the talkpage, and started looking around. I already reinstated the old section, and resorted the section. I have no clue about the medicine (hence the 'expert' tag). I have removed the advert tag again, although it is still quite positive about the compound (though I think the first sections are just scientifically correct, even when the references are missing). When there are scientific references, pertaining the negative issues of the compound, I think the first half can be rewritten also. I don't know anything at all about the controversy, could you write some things, I'll help you with layout, text, etc.?

<dd>I know very little, just what I've seen on some Web sites. Wish I could help more, but no time right now. Glad someone is watching what happens on these pages. Surely the person who sanitized the article is on the payroll of a drug company, no? Notice that one external article (the second one in my first comment here) claims that it's the drug companies in the industrialized world that don't favor the drug, and have carried out a smear campaign.

<dd>I am not that fast in pointing my finger somewhere. Both IP-addresses are totally anonymous (certainly not traceable to a company), it might have been good fait, it's better to assume that. On 450 million users there will of course be some that react wrong on the compound (and if that is you, it is really bad, but the statistics can still be very positive). As there is something on controversy in the history of the article, I think that needs to be named in the article. But for that also references need to be added, which back that up. We'll see how it develops, hope to see you back some time, when you have time to help.

Indeed it is best to assume good faith, and to add a {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcome_2ac1.html" title="Template:Welcome">welcome</a>}} to the userpage (or a {{<a href="../../../w/e/l/Template%7EWelcomeanon_15a4.html" title="Template:Welcomeanon">welcomeanon</a>}} and add a section about a specific example and explain that his work is not according to policies (if it is a good entry, tell him that his work is merged into the another article, or otherwise, that it is deleted. You can have a look at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_talk_namespace_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace">Wikipedia:Template_messages/User_talk_namespace</a>, there are many predefined templates there which deal with many situations (I used in this case a {{<a href="../../../n/c/0/Template%7ENC0_baa1.html" title="Template:NC0">NC0</a>}}), but that does not always work. Choose one from the first column, level 0, good faith edit if you think the person is editing in good faith. Hope this helps.</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid I need to ask your advice again about how to handle continued malfeasance by this same unregistered user <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.168.217.240_5398.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.168.217.240">67.168.217.240</a>. Your warnings, and mine after them, and those of another admin (<a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp">Alphachimp</a>), do&#160;not seem to be having much effect; and, frankly, I&#160;have my doubts as to whether he has ever seen them, despite my linking to his <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.168.217.240.html" title="User talk:67.168.217.240">talk&#160;page</a> in most of my edit summaries of reverts of his actions. His&#160;usual <i>modus&#160;operandi</i> remains essentially the same: replacing legitimate redirects (now from alternative names of biological species, as well as from plurals and misspellings) with very short, frivolously written articles. His&#160;count of redirects trashed is now well into double&#160;digits. I&#160;have escalated the warnings to the&#160;level of {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}}, and he&#160;has continued after&#160;that.

<p>I forgot to log in for one of those edits, so that might help explain some. I see your point about the names used for the reference tags. I agree, and admit I hadn't really thought about it that much. The numbers I've been using correlate with the numbers in my unpublished MS Thesis, and obviously doing it that way makes it easier for me to keep up with them. But it will really make it difficult to interpret later. I was thinking maybe I would just finish it up, and then used a find and replace to change them later. But I'm not sure what would be useful, and still compact. I was thinking maybe 1st four letters of the 1st author and the last two digits of the year.<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.folsom_c9dd.html" title="User:James.folsom">James.folsom</a> 20:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>James, first a happy new year. The naming is OK with me, if you are working on the page it is not a problem, but indeed it would be nice if it would change into something more comprehendable, easier, later.

<dd>First of all, a happy new year to you. Secondlly, I think it is a great honour to see that one of the gods of thermodynamics is asking my opinion on the term 'free' in the energy names. As far as I know, Sadi died on a rather young age (illness?), I hope this (re)incarnation does not follow a similar fate ... I hope I can help a bit in this, though I am not a big hero in thermodynamics. I am very much inclined to concur with your opinion, I know these terms as Gibbs Free Energy and Helmholz Free Energy. I guess we are not thát strict about following IUPAC, we follow the name that the most people know, and when that gets close to 50-50, we follow IUPAC. As such, I would vote against renaming the articles. That said, the reason for the word 'free' in the terms, should be made very clear in these articles. Hope that you, as one of the founders of thermodynamics, are able to do that&#160;;-).

<p>hi beetstra&#160;:) found your talk page. i posted a question to you in discussion on the uric acid page and you referred me here. here's the link you requested, when i was asking what the info and comment meant:</p>
<p>08:19, 9 January 2007 Beetstra (Talk | contribs) (RV to 99394796 (2007-01-08 20:40:14) by 24.141.95.140 using Popups - unexplained removal of data)</p>
<p>i don't know what any of that means, about RV to 99394796, or about using popups, or about unexplained removal of data (because i think that's my IP but i don't remember taking off any info, just re-organizing so that the TOC is nice and clear. what did you think was missing? is it just moved and you hadn't seen the new spot? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.141.95.140_e383.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.141.95.140">24.141.95.140</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.141.95.140.html" title="User talk:24.141.95.140">talk</a>) 23:14, 12 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, I see. Yes, it is your IP, let me explain all data in that line. RV is for revert. The big number is the page revision, every page that gets saved gets his own revision-number, the time is the time of that revision number, and you were the editor of that revision. Popups is the script that I am using to do the revert (see <a href="../../../p/o/p/WP%7EPOPUPS_4a3b.html" title="WP:POPUPS">WP:POPUPS</a>, it is a set of tools that allows certain easy access that is not standard on the wikipedia page. After that is a dash and then a small part of text that I add, telling why I did the revert, in this case, someone (not you) removed data without explanation, and I suspect that that was not meant to happen. I often type 'rvv', which is my shorthand for revert vandalism.</dd>
<dd>What happened is that someone after you edited <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uric_acid.html" title="Uric acid">uric acid</a>, and was removing data and did not give an explanation (using e.g. the edit summary), this is what he/she did: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uric_acid&amp;diff=99487267&amp;oldid=99394796" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uric_acid&amp;diff=99487267&amp;oldid=99394796" rel="nofollow">link</a> (on the left your version, revision 99394796, on the right the version after the two edits). I saw that, was not sure if that was a genuine edit, and decided to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uric_acid&amp;diff=99521178&amp;oldid=99394796" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uric_acid&amp;diff=99521178&amp;oldid=99394796" rel="nofollow">revert</a> (again, your revision on the left, mine on the right; it may have been vandalism, but I am not a specialist in uric acid, and maybe in this case the person had a good reason, maybe it was duplicate or something, so in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>, I revert because of an unexplained deletion of data).</dd>

<p>hey thanks dirk&#160;:) so, i'm not really suprised that somebody was wiping out MS information, it has happened to me before. whenever i put any information about nutrition and biochemistry on the MS page it gets wiped out within hours. i complained about it on my MS forum and i'm not the only person it's happened to. this other victim of deletion said he tried to contact the person who kept changing it, and this character replied "he knows best". i was tempted to just change it back to my version every day but i already e-procrastinate more than enough as it is!</p>
<p>anyway thanks for explaining the whole edit thing and yea i probably should get an account. i am proud of the uric acid page lol! ciao! 24.141.95.140 03:34, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have started the discussion again on the appropriate wikiproject. IMHO, people not involved in the project where a page is tagged under, should not be deciding on maintenance tags (sorry, nothing personal). These articles are all important (and the one I did remove does state why), they only don't state why they are important. There is some discussion on that, in my view: a non-notability tag is really a question if an article is non-notable, and importance tag is saying, that the article does not say why it is important (but it probably is), and hence that it <i>may</i> be non-notable. There is a significant difference in that.</dd>
<dd>I know there is a big backlog on the non-notability categories, but that means that there is still a lot of work to be done. Deleting articles is a solution, but then, who is to decide whether these articles are ripe for deletion, or that they should be worked on. That is why I say, that that decision should be made by the appropriate wikiproject, not by a person who wants to make the non-notability category smaller.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Well, most of them (I suppose you have seen <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html#January_13" title="User:Jobjörn">the list</a> of my prod nominations) would probably not survive an AfD, such as <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_%28CA%29_a86e.html" title="Immigration (CA)">Immigration (CA)</a> or Mack Dawg Productions. In the two cases contested so far, I see no reason to go to AfD, but most of the articles I've nominated I would bring to AfD if contested. I don't nominate articles for deletion because I want backlogs cleared, I nominate articles for deletion because they should be deleted. Very often, articles that ought to be deleted are found in the backlogs, but also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_American_Airlines_destinations_b6db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/American Airlines destinations">elsewhere</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn"><font color="#FF8000">Jobjörn</font></a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 15:34, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know this is only a prod, which might set some people to work on these articles, but I don't think that it is a good plan. It is just that I am against deletion/proposed deletion by people who are not working in the field where that article is of interest. In general these articles are made by someone in the field who is encountering it in another article, and starts a stub in the hope it will grow, and someone else who sees that the article does not describe for what it is used tags it for importance (which can be done by anyone, that person apparently had an interest for that article). Then a third person comes along, and either prod's it, or deletes it, because it is tagged as non-notable, without knowing anything about the subject, or doing some research. (I am sorry, I don't mean this at all personal, it is just, every week/forthnight someone comes along and 'touches' maintenance tags on articles outside his/her own field, I would suggest, that that should be left to people within a certain project). I have made a suggestion on the non-notability wikiproject.

<dd>Deletions are hardly contested, anyway, people don't see this, most people in chemistry don't even know that these articles exist (by the way, I feel like removing the tags on the others as well, I saw them, but I am waiting for input/discussion). About how long they should stay .. well .. until someone adds more info. If articles are notable, they should stay, deletion does not make the database smaller, the database is just as big with or without that article, so I see no reason to delete. At the moment there is a big non-notability category where no-one wants to plough through, if it is per discipline, people within the discipline might do it, because the categories are then smaller, and well, I am bored sometimes, and decide to suddenly improve an article. Also having that smaller, specific category makes the chance bigger people in a project actually put some of the articles on their watchlist, and the project can be activated to do something about it. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 16:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re remainder: Don't worry, you can bother me whenever you need. Within chemistry you see either the most-common name or the IUPAC name, other names are then redirects to that name.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Copper sulfate herbicide</span></h2>
<p>I am a member of a group that monitors a local mangrove forest. It was recently brought up that copper sulfate herbicide was being used to control algal growth at the periphery. Will this adversely effect the mangroves, or other plant and animal life? Are there better alternatives?</p>

<dd>Copper sulfate is a harmful compound: the Aldrich guide also has a little label stating "dangerous for the environment". So yes, it probably is harmful, not only to the algae, but also to other plant life. The reduction of algae growth is prehaps possible by reduction of fertilizer run-off present in the water, although this is of course dependent of local conditions. Alternative pesticides I wouldn't know. Also, is the reduction of algae really nessecary?

I have not been very active, yesterday only reverting some vandalism, and not notifying users. At first glance I would have judged this as a good faith edit, anyway.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fundamental problems with notability and consensus</span></h2>
<p>Hello once more from <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuromath_ffc9.html" title="User:Neuromath">Neuromath</a>, whom you welcomed to Wikipedia. I have another occasion to ask for your advice on something, and this time it concerns far weightier matters than how to warn a vandal. I've recently been involved in three AfD's, and I raised as an issue certain confusions in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, described at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html#Primary_subject.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)#Primary subject?</a>. But my background investigations have turned up far graver problems. I'm starting to suspect that the guideline status of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and all other notability guidelines is unjustified on grounds of lack of consensus, and even that there are fundamental problems with the very notion of consensus as used in Wikipedia decisionmaking.</p>
<p>I've found that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29&amp;diff=13893408&amp;oldid=13874607" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29&amp;diff=13893408&amp;oldid=13874607" rel="nofollow">made an official guideline</a> by <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> on 2005-05-18, with a blank edit summary and no corresponding message on the talk page (now <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_Archive_0_57e0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for inclusion of biographies/Archive 0">archived</a>). At that time, there had been only a few brief entries to the talk page more recent than one <i>year</i> prior to <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a>'s action, one of which stated explicitly that "this page <b>has no consensus in the first place</b>" (emphasis in the original). Shortly thereafter, the page was demoted to "proposed guideline" status by <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> on 2005-06-01, in part because "I'm not sure it (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) really got all that much attention". No response was made to <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a>'s message on the talk page; instead, <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> chose to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29&amp;diff=15321213&amp;oldid=15116619" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29&amp;diff=15321213&amp;oldid=15116619" rel="nofollow">restore guideline status</a> on 2005-06-13, with the edit summary "<i>Guideline - widely in use</i>", and no commentary on the talk page.</p>
<p>What kind of consensus process is this? Am I missing something—for example, did more discussion take place somewhere else, say at the Village Pump, or an RfC, or a project page? Or if this really is all there was to it, how can anyone say that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is supported by consensus? I'm almost ready to put a {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedtag_63ab.html" title="Template:Disputedtag">disputedtag</a>}} on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>—and it wouldn't be the first time that's been done, as I've also discovered by looking through the talk page archives. I've also just learned that the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="meta:Inclusionism">Inclusionists</a> typically regard <i>all</i> the notability guidelines as lacking consensus. —<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuromath_ffc9.html" title="User:Neuromath">Neuromath</a> 12:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, now you are hitting me with a subject where I have never been involved in. I am a bit busy at the moment, but I'll try and jot an answer.</dd>
<dd>I have looked through the pages and the archives, and though there are people adding comments on the article being disputed, I don't see much response to it (neither for nor against). For a dispute one needs a hot discussion, so when there is hardly any discussion, propositions and disputed tags can be removed after some days, apparently it is then not disputed, and noone is against a proposal. I see from the discussions this is a very difficult subject, and it is difficult to look onto it without making a choice. Guidelines are more loose than policies, I guess there is where it is at. Guidelines give you a way of thought, policies tell you what to do and not to do. In that regard, can a guideline be really disputed, it is no law?</dd>
<dd>I'll try and give this a bit more thought. You could try and start another discussion on the talk-page, but that has been done already quite some times, and there is no real conclusion coming out of most of them. I do think that Radiant! could have given a message in the edit summary and on the talkpage, but most of these being quite long ago, it is not really useful to ask for his thoughts then. Discussions on this subject are certainly going to attract a lot of people of both fields. Hope this helps for now. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 16:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for taking a look at these problems and giving me your thoughtful comments. I agree entirely that "this is a very difficult subject, and it is difficult to look onto it without making a choice"—it is <i>polarizing</i>, and I am rapidly becoming polarized (as an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="meta:Inclusionism">inclusionist</a>) from looking into it. According to discussion at <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Inclusionism#Wikipedia_Notability_Guideline_finally_under_fire" class="extiw" title="m:Talk:Inclusionism">m:Talk:Inclusionism#Wikipedia Notability Guideline finally under fire</a>, the basic <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> (<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>) guideline has a problematic history similar to what I have described for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, although I have not yet verified this for myself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to guidelines being "no law", I would <i>like</i> to take that position as regards the notability guidelines at least, but I don't think it's a real option; admins enforce them as if they were full-fledged policies. In fact, the admin who closed the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Melissa_Skirboll_ac49.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Melissa Skirboll">Melissa Skirboll AfD</a> with deletion cited <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>, which is just an essay and not even a guideline, as if it were authoritative. The <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism" class="extiw" title="meta:Inclusionism">inclusionists</a> say that much the same was often done with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> before <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> made it a guideline. (I'm happy to say that the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daniel_Avila_15fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Avila">Daniel Avila AfD</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Curtis_Warren_%28game_show_contestant%29_09bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Curtis Warren (game show contestant)">Curtis Warren AfD</a> closed without deletion, and the articles <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Avila_dc1b.html" title="Daniel Avila">Daniel Avila</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtis_Warren_%28game_show_contestant%29_d45b.html" title="Curtis Warren (game show contestant)">Curtis Warren</a> are still there.) And the overview document <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">WP:POL</a> doesn't really draw much of a distinction between guidelines and policies.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with consensus on guidelines (and policies) is this: suppose you have a non-authoritative essay on a polarizing issue like this one. Someone changes it to a guideline at a time when few people are paying attention. Then every newbie who comes into Wikipedia and looks at it sees the banner at the top of the page with the big green check-mark and the stern warning about the need to achieve consensus before making any changes; they assume (as I did at first!) that it must be as well-founded as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Once attention is focused on it, and its polarizing nature predictably divides Wikipedia into factions, the faction that favors the polarizing guideline points out that consensus must be achieved before changing it, and of course once polarization has occurred that will never happen. Yet how can it be legitimate to demand consensus for changing the guideline, or demoting it back to the status of an essay, when no consensus for making it a guideline ever existed in the first place? For these reasons, the history does seem relevant to me, no matter how long ago it was.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a> says that "'Silence equals consent' is the ultimate measure of consensus — somebody makes an edit and nobody objects or changes it. Most of the time consensus is reached as a natural product of the editing process." That may work well for articles, where anyone can make changes at any time, but I do not see how it can be legitimate for guidelines and policies bearing the check-mark banner, where consensus for changes is demanded <i>in advance</i> and the price of <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> editing or <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignoring all rules</a> may be paid in blocks and bans; under those circumstances, there will be a strong bias toward accepting the status quo, however questionable its origins. This is why I find the whole Wikipedian notion of consensus itself problematic, and not just the notability guidelines. Incidentally, there is a lively discussion going on right now in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EConsensus_dc23.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Consensus">Wikipedia talk:Consensus</a>; I haven't read all of it yet, and it isn't clear to me whether the issues I've just raised are being faced.</dd>

<p>that entire paragraph is thoroughly backed up by mainstream scientific references...it is all factual and all referenced with a brief outline of the various aspects of methamphetamine toxicity...i havnt much looked yet at ur contribs...yet my first glance tells me u just arent some meth &amp; amphetamine obsessive like konradG...so i take ur opinion a little more seriously...yet before u just remove a thoroughly referenced section u indeed should take it to the talk page...and explain which sentences are illogical...if there are some illogical sentences id want them cleaned up...anyways...im reverting that paragraph until u explain urself better on the talk page...then ill address ur concerns and revamp any illogical sentences...i somewhat regret getting into the middle of the meth page these last few days...i see its going to be defended aggressively by pro-meth people...so im getting out of it i think...its a waste of my time...yet go ahead and address ur specific concerns as yall baby that page up and take out all refernces to its harms...instead yall have the intro, of the drug of most concern in many places, basically just acknowledging its used medically...before i added in that its medical use is in very small quantities and recommended for very short time periods it was really a pathetic intro to that page...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 23:51, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>hi there! yes..i just added that sentence about reproduction recently and didnt spend much time on it...and i actually put it in as a "gift" to the more pro-meth editors of this page so theyd stop harassing me and the info &amp; links i put in showing its damaging effects...(as meth shows little harm to fetuses)...im not really editing that page much more i think...yet anyways i suppose it would be good to have broken that sentence up some...but reproduction i do think can refer to many varied things...an effect on reproduction can mean an effect on courtship, sex &amp; mating, the fetus, or child development...ie...(a problem at any stage negatively impacts a species reproduction)...its just a technical point...yet that is how i think of that...perhaps u think differently...as to "weasel words" i have to look that up...i changed the wording in some of those sentences to appease the meth defenders...i used to say "its considered dangerous" then conceded and put "many consider it dangerous"...i think there is enough evidence from many scientific and medical sources to say the previous more strongly worded version...yet i think ive given up trying to put in links to scientific studies that show negative effects from meth...theyve just been erased...its someone elses job now...theres plenty of pages out there without lobbies...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 01:02, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did <b>not</b> say that I was against this paragraph (but I am also not saying I am pro). You were the person who originally added that piece of information and it has since been heavily disputed, though only (mainly?) by one editor. Besides that dispute there are textual concerns on that paragraph as well. So from that point of view, the text has been removed, and I will keep on removing it until the dispute has been settled. Forcefully readding is not going to help you getting your point (I know that is a push-argument). Please rewrite the paragraph (as a hint: have a look at <a href="../../../m/o/s/Wp%7Emos.html" title="Wp:mos">wp:mos</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wp%7Ecite.html" title="Wp:cite">wp:cite</a> and others, I'm not in the field of this, just a 'plain' chemist, so I can't help you with the contents, only giving you this hint to help you make your point).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Street Names</span></h2>
<p>I understand where you are coming from. I have no actual proof that those are legitimate street names, but I have a case to argue. I feel that no citation should be needed for the addition of street names, and I say this because it varies. Street names vary from culture to culture, of which I am sure you are aware of. I feel that in order to provide the most accurate information about this topic there needs to be a diverse culture of editors. I hope that makes sense. Wikipedia is supposed to provide the most accurate information possible, and I am just trying to add to it. By adding certain slang names, it opens up people’s knowledge. Being a user myself, I feel that my information is VERY accurate, seeing as how I would use the terms on a daily basis. Sure there is no citation, but there is an addict that lived the lifestyle. That should be a citation enough. I hope you now understand where I am coming from.</p>
<p>Maybe you could help me find a good spot for the information.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../t/i/p/User%7ETiptonprisoner_930a.html" title="User:Tiptonprisoner">PulsHrd</a> 16:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. If it is a used streetname, there simply are references for it. I am sorry, but information is not accurate because the person that adds it says so, accuracy should be measured by <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">reliable sources</a>.</dd>
<dd>That street names vary from culture to culture indeed is known, and I am not saying that we should not have streetnames in articles, they indeed are a welcome addition. The thing is only, what if I am a vandal, and I want to add the streetname 'mobile' to the list of MDMA-streetnames (I could add a whole list of common objects that people carry around when being in the street, and I have seen that happening) .. from your point of view, you would not contest that. Now seen the seriousness that you have in editing the article, and since you have taken the effort to open a wikipedia account, I don't think you are a vandal, but still the same principle would apply.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Point for Discussion</span></h2>
<p>The mention in your article regarding the gas vapour density effect on its behaviour is correct if it relates to pure H2S which is not very common. At the low concentrations normally associated with this gas the characteristics of the carrying fluid (liquid or gas) have the greater influence.</p>
<p>10,000ppm = 1% i.e. 99% of something else.</p>
<p>It is found in low lying areas when it is associated with a liquid. The main influences in the hydrocarbon and Petrochem industries on the gas behaviour is the velocity of any pressurised leak of the carrying gas (e.g. methane) and wind speed and direction. A pressurised leak also causes turbulence resulting in a mixing of the gas with the atmosphere producing further dilution often resulting in a gas air mixture with a vapour density close to that of air.</p>
<p>However it is still possible to see procedures advising people to gain height during an H2S emergency which would be tragic if they were above a leak with an upward velocity or they ran down-wind towards higher ground.</p>

They also have numerous references. I appreciate your fervor and effort, but believe in this case that it was misdirected. <a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Spencer_cced.html" title="User:J.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">QW RS?</span></h2>
<p>There is only a few dubious sources heavily discussed on the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quackwatch.html" title="Quackwatch">Quackwatch</a> talk page that infer that Quackwatch is not a RS. Quoting a non-RS source that states that something else is "not RS" is a tautology. So either it is just because of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> (which I found odd, given the hysteria over Thiomersal in general) or not. RS has little to do with it (IMO). However in saying that, there needs to be a far bit of link pruning BUT since the scientific evidence (ie/ RS) overwhelms the scaremongering (ie/ not-RS), the ELs should reflect this. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShot_info_7854.html" title="User:Shot info">Shot info</a> 00:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good advice. As far as verifiablity and notability, Quackwatch is certainly verifiable and notable. A search for Quackwatch will quickly reveal that it is universally despised by promoters of products and methods that are not mainstream (IOW alternative medicine, most of whom are likely quite innocent of any crimes), as well as various scammers and and con artists, and it is very commonly used and linked to in a favorable manner by libraries, universities, government agencies, consumer agencies, scientists, physicians, etc..</dd>

<dd>So its notability is not in question: either one is for it or against it. Anyone who knows anything about consumer protection and alternative medicine (from either POV) is aware of Quackwatch. One could say it parts the waters in debates on such subjects. It is either notable or notorious, depending on one's POV....;-) That's why there is a very strong movement here at Wikipedia to delete it, and obviously there are also attempts to counteract such actions. Unfortunately scientists and physicians are usually hard at work at real jobs, while just about anyone can edit Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>(undent)Indeed, to use it as a reference has to be judged case by case. It depends strongly on how the sentence that is using this site as a source is written. This source (and many others) are secondary sources of information, in many cases the references used are a better source than the article itself. The problem is, anyone can write a page with complete rubbish, backed up by many references, that does not make that page reliable. Though there are of course many pages that are reliable information, but you need reliable, 3rd party sources to again back that up.</p>
<p>Still, I don't believe that such links should be in the external links section of the page (<b>even</b> when third parties back it up, it then deserves being used as a reference), that does not give a clear and good description of the POV of the EL. And the pure fact that a reliable source exists does not mean it <b>has</b> to be used as an EL (also covered in the EL-guideline). Links invite more links to be added, the level slowly going down. Hope this clarifies my point. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 13:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So rather than the list of excuses you used to justify your deletion, there is only one reason why you don't want it there and that's because you prefer the number of ELs be reduced. I agree with you on this point but I disagree with your wikilawyering to justify it. It only invites editors to point out the errors in the logic. Note that you should be using some more RS and V to check through the other ELs on the list.

<dd>I see you are up against an established editor. I guess it is better if you keep low profile, and play their game. I know it is not how it should be (I see he ignores all your questions on his talkpage), but if a straight approach does not work ... Just start a topic on the talkpage for every subject you want to change, explain the case, provide the references. See how they react, and be patient with them. The list is controversial, and that indeed means that things have to be discussed before a change is applied.

<p>Hi Dirk,</p>
<p>I have some comments/questions regarding this external link on the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Sildenafil.html" title="Sildenafil">sildenafil</a> page, which was deleted, and I restored, and you deleted again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usrf.org/breakingnews/bn_111202_viagra/bn_111202_viagra.html" class="external free" title="http://www.usrf.org/breakingnews/bn_111202_viagra/bn_111202_viagra.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usrf.org/breakingnews/bn_111202_viagra/bn_111202_viagra.html</a></p>
<p>I'm all for keeping Wikipedia clean, beautiful, and free from debris, and I try to do my part by picking off linkspam and other bad stuff when I see it. And I can appreciate the need to keep a tight rein on external links, especially on a page vulnerable to spammers and commercial exploitation. But I disagree that this particular link contributes to the "linkfarm" factor, and I think it does provide worthwhile and credible information for what it is. I imagine some others agree, since that link has been there for years, and given the level of scrutiny this page receives, I doubt it would have survived if it were without merit. Of course, longevity doesn't necessarily mean anything in itself, so let me explain my view and my reasoning in restoring the link.</p>
<p>The content (debunking common misconceptions about the drug, first-hand subjective experiences of users) isn't found in the sildenafil article or in any of the other external link sources, and it's relevant, useful, non-trivial, and presented in an accessible manner. This is significant, especially considering that many of the people who come to the sildenafil page will be researching the drug because they intend to use it themselves. The drug factsheet or even the official drug site doesn't address these topics or provide this information. These are relevant details, but obviously not suitable for the article text, so including an external link that addresses them makes sense.</p>
<p>As far as it being a reliable or authorative source on the topic, granted, the Wall Street Journal health column wouldn't be considered a scientific or medical authority (and Howstuffworks.com is?). But it's not making that claim, and in this case, I think a more liberal definition of "reliable" or verifiable is justified. The focus of the piece is on users' concerns and experiences, not the hard (pardon the pun) science. And in that context, I think WSJ and the sources they cite can be considered credible and accurate. Plus, the link is from the website of a urological organization, so it's passed some professional/medical scrutiny.</p>
<p>I think it's worthwhile to judiciously include some non-scholarly sources in external links for otherwise scientific or medical articles, if the links address relevant issues and augment existing links. With all due respect, I don't understand how this particular link is in conflict with Wikipedia guidelines. If you still have objections to my restoring the link, I'd appreciate it if you could elaborate on how you see the guidelines applying here and why this sort of link should not be included, or point out what it is that I'm not getting.</p>

<dd>Thanks, it is nice to see a good explanation why one would like to include an external link (with this discussion on the talkpage, I might even have left it there). Might have.</dd>
<dd>WP:EL addresses WP:RS, external links should be reliable sources. For as far sildenafil is concerned, that page is always problematic with external links, generally, when there are external links, more get added, and when the links get to the 'loose end', that standard drops and drops. I do believe we should draw a line (and when there are more below that line, these should simply go). Wikipedia is not a linkfarm, external links should be kept to a minimum, etc. etc. (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>).</dd>
<dd>I'd suggest, write a paragraph with a similar explanation, using the data in the article (cite it properly). Back it up with more reliable sources. Hope this helps.

<p>I have personally experienced nightmares taking 5-HTP. I came across the 5-HTP page by Dr. Sahelian who has written a book on this topic and he happens to clearly mention that a side effect of 5-HTP is vivid dreams and nightmares. Perhaps you should try the 5-HTP yourself and see that you will have vivid dreams the first night you take it. In my opinion people reading the 5-HTP page on wikipedia should be aware of this side effect and it is a disservice to the readers not to have this information.

<dd>Salut,</dd>
<dd>I had a quick look, but I could not download (yet, probably, account seemed not to be active, I'll try again later). Let me say, it looks quite nifty, does this work on *nix type systems (and then I mean, can I create documents in a text-editor, and incorporate these images, and if I give that document to someone else can they then still see the images? Would this work for documents that one sends for official publications (ACS, RSC, Wiley ..)? But those questions are besides the point here.</dd>
<dd>Basically, I <i>do</i> like the possibility to incorporate chemical drawings in wikipedia, but I don't think that it is an application that is going to be accepted by the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Special%7EVersion_d75c.html" title="Special:Version">programmers</a> of the mediawiki-software. I am trying to get a wikipedia based search engine to run (a special:chemicalsources, working like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" title="Special:Booksources">special:booksources</a>), and they already think that that is too specific, to specialistic. That does not mean, that such functionality should not be written (I have written the specialpage), an extension to the software might be very good for chemistry specific wikipedia. The way to go would be to write the extension, find a way to store the data in the wikipedia database, and to upload a patch to bugzilla. From that moment you will have to nag developers to incorporate you patch in svn (step 1), and after that try and see if the main developers (Brion and Tim) are willing to enable it on wikipedia (I don't know if you have a big chance there). At that point the software is available to other users, and people running their own wiki (like me), or chemistry wiki's can choose to activate the extension, and use the software. I guess you will have to start <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" class="external text" title="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" rel="nofollow">here</a></dd>
<dd>You could leave this message also at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Chemicals_6167.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Chemicals">wikipedia:wikiproject Chemicals</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Chemistry_cbe8.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Chemistry">wikipedia:wikiproject Chemistry</a> and see how they respond. I guess there will be more that like that idea.</dd>
<dd>I saw that you created some documents on chemaxon. As a person working for a company, you have to be careful with that, wikipedia strictly adheres to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and all the other policies and guidelines. I don't know what the text was in the document, but either the document should not tell anything, and you should rely on others to expand (which may take quite some time, and until that, people might delete for lack of notability). Another option is to put the page on a request-list (there is a link when you go to a non-existent page. Hope this helps.

<p>Right, sorry! I though it might break the syntax if I left empty fields in. Congrats on your work on the template by the way. I also have one question, if you don't mind answering it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't suppose there's a way for the template to use the "simplified" molecular formula fields, as in {{<a href="../../../d/r/u/Template%7EDrugbox_2667.html" title="Template:Drugbox">Drugbox</a>}} (which format subscripts, color elements and link to element pages)—I think that's a template itself, but I'm not sure.</li>

<p>Thanks in advance. If the template's good to go, I'll start adding it to compound pages without a chembox&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/v/a/User%7EFvasconcellos_4804.html" title="User:Fvasconcellos">Fvasconcellos</a> 01:21, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The old template broke with empty fields, indeed (well, broke, you saw empty sub-boxes). Things have now been designed in such a way that everything is invisible, except when it has data. So you can use it if you want, already. {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">Chembox new</a>}} contains a bit of a manual, maybe that helps. If you really see something missing, just poke me.</dd>
<dd>I saw that part of the drugbox, I have not given that much of a look. I think it must be possible to do the same here (if I want all chemboxes to be replaced by the {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}}, I think I will have to look into that as well). Although, for a chembox that would mean ALL elements .. hmm. And I personally hate the element colourings there. I see that drugbox does a lot of categorisation as well, so there is also work there to be done!</dd>
<dd>I am busy 'stealing' as many fields as I can get. Not all that the {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}} can handle is shown, I try to use only the optimal fields, where I can get most out of the parameters (e.g. I prefer 'ATCCode_prefix' and 'ATCCode_suffix', though it does understand 'ATCCode' as well). Hope this helps. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 01:37, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, yes... most pharmaceuticals are composed of a limited range of elements, I hadn't thought of <i>all</i> elements being needed here. The element colors don't seem very popular, but they are quite a useful visual aid when the drugbox has a ball-and-stick or space-filling model. Say, you're not thinking of replacing Drugbox with Chembox new, are you? I've grown quite attached to it&#160;:D Thanks for the help. <a href="../../../f/v/a/User%7EFvasconcellos_4804.html" title="User:Fvasconcellos">Fvasconcellos</a> 13:56, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It would give some interesting possibilities when doing that (counting per element), and I am thinking about the possibility, but I have to get to it (it is possible to calculate the molecular weight automagically when providing the separate elements!). It does almost all the things that the other common boxes do, so I guess I am getting there. There are still some 'hidden features' to be programmed, and maybe this falls under that (give them formula to fill in, but for the selected few, have C, H, N fields ready which overrule the other fields, the former is needed anyway in some cases, non-stoichiometric compounds e.g.)</dd>
<dd>About replacing .. well, actually, yes .. I am thinking about that, kill all boxes and replace them with one standard box, all the same all through the wikipedia. People know what to expect, people know where to find the data. I know that for some chemicals they can be connected to one specific field, but others ..? But we'll have to discuss this, I hope some people give their point of view after my post on the chemistry wikiproject. The old boxes are still there. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 14:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">again commercial links on chemical pages</span></h2>
<p>It was discussed again and again. It was said some links might be permissible. <i>see Mdwyer 05:50, 9 September 2006</i></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mdwyer, I did not remove the links, that was DrBird/71.245.157.18. There are problems with external links, there have been extensive discussions on that. A solution that is underway (though I still need a Wikipedia-programmer), would be a page like special:booksources, which would load Wikipedia:Chemical sources. For now, there is the template</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemical_sources_67a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemical sources">Links to external chemical sources</a>, which enables to remove commercial links, <i><b>but I do not remove links which directly link to the compounds property pages</b></i> (I do remove links to companies homepages or similar, non-specific pages). --Dirk Beetstra T C 07:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I knew you weren't removing them. I was actually replying to DrBird, and I hijacked your page for a discussion. Sorry about that. In any case, I'm not familiar enough with the guts of the code to do more than just keep manually reverting things when I find them. The link DrBird keeps adding doesn't look like it fits WP:EL. <i><b>The Fermentek ones seem valid to me</b></i>. In other cases where I'm not sure, I will often move them with a note in the talk pages so someone can put them back if they think they are valid. --Mdwyer 05:50, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>DrBird is adding links to his own site, these do not comply WP:EL, moreover, these links did not link to the chemical property page, but to a general page. Links to chemical property sheets on commercial websites are not necessarily wrong, they give extra info, which is still necessary on many chemical pages. I see DrBird is still pushing, I will revert all his edits when he only adds or removes links in the 'external links' section (but I am going on holiday). --Dirk Beetstra T C 06:50, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Now I see you have launched a crusade against all of them. You contradict your own expressed opinion. Maybe reconsider?</p>
<p>In any case I will go on mentioning and linking to the pages that the data have been copied from (on permission of course). It is a matter of honesty. Please visit here: <a href="http://www.fermentek.co.il/09-copyright-statement.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fermentek.co.il/09-copyright-statement.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Now also consider that: You might have noticed Fermentek does not offer its products to individuals, nor does it publish or compare prices.</p>
<p>In any case, I think you will not object to linking to corresponding MSDS pages from wiki chemical articles.</p>

<dd>My support goes stronger and stronger towards removing all commercial links from chemical pages, there are many, non commercial sites available. The template {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChemicalSources_9571.html" title="Template:ChemicalSources">ChemicalSources</a>}} is available, and requests for enabling a special:chemicalsources has been made, and I have asked several times for support of that. Note that the terms that are used are 'might', 'not necessarily wrong' .. I know that Fermentek is not offering to individuals, but there are many chemists using the site, and for them this can still be explained as advertisement. Please consider <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> in that light. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 14:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just to be sure, some of the MSDS's are also available from non-commercial sources, maybe these are a better EL? --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 15:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Another sentence to reply to, it is indeed honest to mention the pages where you found the data, that is even very good, but in that case they should be mentioned as references, preferably using the <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> mechanisms available. Just as a sidenote, many of the compounds would really benefit from a chembox or a drugbox (both provide the same functionality), these also link directly into the online databases (PubChem, CAS, MeSH, KEGG, ChEBI, eMolecules, etc.), where, probably (and for some I am sure because I did check whether the information was available non-commercial), more information can be found. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 15:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
