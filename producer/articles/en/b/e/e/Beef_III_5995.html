<p>Bang 'Em Smurf and <a href="../../../5/0/_/50_Cent_813c.html" title="50 Cent">50 Cent</a> were very close friends together when Bang Em' Smurf &amp; Domination were signed to 50's <a href="../../../g/-/u/G-Unit_Records_eac6.html" title="G-Unit Records">G-Unit Records</a>. However, the friendship would come to an end when Bang 'Em Smurf was arrested for possession of a firearm and was expecting 50 Cent to come bail him out, which 50 Cent didn't. Bang 'Em Smurf had to mortgage his own mothers house to pay for bail. While Bang 'Em Smurf was imprisoned, Domination started to record diss records against 50's disrespect. While 50 Cent and some of the G-Unit crew were performing at a concert in 50's hometown, Domination and some of his men attended the concert to make a message that they were there to get revenge. 50 Cent knew that Domination and his men were there so while 50 was on stage, he walked to the left side to grab a water bottle, took a couple of sips and threw the water out on Domination and his men. It was then Domination and his men grabbed chairs and threw them at 50 and his entourage on the stage, while the police also came on stage to try and stop the heated engagement.</p>

They both became very popular for their quick, rapid-fire style of rapping delivery. The beef started with a dispute over who originated this style. Bone Thugs say that Twista did not come out with the rapid-fire style. Krayzie Bone elaborated and said "yeah he came spittin it a hundred miles an hour but he wasn't adding the harmony like us". Later on peace was made and the beef is now over.</p>

Nelly decided to take Chingy with him on tour, but Chingy felt that Nelly was trying to take all the fame and keep him under his wings, to Chingy's dissatisfaction. Because of lack of recognition, Chingy became disenchanted.

Nelly also felt disrespected by Chingy, stating to the press that Chingy never gave credit to Nelly because of the success he was having. Nelly also claims that he invented the word "Derrrty", Chingy says he's a liar and the people have been saying "Derrrty" since back in the day.</p>

During the concert, the crowd were really getting pumped and excited by the music, then the <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando_Police_Department_08a2.html" title="Orlando Police Department">local police</a> stepped in. They gave Scrappy a warning, because he took his shirt off (which made female fans even more aggressive). The reasoning for this was because the police were afraid of a potential <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riot</a>. They stated that if Scrappy were to do something like this they would cancel the concert. Then, Scrappy did a stagedive, which made the police react and they entered the stage and stopped the music. An officer then bumped into Lil Scrappy's manager making him angry. The same officer then rushed over to Lil Scrappy and pushes him off stage.</p>

<p>They were both doing a photoshoot for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Source_%28magazine%29_e5b1.html" title="The Source (magazine)">The Source</a>. Then producer <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Fury_36c8.html" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a> asked T.I. to do a verse on <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lil_Flip_0aab.html" title="Lil Flip">Lil Flip</a>'s "Game Over" remix, so T.I. discussed this with Lil Flip and his record label, and decided to do it. However, Lil Flip then tells him that it is already done and T.I. couldn't be on it. After that, T.I. becomes arrested and went to jail for a parole violation. The feud escalated there after, including when T.I. visited Lil Flip's <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston%2C_Texas_c0fa.html" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a> neighborhood, (which led to an altercation between each rapper's entourages) until it eventually died out. They both made amends shortly after The Game and 50 Cent did so in similar fashion (although Lil Flip's and T.I.'s beef has stayed settled).</p>

<p>When Beef III finished production, the beef between 50 Cent and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Game_%28rapper%29_14c6.html" title="The Game (rapper)">The Game</a> was thought to be over (or everted from higher levels). Beef III ended with the truce the two rappers had held in New York City, where they each donated over $200,000 dollars to charity. This documentary ended with the feeling that for now it looked like an East vs. West rivalry was avoided. There was somewhat of a cliffhanger when in the end the DVD stated that at least <i>for now</i> a coast vs. coast beef was gone. Since Beef III was released, the rivalry had actually intensified leading to some heavy disses especially on Game's part, including the 15 minute-long "<a href="../../../3/0/0/300_Bars_%26_Runnin%27_3a69.html" title="300 Bars &amp; Runnin'">300 Bars &amp; Runnin'</a>," which is seen as the pinnacle of Game's career to his fans, and a gimmick to those of G-Unit and Roc-a-Fella. In an extended interview found in the extras portion of this DVD, Game further explained his dissatisfaction with 50 Cent and G-Unit, including footage of a concert where Game performed at <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giants_Stadium_3dd9.html" title="Giants Stadium">Giants Stadium</a> in East Rutherford, New Jersey (just eight miles across the Hudson River from New York City), in which he threw his G-Unit chain into the back row of the crowd.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef_III_5995.html" title="Edit section: The Game vs. Yukmouth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Game vs. Yukmouth</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukmouth.html" title="Yukmouth">Yukmouth</a> first met The Game at a club, at the time Yukmouth was engaged in a feud with 50 Cent and G-Unit. The Game released a diss track aimed at the rapper over the "<a href="../../../i/_/g/I_Got_5_on_It_139b.html" title="I Got 5 on It">I Got 5 on It</a>" beat, a song which Yukmouth recorded when he was a part of <a href="../../../l/u/n/Luniz.html" title="Luniz">Luniz</a>. Yukmouth responded with a track that mocked The Game's appearance on <i>Change of Heart</i>. The two later tried to bury the hatchet, due to a personal friend and even recorded a song together, named "Peace". However the beef continued afterworth, since The Game dissed Yukmouth on the 'Peace' song (they recorded their verses separately). Since then, The Game responded by claiming he was invited to <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fabolous.html" title="Fabolous">Fabolous</a>'s "<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breath.html" title="Breath">Breath</a>" video and which Yukmouth attended. Once The Game arrived at the video shoot arguements started until guns were pulled out and the police came. Upon leaving apparently The Game smacked Yukmouth upside the head and up close two times and Yukmouth was quickly escorted out. The Game then released a song called "Running" commenting on the event saying he smacked him once, twice and almost a third until he quickly ran out like a bitch and hasn't said nothing since. The feud has died down from no response to this song from Yukmouth and The Game won the feud.</p>
