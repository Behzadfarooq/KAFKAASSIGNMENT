<div align="center" style="color:#FF0000"><b>ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL</b></div>
<p>There are several discussions about my link removal here, and in my archives. If you want to contact me about my view of this policy, please read and <b>understand</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, and read the discussions on my talkpage or in my archives <b>first</b>.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">My view in a nutshell:<br />
External links are not meant to tunnel people away from the wikipedia.</div>
<br />
<p>Hence, I will remove external links on pages where I think they do not add to the page (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>), or when they are added in a way that <i>wikipedia</i> defines as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a> (understand that wikipedia defines spam as: '... wide-scale external link spamming ...', even if the link <i>is</i> appropriate; also read <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#External_link_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">this</a>). This may mean that I remove links, while similar links are already there or which are there already for a long time. Still, the question is not whether your link should be there, the question <i>may</i> be whether those other links should be there (again, see the wording of the policies and guidelines).</p>
<p>Please consider the alternatives before readding the link:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the link contains information, use the information to add <i>content</i> to the article, and use the link as a reference (content is not 'see <a href="http://www.example.org" class="external text" title="http://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information').</li>
<li>Add an appropriate linkfarm like {{<a href="../../../d/m/o/Template%7EDmoz_e80e.html" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>}} (you can consider to remove other links covered in the dmoz.</li>
<li>Incorporate the information into one of the sister projects.</li>
<li>Add the link to other mediawiki projects aimed at advertiseing (see e.g. <a href="http://www.aboutus.org" class="external text" title="http://www.aboutus.org" rel="nofollow">this</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the linkspam of a certain link perseveres, I will not hesitate to report it to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">wikiproject spam</a> for blacklisting (even <i>if</i> the link would be appropriate for wikipedia). It may be wise to consider the <i>before</i> things get to that point.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">The answer in a nutshell<br />
Please consider if the link you want to add complies with the policies and guidelines.</div>
<br />
<p>Pertaining links on pages about chemicals: If the link is a regular source of chemicals, consider adding the link to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemical_sources_67a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemical sources">wikipedia:chemical sources</a>, and add the template {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChemicalSources_9571.html" title="Template:ChemicalSources">ChemicalSources</a>}} to the external links sections of the chemicals' page(s) (when not there). If you would like to see my proposed special:chemicalsources be activated, please vote for <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" rel="nofollow">bug 7514 on bugzilla</a>.</p>
<p>If you have other questions, or still have questions on my view of the external link policy, disagree with me, or think I made a mistake in removing a link you added, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">please poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a>.

<div align="center"><b>Reliable sources</b></div>
<p>I convert inline URL's into references and convert referencing styles to a consistent format. My preferred style is the style provided by <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">cite.php</a> (&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;references/&gt;). When other mechanisms are mainly (but not consistently) used (e.g. {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}}-templates) I will assess whether referencing would benefit from the cite.php-style. Feel free to revert these edits when I am wrong.</p>
<p>Converting inline URLs in references may result in data being retrieved from <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">unreliable sources</a>. In these cases, the link may have been removed, and replaced by a {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}}. If you feel that the page should be used as a reference (complying with <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>!!), please discuss that on the talkpage of the page, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a></p>
<p>Note: I am working with some other developers on mediawiki to expand the possibilities of cite.php, our attempts can be followed <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you like these features and want them enabled, please vote for these bugs.</p>

<div align="center"><b>Stub/Importance/Notability/Expand/Expert</b></div>
<p>I am in general against deletion, except when the page really gives misinformation, is clear spam or copyvio. Otherwise, these pages may need to be expanded or rewritten. For very short articles there are the different {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} marks, which clearly state that the article is to be expanded. For articles that do not state why they are notable, I will add either {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}. In my view there is a distinct difference between these two templates, while articles carrying one of these templates <i>may</i> not be notable, the first template does say the <i>article</i> is probably notable enough, but the <i>contents</i> does not state that (yet). The latter provides a clear concern that the article is not notable, and should probably be {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}ed or {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_4f30.html" title="Template:AfD">AfD</a>}}ed. Removing importance-tags does not take away the backlog, it only hides from attention, deleting pages does not make the database smaller. If you contest the notability/importance of an article, please consider adding an {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">expert-subject</a>}} tag, or raise the subject on an appropriate wikiproject. Remember, there are many, many pages on the wikipedia, many need attention, so maybe we have to live with a backlog.</p>
<p>Having said this, I generally delete the {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}}-template on sight. The template is in most cases superfluous, expansion is intrinsic to the wikipedia (for stubs, expansion is already mentioned in <i>that</i> template).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The importance tag</span></h2>
<p>I do agree with you about the stance of the importance tag. Is there a way to move those articles out of the <a href="../../../n/n/_/CAT%7ENN_ff0e.html" title="CAT:NN">CAT:NN</a> category? Or better yet, could there be another category formed placing the articles with unclear notability in it and the articles with unclear importance in another? <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiez2_aaaf.html" title="User:Diez2">Diez2</a> 01:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, and by the way, I didn't remove the importance tag on those chemical formulas that you had to reinstate, just to let you know. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiez2_aaaf.html" title="User:Diez2">Diez2</a> 01:12, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I saw you did not remove the importance tags, those were removed together with the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}.</dd>
<dd>The best way to get them out of <a href="../../../n/n/_/CAT%7ENN_ff0e.html" title="CAT:NN">CAT:NN</a> would be to improve the articles and add the importance they have; some of these articles may indeed not be notable enough and should be removed. The <a href="../../../n/n/_/CAT%7ENN_ff0e.html" title="CAT:NN">CAT:NN</a> for June becomes smaller and smaller, and now the difficult ones surface (and apparently a big number of them are chemical compounds in June). I have already suggested a couple of times, that the assessment of that should be done by people in an appropriate wikiproject, not by 'random' wikipedians (nothing personal). I would be in favour of creating a {{importance-expert}} (parameters subject &amp; date; in a way a combination of the {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">expert-subject</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}}). Articles in the backlog <a href="../../../n/n/_/CAT%7ENN_ff0e.html" title="CAT:NN">CAT:NN</a> could then be moved to that tag and the wikiprojects can then be asked to actually start working on that backlog.</dd>
<dd>Splitting up the category in 'unclear importance' and 'unclear notability' does not really take away the backlog, just a fresh one is being created. Moreover, some of these articles may indeed be not-notable enough.</dd>
<dd>Another consideration; we have a backlog, and there are articles that need work. These are quite pressing but maybe we have to consider that that backlog should just be there until the articles are improved.</dd>
<dd>Is there a place where we could keep this discussion but where we have a bigger audience, <a href="../../../w/p/n/WP%7EWPNN_977f.html" title="WP:WPNN">the notability wikiproject</a> seems to stay quiet on this subject, and it is bound to surface again in a couple of weeks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Paris Sud</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I apologise if my posting a link to my site "Paris Sud" is considered spam, however, this site contains articles about the local area to the south of Paris including départments:</p>
<pre>
   * Paris
   * Hauts-de-Seine
   * Val-de-Marne
   * Yvelines
   * Essonne
   * Seine-et-Marne
</pre>
<p>The idea is to cater for residents who speak English, although obviously all French speakers are welcome to visit and participate. We organise get togethers as well.</p>
<p>My link is not to our group, however, but to our site where factual information concerning all aspects of life in the southern banlieue of Paris are displayed. This is why my link to this site has been added to the various places in the region featured on the Wikipedia site.</p>
<p>If you feel that this has nothing to do with Wikipedia then I will respect your decision and cease to post my link, even if this could be interesting to visitors of the local area, as per current links where I have posted.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>John Nelson. <a href="http://parissud.wordpress.com" class="external text" title="http://parissud.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Paris Sud</a></p>

<dd>Thanks for the remark. I reverted because you were only adding the link, which is, under the wikipdia definition, considered [WP:SPAM|spam]]. I am sorry about that. Regarding the link itself, you were adding a link to the homepage of the site, not to information that is symmetrically and directly connected to the subject of the page. If the site contains good information (which might very well be possible; please check with [WP:RS]] and <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>), consider adding content to the pages, and add the site as a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">reference</a>.

<dd>Moderator .. hmm .. new function in wikipedia. I don't seem to have had an earlier contact with this person. His additions look like the additions by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.164.55.34_2154.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.164.55.34">203.164.55.34</a> (see discussion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Beetstra#Removal_of_external_links" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Beetstra#Removal_of_external_links" rel="nofollow">here</a>). I think I have been misinterpreted here, I did not say to that person that he could add the links in the text, I told him to consider adding content, and using the site as a reference.

<p>Hi again Dirk, Have just seen the above entry by Moondyne, about my links. Didn't notice it at first. My apologies if I misunderstood what you said about text and references. I thought you meant that it was ok to put a link in a piece of text. Silly me. As I said, I won't be adding anymore external links, but how Moondyne can say that my links were "blatant linkspam" is beyond me. My links have all provided relevant info that was of general interest. It looks to me like some of these people just like to go on a witch-hunt, burning links wherever they find them. Got nothing better to do, people? Neilrobertpaton 11:42, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">external links</span></h2>
<p>Hi Dirk, Do you know who Moondyne is? He took me to task over some links I added. I was interested to know if he actually has any authority in these matters. The subject of external links seems to be a tricky one at Wiki. All the links I have contributed have been deleted, even though they don't fit the Wiki definition of spam, which is that spam is there to promote a website. My links were not there to promote a site; they were there to provide info which is relevant to the subject and of interest to readers. However, I have decided to take the hint. I have accepted that Wiki doesn't want external links, so I won't do any more. Personally, I think the real reason is that they don't want the competition. If I provide a link to an external site which has information of interest to readers, that site is then in competoition with Wiki. Obviously, they don't want that. I've learned my lesson. No more external links, unless I discuss them with you first. I want to be a constructive contributor to Wiki, so from now on I'll behave myself. Neilrobertpaton 11:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll answer both posts here.</dd>
<dd>The way you were adding is regarded <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a> under the wikipedia definition (first line: "... wide-scale external link spamming, ...") I am sorry, but the link you provide does not comply with <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, pictures can be incorporated into wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>About witchhunt. In a way, yes. I do concur, we all have better things to do, but wikipedia has the policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and the guidelines <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and I am afraid that some people have to 'close the floodgates'. Currently there are 5.98932 links added <i>per minute</i>. Many of these (if you see the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-en-spam" class="external text" title="irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-en-spam" rel="nofollow">feed on IRC</a>) are to sites where one could ask, whether or not these sites should be <i>linked</i> anyway (per <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>); external links tunnel people away from the wikipedia, information should be incorporated into the wikipedia, not linked. About the only reasons (in short) to add a link is to a) attribute a claim in the content and b) when the external site provides information that cannot be incorporated, all others are, most of the time, unnecessary.</dd>
<dd>You don't have to ask me explicitly for every link you add. If you read the policies and guidelines, you will see what is appropriate, and what not. A link to the official site of someone, fine; <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">reference</a> to a newsitem on a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">good source</a>, fine as well. But links to picture sites are most of the time not-done; when you own the picture (or the picture is free), upload the picture and use it in the text (it makes the article better). If in doubt, ask on the articles talkpage, or indeed, ask me or someone else at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WT%7EEL_716d.html" title="WT:EL">WT:EL</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">link to educational website</span></h2>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I recently submitted a revised article "<b>caligo</b>" and added a link to the website <b>www.learnaboutbutterflies.com</b>, but the link was removed.</p>
<p>Please be assured that <b>the website exists purely as an educational tool</b>, it's purpose is to educate visitors regarding the anatomy, taxonomy, biology, ecology and conservation of butterflies and their habitats across the world. It is entirely non-profit making, and provides a huge amount of educational material. It is invaluable to anyone with an interest in butterflies, and includes a considerable amount of educational information. I feel therefore that the link should be allowed to remain, and would also like to add the link to the "butterfly" article.</p>
<p>The link reads as follows :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learnaboutbutterflies.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.learnaboutbutterflies.com/" rel="nofollow">learnaboutbutterflies.com</a> - promoting the conservation of butterflies and their habitats worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is unacceptable, would the simpler link as follows be acceptable ?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Noham Chomsky</span></h2>
<p>Hello Mr. Dirk - I recently added a link to Noham Chomsky's page to the video of his talk at one of his visit - the reason for this was thaht the quality of that contribution is at least on the level (if not better) of the other link to his talks and interviews in the same section. Therefore I'd suggest to have this link on the page.</p>

<dd>As I also pointed out in our earlier discussion above, the way these links were added is, under the wikipedia definition, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a>.

<dd>Sigh. We are currently operating under a link addition rate of 5.7558277 links added per minute. You were spamming your link across these pages in combination with good edits. I decided to clean up after you, resulting in your links being removed. You were notified for the first time about policies and guidelines more than a month ago, and warned not to add your link and read the policies. You added your link again after I asked you to read the policies and guidelines (that first message of today was not an official warning, because I wanted to give you a chance to review your actions; the following messages were official warnings). I have redlisted your site as well as the other links, and I have generated a report on them. I am sorry that we noticed your conflict of interest and spamming and that we hence cleaned too many your links. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 15:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did not see the note from a month ago and was unaware of these policies until your first note today. The links I re-added were those that had been there before, not the ones recently added and I explained why. When you rejected them I did not attempt to re-add them. I was not notified that we were in any peril of an "official" warning. It therefore seems inappropriate for a "report" to be made or a "redlisting" (not sure what that is). Please advise.</p>
<p>Figuring out the system a bit better. In my talk history see no record of a communication from you before today. As I indicated I saw none, but unless I am misunderstanding something about how things work, the month ago communication you mentioned does not appear to have made it. Anyway, look forward to your response on the last paragraph.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Demographia (<a href="../../../d/e/m/User_talk%7EDemographia_301d.html" title="User talk:Demographia">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Demographia_af0b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Demographia">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>(edit conflict)The note was on your talkpage (it was not posted by me, but the welcome message is there since 31 Jan 2007; posted by <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">user:Francs2000</a>), you had the chance to read them (even without that message, they are also linked via the wikipedia mainpage). I will replace it with a more elaborate one shortly.</dd>
<dd>Redlisting just means that we now notice when these links are added to the wikipedia. Just an attention thingy.</dd>
<dd>Demographia.com and citypopulation.de have a list on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_LinkSearch_demographia.com_d84b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkSearch/demographia.com">Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkSearch/demographia.com</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_LinkSearch_citypopulation.de_7edd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkSearch/citypopulation.de">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spam/LinkSearch/citypopulation.de</a> respectively. This is also an attention thing. If we see them going up quickly, we might look through the pages and decide to clean (especially when they are not used appropriately, or if they are spammed).</dd>
<dd>The two last messages on your talkpage are more official good-faith warnings. You got these to draw your attention to the policies and guidelines. These links also provide the alternatives (ranging from reaching consensus on talkpages to being blocked from editing and blacklisting of the sites in question). They wear of in time (order of days to weeks), nothing to worry about if you read and follow the policies and guidelines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just general, Wikipedia is in the first place an encyclopedia, written by many people. Its purpose is to incorporate information, not to add external links to tunnel people away from the site (however appropriate the link may be). When adding content for which one has used a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> one can add references (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>); again, the target should not be to tunnel people away, it should be to give people the opportunity to <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">verify</a> the information). For the few things that cannot be incorporated an external link can be added (but still, it is not really necessary; the information may just not be necessary for the article to become better). So instead of saying "London is a busy city. More information can be found here: link", consider "London is a busy city, at the beginning of 2007 the city had a population of xx million.(appropriate ref with link)"</dd>
<dd>It is in no way the purpose of the list of external links to be complete, it can show some useful information. If information is available from several external sources, either name only one or two (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a>; indeed, that may be unfair), or link to an independent linkfarm (e.g. a {{<a href="../../../d/m/o/Template%7EDmoz_e80e.html" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>}}). All these things are described in the guidelines.</dd>
<dd>Now there are already many external links sections which contain many external links. When you think that these links are not really appropriate, consider drawing attention to that (see <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WP:WPSPAM</a> for methods of doing that), or help cleaning them (e.g. by replacing them with a <a href="http://dmoz.org/{{{1}}}" class="external text" title="http://dmoz.org/{{{1}}}" rel="nofollow">Beetstra/Archive 6</a> at the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Directory_Project_505b.html" title="Open Directory Project">Open Directory Project</a> <small>(<a href="http://dmoz.org/cgi-bin/add.cgi?where={{{1}}}" class="external text" title="http://dmoz.org/cgi-bin/add.cgi?where={{{1}}}" rel="nofollow">suggest site</a>)</small> -entry, or by converting them to references; please note that <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> applies to you). It is better to consider these alternatives before someone removes a whole series of spammed links because someone is spamming (or even worse, blacklists).

<p>I'm assuming that you placed this comment in reference to an external link I was providing as a reference. The link in question is to some reviews of correspondence chess servers. It is an angelfire page, and wiki-bots seem to dislike it. I've posted at another user talk page this query:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have repeatedly inserted a link to an angelfire page, had it removed, and inserted it again. It is not vandalism (though I understand why angelfire might have that reputation). The site in question offers reviews of server-based correspondence chess sites. There is nothing else like it on the web for its objective assessments of the merits of the leading chess servers.</dd>

<dd>If we (shadowbot, I) revert a site that means that these sites do not meat the criteria in <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>.

When using it as a reference, pages on angelfire do not meet <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. That explains why it is on the revert list of shadowbot. When I see this specific case, you are linking to a personal linkpage, containing <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, an opinion of the maintainer of the website.

<dl>
<dd>How does this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These sites mark one of the most recent and exciting developments in how chess is played. Whereas traditional correspondence chess required transmission of each move through some form of notation on postcards, email, or similar medium, server based correspondence chess employs a JavaScript-enabled board upon which players make their moves. Usually there is also a space for leaving short messages for your opponent. In traditional correspondence chess players must laboriously verify their records and move notation to avoid error; server based chess eliminates this need for record keeping. Of course, many players maintain separate records for off-line analysis, and to store a record of previous analysis.</dd>
<dd>The links below take you to in-depth reviews of the best sites. I also have a chart for comparing which sites offer key features.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>prove that? It shows an example, but that is not proof that they have a wide range of facilities, it does not even talk about the facilities. I think you need to link an official document on a chess union site that tells that casual servers have a wide range of facilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, link additions don't get reverted because they get named in the policies or guidelines, but they get reverted because the do not comply with the policies or guidelines. Sites on angelfire do not comply with <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, so can not be a good external link, nor a good reference.

<dd>Thanks for the reply. You seriously need to examine the syntax of "JStripes using pop-ups." It gets misunderstood because the plain sense understanding of the phrase is exactly what you call a misunderstanding. Creative misreading is needed to perceive the author of the phrase as the one using pop-ups.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've expanded the sentence to which I was providing the reference, but without restoring the note. I agree with you that the opening paragraph of the referenced site does not adequately support the statement. I was thinking of the comparison chart (a subsequent link from the main page) and the content of several of the reviews (also subsequent links).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as the saying goes, when you offer the general statement that "[s]ites on angelfire do not comply with <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>." Some may. You really have no idea whether this particular site has been vetted or not. Not all professional publications, especially those on the web, are refereed to the same extent as <i>Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds.</i> I would cite a better source if I could find one, but there is nothing else close. The site in question may reflect the opinions of one person, but he or she clearly has devoted considerable time and energy to the development of unbiased opinions. Chess is not an academic discipline; the standards for reliability of sources differ from those in chemistry and history.</dd>

<dd>One of the most highly regarded venues for the discussion of correspondence chess is TCCMB (The Correspondence Chess Message Board) at <a href="http://pub11.bravenet.com/forum/924995304" class="external free" title="http://pub11.bravenet.com/forum/924995304" rel="nofollow">http://pub11.bravenet.com/forum/924995304</a>.

<dd>I'm sorry, I will answer later, I am busy at work and this needs some more elaborate explanation, I think. Just as a quick answer, there is a team at <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSPAM_fbb6.html" title="WP:WPSPAM">WP:WPSPAM</a>, and as a team we decide what is blacklisted and what not.

<dd>I said I was going to expand, but technically, most has been said in my short reply (also, this discussion is better on <a href="../../../e/l/_/WT%7EEL_716d.html" title="WT:EL">WT:EL</a>).</dd>
<dd>But some epxansion. The information available on Angelfire was written by someone, but we have no way of knowing who that person is. The information that that person has added is probably correct (though does not need to be). And the information does not get independently checked, hence we have to believe that the author is providing correct information. When the site is citing references, these references are better sources than the site itself (the unreferenced information the person is adding is original research; and even with references information does not have te be correct). So for the information to be attributable, there needs to be an official source that states that that site is the official site .. which in most cases makes the attributing site a better link. When there is only an angelfire site, one can already ask whether the page on wikipedia would pass the notability criteria. And indeed, after all this, there will be some sites left over, and for these exceptions can be made. I did not see that in this reference.</dd>
<dd>A similar reasoning holds for forums. Anyone can post there. It is a source for information, but hardly ever a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.</dd>
<dd>I have redlisted (alert list) bravenet, it seems that the site does not have a large number of links on wikipedia (33 in mainspace at the moment). And we don't blacklist everything we encounter, that would be unworkable, we only blacklist when a site becomes a problem.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for taking the time to clarify your point of view. I'll continue looking for better sources to support the information in that article, as well as the others that interest me. As a historian with an interest in Ronald Reagan, I'm well aware of the problems faced by Wikipedia concerning POV, spam, vandalism, and unattributed opinions from questionable sources.

<p>Dirk, I know your intentions are the best, but you are wrong here. The reason the content cannot be added to the article is that it contains the graphical representation of the charities' performance and this year's financial details. As I said: please visit the website and you will understand what I mean, viz: "amount of detail (such as professional athlete statistics, movie or television credits, interview transcripts, or online textbooks) or other reasons". It would be a promotional exercise if money were involved but it is not. The website in question does not make money (and is already financed and does not request money from the public).<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Laagerfeld (<a href="../../../l/a/a/User_talk%7ELaagerfeld_d8db.html" title="User talk:Laagerfeld">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Laagerfeld_882b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Laagerfeld">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Dirk - The page is *very* on-topic indeed and it reveals a *lot* about MSF. In fact to donors it is arguably more useful than the wikipedia entry. Nowhere else can you find the combined information of: how transparent MSF in its dealings, what reserves it is sitting on, what its CEO salary is, which other charities work in the same space, what its fundraising ratio is, what its admin costs are, and what its estimated statutory funding is (among other things).

<p>Dear Beetstra, I would like to insert the link of a database that was created for non-profit use and destined to the scientific community (<a href="http://peroxidase.isb-sib.ch" class="external free" title="http://peroxidase.isb-sib.ch" rel="nofollow">http://peroxidase.isb-sib.ch</a>). While entering it on several websites that all had in common the peroxidase subject, I have been considered as a spammer and have received a final warning that would prevent me from entering any further information if I continue.</p>
<p>I understand that publicising a database is not tolerated by Wikipedia. I would however like to add the PeroxiBase link at least in the Wikipedia page "Peroxidase" (and the "PeroxiBase" Wikipedia page as well). If you prefer me not entering the website address on other peroxidase-related sites (myeloperoxidase, gluthathione peroxidase, etc...), please just tell me, and I will not do it.</p>
<p>I would really like to be able to put this database as a Wikipedia entry. It is scientifically recognised (I can give you a list of publications) and I think it should exist, as do other databases such as GenBank and UniProt (to which we are affiliated).</p>
<p>Thank you for your help, and best regards. --LABPV 16:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please understand that your edits were a bit disruptive, your edits broke a template, and you are forcing links against consensus. Also, your edits were mainly changing links, and adding links to pages where they do not directly have a relation to the subject. I will leave you a welcome-message shortly, and I hope that you will take some time to read the pages that are linked there. It may be that your site contains valuable information, but links are NOT meant to tunnel people away from wikipedia, and we try to write an encyclopedia here, which means that we follow consensus, not what one editor thinks is the best link.</dd>
<dd>By the way, the link has not been removed from the PeroxiBase page, I have moved it to the appropriate place. Please read the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">manual of style</a>.</dd>

<p>Dear Dirk, thank you for your answer. I am really sorry I provoked a little trouble in Wikipedia. I am quite new in entering edits (actually, my first one was yesterday), and I know I should read the rules more carefully. I am just still worried that any change I perform will be deleted. I guess adding links to other wikipedia pages is now allowed (so, can I add a link to the Wiki PeroxiBase page from the Wiki peroxidase page?). I would also like to modify an external link in the Peroxidase Wikipedia page, because I am certain it is incorrect (the general EC number of peroxidases is 1.11.1.x, and not 1.11.1.9): this will make me removing an internet link, and adding a new one (which is not the one of the Peroxibase homepage, of course). Am I allowed to modify external links?--LABPV 08:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good morning! Don't worry, we were all new once. A bit unfortunate you started spamming, but that will be quick forgotten. If you read the basic things you will notice, that when you save, you release data into the public domain, and it may be mercilessly altered. But well, that will (hopefully) only improve the content in the end.</dd>
<dd>I would take care with altering weblinks, people have added them there for a specific reason. The only reasons to change a url would be that a link has gone dead (and then, consider removing the external link, links are better as references in the text, and should not be meant to tunnel people away from wikipedia, however appropriate) or to correct a link (in all cases, be sure to provide a clear edit-summary then, it makes it possible for us to judge the action more to its value). In template space, discuss, and wait for answers, even if it takes weeks, and try to reach consensus.</dd>
<dd>All link-additions/alterations will show up in our <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net:8001/wikipedia-en-spam" class="external text" title="irc://chat.freenode.net:8001/wikipedia-en-spam" rel="nofollow">linkfeed on IRC</a>, and may be judged (users adding more than 2 links show up in red, until we put them on the 'trusted' list, the linkadditions still show up in the feed, even for trusted users). Continuous addition of a certain link may result in blacklisting, even for good links and trusted users. Such additions are <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam (wikipedia definition)</a>, and suggest <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">a conflict of interest</a>, we want that cleared out before further additions can be made.</dd>
<dd>About the specific change you propose, I would suggest discussing that on the talkpage of the article.

Dear Dirk,</p>

<dd>Hi. That has been some time ago. Well, a god .. I am just a simple user enjoying editing and keeping the wikipedia clean. I removed your links-additions, since the way you were adding them is, in wikipedia, considered spam. If you read <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, you will see that it is defined as "Adding external links to an article or user page for the purpose of promoting a website or a product is not allowed, and is considered to be spam. Although the specific links may be allowed under some circumstances, repeatedly adding links will in most cases result in all of them being removed." It does not matter what the intentions are (which are hard to check), or what the target of the link is, it is the way they are added. Also, the existence of similar links on wikipedia does not mean that more can be added, it may even be that the others should go as well (but not necessarily!).

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am a retired Brit, and I live in Zambales, Philippines. I was stopped from putting a link from some of the Philippines articles to my website. My website is not commercial. It is used to try to sell (privately) a house and/or some of the land I own in Zambales. We are trying to encourage ex-pats to live in the central Zambales area. I know that lots of people outside the Philippines use Wikipedia to help them identify areas of interest when they are looking for property. You allow beach resorts, wildlife parks, restaurants, small-ads promotions, etc., etc., to link to their websites, so why not allow a link to a private property website?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Second Opinion Needed</span></h2>
<p>Hi Dirk, I would like to have an opinion on an editing dispute. Yesterday I put a passage in the Transcendental Meditation article, in which I provided a list of mantras that I got from a book . It was a criticism of TM insofar as the list of mantras is alegedly based on age-groups, whereas TM has always said that the mantras are given out on an individual basis. I provided the appropriate reference.</p>
<p>Today I find that the passage has been deleted from the article, and there are two messages from two people, saying that it was a copyright problem etc.</p>
<p>The two people involved were <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimidGuy_f7a8.html" title="User:TimidGuy">User:TimidGuy</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">User:Michaelbusch</a>. At this stage I'm not sure who was responsible for the deletion; I'm still trying to find out.</p>
<p>My complaints are, firstly, that they had no grounds for deleting the passage, because there was no copyright issue involved; secondly, that they deleted the passage without discussing it with me first. Can you give me an opinion on this issue? This is the sort of thing that puts people off Wiki. Neilrobertpaton 08:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Have just looked at discussion page for TM and have found that MichaelBusch works for TM, at Maharishi Uni. of management. We're entitled to question his impartiality. I got the impression that contributors to the TM article were a little biased towards TM, and I thought it would be interesting to see how long my passage lasted. Looks like my impressions were justified. Neilrobertpaton 08:27, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good morning. Hmm, this is a subject where I don't know a lot about. I see the section got deleted, and I see a discussion on your talkpage about it. Deletion seems a bit drastic if the main concern is 'it is in the wrong place in the document'.. they could have moved it to the appropriate part. The layout of the deleted part is not according to the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, but that is besides the point, that is a matter of refactoring it a bit.

<dd>Hi, thank you for your question. Proboards is blacklisted, it is not a reliable source, and mediawiki wants to move to more reliable sources. You say the link was to a cut-and-paste job that someone did for a chicago newspaper article?

<p>When you are removing Proboards links from articles when they aren't being used as sources, I don't object. But I am very uncomfortable about removing links that are being used as sources without replacing them. I feel that if you want to get rid of the link, you should find a replacement source. The consequence of what you are doing is that you are turning referenced material into unreferenced material. Proboards references are bad, yes, but they are <i>something</i>. What if, instead of removing them in these cases, you left a note saying that the reference needs to be replaced? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:59, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your question. I started doing that later, that is indeed more fair. In the majority of cases I have seen proboards as a reference I would say, they are nothing. Proboards is a forum, and people are retrieving numerical data from that. I am sorry, but it is going to be impossible to find a replacement reference for unreliable information. But indeed, a {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}} is better, and that is now what I put there as a replacement in later replacements.

<dd>Thank you for your question. In principle, self-published sources are allowed. But proboards is a forum, and, as everywhere on the internet, people can pretend to be anyone. Before the proboards link would be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, it should be backed-up by other, reliable, sources telling it is the forum of this person. Now you say that the link was an exact copy of a biography in a published source, being it exact would indeed show that the proboards forum contains reliable information. But what is then the problem with citing the original source, instead of the copy? That precludes all problems.

<dd>Would the fact the this forum is linked on the official website be proof enough? I'm sorry, but I do not understand your reasoning at all in this case. It is as clear as it can be that he is who he says he is on the board - if he were an impostor, do you not think that his account name (which uses the real name of the person) would be quickly deleted? How likely is it that this person would link to a forum which is the "official forum" on his website and yet never visit it in years and find out that someone is impersonating him? The <i>reason</i> that I did not just cite the book is because the book is far harder to find. On the other hand, he says right in the forum that this is a direct quotation for a book. If you say that proboards is blacklisted on principle, please give me the link where this discussion took place. <a href="../../../s/p/s/WP%7ESPS_9b02.html" title="WP:SPS">WP:SPS</a> seems to disagree. In any case, this is just silly and unreasonable. I'm trying to make things easier for users - I <i>could</i> just cite the book, but then I'd know that a very simple and reasonable way of improving the article was denied me because of a literal reading or rules that ignores their actual intended purpose. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 09:48, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most forums do not delete imposters, they do not have a policy for that. Forums are just generally bad because of that reason (and most get blacklisted on <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowbot_64a7.html" title="User:Shadowbot">user:shadowbot</a> on sight). Now this seems indeed to be one of the few examples where the proboards-forum would be similarly funtional as the original source (the book may be harder to find, but with an ISBN it can be found), though in my opinion, I would just cite to the book (that source can be easily checked for its verifyability), and then maybe consider adding the proboards forum (which is indeed a service).</dd>
<dd>References are not meant to be checked, they are meant to attribute statements, so that they <i>can</i> be checked (and for that a book is a better and an easier to check reliable source than the proboards forum that first needs to be checked for its reliability before one can use it to check the statement it attributes).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h2>
<p>I'm not a moderator, but I found out the hard way that external links are not particularly wanted at Wiki. Most of mine were removed in record time. They are accepted if they are official sites or similar, but the folk at Wiki don't especially want people being led away from Wiki by external links, and don't want Wiki being drowned by fan pages etc. Hope this helps.

<p>Dirk, a general question. I've found that certain articles are "supervised" by self-appointed guardians who delete anything they don't like, no matter how legit it might be. This means deleting a contribution without discussing it first, when any problems could be cleared up with a bit of civilised discussion. My question is, if someone keeps doing this, would it be grounds for barring them from editing? There's so much of it going on, the only way to put a stop to it would be to bar repeat offenders from editing. Does this happen? Neilrobertpaton 07:42, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are some mechanisms. If you have tried to convince people on the talkpage, and you feel like they are more protecting the document than they are letting in information where you feel thy don't tell you why (using good reasons), you can ask for a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">request for comment</a>. That should attract uninvolved, impartial editors to the subject. If an RfC does not help, a next step would be to go to e.g. <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> (spec. <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>), but I would not do that before you have tried resolving the dispute by talking on the respective talkpages.</dd>
<dd>I know that these things are quite frustrating sometimes, but all you can do in the beginning is try to reach consensus, and get an edit history on other pages so people can see your edits. That helps you in gaining trust when editing controversial or disputed subjects. Such subjects are sometimes 'protected' (sometimes even using the mediawikis built-in protection mechanism) against new and unregistered users because of the controversial nature of a document. But still, the least that the protecting editors can do is <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and at least move the more genuine contributions to the talkpage to discuss. Hope this helps, have a nice day! --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 08:50, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
