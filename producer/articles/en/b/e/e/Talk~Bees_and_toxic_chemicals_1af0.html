<p>This article is well researched and written and thus a good contribution of effort to wikipedia; however, the orientation seems biased toward natural toxins. It would seem that the article needs major expansion to balance the natural toxins discussions. First of all the significance of man-made toxins are much greater than natural toxins. Finally the expansion should address impacts more thoroughly of pesticides upon biodiversity. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovalent_6f27.html" title="User:Covalent">Covalent</a> 23:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct. However, WP already has a long article on the subject at <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pesticide_toxicity_to_bees.html" title="Pesticide toxicity to bees">Pesticide toxicity to bees</a> (which admittedly could be expanded even farther and more articles added). We are a bit thin on this important topic I am afraid. I also note that I did include the following references on exactly this topic:</dd>

Also I will note in my partial defense, this present title is not my personal choice for a title. I only conceded to that title to avoid AfD. My own title would have been something more like Bees and intoxication but I had several people anxious to put it up for AfD, so I relented and gave it the present title to avoid ruffling feathers and upsetting people. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 00:24, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>My students reviewed the bee story:</p>
<p>There were several statements that the students found enormously humorous:</p>
<p>"… has put inebriated bees on running wheels" "If a bee is sufficiently intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs "…bee bouncers" will chew the offending bee's legs off "Researchers place the bees in tiny harnesses"</p>
<p>Humor, intended or not, is an excellent method of conveying information.</p>
<p><br />
Some questions that arose to which I had no answer:</p>
<p>Details on the interaction of bees with antabuse; How do they know who to bounce?</p>
<p>They wanted pictures, not of bees, but of drunken bees in tiny little harnesses or running on a wheel. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>I was asked to define two words. The first I felt should be known, the second, perhaps not.</p>
<p>Feasibility Chronic</p>
<p>One student noted the extensive documentation when compared to the Evolution article we wrote. I told him we couldn’t document since it was all made up. That made him feel much better?!</p>
<p>I am impressed, just to fire off the article, on a topic I assume is not within field. You should consider employment with the text book companies.</p>
<p>The article needs to be linked; I suggest adding links to the main articles that it relates to, so that it can be found. A “see also” on some of the mainstream pages dealing with bees or intoxication. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom_Replicator_b58d.html" title="User:Random Replicator">Random Replicator</a> 15:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did try to make this slightly humorous on purpose; the reason I wrote this is that I found it funny myself:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>… has put inebriated bees on running wheels</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>The image of bees running on a wheel as part of an experiment just seems ridiculous, but this is true apparently. I am reminded of the famous Youtube video of experiments where researchers had shrimp running on a treadmill.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>If a bee is sufficiently intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, this just seems ludicrous, but it is what they do.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>…bee bouncers" will chew the offending bee's legs off</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>When I heard this some months ago in a documentary (on NPR or CSPAN), I was amazed, and this lead me to write the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Researchers place the bees in tiny harnesses</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>This indicates the effort to which the researches will go to do this work. And it does create a strange image.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Details on the interaction of bees with antabuse; How do they know who to bounce?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I do not know exactly how bees interact with antabuse, but apparently it is not that different from human interaction with antabuse. It is in the references, and I sometimes only read the abstracts. I do not know how they know which bees to bounce. This information is in the references, and I also heard about it in the documentary. It is a good question however.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>They wanted pictures, not of bees, but of drunken bees in tiny little harnesses or running on a wheel. Good luck with that!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I admit this would be great, and maybe eventually we will get some pictures to use.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I was asked to define two words. The first I felt should be known, the second, perhaps not.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Feasibility</i></dd>
<dd><i>Chronic</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>At least it was only two words. I am surprised they did not have a problem with temulent, which I chose on purpose because it is so obscure.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>One student noted the extensive documentation when compared to the Evolution article we wrote. I told him we couldn’t document since it was all made up. That made him feel much better?!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That is pretty funny. However, the reason I had to document this so carefully was that I was making such outrageous statements. Most of what we said in the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Introduction_to_evolution.html" title="Introduction to evolution">introduction to evolution</a> article is common knowledge, or is readily available in other articles like <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I am impressed, just to fire off the article, on a topic I assume is not within field. You should consider employment with the text book companies.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I know nothing about bees or biology. I never took a class in biology; not even in high school or junior high. I have contemplated writing a textbook from time to time.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The article needs to be linked; I suggest adding links to the main articles that it relates to, so that it can be found.

<p>I probably should add more links. I was quite cautious at first because of the threat of deletion.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 15:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was going to pass this article for GA (unlike the previous commentator I don't see a problem with the form of the references) but while I was reviewing it someone put a disputed fact banner into the effects of intoxication section. I was fairly easily able to verify all the facts in the section (including the one about guard bees keeping intoxicated bees out of the hive), except the part about them chewing the legs off of repeat offenders. There is a citation for that fact, but the source cited is an article in journal about alcoholism and the body of the article was not available online to non subscribers. The abastract of the article, which was available free, did not confirm the fact. Can someone with access to a good research library (I am sure any med school library would do) get access to the cited article and confirm or disconfirm the fact? I think this a great article but I am reluctant to pass it while there is a disputed fact banner on it, and I am reluctant to remove the banner without being able to confirm the fact (or remove a fact with a cited source just because I don't have access to the source). Incidentally, I don't think whomever put the banner up acted correctly. I believe that they should have added a comment to this page indicating exactly what fact(s) they were disputing and why. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusty_Cashman_8b6e.html" title="User:Rusty Cashman">Rusty Cashman</a> 19:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi Rusty, I agree with and support your thought process and decision. I am going to go one step further. I agree with you that the banner was improperly placed. The person placing the banner needs to explain here on the Talk page exactly what problem they have with the sourcing of the section. If they do not do so in a couple of days, I will remove the banner. I suggest that holding off on the GA is best for now. In a couple of days perhaps either (a) someone will come by to defend the banner or (b) someone will be able to conclusively confirm the information. I suggest we give it two days and see where we stand. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 20:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bees_and_toxic_chemicals&amp;diff=108045576&amp;oldid=107865139" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bees_and_toxic_chemicals&amp;diff=108045576&amp;oldid=107865139" rel="nofollow">the edit summary</a>, I suspect that someone didn't realise that was a link to an abstract, and so thought that since it wasn't in the abstract, it wasn't in the article. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 03:30, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am going to leave a message for the editor who placed all this text in here, but frankly it should be removed, and I will do so; this is a page about TOXIC CHEMICALS. Simply moving it to the CCD article is not appropriate either, because it is unreferenced, unwikified, and not encyclopedic - it does, as noted, sound like an essay, or a news report. If a news report is the goal, then by all means, submit it to Wikinews, but it does not belong here. <a href="../../../d/y/a/User%7EDyanega_f44b.html" title="User:Dyanega">Dyanega</a> 17:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
