<div align="center" style="color:#FF0000"><b>ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL</b></div>
<p>There are several discussions about my link removal here, and in my archives. If you want to contact me about my view of this policy, please read and <b>understand</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, and read the discussions on my talkpage or in my archives <b>first</b>.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">My view in a nutshell:<br />
External links are not meant to tunnel people away from the wikipedia.</div>
<br />
<p>Hence, I will remove external links on pages where I think they do not add to the page (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>), or when they are added in a way that <i>wikipedia</i> defines as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a> (understand that wikipedia defines spam as: '... wide-scale external link spamming ...', even if the link <i>is</i> appropriate; also read <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#External_link_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">this</a>). This may mean that I remove links, while similar links are already there or which are there already for a long time. Still, the question is not whether your link should be there, the question <i>may</i> be whether those other links should be there (again, see the wording of the policies and guidelines).</p>
<p>Please consider the alternatives before readding the link:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the link contains information, use the information to add <i>content</i> to the article, and use the link as a reference (content is not 'see <a href="http://www.example.org" class="external text" title="http://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information').</li>
<li>Add an appropriate linkfarm like {{<a href="../../../d/m/o/Template%7EDmoz_e80e.html" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>}} (you can consider to remove other links covered in the dmoz.</li>
<li>Incorporate the information into one of the sister projects.</li>
<li>Add the link to other mediawiki projects aimed at advertiseing (see e.g. <a href="http://www.aboutus.org" class="external text" title="http://www.aboutus.org" rel="nofollow">this</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the linkspam of a certain link perseveres, I will not hesitate to report it to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">wikiproject spam</a> for blacklisting (even <i>if</i> the link would be appropriate for wikipedia). It may be wise to consider the <i>before</i> things get to that point.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">The answer in a nutshell<br />
Please consider if the link you want to add complies with the policies and guidelines.</div>
<br />
<p>Pertaining links on pages about chemicals: If the link is a regular source of chemicals, consider adding the link to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemical_sources_67a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemical sources">wikipedia:chemical sources</a>, and add the template {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChemicalSources_9571.html" title="Template:ChemicalSources">ChemicalSources</a>}} to the external links sections of the chemicals' page(s) (when not there). If you would like to see my proposed special:chemicalsources be activated, please vote for <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" rel="nofollow">bug 7514 on bugzilla</a>.</p>
<p>If you have other questions, or still have questions on my view of the external link policy, disagree with me, or think I made a mistake in removing a link you added, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">please poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a>.

<div style="margin-top:.1em; margin-bottom:.1em; border:1px solid #8DB9F6; background-color:#E9F2FE; padding:.1em">
<div align="center"><b>Reliable sources</b></div>
<p>I convert inline URL's into references and convert referencing styles to a consistent format. My preferred style is the style provided by <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">cite.php</a> (&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;references/&gt;). When other mechanisms are mainly (but not consistently) used (e.g. {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}}-templates) I will assess whether referencing would benefit from the cite.php-style. Feel free to revert these edits when I am wrong.</p>
<p>Converting inline URLs in references may result in data being retrieved from <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">unreliable sources</a>. In these cases, the link may have been removed, and replaced by a {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}}. If you feel that the page should be used as a reference (complying with <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>!!), please discuss that on the talkpage of the page, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a></p>
<p>Note: I am working with some other developers on mediawiki to expand the possibilities of cite.php, our attempts can be followed <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you like these features and want them enabled, please vote for these bugs.</p>

<div align="center"><b>Stub/Importance/Notability/Expand/Expert</b></div>
<p>I am in general against deletion, except when the page really gives misinformation, is clear spam or copyvio. Otherwise, these pages may need to be expanded or rewritten. For very short articles there are the different {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} marks, which clearly state that the article is to be expanded. For articles that do not state why they are notable, I will add either {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}. In my view there is a distinct difference between these two templates, while articles carrying one of these templates <i>may</i> not be notable, the first template does say the <i>article</i> is probably notable enough, but the <i>contents</i> does not state that (yet). The latter provides a clear concern that the article is not notable, and should probably be {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}ed or {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_4f30.html" title="Template:AfD">AfD</a>}}ed. Removing importance-tags does not take away the backlog, it only hides from attention, deleting pages does not make the database smaller. If you contest the notability/importance of an article, please consider adding an {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">expert-subject</a>}} tag, or raise the subject on an appropriate wikiproject. Remember, there are many, many pages on the wikipedia, many need attention, so maybe we have to live with a backlog.</p>
<p>Having said this, I generally delete the {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}}-template on sight. The template is in most cases superfluous, expansion is intrinsic to the wikipedia (for stubs, expansion is already mentioned in <i>that</i> template).</p>

<p>Salut, I am glad to see your comments regarding searching chemical structures in Wiki's, I have had several comments on <a href="http://thesynapticleap.org/?q=node/115" class="external text" title="http://thesynapticleap.org/?q=node/115" rel="nofollow">other forums</a> about adding this type of functionality.

<dd>Salut,</dd>
<dd>I had a quick look, but I could not download (yet, probably, account seemed not to be active, I'll try again later). Let me say, it looks quite nifty, does this work on *nix type systems (and then I mean, can I create documents in a text-editor, and incorporate these images, and if I give that document to someone else can they then still see the images? Would this work for documents that one sends for official publications (ACS, RSC, Wiley ..)? But those questions are besides the point here.</dd>
<dd>Basically, I <i>do</i> like the possibility to incorporate chemical drawings in wikipedia, but I don't think that it is an application that is going to be accepted by the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Special%7EVersion_d75c.html" title="Special:Version">programmers</a> of the mediawiki-software. I am trying to get a wikipedia based search engine to run (a special:chemicalsources, working like <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" title="Special:Booksources">special:booksources</a>), and they already think that that is too specific, to specialistic. That does not mean, that such functionality should not be written (I have written the specialpage), an extension to the software might be very good for chemistry specific wikipedia. The way to go would be to write the extension, find a way to store the data in the wikipedia database, and to upload a patch to bugzilla. From that moment you will have to nag developers to incorporate you patch in svn (step 1), and after that try and see if the main developers (Brion and Tim) are willing to enable it on wikipedia (I don't know if you have a big chance there). At that point the software is available to other users, and people running their own wiki (like me), or chemistry wiki's can choose to activate the extension, and use the software. I guess you will have to start <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" class="external text" title="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" rel="nofollow">here</a></dd>
<dd>You could leave this message also at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Chemicals_6167.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Chemicals">wikipedia:wikiproject Chemicals</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_Chemistry_cbe8.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject Chemistry">wikipedia:wikiproject Chemistry</a> and see how they respond. I guess there will be more that like that idea.</dd>
<dd>I saw that you created some documents on chemaxon. As a person working for a company, you have to be careful with that, wikipedia strictly adheres to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and all the other policies and guidelines. I don't know what the text was in the document, but either the document should not tell anything, and you should rely on others to expand (which may take quite some time, and until that, people might delete for lack of notability). Another option is to put the page on a request-list (there is a link when you go to a non-existent page. Hope this helps. Now I am wondering if I should end this message with 'Pa'? --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 10:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was discussed again and again. It was said some links might be permissible. <i>see Mdwyer 05:50, 9 September 2006</i></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mdwyer, I did not remove the links, that was DrBird/71.245.157.18. There are problems with external links, there have been extensive discussions on that. A solution that is underway (though I still need a Wikipedia-programmer), would be a page like special:booksources, which would load Wikipedia:Chemical sources. For now, there is the template</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemical_sources_67a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemical sources">Links to external chemical sources</a>, which enables to remove commercial links, <i><b>but I do not remove links which directly link to the compounds property pages</b></i> (I do remove links to companies homepages or similar, non-specific pages). --Dirk Beetstra T C 07:15, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I knew you weren't removing them. I was actually replying to DrBird, and I hijacked your page for a discussion. Sorry about that. In any case, I'm not familiar enough with the guts of the code to do more than just keep manually reverting things when I find them. The link DrBird keeps adding doesn't look like it fits WP:EL. <i><b>The Fermentek ones seem valid to me</b></i>. In other cases where I'm not sure, I will often move them with a note in the talk pages so someone can put them back if they think they are valid. --Mdwyer 05:50, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>DrBird is adding links to his own site, these do not comply WP:EL, moreover, these links did not link to the chemical property page, but to a general page. Links to chemical property sheets on commercial websites are not necessarily wrong, they give extra info, which is still necessary on many chemical pages. I see DrBird is still pushing, I will revert all his edits when he only adds or removes links in the 'external links' section (but I am going on holiday). --Dirk Beetstra T C 06:50, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul class="noindent"></ul>
<hr />
<p>Now I see you have launched a crusade against all of them. You contradict your own expressed opinion. Maybe reconsider?</p>
<p>In any case I will go on mentioning and linking to the pages that the data have been copied from (on permission of course). It is a matter of honesty. Please visit here: <a href="http://www.fermentek.co.il/09-copyright-statement.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fermentek.co.il/09-copyright-statement.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Now also consider that: You might have noticed Fermentek does not offer its products to individuals, nor does it publish or compare prices.</p>
<p>In any case, I think you will not object to linking to corresponding MSDS pages from wiki chemical articles.</p>

<dd>My support goes stronger and stronger towards removing all commercial links from chemical pages, there are many, non commercial sites available. The template {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChemicalSources_9571.html" title="Template:ChemicalSources">ChemicalSources</a>}} is available, and requests for enabling a special:chemicalsources has been made, and I have asked several times for support of that. Note that the terms that are used are 'might', 'not necessarily wrong' .. I know that Fermentek is not offering to individuals, but there are many chemists using the site, and for them this can still be explained as advertisement. Please consider <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> in that light. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 14:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just to be sure, some of the MSDS's are also available from non-commercial sources, maybe these are a better EL? --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 15:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Another sentence to reply to, it is indeed honest to mention the pages where you found the data, that is even very good, but in that case they should be mentioned as references, preferably using the <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> mechanisms available. Just as a sidenote, many of the compounds would really benefit from a chembox or a drugbox (both provide the same functionality), these also link directly into the online databases (PubChem, CAS, MeSH, KEGG, ChEBI, eMolecules, etc.), where, probably (and for some I am sure because I did check whether the information was available non-commercial), more information can be found. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 15:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles are gone. Now, today I added an article to a <i>List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts</i> and I was reverted. I cited 3 references and discussed it on the talk page. I <i>fixed all the references</i> in the article too and that was also reverted. Feel free to take a look at my edits to the article.

<dd>I see you are up against an established editor. I guess it is better if you keep low profile, and play their game. I know it is not how it should be (I see he ignores all your questions on his talkpage), but if a straight approach does not work ... Just start a topic on the talkpage for every subject you want to change, explain the case, provide the references. See how they react, and be patient with them. The list is controversial, and that indeed means that things have to be discussed before a change is applied.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article: Periodic_table, external link removal</span></h2>
<p>hello beetstra,</p>
<p>you removed the external link I added (www.dayah.com/periodic).</p>
<p>I added this link because dayah's periodic table is very well suited for printing it out.</p>
<p>This may not be encyclopedic information in its original sense, but Wikipedia has evolved beyond that, has it not? Pupils and students that want to have a nice print of a periodic table may try to find it on Wikipedia. It was so in my case.</p>
<p>I clicked all the other external links that were already on the article page, but none of them satisfied me. Maybe there is an alternative to dayah's table (equal amount of information, color-coded and printable), but then it was not immediately apparent. I never stay longer than about 5 seconds on a website when I am searching for something where there is a wide choice, and I think most people act as I do.</p>
<p>I read the (quite tedious) article about external linking. IMHO the link I added is not redundant. Please consider letting me reinsert it, or please tell me why this may not be.</p>

<dd>Sorry, you may be right that your link gives a nice, printable periodic table, but I am afraid, that many other pages also believe the same. If you read the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, you see that it is written in a style of 'external links can be added' (not must), 'things that should be linked' (again, not must), and 'links normally to avoid' (speaks for itself) .. Moreover, this guideline relies on a couple of policies (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). For this case, in short, the number of external links should be kept to a minimum, and if we allow one external link to be added, what keeps others from adding (though I will not listen to the argument 'but there is another link already' anyway, I still like <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a>, but that redirect is up for deletion). I am sorry, but the site is not in the list of 'what should be linked', and may be part of 'links normally to avoid', in top of '<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">not a linkfarm</a>'. Hope this explains. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 23:33, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see. I understand the importance of keeping external links to a minimum.</p>
<p>The external link from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the flash table link from touchspin.com, as well as the external link from www.ceet.niu.edu do not appear to provide any information beyond what is already available from the webelements link, they merely present it in a different form (using Flash instead of html, for instance).</p>
<p>I'd also like to note that "my link giving a nice printable periodic table" is not solely personal preference. I am capable of objectively comparing the periodic tables that I print out. I know that webelements offers a very basic, simple printable periodic table (not color-coded, no electron configs, etc) as pdf, which will nonetheless suffice for any student, so I guess I can't argue. However, if you find the time to compare A4 prints of these two tables (and perhaps many other tables as well - I was thorough in my google search), I hope you will see my motivation to add the link.

<dl>
<dd>There may indeed be links there that are superfluous. Seen the current setup of WP, pdf files cannot directly be incorporated in the system, they have to be external links, so I think it should stay with one or two periodic tables from respected sources (LANL, webelements would fit that at least). Others .. maybe that part should be cleaned up.</dd>
<dd>If you really think the link adds info, and can be used to replace other links, or maybe is a good addition, please discuss its addition on the talkpage of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a>. That is probably also the place to talk about removal of some of the links (a link to a flash site should technically not be on the page ..). It may be a lenghty discussion.</dd>

<dd>Brilliant! I have solved the problem. You can now add, in the top-level of the {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}} a parameter 'Reference' (I am not making it a standard reference).

<p>The lenntech pages pointed to are technical info only, and furnish extensive detail and history. They are not promotional for lenntech's products (I don't even know what their products are). I didn't realize that links to such pages were a Wikipedia policy problem. Before you judge the lenntech pages, please have a look and read one of them all the way through. If there is still a problem linking to them, please cite chapter and verse of the policy that is causing the problem. I just read the "links normally to be avoided" at <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:external links</a>.

<dd>I certainly do realize that posting links to commercial sites is treading closer to the edge than most of the other edits I've done. But in my opinion, lenntech's motives seem to be pure. Their informational pages appear to be just that -- an effort to impart technical and historical fact. Indeed I only found them because of other links to their pages on Wikipedia. In the case of the new "process detail" section I wrote for <a href="../../../l/e/b/Leblanc_process.html" title="Leblanc process">Leblanc process</a>, I was summarizing the info at the lenntech page as well as at a few other pages I found (especially the 1911 version of Britanica, which is now on line). I didn't think it would be appropriate to post all of the info I found at external sites, because it would make the article too long. But I thought readers should have the opportunity to find out more if they were interested (there have to be a few other nerds like me who find chem-industrial processes, especially historical ones, fascinating). I think the reason that a number of other Wikipedians thought to link to lenntech is because of the quality and quantity of the material they find there. But on your advice, I will put more thought into striking a good balance between avoiding links when I can and providing the reader with further detail. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlhahn_905b.html" title="User:Karlhahn">Karl Hahn</a> (<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarlhahn_3b79.html" title="User talk:Karlhahn">T</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Karlhahn_f930.html" title="Special:Contributions/Karlhahn">C</a>) 23:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I saw you adding the link to all the articles, which is why I addressed them as spam (mass addition of links to articles). Then I realised that it was the official page for the band, and reconsidered.

<p>Dirk, I appreciate your comments. However the links that Macrakis and now yourself are removing are useful non-commercial content-relevant links to traditional Mediterranean and Asian recipes, so there is no conflict of interest. These recipe links have been on Wikipedia since 2004 and have shown many Wikipedia users how to cook traditional ethnic dishes, so to suddenly remove them would be extremely unfair, and certainly not in keeping with the spirit of this encyclopedia.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Foudel (<a href="../../../f/o/u/User_talk%7EFoudel_5a26.html" title="User talk:Foudel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Foudel_fc9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Foudel">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Thank you for trying to put me at ease regarding the weird things going on - as regards being branded as a spammer, you've more or less convinced me that I'm not condemned. However, the matter of the external link that appeared along with my edit still worries me and will continue to do so as the same might happen again on any other page I edit. Is there some technical help page I can go to in order to ensure that there isn't any kind of virus attached to my account?

<dd>I saw this particular link being spammed by the IP (without edit summary) on the channel feed. I reverted because of that, and removed other additions by the same account as well. I did not look closely to the other links, but having links in the list does not mean that more should be added; others may have to go as well.</dd>
<dd>I understand that there is an interest in having links on pages, but wikipedia is not a directory for links (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>), and I am not sure if links to news-sites would be allowed per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.

<dd>I see that I <i>may</i> have overreverted a link added by 67.162.4.109, if the reference is to the same document as the original reference, than maybe that link should be changed. I am sorry for that, but in general, the account was adding a link to several external link sections, and did one change (?) of a link in a reference. The author that added the reference in the first place was using the that link as the reference, not another url, so the change was controversial there, and might have needed some explanation. When you confirm that the link in the reference should be to the <i>same</i> document on another server, please do change that (please provide an edit summary).

<p>Hi, thanks for adding chemboxes to articles, but may I ask you to have a look at {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}}, it offers some advanced properties, and gives cleaner and smaller documents (less table-gibberish). Some of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chemicals_5a2b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemicals">us</a> have started to use the new one, or replace old boxes.

<dd>Thanks, I'm well aware of the {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}}, but I don't like to use it as I feel it's inferior to the other forms, like {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_e6a6.html" title="Template:Chembox">chembox</a>}}. If you check, I wrote quite a lot of code for both the simple chemboxes to make them easier and clearer to use. Besides, the main reason I uses the 'obsolete' versions is because they're way more versatile. You can literally put any info you find in them, but you're limited to predesignated fields with the new version - <font face="Verdana"><b><a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJrockley_3b32.html" title="User:Jrockley">Jack</a></b> <small>· <a href="../../../j/r/o/User_talk%7EJrockley_5c87.html" title="User talk:Jrockley">talk</a> · 11:00, Thursday, 22 February 2007</small></font>
<dl>
<dd>I still think that the whole table in the top of the document is a big list of gibberish, which may scare people to fill in other data. Also, fields are easily added to the {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}}, and can then be used in other chemboxes as well, without any trouble. In that case it is only once that you have to do the addition. One of the big advantages of the chembox new, IMHO, is that the chemboxes are similar all through, so that people know what to find where in the chembox, and they do not find chemboxes of different types in different pages. Hope this explains. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 15:06, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Beetstra - -your comment about advertising and providing information is a thin line. I appreciate your desire to police the ranks. If you felt that the article was bordering on advertising, we would have appreciated it if you simply did not delete the entire article but warned us at least that you felt there were elements of advertising. We are willing to follow the rules. Anyway, we will edit our article to ensure if is just a source of information on the company. We will send a link to you once complete to check if you're fine with it. Please understand that it also took time to write the article and if there was a questionable section, it would be good if you let us know and we would either revise or remove it. But to delete the entire article is a bit too much. Thank you for understanding.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrapeflix_1bc5.html" title="User:Grapeflix">Grapeflix</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrapeflix_c3d5.html" title="User talk:Grapeflix">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grapeflix_b887.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grapeflix">contribs</a>).</small></p>
