<p>That's fine and all, since the article exists now.

<dd>{{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}} — The request below hasn't been addressed yet cause it's easier and takes much less time to check interlanguage links or respond on talk pages than to sort through sources and significantly expand an article. With the level of traffic this article gets it's going to take more than two days for someone who's interested in putting that kind of work in to stumble across your request. — <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> | <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">Talk</a> 17:09, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I do find the request below far more important than what is written above, especially since the issue in question has been adressed and taken care of. Besides, with the low level of traffic here, it would be more desirable when someone first is here, to adress what is most important. And why in God's name did you restore the "ang" link, since it was incorrect from the start? <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatanael_e681.html" title="User:Satanael">Satanael</a> 18:27, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize; I didn't realize it had been taken off before. I added it because all the other languages link to it and my Anglo-Saxon is too poor to realize it is simply a mistake across the board.</dd>
<dd>Like I said, importance doesn't always translate to speed around here. The easier things tend to get done first until a particularly interested party comes by. I'd do it, but already have too much on my plate and don't consider myself anywhere near knowledgable on the subject. — <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurascudder_7cfd.html" title="User:Laurascudder">Laura Scudder</a> | <a href="../../../l/a/u/User_talk%7ELaurascudder_bd8d.html" title="User talk:Laurascudder">Talk</a> 20:08, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, it's fine, though I'm concerned about the bad continuity on the other language section for some articles. I'd edit it myself as well, but, unfortunately, I have too much on my plate as well. Perhaps I should put up a notice asking for someone to attend to the matter. I feel that the matter isn't covered enough in the info already present. I'd like it that a scholar of some sort would have been present and attended the matter at hand, unfortunately, that isn't so. The same can be said of the articles on various other demons and religious and mythical beings as well. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatanael_e681.html" title="User:Satanael">Satanael</a> 21:18, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The interwiki link to <a href="../../../../ang/w/%C5%8D/d/W%C5%8Ddening.html" class="extiw" title="ang:Wōdening">ang:Wōdening</a> was automatically added back. I removed it, and also removed all the interwiki links at the Anglo-Saxon article. (They were all to various translation of Beelzebub.) I also went and removed the corresponding links back to <a href="../../../../ang/w/%C5%8D/d/W%C5%8Ddening.html" class="extiw" title="ang:Wōdening">ang:Wōdening</a>, so hopefully that article is now completely dissociated from Beelzebub.</p>
<p>That question remains what, if any, English article <a href="../../../../ang/w/%C5%8D/d/W%C5%8Ddening.html" class="extiw" title="ang:Wōdening">ang:Wōdening</a> should actually link to. As far as I can tell, it simply means "son of <a href="../../../w/o/d/Woden.html" title="Woden">Woden</a>", and is also a fairly common surname. Maybe there should be an article on it at <a href="../../../w/o/d/Wodening.html" title="Wodening">Wodening</a>, but currently that's a redlink. —<a href="../../../i/l/m/User%7EIlmari_Karonen_d189.html" title="User:Ilmari Karonen">Ilmari Karonen</a> 18:59, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Simple... Right facing images need to be on the left per Wikipedia style guides... Trivial mentions that are nonnotable for the topic need to be removed... Beeelzebub in culture is completely unnecessary as an article and uses a title that doesn't conform to what it was intended to be about anyway. I also added the caption under the image and other cleanup. Blindly reverting it all just because the editor in question feels like he owns the page or something, first without any comment and then when he did comment he simply said "it sucks" with no logical explanation and made other rude comments. He also claimed I showed no interest in the topic previously, but I've edited these kinds of articles plenty of times, and he knows it as I have commented on this very talk page previously and edited the article, and have on more than one occasion had to remove his edits to multiple articles on similar themes as being unsourced, poorly written and thoroughly unencyclopedic. All in all, Satanael is up to his old tricks again. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 13:54, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is deliberately misleading to claim that the Britannica link does not comply with <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> when it is in fact fully in compliance with that policy. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 09:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First up, and most importantly, that link is NOT an "Encyclopedia Britannica lijnk" site but someone's knockoff site using public domain info that they do not own so that they can place ads on it and make money. This is clear, calculated spam. Information from that edition of the encyclopedia can, and by policy <i>should</i>, be placed directly on this page if it's any good. <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> clearly states that sites to be avoided include "any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose." As the info there is not covered by copyright, we can lift all of it of any value directly to Wikipedia. It is nonencyclopedic to link to some spammer's external site that has nothing more than what we already have here or can place here. In addition, also listed under sites to avoid linking to are "Links that are added to promote a site" and "Pages with advertising unless the page is the official home page of the organization, person, or other entity that is the subject of the Wikipedia article on which the external link exists." This site clearly fails as a valid link for multiple very important reasons.</p>
<p>Your list of sites that should be linked to explicitly do not apply to that site, as that site was NOT used as a source for this article, and, furthermore, if we use the Encyclopedia Britannica info, we can use it straight from the ORIGINAL source (the public domain text) and NOT the spammer's site.</p>
<p>And then to claim further that I was "deliberately misleading" when all I did was explain policy to you, policy that you clearly did not read or understand IN THE SLIGHTEST, violates the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith policy</a>, which you have been violating on a regular basis on more than one article when you declare that my edits are deceptive when they are not in any way, shape or form deceptive accept that you are either incapable or unwilling to follow along.</p>
<p>Furthermore, falsely calling my actions "trolling" when I am merely following site policy is a clear violation of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> policy.</p>
<p>If you'd bother familiarizing yourself with our policies and how things are done here, you would know this. Instead you have made a habit of harassing edits directly aimed at me, and continue to do so even after you have been warned by an administrator to stop. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 09:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kindly keep your comments on-topic, and refrain from posting further personal abuse. Perhaps re-familiarising yourself with Wikipedia's policies might be worthwhile at this juncture, as there appear to be serious deficiencies in your current levels of comprehension, to the extent that meaningful dialog with you is not possible. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 10:01, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As has been aptly demonstrated, you are the one who does not understand policies here (as an admin has already tried to warn you on more than one occasion on your talk page).

<dd>The bottom line is directly quotes from the relevant policies proved you wrong, and you were unable to fashion any sort of response to back up your version of events and so just made more personal attacks.

<p>Hi there i'm new to this but was just wondering Tenaciuos D's latest album has a song called "Beelzeboss (the final showdown)" where jack and kyle have a rock off with the devil(or the devil's son maybe.... it's some form of demon thing I can't really remember). i was wondering if "beelzeboss" is a made up name or has it been used before?</p>

<p>"Zeboul might derive from a slurred pronunciation of zebûb; from 'zebel', a word used to mean 'dung' in the Targums; or from Hebrew zebûl found in 1 Kings 8.13 in the phrase bêt-zebûl"</p>
<p>Zebel is a word meaning rich and prosperous in ancient Hebrew texts the word is transformed to relate to dung much later in the evolution of the Hebrew language. It is used in the scripture to refer to something as rich and prosperous. This meaning coincides with much of the rest of the paragraph so I'd suggest striking out the translation to dung. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_89.0.183.234_6be5.html" title="Special:Contributions/89.0.183.234">89.0.183.234</a> (talk) 10:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
