<p>While this is an important style, it should be part of the list of styles as described above. This section as written was atrocious, simply a few sentence fragments, so I deleted it pending the aforementioned style list. An added note, that list probably should be textual with a short description of each, but not replace the individual style articles. A pure list would be redundant with the styles category. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECouchand_3e63.html" title="User:Couchand">Couch</a> 10:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found this article to be frankly rather disappointing and in need of improvement. First, the section "Determining a beer's style" in its present form shows somewhat of an anti-American bias and as such is not NPOV. Second, I think any decent article on beer style should give some breakdown of the components of beer style, which would include not only type of yeast, but color, hop bitterness and aroma, gravity and attenuation, and additional ingredients; in fact I would consider this to be the real heart of the article, which might otherwise end up being little more than a list of beer styles. --<a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalimu59_7f54.html" title="User:Mwalimu59">Mwalimu59</a> 21:50, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There have been several modifications to the discussion of style authorities in the "determining a beer's style" section recently. I think including what authorities there are on this subject is important. A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the words "for homebrewers" was recently added to some of this. I think that's not a very good idea because the general reader may not realize that homebrewed beer is every bit as much beer as commercial beer. If you don't know about the process, you might think that there's someway in which homebrewed beer isn't <i>really</i> beer, which is just false.</li>
<li>The BJCP guideline and the BA guidelines are both used in the US quit a bit. Both should be mentioned. Should it be mentioned that for the most part, these guidelines reveal consensus about what styles there are?</li>
<li>Are there really no recognized bodies that classify beers in Europe? (I guess that wouldn't be surprising to me, but I have to ask.)</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
I understand that there might be differences of opinion on some issues, but wouldn't it make more sense to discuss these first before modifying an article to match your opinion?</p>
<p>Your point regarding home-brewed vs. commercial beer seems to me absolutely invalid. How many people will experience a given home-brewed beer vs. a commerical one? Furthermore, home brewing, as I understand it, can and should be a creative process. Some of the most interesting beers to have come out of Belgium recently, for example, come from home brewers gone commercial who have no style book and have no interest in trying to duplicate a given style, even if they had a guide!</p>
<p>You say the BJCP and BA (who are they?) guidelines are "used in the US quite a bit". You however leave out by whom. I assume by home brewers. Isn't that who these style guides are for? And aren't these guidelines used primarily to judge home brews in competition?</p>
<p>The description of how styles come into being is already covered quite well in the current article. Furthermore it is covered universally, not just for American beers, but beers made anywhere.</p>
<p>And to answer your final question, no, there are no recognised groups in Europe (that I am aware of) that classify beers. Beers here have been brewed for hundreds of years and techniques are passed down from generation to generation. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 10:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A few observations based on my own experience as a beer judge (which was admittedly has been a few years). First, it is not the job of a beer judge, BJCP or otherwise, to determine a beer's style, even though experienced judges may become quite good at it. Rather, a beer judge is given a style profile and has to judge how well particular beers are representative of the style; the contestant, not the judge, decides what style a beer should be entered as.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a committee on the BJCP that decides style guidelines to be used in AoB/AHA sanctioned competitions, and they are primarily use in the USA and Canada. Aside from the use in those competitions, I don't know how much they are recognized as any sort of highest authority. They try to be faithful to the traditions and origins of a beer style and its country of origin, but there is probably some degree of bias toward how the styles have been done in the American craft brewing industry.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One more observation - Fifteen years ago, I was disappointed at how much the craft brewing industry was mostly sticking to the traditional beer styles. More recently, from what I've seen at beer fests and at the liquor stores, I've been much more impressed that some brewers have been "breaking the barriers" and inventing/experimenting with beer styles that aren't bound to traditions. --<a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalimu59_7f54.html" title="User:Mwalimu59">Mwalimu59</a> 17:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An interesting post. I quite agree with you that brewers ignoring style guidelines tend to be the ones making the most interesting and rewarding beers. IAC, as I said, I don't believe that the guidelines for home brewing or professional competitions have a place in the general beer articles in Wikipedia. In fact, for the people new to beer or new to beer information, these guidelines can be confusing and give entirely the wrong message.</dd>

<p>Just did a major addition to the article discussing elements of beer style, replacing the section that had been titled "Determining a beer's style" (and incorporating some of the material that had been in that section).

<p>I think it would be neat and real helpful if someone perhaps added a box at the bottom of the page with all the different styles. We could also put the same box on all the individual pages of beer styles. It would enhance navigation and facilitate learning about different beer styles you may not be familiar with. I would be happy to do it myself but I'm totally swamped at work at the moment so it might take me awhile, let me know what everyone thinks. Also if this does happen is there a way do put the box on all the style pages at once? It might be time consuming to do it one by one. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenStoic_83c3.html" title="User:BrokenStoic">BrokenStoic</a> 05:20, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>With all due respect to its creator, I've removed the beer style chart because I feel that, as it stands, it's not accurate enough for inclusion. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lambics are, by at least some sources, considered ales as the majority of fermentation happens on the top of the beer.</li>
<li>"Belgian ale" isn't really a distinct style in and of itself, covering as it does such a wide range of styles -- the disposition of Saison is also a little odd.</li>
<li>"Dark ale" is a bit dubious considering the continuum in practice between stouts, porters, and dark milds. Milds aren't represented at all on the chart.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this will be taken as constructive criticism; the idea of a chart isn't bad in and of itself, but I don't think a strict hierarchy is the best way to present things.</p>
<p>My own lean would be toward a table with yeast type in one column and then base malt in the other; I don't have the books to hand right this instant second, but I seem to recall that some sources (Darryl Richman in <i>Bock</i> comes to mind first) argues that beers can be classified by base malt style (e.g. Bocks are all based on Munich malt, stouts always include roasted barley as the dominant specialty grain...). This strikes me as a natural method.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CAMRA, BJCP (*hides*) and Brewers Association all define beer styles in terms of three variables: yeast, original gravity, and color. Given that those three guidelines already all exist and more or less match, we can go with that to avoid accusations of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/l/User%7EStlemur_8a12.html" title="User:Stlemur">Stlemur</a> 08:38, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I created this chart in order to be able to have a clear view about all the different types of beer around. Before making this chart I was very confused. Then I collected all the information I could about beer classification from Wikipedia articles and I made this chart. I don't expect to have understood everything properly, but I think a chart is clear enough to help people understand the complex world of beer styles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, my chart can't be considered an original work because I just re-arranged all the data that was <i>already</i> within Wikipedia: my work was just a (hopefully!) smart copy and paste. My only reference is Wikipedia. Since it was a big work of synthesis, there can be mistakes, but that's why I put it here, so we can discuss and improve it!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will answer to the points of <a href="../../../s/t/l/User%7EStlemur_8a12.html" title="User:Stlemur">Stlemur</a>:
<ul>
<li>my starting point to create the chart is this article, <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_style.html" title="Beer style">Beer style</a>. In the "Beer styles" section there is "lager" and "ale" (two separated <i>generators</i> of the chart), "lambic" is in a different section (if it were an ale, it would be within the "ale" section), the last section is "hybrid beers" that can't be classified just because they are hybrid. That is why the three main kinds from every other kind starts are <i>lager</i>, <i>ale</i> and <i>lambic</i>. Can we say that <i>all</i> the fermentation of <i>all</i> the lambic happens on the top of the beer?? if it does, then they are ales (and we'd better fix the article), if it does not for at least <i>one</i> lambic, then I think we'd better keep it as a different kind of beer.</li>
<li>I agree about the fact that Belgian ale is not a kind of beer of its own, but you will agree with me that Abbey beer, Amber beer, [..], Trappist beer and Tripel are Belgian ales. It's like a trick to improve the output of the chart. The same for Dark ale: I have never seen "Dark ale" printed on any beer bottle, so I wouldn't say it's a kind of beer, but you might agree with me that Stout and Porter are Dark ales. Do you know what I mean?? if you have any idea about how to improve the general layout, it's absolutely welcome.</li>
<li>from the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saison.html" title="Saison">Saison</a> article, <i>Saison is the name given to pale ales brewed in Wallonia</i>, so I put it under <i>pale ale</i> in chart, what's odd with it?</li>
<li>yes, I forgot to include Mild beers: tell me where it should be, and I will add it (of, if you can edit the SVG file, you can do it by your self&#160;:-)</li>
<li>the chart might simplify the argument too much, but it will be very easy to understand. If we make a table or a list, it won't be clearer than reading the article itself. You can make a table as well, but I think a chart is much more useful.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I have published this chart, I know it was going to start a discussion because I made a big work of synthesis and simplification. I expected this, and I like it because it will help me to have a better diagram: that's the way Wikipedia works, and there is nothing bad in it. If you want to express your opinion, you are absolutely welcome, but please, don't just say "I don't like it", but try to explain exactly what is wrong with it and suggest ways to improve it&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a> 17:56, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What's odd about Saison is that it's a pale ale in that it's based on pale malt, but it's a Belgian ale in that it uses, or can use -- it's hard to state universals about a farmhouse style -- Belgian-style recipes (spices, candi sugar), Belgian-style fermentation (high temperatures, up to 30 degrees C) and Belgian strains of yeast (high attenuators). It's cases like this which I think rule out a strict single hierarchy, although a multiple chart -- one classifying by malt, one by yeast, one by geographic origin -- might have some merit. --<a href="../../../s/t/l/User%7EStlemur_8a12.html" title="User:Stlemur">Stlemur</a> 19:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In defense of the chart-maker, Saison is listed at the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pale_ale.html" title="Pale ale">pale ale</a> article (which is odd).

<dd>thanks <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoethean_633f.html" title="User:Goethean">goethean</a>. I understood the point about Saison, I can't express an opinion because I didn't try any in my life and I hardly know it existed... according to what you told me and what I read on the relative article, it looks like it's a pale ale with some extra features, but it is still a pale ale, and so it deserves the place I have chosen. If you disagree with it, first change the beginning of the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saison.html" title="Saison">Saison</a> article, pointing out that it is <i>not</i> a pale ale but it's own style, and I'll move it under "Belgian ales". I changed the diagram adding Mild, I hope you agree about where I placed it. Anything else to be fixed?? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a> 10:02, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
One of the problems with a fixed beer style chart is that it is difficult to embrace the complexities of the differing ways that beers are grouped. Saison is an ale made with pale malt and so is a pale ale. It has associations with Belgium, so people like to group it with Belgian beers. If the same beer is made in France people call it a Biere de Garde. Beers are sometimes grouped by country as well as by recipe or ingredients or colour. Such is the delightful muddle of beer classification! <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 23:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>the chart is meant to give an overview, then any reader can get more precise information on the relative article. I wrote "Belgian ale" meaning all the particular ales that can't be classified as anything else and that were invented in Belgium. I can replace it with "Special ale" if you prefer, but then we should make a "Special ale" article (while <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_ale.html" title="Belgian ale">Belgian ale</a> alread exists).</dd>
<dd>About multiple names, I had the same problem with Wheat beer, that can be called white beer, bier blanche (is it spell right?), weissbier, weizenbier, etc. but it's the same thing. A user who is confused can go in the relative article to know more about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>if you think any other way of classifying can be useful, we can make that as well, no problem&#160;:-), but I think a chart is the clearest thing. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a> 06:26, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would like to see a chart of some kind, but from the drinkers' POV, not the brewer's. I would find it interesting, for example, if the chart showed two separate categories: 1. alcohol content 2. taste (bitter, sweet, sour). Most of the data for this kind of chart is easily available (the alcohol content, for example), however quantifying taste may be more difficult.</li>

<dd>I thought this approach could be useful (that was the same approach of Wikipedia articles, even if nobody noticed it...) because, thanks to this, anybody can understand which kind of beer is drinking just looking at the label of the bottle and at the chart. Any other kind of classification is welcome, but I think we'd better try to work on finishing this existing chart first. I agree about using as few names as possible, to keep it simple and clear, but I didn't want to ignore any important kind. Which one do you think is in excess in the chart?? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a> 04:59, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many of those charts in the other articles are written by home-brewers who think technical information is important for everyone. I agree with you completely that the idea should be to let anyone get more information about the type of beer they are drinking even if they know nothing about home-brewing. Unfortunately, beer labels are not the same in all countries. Germany, for example, usually lists the beer type in addition to the name. Belgium and the Netherlands, however, list the type much less. In Europe, I believe all bottles list abv, although I am not sure about the US. It is possible to get a list of the major beer types from brewers groups in <a href="http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=727" class="external text" title="http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=727" rel="nofollow">Belgium</a> and <a href="http://www.brauer-bund.de/bierfans/sorten/inhalt.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.brauer-bund.de/bierfans/sorten/inhalt.htm" rel="nofollow">Germany</a> and from <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180657" class="external text" title="http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180657" rel="nofollow">CAMRA</a> in the UK.

<dd>thanks for the links but... do you speak all languages?! I didn't know the Italian link either, it's really interesting. I don't think this chart goes too technical. Since it puts similar beers in the same "section", if a drinker has a reminder of a beer he had in the past, he can guess how another similar beer is going to taste like. And since the chart is quite small (compared to the huge complexity of brewing), it can give a quick overview. I know, Belgian beers usually don't show the beer type as big as Germans do, but it is often written smaller somewhere on the label, and the user can look for it until he finds any of the names of the chart.</dd>

The Italian site you sent me is <i>very</i> detailed about beer styles, I will take a look carefully when I have more time. The best way to improve this chart would be to show this chart on the German and French wikipedia, so that more people can express their opinion about it.

<li>As your links clearly demonstrate, "beer style guidelines" is an expression used by brewers, not by beer drinkers. And so, is of more interest to brewers than drinkers. However, having said that, my goal was not to start a debate, simply to state what I consider a valid point. There is an association for Belgian brewers and they have a style list on their site (in English). I think their list also demonstrates the difference between how "style guides" are greatly different between European brewing nations and the US. Here it is: <a href="http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=727" class="external free" title="http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=727" rel="nofollow">http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=727</a> For comparison, here is another list (from the Zythos site) made by someone who is proposing a new beer festival. He says that his group is trying to present as many different Belgian beer styles as possible and offers the list of styles they hope to present: <a href="http://www.zythos.be/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5149#5149" class="external free" title="http://www.zythos.be/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5149#5149" rel="nofollow">http://www.zythos.be/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5149#5149</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 14:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Style guidelines are not just for brewers, but are for anyone with a reason or a desire to judge beers or to categorize them. A big thank you to those who have located other sources of style guidelines. I personally am most familiar with BJCP, but I think drawing from all these different style guidelines can only be a good thing.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I assume you are a home-brewer because I have only heard this from other home-brewers. In the milieu where I drink beer, nobody says "what style was that?" they say instead "did you like that beer". That is how beer drinkers talk with each other. What you suggest is how brewers talk with each other. Let's at least be clear about that. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikebe_d621.html" title="User:Mikebe">Mikebe</a> 20:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One reverted edit raised the question of how many beer styles there are. I think that's like asking how many styles of music there are. Is stout a style? Well, yes, but it can be subdivided into sweet stout, dry stout, milk stout, oatmeal stout, Russian Imperial stout, and probably others. Are those all styles too, then?</dd>
<dd>Until recently there was a subsection of Elements of Style that listed vital statistics; it has been gutted and renamed, and is now largely redundant with other subsections; in my opinion should be restored to something closer to what it was.

<dd><i>The strength of the beer can refer to three variables: original gravity, final gravity, and alcohol concentration.</i></dd>

<p>Isn't it <i>one</i> variable --- the beer's alcohol concentration, which is determined by the difference between the final gravity and the original gravity?

<dd>The brewer can control originl gravity, and he can control attenuation. I count that as two independent variables; final gravity is a dependent variable of those two and any two uniquely determine the third.</dd>

</ul>
<p>The above three are the ones still present in the current edit of the article. Unlike a couple of the pages below, none of the above pages attempts to cover all beer styles. The first two give pretty detailed coverage of a subset of beer styles and as such would be good to keep; the third (the CAMRA page) isn't that closely about beer styles per se and if paring down the list is needed it would be one of the leading candidates for removal (though it would be a good link from one or more of the specific style articles). If you're going to keep it, at least link to the <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180657" class="external text" title="http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180657" rel="nofollow">styles subpage</a> instead.</p>

</ul>
<p>All of these at least attempt to cover all beer styles. Of these, the Brewers Association page is the most homebrew oriented and if that's grounds for removal would be the first to go. The BJCP page should probably be changed to link the <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.html" rel="nofollow">style subpage</a> but is still one of the best resources I've seen on beer styles. It is somewhat homebrew oriented but I don't think that's enough of a detriment to outweigh the quality of the information. Both the Beer Advocate and the Michael Jackson page are oriented toward beer drinkers, not homebrewers, and both include a number of beer styles not covered by any of the pages from the first group.</p>
<p>If the objective for links in the article to give the reader the best resources for additional information then IMO the CAMRA and the Brewers Association links could go; the rest should stay. --<a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalimu59_7f54.html" title="User:Mwalimu59">Mwalimu59</a> 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
