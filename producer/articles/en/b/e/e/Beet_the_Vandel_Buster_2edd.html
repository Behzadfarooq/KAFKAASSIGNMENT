<p>The story is set in the "Century of Darkness" (Ankoku no Seiki), a term referring to the time since Vandels appeared and started attacking humans. Beet is a boy who dreams of joining the "Zenon Warriors", a group of "Vandel Busters" who are considered to be the strongest on the continent. When the group comes to protect his village from the Vandel, Beltorze, Beet tries to join them but is rejected.</p>
<p>When Beltorze appears, the Zenon Warriors seem to have the upper hand until Beet cheers them on, causing the Vandel to notice his presence. Beltoze attacks Beet so the Zenon Warriors to drop formation to help him. Beltoze uses that moment to attack again, which mortally wounds all of them. Hidden in the smoke, the Zenon Warriors decide to rescue Beet’s life by putting their life force into their “Saiga” and giving them to Beet. When Beet complains and asks them why they are doing this, it is revealed that Zenon is Beet’s brother. The now weaponless Zenon Warriors then emerge from the smoke and continue to attack Beltoze. When Beet regains consciousness, both Beltoze and the Zenon Warriors are gone. Guilt ridden and sad, he cries and vows to destroy all the Vandels and end the Century of Darkness. He then goes on a three-year training expedition.</p>
<p>His childhood friend, Poala, later joins Beet and they form the “Beet Warriors”. As the story continues more is learned about the fight between the Zenon Warriors and Beltorze and the fantasy world of Beet is expanded on.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Beet</dt>
<dd>Beet is a young boy who has always desired to be the strongest Buster. He aspires to be like his heroes, the Zenon Warriors, who are known as the strongest of all Busters. However, unknown to Beet, the leader of the Zenon Warriors is his brother. When Beet was a baby, Zenon wanted Beet to stay away the path he chose, wanting him to live a life of peace which he tried to give him. One day, Beet told his heroes he had become a Buster, they quickly told him to quit, telling him he was not fit for such a thing. Beet, however, believed that Busters are fighters for justice and continued the hard Buster life. However due to a fight with Beltoze, the "King of Tragedy", the strongest Vandel of all, the Zenon Warriors were critically hit. To make things worse, Beet, showed up to the fight trying to cheer his heroes. Beletoze saw Beet and rapidly took him as a hostage and mortally wounded him. Seeing this horror, the Zenon Warriors became distracted and were hit by Beletoze’s most powerful attack, the Phantom Explosion. Thus, after receiving such an attack, they were left at a critical state. Worst of all, Beet was about to die. To save his life, they decided to give up their lives and give Beet part of their souls which were sealed in their Saiga, the power symbol of a Buster. Beet reluctantly tries to stop this, however, he is finally told that Zenon is his brother, and in a dramatic moment, Beet sees his heroes leave to try and defeat Beltorze- even without any Divine Power or Saiga. Seeing them leave, Beet promises that he will become the strongest Buster and end the suffering Vandels cause to the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus Beet grows over three years and begins learning to handle his gift, and founds the Beet Warriors to end the Dark Century. Beet is not particularly intelligent (something to which he openly admits) but he has a good heart. He is not able to use Divine Power as most of his fellow Busters can which sometimes makes Beet ashamed, though his amazing use of Saiga show that Beet is truly at another level. Beet also has is his ability to stay awake for three days, after which he falls into an almost comatose sleep for one day. He is a reckless prodigy on the battlefield, defeating strong monsters and Vandels (just barely) relying on his Saiga, his will to complete his goal, his luck, and his friends. Many, however, believe that such luck might also show that Beet has true strength within him- something that he has not truly developed. Beet is angry that other Busters are mostly corrupt, since he believes that they must protect others at all times. He likes to help people and never asks for money in return, except the Buster reward money which is given when you defeat a Vandel or level up. Since he does not use money, he usually camps in the wilderness and eats bugs which are free- much to his teammates' dismay.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Currently, Beet has a one-star bounty on his head, although this knowledge has only been released to the seven-star vandels. These Vandels drew cards to determine the order of who gets to attempt to kill Beet. This bounty was placed on his head after he managed to kill Gruneede.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is an extremely strong Saiga, controlled by Beet's brother Zenon. It is a powerful sword materialized by the Divine Power of Light. Its appearance, with its angelic wings, Reflects its majestic, heavenly force. The Excellion Blade Beet can Materialize, is an imperfect Excellion Blade. It is also the Saiga he can use while under intense gravity due to its nature and effect on the user.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is the Saiga of Laio. Laio, the lead attacker of the Zenon Warriors, was closest to Beet. Since Beet learned the Sohjutsu (Art of the Spear) from Laio, he uses this Saiga the most often. Born out of the Divine Power of Fire, this spear always radiates with heat and burns the bodies of its enemies as it slices through their flesh. As a first choice, it's the best weapon to use against Vandels. The Burning Lance can also extend, and gain a second spear head on its other end as shown in Beets brief battle against the Winged Knight.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is the Saiga of Alside, another member of the Zenon Warriors. He is known for his silent presence and his accurate shots. Materialized by the Divine Power of Wind, it has incredible speed. The damage it can inflict is immense, and it can bring forth an enormous plume of smoke wherever its bullet hits. The blade that stretches below the muzzle is sharp and can be used during close combat. At first, Beet can only fire on shot with the Cyclone Gunner.At first, Beet thought that this was because of the difference between his and Alside's level of wind tengeki, but in order to fire multiple shots, Beet soon discovered that he had to sync his breathing with the gun's.</dd>

<dd>This is the Saiga of Cruss, another member of the Zenon Warriors. It was made from the Divine Power of Water. This Saiga is known as the world's strongest shield. While it is primarily used to deflect attacks, it can also turn into a ball and chain that can be used to pound enemies into the ground. This Saiga also can clense a body of poisons, make it a very versatile saiga.</dd>

</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dd>Beet's so-called future wife that joins Beet in his adventure. Her family adopted Beet after Zenon left Beet to fight against Vandels. Poala has looked over Beet since they were very young, being critically harsh on his mistakes and wanting him to think reasonably which, of course, he does not do most of the time. When Beet leaves for his training in the outside world, Poala decides to become a Buster herself to protect her town from the menaces which arise. She is a tough, tomboyish girl that is ready to get her hands dirty in a fight with Vandels. She's a reasoning person, and does not understand how Beet can be calm and collected in very tough times such as fighting against tough Vandels. Also, she's the brains of the Beet Warriors, keeping everything about the group in her special diary, she is also the money manager, though sometimes she spends the money to “help” the group by buying all sorts of weapons. She likes to use the Divine Power of fire, specifically fireballs. Poala does not like to eat bugs or rough it, and sometimes hates camping with Beet because of his weird schedule, yet this is a major part of survival while busting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Her favored weapons are a pair of short swords and an arm-mounted armored gun. Her strongest power is the Divine Attack of Fire and its powerful Burst End technique. Fired at point blank range, this attack can annihilate even the toughest targets. She discovered this move in the battle with Grineed, in which it completely annihilated the Vandel's arm.</dd>

Kissu along with the rest of Beet's group</div>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dd>Beet's best friend and partner, Beet meets Kissu two years into his training, and was amazed with Kissu's abilities. Kissu is different from other Busters because he is a master of all five types of Divine Powers, while most Busters only use one. He is also exceptionally intelligent and able to notice even the smallest details and find a solution to complicated problems in a matter of seconds. He is not confident with himself and is wary of living up to his dreams but he wants to be bolder like Beet. Therefore, one day Beet and Kissu decide to make goals they wish to achieve. Beet’s goal is to end the Dark Century, while Kissu decides to be the world's greatest master of the Divine Attack. Though it was time for both to take different paths, Beet went on with his training, defeating all kinds of Vandels. Kissu, meanwhile, decided to join another Buster team which took him in. As they traveled, Kissu was always treated as a weakling by his peers, until one day, a powerful Vandel appeared and challenged them. Seeing that the Vandel was beyond their powers, the team told Kissu to distract the Vandel with his Divine Attack while the others prepared a devastating attack to eliminate it. Kissu accepted and attacked the Vandel with all he had, which was useless. When he turned back to give the signal of attack, his partners were escaping-Kissu was used as a sacrificial lamb. Shocked, Kissu stood there while the Vandel struck the team with his power killing them. To his surprise, the Vandel spared him since he was brave enough to attack him. As his partners had attempted to escape, the Vandel granted them death instead. Devastated, Kissu started to ponder the nature of humans. He traveled without direction until he stopped at a Vandel ruin, admiring them and beginning think how noble Vandels truly were. That was when he met Grineed, who was amazed that a human was looking at Vandel ruins. Seeing this, he took advantage of Kissu and decided to take him as his henchman, placing on him a poisonous bracelet, the symbol of Grineed's influence over Kissu. Kissu stayed with Grineed and obeyed every order that was given him, until one day, the one person that had changed his life came back-Beet. Then, he became ambiguous as to which side to stick with: the Vandel’s or Beet’s? After Beet defeated Frausky, Grineed's henchman, they were attacked by Rozzgoat, another powerful Vandel under Grineed. During the battle, he stood between Rozzgoat and a weakened Beet. At this point he decided that he would never leave his friend and would fulfill his dreams alongside him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After the team defeated Rozzgoat, Kissu rapidly joins the Beet Warriors being the long range Divine Attacker. He complains and pities himself sometimes as they travel, since he was out of shape, not being able to use Divine Power for two years. Though, when he is confident in himself, Kissu and Beet are an unstoppable team. However, serving under a Vandel is considered a serious crime, and Kissu is wanted by the Buster Association. After the Beet Warriors destroy Grineed, the Broad Buster Milfa sees the faith Kissu's team has in him and decides to escort the Beet Warriors to Kissu's trial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kissu's fighting style consists of using all five forms of Divine Attack (Fire, Wind, Water, Thunder, Light) to nail his enemies at long-range. To make it work properly, he throws arrows of light that secretly carry another Divine Power within them, making it hard to predict for his opponents what kind of Divine Attack it ultimately is. In addition, he's skilled at manipulating the Divine Attack of wind around his body as a shield. He has a favored final attack, Tensei of Ice Shockwave (Frozen Wave of Divine Blue in the English manga), which pierces foes with an arrow of ice, freezing them completely. This, coupled with his genius-level intellect makes him a formidable Buster and asset to Beet's team.</dd>

Slade from ep#14</div>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dd>Slade is Beet’s rival and is always looking for a chance to defeat Beet in a battle since he dislikes Beet's naivety to the world of Busters. Slade believes that being a Buster is not a charity work as Beet does, so he asks for money for defeating Vandels he encounters in towns. He is an assassin by nature. Slade tends to be a loner, though within that hard shell, there lies a noble person who will fight for justice. Slade has also saved Beet from himself, mostly when Beet falls asleep accidentally in the midst of battle. He even helped Beet escape from Beltorze and confronts him to buy Beet some time. He uses a spear like Beet and uses the Divine Power of Wind. He is strong enough to use a "Secret" Saiga that his enemies "almost" never see called Silent Grave. It is a spear Saiga compressed to its limits so that it can cut through anything- even the skin of the strongest Vandel. He boasts that by the time it's noticed it has already killed. Beltorze calls him an assassin and says he must have killed many. Beet accuses him of taking money for non-Buster work, he calls it taking jobs on the side... perhaps monsters and Vandels aren't the only things he's killed?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Though it's not yet known if he shows up for the second season of Beet the Vandel Buster, he does make a reappearance in the final chapter of Volume 9 of the manga, and Volume 10 onwards as well. It seems that Slade is developing a rivalry with Kissu, although it's not quite the same type as the one he shares with Beet. At first Slade has a degree of disdain toward Kissu, he begins to respect him during the campaign against Garonewt.</dd>

<dd>Milfa is a young Broad Buster. (Broad Busters are like police for Vandel Busters, hunting down buster who break laws)She may seem to be a naive and weak girl, but she is incredibly strong since Broad Busters are considered to be the strongest Buster force. However, as Level Forty is the minimum to be a BB and Milfa is only in the low forties, she is still technically a rookie Broad Buster. She is very flirtatious with Beet. After she sees his Saiga she realizes that he has inherited the Saiga of the Zenon Warriors. She considers Beet's encounter a "meeting of fate" because she idolized Zenon from childhood, and believes Beet will grow up to be just like him. Beet is impressed by her fighting skills, but does not understand her flirting. Milfa also falls in love with Kissu after he saves her and displays his amazing Divine Attack uses. Milfa mostly fights with martial arts. She fights with the Divine Power of Lightning, focusing it on her self like a lightning rod with devastating results (lightning armor or aura of sorts). Milfa has a huge Saiga called the Lightbolt Grasper, usable as a huge clamp to grapple larger enemies. Milfa considers Poala to have great potential, and together, Lightning and Fire make a wonderful team with Milfa as the mentor.</dd>

However, Jiiku, unlike Slade, has the same views as Beet on what Busters should truly be like, as he was saved by the Zenon Warriors when he was a kid. Believing he should be Zenon's successor, he tends to loathe Beet for having inherited the Zenon Warriors' Saiga. Naturally, he's always eager to show he's better than Beet. Besides his arrogance and pride, he also has a weakness for pretty much any girl he meets. Due to this he instantly fell in love with both Poala and Milfa when he first met them. His two teammates are Ryuku and Raku, twins who use spears while he favors swords. He fights with the Divine Power of Fire, but usually just uses his fire Saiga Blaster Edge, which is a special sword that can both fire smaller blades attached to it and have its blade ignite. While at first he really did not like Beet at all, he eventually did develop some respect for him when he learned how much the Beet Warriors believed in him. He is an anime original character and does not show up in the manga.</dd>

<dt>Zenon</dt>
<dd>Leader of the Zenon Warriors, a group of Vandel Busters. He is Beet's elder brother and is considered to be one of the strongest Busters of all times. At the beginning of the story Zenon is against Beet becoming a Vandel Buster since he left Beet in the care of Poala's parents to live a peaceful life in the Age of Darkness. But when Beet is mortally wounded by the Vandel Beltorze, "The King of Tragedy", Zenon and the other four Zenon Warriors give Beet their Saiga to save his life and fulfill his vow to end the Age of Darkness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He is a swordsman whose Divine Power is Light and he wields the Excellion Blade, a huge white sword with wings one the inside edge. His signature move is the "Zenon Windzard", an attack where Zenon leaps in the air and, once he is close enough to the Vandel, Zenon slashes vertically, making this an unstoppable move for any normal Vandel. Beltorze admitted that it took his full power to block and it still cut halfway through his arm. The Excellion Blade has the ability to control gravity which allows the user to move faster and jump higher.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Excellion Blade is one of the Saiga Beet has not yet mastered. Even though he can materialize it and slash enemies, it is still not complete. This is evident in his fight with Beltorze's phantom in Volumes 2 and 3 of the manga when he tries to use the "Zenon Windzard" against him, but it ends up shattering after he strikes Beltorze, showing the long way he still has left to be able to completely use the Saiga.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Shagi makes a cryptic statement about how if Beet is Zenon's brother and can wield his Saiga that he must also have "that power." This has yet to be explained. Zenon makes a similar statement himself in the first volume, when Poala's parents tell him of Beet's odd sleeping habits. Zenon's inner dialogue reveals that a Buster's strength is connected to their sleep, and ponders if Beet could have that much more power.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In volume 11 it shows the Cruss tells Beet about the real fight. Zenon used a hidden power that made him stronger and able to fight beltorze with no saiga. The power was made to get to the next step of the saiga but he didnt have one because he gave it to beet. <i><b>Saiga</b></i><br />

<dt>Alside</dt>
<dd>A member of the Zenon Warriors. He has a calm endeavor, and silent presence. He usually does not talk and mostly meditates to “unify” himself with his soul. He is the long distance fighter of the group. He uses a gun, his Divine Power is Wind, and he uses the Saiga Cyclone Gunner.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Cyclone Gunner is the third Saiga Beet starts to master. At first, the Saiga is hard for Beet to use because he can only fire one shot in comparison with Alside, who could fire lots of bullets. At first Beet though it was the difference of Tenryoku they both had which limited Beet’s amount of shots. After his second fight with the Vandel Frausky he realizes he has to synchronize his breathing with the Cyclone Gunner (since it breathes air, this explains why Alside could shoot consecutive times without having to reload) in order to shoot an unlimited amount of bullets- in fact, in Beet's words, the Gunner has no bullets to begin with. Using this knowledge, Cyclone Gunner becomes a mighty weapon in Beet’s arsenal. The Cyclone Gunner has a secondary form where it fires a thin beam of power and can accurately hit enemies that are far away, almost like a sniper's weapon. This secret ability enables Beet to simultaneously kill the Vandels Ventura and Frausky.</dd>

<dt>Laio</dt>
<dd>A member of the Zenon Warriors. He is the lead attacker, using a spear as his weapon. His Divine Power is Fire, and his Saiga is the Burning Lance. He teaches Beet Sohjutsu (the art of spears) and as a result, the spear is Beet's preferred weapon. In the anime Laio is known as "the Master of Spears" which goes to show how well known the Zenon Warriors are. At first it seems like Laio is annoyed by Beet, but in reality he really cares about him. He is even amazed on how Beet changed when he became a Buster, admiring his dream and his will to become as strong as the group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Burning Lance is one the first Saiga Beet begins to master at the start of the series, since his main weapon is a spear. Beet can power up the Lance using his divine power called (though if Beet tries to use the Divine Attack of Fire without the Burning Lance, he ends up burning his own hand) and can make it stretch to unbelievable heights similar to Son Goku's nyoi-bou from the story "Journey to the West" and it's also like <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gin_Ichimaru_61b3.html" title="Gin Ichimaru">Gin Ichimaru</a>'s shikai which lets it grow to a large amount.). The Burning Lance also has the ability to change into a twin-headed spear, though Beet has not yet used this particular power. He uses this mortal weapon many times, relying on its strength to defeat many Vandels.</dd>

<dt>Cruss</dt>
<dd>A member of the Zenon Warriors. He is the defender and the healer of the group. He uses a shield (which is attached to a chain and can be used as an offensive weapon), his Divine Power is Water, and his Saiga is the Crown Shield. Cruss can use his Saiga or his normal shield to heal his teammates of poison one of his special abilities.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Crown Shield is the second saiga Beet begins to master. At first, Beet considered Crown Shield useless for attack and only served to be a defense object. After Beet's first fight with Beltorze he remembers Cruss teaching him that he should use offense and defense with a shield. He also remembers that Cruss used his shield to heal Laio of a poison he was infected with when they fought a Vandel earlier that day. Beet uses the Crown Shield to save Poala from one of Grineed's poisonous arrows.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When Beltorze finds him he thinks that Beet would be trembling in fear. But instead Beet had an idea of defeating him, he told Beltorze that in their first fight he used too many Saiga, so instead he should just rely on one and fight aggressively with it, so Beet decides to fight with the Crown Shield, which he declares the best Saiga to use against Beltorze. To Beltorze’s surprise, Beet turns the Saiga into a spiked ball and begins to hammer him. When Beltorze tries to use his most powerful Dark Attack, the "Phantom Explosion", Beet turns the Crown Shield back into its shield form, deflecting the attack and killing the phantom Beltorze. After the fight, Beet realizes had he not interfered in the fight three years ago between Beltorze and the Zenon Warriors, Cruss would not have broken formation and they would have won.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In Volume 8, Beet finds out that Cruss is still alive, but he has lost his memory and cannot use his arms any more. Cruss is living as a painter, now named Cain, in the service of the leader of the country of Bekatrute. In Volume 9, he was captured by Garonewt to be used as a hostage against Beet. It also seems that Cruss is slowly regaining his memories, as evident when he saw an image of a younger Poala when she saved him, and remembered his battle with Beltorze when Beet spoke his name. It should also be known, that there is a painting of Beltorze hanging up in his studio. Cruss mentioned that he continously sees this portrait in his dreams.</dd>

<dt>Bluezam</dt>
<dd>Bluezam was the muscle of Zenon Warriors. Bluezam's Divine Attack was Thunder and his Saiga was the Boltic Axe. Being so strong, Bluezam could make Vandels fly with only one swing of his axe. The Boltic Axe was a massive weapon with incredible power which only Bluezam could use. It seems as though Bluezam was telepathic, as he said he read Zenon's mind when Zenon considered giving Beet the Saiga. Whether he was truly telepathic or if this was a figure of speech remains unclear. When Bluezam was about to die, he was the first to give up his Saiga, showing his golden heart.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Saiga which Beet used the least was his Boltic Axe. One reason for this was its incredible and difficult-to-handle power level. In Volume 6, Beet told Poala that if he ever had to use it, she should run away as quickly as possible because he did not know the effects. Another reason is that it took him some time to materialize it: exactly twelve seconds. Because of these reasons, the Boltic Axe was only used by Beet as a last resort. He was able to control it to some extent, as was evidenced by his fight with Grineed. In Volume 7, he used the Boltic Axe to cut off the villain Grineed's horn when he was in his true form, because the axe was the only weapon with enough power to hurt him. However, his inexperience with the Saiga almost made him destroy the battlefield completely.</dd>

It is possible that he may be one of the Zenon Warriors, but Beet falls asleep before learning whether this is the case or not. Speculations about his battle with Beet can conclude that he may be Zenon. In the anime the winged knight sounds alot like Zenon. May also be Alside considering his skill with a gun and his body size.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>A vandel that terrorized the hometown of Beet and Poala while Beet was off training, and was the first one Beet destroyed in the manga. He is composed entirely of mud, fitting as he resides in a rotting swamp. Mugine's pride lies in his intelligence, and he enjoys making complicated plans and calculations to rid himself of his enemies. This vandel has an apparent preference of the water element, using mostly water monsters as his servants. However, he also employs drawmen and drawmasters in his plots. Mugine enjoys poisoning areas with his mud lizard-filled black bogs, and had infected many areas before he was defeated. To attack, he absorbs water and turns it into a long, sharp blade, though he has created blades without water. Being composed of liquid, he can detach parts of his body and use them to immobilize his opponents. After being sliced in half by Beet, he regenrated his lost abdomen by consuming his monsters and fusing them into his body. In this state, he could create multiple blades from the crack between the halves of his body and spin them in a buzzsaw fashion. He was destroyed by the efforts of Beet and Poala outside the Gate of their town, ironically with the water-based Crown Shield's light.</dd>

<dd>Ventura deserves mention by virtue of his shear pitifulness. It seems unlikely that he obtained any of his stars with out Grineed's help. Poala maimed and pummeled him without even using divine attacks. He boasts and bluffs then grovels like the worm he is when things go wrong. He is vain, cowardly and spiteful. Grineed made him his servant so he must be good for something, bonus material says he functions as a spy. He is without a doubt the weakest Vandel seen so far. He was killed, along with Frausky, by Beet, using the Cyclone Gunner's "sniping" mode, while running away.</dd>

<dd>The Flashy Crimson Bullet</dd>
<dd>Stars: 5</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Frausky is one of Grineed's lackeys, said to be his strongest. Unlike Rozzgoat who is a dark attack specialist or Grineed who crushes his opponents with his fist, Frausky relies of the unique properties of his body. His right hand and forearm turn into a pistol that fire biological bullets that are generated inside his body giving him effectively unlimited ammo. His right arm works as a cannon firing bombs and he can launch a bunch of needles from his hair. Most formidable of all is his ability to withstand and recover from damage. Frausky has what he calls a core, it's about the size of a golf ball has a face on it and to leaves sticking out of the top. Frausky can survive anything so long as his core is intact, although injuries may still reduce his fighting ability. The core is usually concealed and can be moved to any part of his body. If he finds himself in danger, he separates what ever part as the core then plants it in soil to grow a whole new body. This is usually done with his left arm so he will not lose his stars. The abandoned body explodes violently. The strangest thing about Frausky is his love for children and animals. He says that baby animals and humans have an aura of helplessness and that he cannot kill them. When Shagi questions him about killing Beet, who is a child, he says that humans are cute until they reach a certain size after that they are "out of bounds" and it okay to kill them. He is killed with Ventura when Beet used Cyclone Gunner's "sniper mode".</dd>

<dd>Slade called Beltorze "That legendary monster." After his fight with Zenon and his squad, Beltorze is left weakened and unable to move. Therefore he uses a phantom (puppet with his figure) to raid and kill innocent towns, people, and weaker Vandels. His phantom was beaten by Beet in an epic battle. This battle helped Beet grow in fame in the Vandel world and moreover become Beltorze's awaited enemy. Until that day, he grows in power in the mountains as time passes. Shagi calls him the veteran who never moves. It seems as if he cannot move but it is possible he just does not. He considers the Vandel scholar Noa his best friend as one who has the traits he lacks. Beltorze lives for challenges and loves to fight. When Noah ask him if he plans to challenge God noticing that he has strengthened his body again he answers "If God exists and is an opponent that can make my blood boil then I will" He will be the fourth seven star to try to kill Beet.</dd>

<dt>Garonewt</dt>
<dd>The Immovable Giant</dd>
<dd>Stars: 7</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A huge Vandel who is apparently made of bricks, Garonewt uses his special ability gravi zone to render his opponents too heavy to move, then smashes them with his fists. His skill with Dark attacks seems limited to powering up his fist. He has thousands of stolen monsters stored in his body bricks. He can release them by breaking the bricks. He can also store other Vandels but only if all their stars are removed, but any wounds they have will heal. Creatures in the bricks generate no dark energy so they pass through the shield that extends above a city wall with no problem. He has two arm shields that, like his fists, are so hard that the Excellion Blade could barely scratch them with regular attacks. The left one turns into a launcher for his bricks. He is slated to challenge Beet first. (Although he rigged the contest to determine order to ensure that he would be the first.) In volume 10, in his battle against Beet and his group, Garonewt was able to get rid of every monster block inside of him, which increased his speed dramatically.</dd>

<dd>Stars: 7</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other then the fact he plays the guitar little is known about this seven star Vandel. He is to be the third 7 star to challenge Beet. As shown in volume 11, Hystario hides a blade in his guitar, which he draws against Baron. Whether this is the blade that earned him his title is still unknown as of this moment.</dd>

<dt>Lady Rodina</dt>
<dd>The Little Devil</dd>
<dd>Stars: 7</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rodina is the first female Vandel to be seen in the story; she might be the only one. She looks human and is rather cute. She claims that other Vandels often accuse her of acting human but she is a 7 star Vandel and that does not happen by being nice. Her specialty is creating portals to move herself or others quickly from one place to another. She saved Beet from Garonewt but only so he would not get an unfair jump on the other 7 stars. Her constant companion is Cynthia the margtin - a type of small nearly blind monster with retraceable spine sharp teeth and bottomless appetite for human flesh. She is to be the fifth 7 star to challenge Beet.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Chief of the Dark House of Sorcery, Shagie is in charge of distributing stars and creating monsters. He appears in the form of a rabbit and most of the time seems happy, but has a bit of evil margining under his surface. Who knows whom he serves - elegance, Beltorze or even what he called the "creator". Often provides Vandels with information on Busters. Has the ability to create doors leading from one place to another. He answers to the Eyes of Darkness who created the Vandels. It is unknown just how powerful he really is.</dd>

<dd>The Vandel Scholar</dd>
<dd>Stars: 7</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Said to have mastered all fields of study, Noa is what Grineed could only pretend to be...an intellectual. He dislikes fighting and never sought to be a seven star Vandel. In his own words, "I simply brushed off the sparks that landed on me and this is what I received." He created the Beltorze Phantom that Beet destroyed. He has withdrawn from the contest to kill Beet as he has no interest in being the 8 star Vandel. All he cares for is his studies. He is friends with Beltorze, and drew for him in the contest to determine order. It is also implied that he is in fact incredibly powerful, as evident when Beltorze said only fools cannot see the terrifying power in Noa. Noa wears what seem to be one half of a pair of spyglass, like those the Saiyans use in Dragon Ball Z, over his left eye. Whether it is there for reason or not is unknown, but it may be that this glass gives Noa some sort of power to predict what happens in a certain amount of time based on the current situation. Or it may be that this glass just does all the calculations for him.</dd>

<dd>The Bloody Beast/The Clever Honcho of Deep Green/The Dark Dreen Tactician</dd>
<dd>Stars: 6 later 7</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The self-proclaimed Dark Green Tactician, Grineed is considered to be one of the top Vandels matching in strength even the mighty king Beltorze. He detests the violent nature of Vandels, especially his own, and tries to contain himself by encasing himself in a special shell. He uses poisons and henchmen to do his dirty work, typically, rather than fight himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When angered, though (this can occur at provocations as small as a bad choice of words), Grineed shows the true nature of the creature beneath the shell. Provoked enough, the creature will burst free of his shell. In this form, known by the other Vandels as Bloody Beast Grineed, he is virtually indestructible and nightmarishly strong. Using his Peak Infuriation attack a.k.a Fierce Wave of Infuriated Steel in the manga, he can create a powerful blast with deadly results. Unlike other Vandels who view humans as a source of amusement, Grineed seems to genuinely hate them.</dd>

<dd>Zande first appeared with the intention of destroying the town of Uncruz, only for the reason of spiting the Vandel Beltorze who also wanted it destroyed. Beet, only a Level 1 Buster at the time, attempted to fight Zande, was an easy target for one of Zande's sword-throwing attacks. Beet was saved by Zenon, who then swordfought against Zande. Zande was able to cut through Zenon's sword but the rest of the Zenon Warriors came to Zenon's aid. Zande proved to be a formidable opponent for the Zenon Warriors, but their teamwork was able to badly damage him. Zande was ultimately killed by the Zenon and his Excellion Blade, using his attack Zenon Windzard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Zande used Thunder-type Dark Attacks, along with the Right-Handed Thunder. Zande also used a sword made of electric energy which could be thrown as a spear as well.</dd>

<dd>Barasa was a strong Vandel who had always wanted to control the Black Horizon. However, it was under the control of the stronger Vandel, Grineed. During Grineed's reign, Barasa put himself in a coma but awoke himself upon Grineed's death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Immediately after awakening, Barasa captured the city of Termits, a.k.a. The Fortified Port by planting mushrooms which in turn captured the humans. When the Beet Warriors entered the city, they found him killing a Vandel Buster. The Beet Warriors immediately engaged Barasa in a fight, but were overwhelmed by Barasa's extreme speed. Barasa then blackmailed the Beet Warriors by showing them that all the mushrooms surrounding them contained humans and that if the mushrooms were hit by their attacks, the humans in them would die. Barasa had also set up a cannon, whose powerful blasts were enough to send the Beet Warriors into the seas.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Leon</dt>
</dl>
<p>The hard-headed future leader of Shantigo since his father is the leader of Shantigo. He likes escaping at home and "elope". His reason for escaping is that he does'nt want to follow his father's steps and like for him to be a buster and another is that he wants to have a different "atmosphere". The four gaurdians(Tonga, Ibel, Grifas, and Raymond) usually calls him master as of course because even the 4 gaurdians has their own high position, their master or what is called leader of a community. Vaus likes his power that reason why he is always Vaus' henchman's target. Her mother was killed by Vaus because her mother is once one of the protectors of the place.

<dl>
<dt>Busters</dt>
<dd>Vandel Busters are often called Busters. To become a Buster one applies at the Buster "house" to get a brand that indicates their level. Levels are similar to RPG game level systems in that the more monsters or Vandels one help kills the higher one's level. It should be noted that the buster's level is more a reflection of how much they have done than how strong they are. The Elder working at the House will scan the eyes of a buster to see if they qualify for a new level. When one levels up they are given a Roman numeral like brand on their chest. Elders also give monetary rewards for slaying Vandels and Monsters, allow for the formal formation of groups, and give information. Each "house", in each town, is under the jurisdiction of the Busters Association. (Similar to the vandel hotel)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Busters can work either individually or in groups. Buster are policed by a group known as the Broad Busters, commonly referred to as BB, and must have at least a minimum level of 40. Busters fight with Divine attack (energy in the forms of Air, Fire, Light, Thunder, and Water), or their own individual Saiga (A magic weapon made of divine energey), the ultimate weapon used to fight evil. Normally a Buster is not able to produce a Saiga until they have mastered a certain level of divine attack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Vandels</dt>
<dd>The Vandels are creatures that have a demonic appearance and whose sole purpose seems to be terrorizing humanity. Vandels have a base called the vandel hotel located at the end of the world. The dark house of sorcery is responsible for creating Monsters for the Vandels who order them as well as giving money and marble shaped “Stars” for killing humans and destroying towns. They also provide fortress construction for Vandels, luxuries, etc. The Vandels pay for monsters that they order and other things through dark currency (Humans use MG coins).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Vandels can use dark attacks (Meigeki) to attack. Like Divine attacks they can come in several forms: fire, water, wind, lightning, and sorcery. Vandels control the dark power with their horns which is te hardest part of the vandel's body. If the horn of a powerful vandel is severed, the uncontrolled dark power will accumulate inside his body. The moment the vandel dies, it cause an explosion that is five times as powerful as a first-class dark attack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Vandels start out with one “Star” and like levels more work is required to gain one Star if the Vandel already has several. Supposedly, the first Vandel to obtain eight Stars will become the new leader of the Vandels. The stars shatter when a Vandel is killed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Each Vandel's body is different granting them all manner of unique abilities, weapon generation, monster storage, and being able to regrow an entire body from a golf ball sized "core" just to name few. There is also much more variation in the first class dark attacks then in their divine counter part, Rozzgoat's version of Inferno looks like giant centipede of fire with one eye but another Vandel Inferno would look completely different.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The Eyes of Darkness" is the god and creator of the Vandels. Outside of Shagi and some of the other workers at the vandel hotel its existence appears to be unknown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Encyclopedia of Monsters</dt>
<dd>All the monsters a Vandel can order is listed in this encyclopedia. It is also divided into sections like trees, caves, bogs, etc. The stronger the monster the more expensive it is. Low level monsters are like animals in both intelligence and appearance, they do not take instruction they just do what comes naturally. Higher level monster are much smarter and/or stronger but do not reproduce naturally they must either develop from weaker monsters, a medium beetle grow to a giant beetle, or be purchased.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the past Vandels could make their own monsters. Grineed, "The Clever Honcho of Deep Green" (who is wise and intelligent and hates himself for his bad temper) rediscovers the lost knowledge of creating monsters so that he no longer has to buy them from the Vandel Hotel. He dies before passing on his knowledge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Monsters can be "special ordered" this means they have abilities beyond what is normal for that kind of monster. Example are Dangol a protector bug with human speech and intelligence who served Grineed as a personal assistant and punching bag/stress release device. Another is Hazan, Beltoze's Hound Knight, created in response to a demand for "a strong monster who will not be a burden" he is said to be as strong as a Vandel. Rodina has a monster called Cynthia she keeps as a pet what if any special abilities she has is unclear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are to basic philosophies on monsters. Some Vandel like to buy large numbers of cheap monsters while others prefer a small number of powerful monsters.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="notice spoiler endspoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>
<dl>
<dt>Saiga</dt>
<dd>Saiga are the trademark weapons of Vandel Busters. They are created from a Vandel buster's divine force, and are generally gained in the later levels. A Saiga is a Vandel Buster's soul, and is best wielded by the owner or another who wields said Saiga with the whole of their soul. A Vandel Buster's Saiga, or soul can be transferred to another Vandel Buster, or even a normal human to save their life. Upon it being transferred that person can wield the Saiga at their own will, regardless of their prior training as a Vandel Buster, or lack thereof. Each Vandel Buster can only have one Saiga, unless the Saiga of another Vandel Buster is transferred to him or her. The Saiga reflects the owner's fighting style, abilities, and overall soul. Saiga can have several different forms, which can allow a Vandel Buster to suit many different situations. For example, Cruss' Saiga is a shield which can turn into a morning star like weapon.</dd>
