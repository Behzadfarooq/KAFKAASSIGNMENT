<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_127c.html" title="Edit section: GA Re-review">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">GA Re-review</span></h2>
<p>In reviewing the article according to the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">Good article criteria</a>, I have found the article lacking in several of the criteria for GA status and, unfortunately, have to de-list the article at this time. I listed my concerns below. While in-line citations are important, their absence is only one of several concerns. While addressing these other concerns, I encourage the editors to also work on the missing in-line citations because they are of vital importance to passing WP:V.<br />
<b>1. It is well written.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The lead section is quite short and does not provide sufficient overview of the subject as expectation in the MOS section <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a></li>
<li>The External links section is quite excessive and spammy as it becomes a depository for links. I would encourage the editors to trim the section to the most relevant and educational links that pass <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and provide the most benefit to the reader.</li>
<li>In the section <b>Clarifying agent</b> there is a divergence from the encyclopedic tone of the article with the "How to" instruction speaking to the reader in the line <i>"Since these ingredients may be derived from animals, those concerned with the use or consumption of animal products should obtain specific details of the filtration process from the brewer."</i> Similar issues of encyclopedic tone is in the section <b>Styles</b> with the line <i>"Far more important considerations are answers to the questions: do I like this beer and why?"</i>. That line is also a bit awkward in that it references the plural "questions" but is only immediately followed by a singular question before others come later in the paragraph.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. It is factually accurate and verifiable.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The article has the vast majority of it's section completely absent of in-line citations and as such has difficulty being verified in accordance to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. For the sake of brevity, I only tagged a few items of the article that would be well served with an in-line cite.</li>
<li>The absence of cites also makes statements with vagueness or weasel words hard to distinguish from OR such as this line from the section <b>International Consumption</b> that says <i>"Beer is considered to be a social lubricant in many societies."</i>. The natural question is "by whom?". Another example in the <b>Vessels</b> section <i>"Many drinkers consider that the type of vessel influences their enjoyment of the beer. "</i> Again the question is "Who?"</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. It is broad in its coverage.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>There is not much treatment on consumption rates and lines such as <i>"A lot of beer is sold in beer cans."</i> in the <b>Cans</b> section could use a solid figure with a cite attached to it.</li>
<li>Outside of the mention of health concerns, most of the negative attributes associated with beer is largely uncovered. There have been studies on the effects of beer drinking and violence at sports arenas (leading many facilities to end beer sales early in games). Beer is also generally considered the the main vice for underage drinking due to the frequency and popularity of beer ads.</li>
<li>There is also a bit of US/European centric focus that only gives the scantiest of mention to the perception of Beer in other countries. For instance, it is mentioned that there are breweries in the Middle Eastern countries of Iraq and Syria, yet all forms of alcohol are prohibited in Islam. This presents a point of interest in how beer can co-exist with religious proclamations against it but there is no treatment of this in the article.</li>
<li>I was also surprise that there wasn't much of a mention of Beer in popular culture, with particular notice to how Beer marketing has affected not only the beverage itself but also the marketing medium. During Super Bowl times there are always news report of how the Budweiser Ads help to jack up the price of Super Bowl commercials and turned the SB commercials into a viewership draw in itself.</li>
<li>Also in regards to the Social perception of Beer, are there any reliable sources on "Beer snobbery"? I remember from my ex-husband's beer rating days the difference in perception among Beer connoisseurs who liked European Beers vs American Beers, Micro-brews vs Big Breweries like Bud, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. It follows the neutral point of view policy</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>This is mostly tied into the lacking "breadth of coverage" in regards to some of the negative public perceptions and affects of beer. However, even the ill health effects mention in that section is a bit skimpy and seems to gloss over some of the negative aspects. Overall the article presents a one side presentation of Beer in a sympathetic POV tone.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>5. It is stable</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The article is sufficiently stable</li>
</ul>
<p><b>6. It contains images, where possible, to illustrate the topic.</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>However, do note that the Image:Sjb whiskey malt.jpg has a pending deletion notice for redundancy that should be taken a look at.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I encourage the editors to consider resubmitting for GA status once these concerns have been addressed. The article has clear potential to be an outstanding article and I want to thank the editors for their hard work and dedication in getting the article to this point. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 06:37, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Excellent points. All noted. Action is being taken to restore the article to what it once was. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 17:25, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_127c.html" title="Edit section: Improving this page">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Improving this page</span></h2>
<p>I archieved the old discussion as it contained lots of old stuff that wasn't really a part of the current project. As you can see, the GA review remains a part of the current talk page. This is for the obvious reason: as we continue to edit and improve the Beer article, we want to keep the GA review in mind. Indeed, responding to the GA review should be the first priority for this article.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that I have noticed that I think detract from this article that aren't mentioned in the GA review but I think probably contribute to the GA review's assesment.</p>
<ul>
<li>This article is unsympathetic to bad beer. Unsurprisingly, it's pretty clearly written by people who like good beer, but that leaves the Bud and Heineken quality stuff underrepresented in the article, espcially given the degree to which it is over represented in the market place. This article has a duty to represent that stuff in a POV-free way. I know it hurts to talk about bud like it deserves the name beer, but we have to.</li>
<li>The article strays from being general in a lot of places. On this point:
<ul>
<li>Remember that this is an encycopedia, not a book of trivia. Trivia, no matter how interesting, or on topic, or cool, is still trivia. Trivia is inappropriate to an encyclopedia. Statistics should be informative about the topic of beer in a general way. "The most hops ever used in a beer was 32 lbs. in a barrel" is not general.</li>
<li>It's okay for exceptions to remain un-noted. A lot of times this article decends into lengthy caveats, or mentions this one beer by this one brewery in this one corner of the brewing world that is an exception to a rule that applies to every other beer ever. That creates a really awkward paragraph that doesn't really serve the point of an article whose purpose is to inform in a general way.</li>
<li>Longer is not always better. Some of the sections in this article can probably be trimmed and streamlined.</li>
<li>Use "See main article: [XXXX]"--using more specific articles in wikipedia is a good way to include information that makes particular sections of this article too specific or unweildly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are some sections that just need a little re-writing and touch up, where additional good information has been added, probably over the course of several edits, and the result has become jerky presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get on to improving this article wherever we can.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 18:17, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_127c.html" title="Edit section: Beer and Society">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beer and Society</span></h2>
<p>I renamed the section "culture" to "beer and society". I move "health effects" to a subsection of "beer and society" rather than making it it's own section. I also moved "vessels" to "serving" as that seems like the most appropriate place for that topic.</p>
<p>I think the renaming has some good advantages. First off, it's a little more specific that "culture", which is a little vague. Also, it incorporates the issue of beer and health, since health issues related to beer are a public health concern and hence a social concern. That helps to streamline the page.</p>
<p>This section does need a lot of work. I make some suggestions below and invite others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beer and excess consumption, including alcoholism, should be but is not included here. Remember that this should be an even handed presentation, not a defense of beer as "less nasty" than other alcoholic beverages or an attempt to downplay excess consumption as a social ill. A fair discussion of temperance movements would be good in this space.</li>
<li>Economics of beer can be discussed here. How much is consumed, how large is the market. This data is difficult to collect at the international level, so data regarding representative countries would be acceptable.</li>
<li>Beer and religion. Alcohol has been a part of many religious practices. Specific information on the use of beer in religious practice would be very interesting. Also, there are many religions that forbid the use of alcohol. Do any of them treat beer differently, or especially?</li>
</ul>
<p>Oops--forgot to sign that a few days ago: <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 14:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to edit the section on strength to read as follows. Please offer suggestions and objections here. (This is a pretty significant overhaul of the strength section, so I don't want to do it without running it by people first.) I would also like to change the section title to "Alcoholic Strength", since "strength" is a bit coloquial. Other title suggestions are welcome.</p>

<dd>The content of alcohol in beer is less than that of wine or distilled spirits. Beer ranges from less than 3% alcohol by volume (ABV) to over 12% ABV. Particular styles of beer have a range of alcoholic strength that is common for them; pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4-6%. Some exceptional beers have reached over 20% ABV, however, this is not typical of any style of beer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The alcohol in beer comes from the fermentation of sugars that are produced during mashing. The quantity of sugar in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Most of the sugar is derived from the process of mashing, however, sugar is sometimes added directly to the wort. Other ingredients in beer have no effect on the quantity of alcohol in the beer.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I like this better than the previous section because it focuses on general facts rather than minutia that look like a Guiness Book of Records entry. Also, it reads like a section rather than a list a fact about ABV. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 00:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Some excellent recent revisions. And I'm personally excited that someone is taking such a strong interest in this significant article. I like the ideas for the strength section. I would say though that there was a request for details on the strength of beers, and the information on the strongest beers in the world is something that people find of interest. An amalgamation of the two versions is perhaps the best way forward. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 12:23, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The most important thing about the lead is that it summarizes the article well: see the GA review above and <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>. One of the GA review concerns was that the intro was too short and would not be a good summary of Beer for the reader that wants to get the basics of beer without reading everything in the article, so it's important that we don't leave important facts to be discovered below.</p>
<p>Into was structured so that the order of its sections corresponded to the sections of the article, but this has been undone.</p>
<p>Some recent edits seem to have reverted the article to a state that does this less well. For example, the explicit and accurate definition of beer as <i>any undistilled alcoholic beverage fermermted from sugars derived from starch</i> was deleted infavor of th less accurate <i>alcoholic beverage fermented from a starch.</i></p>
<p>A paragraph in the intro which accurately summarized beer ingredients was also trimmed in a way that make it less well summarize that subject. Keep in mind that we're looking for conscise but accurate summary in the intro.</p>
<p>Beer styles proves yet again to be a highly controversial subject, and recent edits to the intro have proven that yet again. I don't understand why they were made and the present version is seeming less clear to me that the version from which it was changed. Certinaly the current "Beer uses varying ingredients..." is personification of beer (beer does not use anything, as it has no mind and hence cannot act) and I don't see why this edit is an improvement.</p>
<p>I don't wish to start a mad reversion war, as my experience is that this tends to leave the article in an unagreeable state. Let's discuss this here please.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 00:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>" For example, the explicit and accurate definition of beer as <i>any undistilled alcoholic beverage fermermted from sugars derived from starch</i> was deleted infavor of th less accurate <i>alcoholic beverage fermented from a starch.</i>" - I made some the changes to that. The thinking behind the removal of "undistilled" was that the definition of beer was being made not by what the beer is, but by what it is not. And there are a number of things that beer is not. There is already later on a short paragraph which gives that exclusive definition "Alcoholic beverages fermented from nonstarch sources such as grape juice (wine) or honey (mead), and distilled beverages are not considered to be beer." I've never felt entirely comfortable with the inclusion of that paragraph as I feel it would be more helpful to explain in simple terms what beer is, rather than what it is not. I wonder how many people get beer confused with spirits or wine anyway? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 20:13, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I still disagree. The point of definitions is to be as accurate as possible. Sometimes it just helps to be explicit about what something is not, especially when you're distinguishing it from nearby relatives. Consider writing "A shirt is an article of clothing made from cloth that covers the torso and some or all of the arms. Shirts are distinguished from sweaters and sweatshirts, which are knitted or made from heavy cloth, and from jackets and coats, which are worn over shirts, usually as protection from the elements or as part of formal or business attire." I think that it is very helpful to define shirts by distinguishing them from coats and sweaters in this way. Similarly, beer is part of the family of alcoholic beverages, and for those unfamiliar with them, being told explcitly that it is a different member from wine or distilled beverages is relevant. Anyway, this point isn't one of special concern, so I won't worry about it now. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 17:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the term 'beer' is being used too broadly here. Beer, at least in American English, refers to fermented beverages made primarily with barley or wheat and flavored primarily with hops. If beer is made to cover any fermented beverage made from a starch source, it would cover everything from ale to lager to sake to kozu to chica to oshikundu to a number of so-called 'wine coolers'. Just because there is no simple one syllable word that covers all those beverages doesn't mean beer should be made to do so. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetrick_5eee.html" title="User:Thetrick">Thetrick</a> 21:16, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that common english usage does not make beer such a broad category. A quick glance at a few dictionaries will indicate that you are right. Indeed, when hopped ales were first introduced to england, the term used for them was 'bier' (or something like that), which eventually became 'beer'. 'Ale' was a term used for starch based alcoholic beverages of which "bier" was one sort--the sort made with hops.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But common english usage does not invovle historical discussion--that's uncommon usage. People talk about sumarian beer and ancient egyptian beer. People ask "when did hops first get used in beer? And <i>where</i> did hops first get used in beer? And how did hops make its way to the British Isles??" This article needs to be able to respect these facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, the fact is that beer, ale and cousins have been with human civilization for so long that it will be impossible to come up with a definition that respects all the varagies of history that have attended it. Instead, the best thing to do is to acknowledge in a clear way that beer as we ordinarily encounter it is hopped and made form barley malt, while conceeding, in a clear way, that this is a relatively recent feature of beer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps most importantly: this article has been written with this definiton in mind, and it would be a pretty considerable editing task to change the whole article to reflect a change in the definition of beer. It would also (probably) require the creation of new articles to replace the content lost in the editing process. I'm not sure that I'm entirely against such a move, but it represents a considerable amount of work for those who undertake to do it. Until we, the editors, are willing to undertake such a task, I think that the definition should remain as is in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I'm pretty open to the suggestion that we change the definition of beer in this article, but I don't want to do that incompletely. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 17:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest creating an article entitled 'fermented beverage' (there isn't one to match the category and it would make sense have one to parallel the distilled beverage article). The new article could have a section for 'beverages fermented from starches' which could then briefly describe beer and its allies and their history. Other sections could describe beverages fermented from fruits, things beverages from milk, and so on.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another solution would be to use phrases like 'modern beer' and 'historic beer' and 'ancient beer' in the current article, but those are vague terms as well, and clumsy to boot. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetrick_5eee.html" title="User:Thetrick">Thetrick</a> 19:07, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recently edited the lead paragraph of this section. It now reads <i>Beer is made by brewing. The essential stages of brewing are mashing, sparging, boiling, fermentation and packaging. Most of these stages can be accomplished in several different ways, but the purpose of each stage is the same regardless of the method used to achieve it.</i></p>
<p>I would like to use this lead to re-write the current section on brewing. It has gotten a bogged down in details like precise temperatures, durations, dangers of getting to hot and the like. Moreover, I feel that differences in types of mashing and so forth are inessetial to understanding beer from the ordinary perspective, and discussing mashing as having a purpose and how that purpose is accomplished allows one to avoid decending into details that won't really be beneficial in a general article about beer. These details should be included in the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewing.html" title="Brewing">brewing</a> article instead. I think each section should also be done in a paragraph rather than list format, with one paragraph for each essential portion of the mash process. Listing isn't really appropriate here, as what's given is not a list. Here's a rough version of a revision for the section on mashing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mashing is the first stage of brewing. In it, the brewer manipulates the time an temperature of a mixture of water and a starch source, known as a mash, in order to convert starches to fermentable sugars. The mash goes through one or more stages of being raised to a desired temperature and left at the temperature for a period of time. During each of these stages, <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzymes.html" title="Enzymes">enzymes</a> in the starch source produce compounds needed for fermentation and further mashing, including the fermentable sugars. The number of stages required in mashing depends on the starch source used to produce the beer. Most malted barley used today requires only a single stage.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To repeat, I want to edit this section into a paragraph like the one above for each of the major portions of the brewing process (mashing, sparging, boiling, fermenting, and packing.) Objections etc. welcome. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 14:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I let these suggestions sit on the discussion page for a few days and didn't hear anything. I've made changes along the lines proposed. The general information of this section was not changed, though finer details may have been removed, and all of it has been re-written. The goal was to write the section in a way that covered what all brewing has in common, while neglecting differences in approaches to brewing. Those differences are more appropriately discussed in <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewing.html" title="Brewing">brewing</a>. The reader who wants to know about beer is interested in an overview, and if he is interested in brewing, he should see that article. A couple of finer points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got rid of almost all the numbers, like temperatures and times. Where appropriate, I've replaced them with phrases like "about an hour" or "a week to months". Numbers represent a level of detail most appropraite to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewing.html" title="Brewing">brewing</a>. Another problem with precise numbers is that they are apt to have exceptions, whereas the alternatives are much less excepted.</li>
<li>I got rid of the section on aging beer. This is not really a matter of brewing--it's not something that a brewer in particular does. This information may be included elsewhere in the article where appropriate, however, here is not the place.</li>
<li>I got rid of the stuff on some beer cafes in Antwerp and particular aged beers that really lie far beyond the scope of an article like this. Even people who think this is really important to this article will agree that it is not a matter of brewing beer and hence should be placed elsewhere.</li>

<dd>My point is that this represents a conflict of interest. "Keeps linking" as in "is the only one linking": You are promoting yourself on wikipedia, which is totally inappropriate.

<p>This section needs some improvement. Here are problems I'm noticing:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a tendency to downplay beer styles and it sounds sometimes as if the difference between stout and pilsner is insignificant. That's not good. This article should try to emphasize that beer is a genus rather than a species of drink. We don't need to be heavy handed about the significance of styles--a controversial topic--in order to present, for example, Guinness and Miller Genuine Draft as different kinds of beer.</li>
<li>The section reads like on of those entries where lots of people have contributed good information without making sure that the information coheres and reads well. For example, it would be good if the section on ales and the section on lagers exhibited parellel structure, so that if one starts out about temperature, then talks about esters, then discusses representative ales/lagers, the other does as well. And where departure from parallel structure is warranted, good flagging will help. For example, because lager is much newer as a popular style than ale, we know more about the history of lager. Here, a good move to keep things parallel would be to make the history sections their own paragraphs.</li>
<li>The dark and light section seems to me to over emphasize color as a part of beer style. Very different beers can resemble each other in color (British bitter and altbier, for example, or pale IPAs and Pilsners), and I think that this section encourages a common misperception that dark beers are alike</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the emphasis on the difference between ale and lager, in part because that's pretty uncontroversial but also because I think "What's the difference between beer and ale?" is a really common (and really kinda misguided) question, one that I would hope this article helps answer.</p>
<p>I propose getting rid of the semi-intro on "categorizing by yeast" and simply make this a clear part of ale, lager and lambic, with perhaps one sentence in the lead to avoid redundancy in the sub-sections.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this amounts to slightly vague suggestions for revision, and I'm looking for feedback on other things in this section that need repair and objections to the above (because I don't want to start editing and find myself reverted becaue everyone thinks I'm being done!) --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 01:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not that I want to discourage anyone, but I think that if anything is done that this section should be shortened and the discussion taken up in earnest on the beer styles page. One paragraph for each of ale, lager, and lambic, and then an paragraph or two on color that reflects better the flavor and body variations that differing colors reflect. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetrick_5eee.html" title="User:Thetrick">Thetrick</a> 01:30, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Talk%7EBeer_127c.html" title="Edit section: Rename?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rename?</span></h3>
<p>Are there objections to renaming the "Beer Styles" section to "Types of Beer"? It seems like this is slightly better, since beer styles mostly implies very specific types like Stout, Porter, Hefe Weizen, Pilsner, etc. wereas "types of beer" implies not only styles, but also ale, lager, lambic--hell, american and british and belgian are types, even if they're pretty uninformative crude ones (that probably don't merit mention in this article). It's a very general term that can be used fo any beer classification. It helps to make this section more dynamic, so that the article can, in a non-ad hoc way, accomodate more information. Certainly, this section should still link to <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_style.html" title="Beer style">beer styles</a> and should include a discussion of styles fairly prominently (but without undue emphasis).</p>
<p>Awaiting thoughts of fellow editors. —<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 00:24, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the phrase <i>beer styles</i> should be kept as that is the currently accepted term for discussing what currently qualifies as beer. I understand what you are trying to get at, but ales, lagers, and lambics have as wide a range within each type/kind as they do between them. Perhaps <i>Classifying beer</i>? <i>Describing beer</i>? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetrick_5eee.html" title="User:Thetrick">Thetrick</a> 01:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Varieties of beer</i>? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThetrick_5eee.html" title="User:Thetrick">Thetrick</a> 02:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of these suggestions, I like Varieties of Beer best, Classifications of Beer I like better than describing beer, because "describing beer" makes it sound like this section is on sentence like "A medium-full bodied beer that still finishes clean and dry" or "herbal and spicy aromatics with just a hint of fruity esters". <i>That</i> is definitely not what this section is about.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But maybe I should try to make my point this way (because I'm not sure I was clear above): Ale isn't a style and Lager isn't a style; this whole section is about ale, lager and lambic, not about styles of beer, so it seems like the name should be changed. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosofool_446b.html" title="User:Philosofool">philosofool</a> 18:36, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While it is interesting seeing old brown hops for a lambic, it hardly should be the image of hops for beer in general. Picture of Fresh green hops would be more appropriate.</p>

<dd>Skunky beer is caused by visible or UV light interacting with certain flavor chemicals from the hops. This is why you should store beer in the dark!</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It is a very different reaction from <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinegar.html" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> production. Skunky beer is the decomposition of isohumulones under light, while vinegar production is the fermentation of alcohol by <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_of_vinegar.html" title="Mother of vinegar">mother of vinegar</a>, a yeast/bacteria slime. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 23:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
