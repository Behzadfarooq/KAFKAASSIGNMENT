	    <p><b>Beer Die</b>, a "gentleman's game," is a <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_game.html" title="Drinking game">drinking game</a> involving four people, a die, a table, four cups, and beer. It combines the highly competitive nature and required skill and precision of a sport with the drinking aspect of traditional drinking games. There is no consensus on where the sport originated - as numerous colleges and fraternities claim to have invented the sport. It is, however, generally believed that it originated in the state of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a>, namely at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colby_College_214b.html" title="Colby College">Colby College</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: The Table">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Table</span></h3>
<p>While there are no official regulations for the table, it has traditionally been an eight feet long by four feet wide piece of plywood, supported by legs at the corners so to be at a comfortable height for the players when sitting (approximately thirty inches). Both size and surface type affect gameplay; a harder surface will cause the die to bounce more, changing certain aspects of the game. Thus it is recommended that material with similar hardness to plywood be used for the surface. Legend has it that the original beer die table was a green ping pong (table tennis) table. An alternative legend is that the game began when the large wooden doors of Colby dorms, frat houses, library and administration buildings were removed and turned into gaming surfaces. Clearly, the invention of the plastic cup and inexpensive dice also played a role in the development. In judging the ur-Myth of beer die, the wooden door theory has several strong arguments: 1) ping-pong tables are difficult to acquire in college; 2) the Colby administration has gone through periodic episodes of remodeling to remove the large wooden doors and also banned in the past the possession of banquet tables which were used for the game and 3) dice do not bounce well off a ping pong surface.</p>

<p>The die used is a normal six-sided die.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: The Cups">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Cups</span></h3>
<p>Cups must be able to hold one twelve ounce beer and be hard enough so that a die hitting the cup will not move it much. 16oz Hard plastic "keg" cups work quite well. Glass vessels are broken easily by a hearty die-toss and are therefore not recommended.</p>
<p><a name="Basic_Rules" id="Basic_Rules"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Basic Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Basic Rules</span></h3>
<p>Four players form two teams of two players each. The teams sit across from each other at opposite ends of the table. The four cups are filled with exactly one beer each and set at "regulation" positions: each player sets his or her cup on the table one hand length horizontally and one forearm length vertically from the corner of the table closest to him or her. While some people roll the die to determine which team goes first, the majority rule is that the oldest player goes first.</p>
<p>Play consists of the teams taking turns throwing the die across the table, alternating between players. Players are not allowed to have teammates take their throws and must throw from a sitting position. Furthermore, players are not allowed to cross the vertical plane defined by the end of the table when throwing.</p>
<p>At no point during play is any player allowed to stand. As noted above, all throws must be made from a sitting position. Players on the defensive are allowed to leave their seats only in a "diving" attempt to catch the die. Players are allowed to stand during any drinking or any other "dead die" situation. However, the game is sometimes played without this rule and the person in possession of the die chooses which cup to aim for. The player cannot throw until the player catching the die signals he is ready; it is a common courtesy to tap the die a few times on the table before throwing to signal the opposition.</p>
<p>If at any point, a cup is not in the regulation position, play cannot continue. Using this rule, timeout can be called by removing your cup from position or "stepping out of the box".</p>
<p>Games are played to five (called bizz). Usually the first game is played to seven (called buzz).</p>
<p>The words "five" or "seven" may not be uttered during game play by participants. Any infraction or error results in a penalty, which tends to be one sip out of their cup. Some variations of the game require the cup be finished for each mention of the word, and one of the side-objects is one player to get another player to say the number numerous times - for example, asking for his phone number. Only "bizz" and "buzz" may be said, respectively. This rule also applies to all areas of numbers during a game. For example, one may not say the time is "two twenty-five." Instead, he must say "two twenty-bizz." However, since the word fifty does NOT contain the word five in it, you can say fifty without penalty, so "four-fifty" is still legal. However, seventy is pronounced buzzty.</p>
<p><a name="Scoring" id="Scoring"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Scoring">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scoring</span></h3>
<p>A team scores a point when one of its players makes a throw in which all of these requirements are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is underhand (or overhand depending on the version of Beer Die you play)</li>
<li>Reaches a certain height (approximately 6 feet above the table height -or- As high as it goes long, some players use a net or a Plexiglass divider in the middle of the table)</li>
<li>Bounces on the table on the line or on the other side of the center line on a fly</li>
<li>Goes off the far end of the table (not the sides)</li>
<li>Lands finally on the ground</li>
</ol>
<p>This is harder than it sounds, especially since the other team is allowed to play defense. As soon as the die has bounced or rolled off the table, they are allowed to try to catch it with one hand and one hand only. The die may be juggled between hands, and other body parts can be used in an attempt to catch it, but the die must come to a rest in one hand only. Body traps are not allowed, and result in a point for the opposing team. The die is still in play and can still be caught until it either hits the ground, or stops moving. Sometimes there is a house rule in which only female participants are allowed to trap.</p>
<p>Additionally, some places (such as Cornell) play with a rule called "Backs". The cups are placed a distance away from the end of table (typically the forearm and hand's length combined), and any die that has the first bounce AFTER the cups but still on the table is called a back. The die is dead when called back. This rule increases the skill involved in the game, first by making throwing more difficult (since a throw can't be too hard or else it won't come down until after the cups, so throwers must put more arc in the throw), and also makes the game go longer (thus making stamina an important skill).</p>
<p>Some players observe these additional scoring variations: A team scores a "puke point" when one of their opponents has to vomit. You can't win on a puke point. You can't win on a sink, either, but a sink still counts for chugging. When a sink occurs on game-point forcing the trailing team to chug, it is called a "dick move".</p>

<p>NW Territory Beer-Die has created a championship trophy (think Stanley Cup) to honor their past and future tournament champions. It is present at all officially sanctioned tournaments, and is awarded to the winning team. The champions' names are engraved into the trophy next to the date, location, and day's record. The 'Cup is also used to honor Beer-Die Hall of Famers and individual (Savage and Petry) Award winners. To date the Beer-Die Cup has been present at tournaments in 6 different States and 1 Canadian Province, over the course of 10 recognized Tournaments.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Sploohing&quot;, &quot;Plunking&quot;, &quot;Sinking&quot;, or &quot;KP&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Sploohing", "Plunking", "Sinking", or "KP"</span></h3>
<p>If a player manages to land the die in an opposing player's cup, the other team fill their cups (keeping the die in the beer) with a new beer, and then chug the entire beer. This is known as a "ker-plunk" aka "KP" (or a "sink" in Newfoundland and at Middlebury College) and counts as a point for the team that plunked. The player that manages a "plunk" would then get to add their name to the table, or add a tally mark under their name. The game then continues as it had before the "ker-plunk." The plunked team, once they chug the entire beer, must spit out the die on the table. If they miss the table, they must drink another beer. As a result, most players move right next to the table so that there is no way the die can roll off the table. If the die lands bizz-up, then the throwing team must fill up their beers and chug, as if they had just been plunked. The die is also placed in the original throwing team's cup and they too get a chance to spit out the die so it lands bizz-up. The process can, in theory, go on forever, but the probability of that is obviously incredibly low. If it lands on anything else, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Plunking brings a unique reward. The player who threw the plunk gets to write his/her name on the table and start a hash mark count of their plunks. In some places when you plunk for the first time, the player is given a "die-name" by all the veterans of the game. The player is required to use this name at this table and every other one until the player plunks 100 times. At this point they may elect for a new "die-name." Any player guilty of a self-plunk must write their name on the underside of the table along with a count of self plunks. Further, they and their partner are required to strip completely naked and run around the building in which they are playing.</p>
<p>You CAN plunk yourself, and both players must still chug an entire beer, and spit out the die. If you spit it out bizz-up, your team must chug another beer. In theory, your team could keep going chugging beers if the die kept being spit bizz-up (and if you miss the table on purpose, you must drink an entire beer).</p>
<p>At some places, the Roll-Out is the procedure following a beer. Under Roll-Out rules, the process is as such:</p>
<p>Following a plunk, the beers should be pounded. Immediately following the die should be rolled out onto the table. The rolling of Bizz-up results in an additional penalty beer.</p>

<p>In the original Beer Die, as played at Colby College, when a player plunks for their first time he or she is rewarded their die name. The name is usually a joke name, since it is invented by the other players on the table. The player who plunked then adds their die name to the table and puts a tick under it to signify the plunk. This "die name" will be their name until the end of college, or if the player does not like his or her die name they can change it to what they choose (besides their own name) after 100 plunks on the same table. A player records every following plunk with an additional tick under their name on the table. When playing on a new table, that player will record their plunks under their original given name. Therefore they will end up "tagging" many die tables across campus with their "die name" throughout college.</p>

<p>If a player throws a die that touches or bounces off either of the other team's cup, this is known as a "plink" or "body blow" and requires the team's cup's hit to take a sip. The die can "hit" both cups, this would require 2 sips. In theory, if the die managed to ricochet back and forth between the cup multiple times, it would be that many plinks. The only negative thing that can happen to the throwing team after a plink is if the die ends bizz-up. This is often referred to as a "self plink". If a player catches the die after a plink if it didn't hit the table at any point, then the plink is "right back at ya" and the throwing team drinks.</p>
<p>As with "a plunk's a plunk," the same goes for a plink. In addition to the die, any object/projectile that strikes the beer is a valid plink, resulting in the opposing team sipping his or her beer. Tradition dictates that after a team member finishes pouring his or her own beer, they are obligated to slide/throw/hurl the empty beer can at an opposing team member's cup. Contrary to popular opinion, knocking over your own beer either defending against a can plink, or knocking it over in the process of hurling your own can, is completely admirable and definitely a cool thing to do.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Drinking">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drinking</span></h3>
<p>Teams drink together. Both teammates are expected to finish their cups at the same points during the game. One "drink" is one fifth of a beer or one fourth depending on how many drinks you give yourself to finish your cup. As soon as a teams cups are empty, they get filled again.</p>
<p>Besides the "plink" and "plunk" drinking requirements, players may be forced to drink for several illegal moves, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throwing a die that does not hit anywhere on the table (called "a heinous")</li>
<li>Throwing out of turn</li>
<li>Trying to pass off a trapped die as a catch (commonly known as "bird style")</li>
<li>Dropping the die on the ground when it is in your possession (between throws) ("Sloppy Die")</li>
<li>When the die lands on the table, not landing bizz up, whoever the bizz side of the die points at must drink, regardless of whether or not they are participating in the game ("Bizz Points Rule")</li>
<li>Whenever anything new and/or exciting happens, everyone at the table must drink ("Maxime Rule")</li>
</ul>

<p>If a throw lands on the table legally, but instead of going off the table vertically (where the other team must try to catch it), goes off the table horizontally, this is called an "Out of Bounds", or OB for short. After 3 OBs from one team, that team must drink. The other team can still try to catch the die and if they do so, there is no OB penalty. Most players try to catch the die since it is a gentleman's game, and by doing so, the other team will try to return the favor when you throw an OB. However, some players do not attempt to catch it in an attempt to make the other team drink.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: PDT (Perfect Die Toss)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">PDT (Perfect Die Toss)</span></h3>
<p>PDT, or Perfect Die Toss, refers to when a player tosses the die and it hits the very end of the table (opponent's side), presumably making the bounce impossible to catch. PDT's, while not officially recordable like plunks, raise a player's status and garner respect from fellow players.</p>
<p>Obviously, when backs are in play, there is no such thing as a Perfect Die Toss, since the die must bounce before the cups, which are not on the end of the table, but rather a forearm and hand's length from the end of the table.</p>
<p>This has also been referred to in some circles as "venom", "kill shot", or "Jesus Drop." It has also been called a "Lugo," in reference to Greg Louganis. There have been cases when players in a drunken, excitable state have accidentally yelled "Guno" when attempting to say "Lugo." There is no penalty for this expression, but such players will be mocked for the rest of the game and generally the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>As with many other aspects of the game, the terminology used for this situation is different at Middlebury, where a PDT is referred to instead as a "nick."</p>
<p>Aficionados at Idaho State University use the term "Miagi"(with emphasis) to describe this perfect throw. It is, perhaps, the most esoteric term, a reference to the "crane technique" from Karate Kid; "when done correctly, no can defend."</p>

<p>An FBP refers to the phenomenon where a player plunks on a freshly poured beer. There seems to be a connection with a freshly poured beer and the die. This plunk is often characterized by a large splash of beer that demorilizes the team that now has to drink another beer. The characteristic "mushroom cloud" shape and resultant frag pattern of beer have led to the FBP being labelled "Daisy Cutter". Few accomplishments in life can compare to "Daisy Cutting" an opponent.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Low">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Low</span></h3>
<p>If the throw is too low, the other team immediately calls Low, and the die, like in Back, is dead. Nothing else can happen with the die once it is called Low, negative or positive for the throwing team. Occasionally, players will call out various words and phrases instead of just simply "low." These include, but are not limited to, "Kurt Loder," "Loder," "MTV News," or the declaration that a certain throw was "ten to the hour."</p>
<p>Another variation is that if a throw is called low, the throw is still live. However, only the throwing team can be penalized for any other infraction that may occur.</p>
<p>This is often referred to as a Whip or simply "height" because it did not reach sufficient height. This is because it is not as high as it is long.</p>
<p>The die must be tossed as high as an average sized man standing with his arm raised at a 45 degree angle.</p>
<p>Some variations say that the die must be tossed over the height of 2 beer cans at the middle of the table.</p>
<p>Other variations demand that the die go as high as the throw goes long, thus a die landing near the middle of the table and bouncing towards the opponent doesn't have to travel as high as a throw landing near the end of the table.</p>

<p>Bizz = 5</p>
<p>If the die is thrown and eventually comes to rest on the table with the "bizz" facing up, the team who last had contact with the die must take a sip (or, in other games, must drink until the non-drinking team touches the die, or in some variations, must finish their beers). This rule can lead to the only time both teams drink at the same time - the throwing team plinks, and the die land up bizz-up.</p>

<p>The most egregious blunder is the self plunk. Plunking your own or your partner's cup, while difficult, is not impossible. On a self plunk both you and your partner must fill and finish your beers, and also, must spit out the die on the table as if it was a normal plunk. If you spit out a bizz (or spit the die off the table to avoid the risk of a bizz), you repeat the process as if the other team had spit out a bizz on your plunk. This could, in theory, go forever, but the odds are obviously extremely low. Often the player who throws the self-plunk must sign the bottom of the table; also known as the "Asshole List". This is a direct result of the humiliating toss that led to a self-plunk.</p>
<p>Another common rule on the self plunk is that you must play the rest of the game naked.</p>

<p>Often, someone not participating in the actual competition will be chosen to act as the referee, or "God". "God" has final say on all questionable throws and catches, but he must remain silent until he is asked his opinion. If a player makes a throw that is too low, it is the burden of the other team to appeal to God and ask if it was an illegal throw. "God" is also in charge of keeping score, and knowing how many drinks remain in each player's cup. In some places, "God" is simply known as "The Arbitrator." At Middlebury, no "God" is used in games, as the players agree to self-referee the games based on the idea that beer die is a gentleman's game.</p>

<p>If a thrown die fails to cross the "Salsa Line" (in reference to the inaugural game of beer die in which a can of salsa was used to denote center table) and lands on the thrower's side of the table (whether through an exceptionally weak throw, or by bouncing off the ceiling or opponent's cup) that team's players must play with their pants around their ankles until they complete a regulation toss. It is suggested that before play, everyone guarantees that they are indeed wearing boxer shorts. A common variant to this rule states that a die that lands on the thrower's side of the table is either a "heinous" (if it did NOT at any time cross the center line and hit the other team's table) or nothing (if it did cross). If the die lands bizz-up, the throwing team still drinks. If the die did not land and also did not cross, this results in a double drink.</p>
<p>Another variant to the rule states that if you "self plunk" you are require to run around the perimeter a dorm (no matter the weather) completely naked. Or, depending on house rules, you must simply play naked, or remove an article of clothing. Another variation to this rule is that if one player "self plunks" they must drink all four cups at the table. Also, if one player "plunks" in their partners cup, they must drink their cup of beer and also their partners.</p>

<p>Cheating, such as lying about the score or purposefully making a false call on a throw, is considered very poor sportsmanship and incredibly frowned upon. The game is considered a gentleman's game; treat it as such with proper respect.</p>
<p>Bird Style - a variation on the catch that walks the fine line between fair play and cheating, usually dependent on the affability (or in some cases, attractiveness of a female competitor) of its perpetrator. In lieu of executing a clean, one-handed catch, the die is trapped (with one hand) against a bosom, abdominal roll, or other lipid deposit. Bird Stlye (aka B.S.) catches were a prominent feature of the New Haven scene during the years 1997-2000. It is unclear whether the nomenclature refers to its inventor's tendency to "swoop" or the chicken wing-like appearance of a player's arm after executing a B.S. catch.</p>

<p>While under normal circumstances a game will continue without interruption, any player may call, during his/her team's turn at throwing the die, a Natural.

<p>A legendary NW Territory Beer-Die Hall of Famer, who is renowned for his unreal competitive spirit and skill at the table - once argued a perceived bad call by God to a level previously unseen at the table. The now fabled "Petry Tirade" resulted in this legendary partipant blowing his top, kicking dirt everywhere, delivering a few choice words to God, and eventually throwing the championship trophy, the Beer-Die Cup, into the Hyolite Reservoir along with a chair, during a tournament out in western Montana. The Tirade was well documented, and the acting God decided to defuse the situation by handing out a stiff number of penalty drinks, but did not disqualify the tirade team from the table (which would have been well within his rights as God).</p>
<p>The Tirade is less of a tactic, and more of a lack of emotional control, but some have argued that the Tirade may have been staged, and a clever and dirty tactic to buy one team "time" to regroup. It also can be argued that God was less willing to call a close call against that team. Regardless, the end result of the day saw the Tirading team take home the championship.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: The MiG Offensive">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The MiG Offensive</span></h3>
<p>The MiG Offensive is a psychological strategy designed to bewilder and infuriate one's opponents. This multi-pronged mental assault is most often performed in a Godless environment, because many of the tactics associated with the MiG Offensive could be construed as cheating. Chief among these is the maneuver of inventing rules during match play to better accommodate one's situation. For example, one might insist that the rules require players to fill their cups to the rim, rather than to the agreed upon line. A player using this technique often justifies his new rule by referencing a nobler, bygone age of beer die, where "men were men," and the game was played in front of thousands of screaming fanatics at sold-out arenas. This player will often argue the point vehemently, in the hope that his opponent will forget the illegality of the rule change itself.</p>
<p>The second component of the MiG Offensive is perhaps the most distressing to opponents. The technique begins with a maddening string of insincere, over-the-top complements directed at one's opponents. The player will often use phrases such as "Ohmygod! You're too good! I can't even play against you! You're too good!". The seemingly cordial player will often run his fingers through his hair repeatedly as if to emphasize his incredulity. This is usually accompanied by a wild-eyed drunken expression. The string of complements is then suddenly replaced by a tactless insult such as "Your mother should've swallowed you," during a critical point in the match. The offender then apologizes, and proceeds to repeat the entire process from the beginning.</p>
<p>Other indicators that the MiG Offensive is in play include, but are not limited to: Insisting that every one of his opponent's throws are too low (often screaming WHIP!, sometimes before the die is even in flight), and accusing his opponents of trying to stage an intervention.</p>
<p>The coup de gras is performed the day after the event, when the player insists that he in fact won the previous night's match. He is usually unwavering in this belief and cannot be moved by persuasion or hard evidence of a contrary outcome.</p>
<p>The MiG Offensive can only be performed under extreme alcoholic duress. It's appearance usually signals the end of the night's beer die festivities. The MiG Offensive is not a recommended strategy for those who truly have respect for their friends and for the sport of beer die.</p>

<p>More an organization of responsibility than a tactic of the mind, this style stresses placing the better catcher on the left side so he can use his right hand to catch the die when it comes between the two teammates.

<p>When playing with a Freshman, tell them to take the die, walk across to the otherside of the table and drop it in an opponent's cup.

<p>Like the Collins Defense, this style of play focuses on the position of the players. This style emphasizes having the better thrower on the right side (again, assuming he is right handed), so he can throw from outside the table instead of from the center.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: The Huff Gambit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Huff Gambit</span></h3>
<p>The Huff Gambit involves intentionally throwing the die short and with various spin angles and speeds in an effort to utilize the die's unpredictable bounce to confuse and surprise the enemy. This gambit can be likened to a fluttering knuckleball in baseball...it travels much slower than the other pitches but it can be extremely hard to hit (or catch in the case of Beer Die).</p>
<p>The Huff Gambit is a difficult throw to pull off correctly and will not work as well on softer tables. As the knuckleball is more effective on a windy day, the Huff Gambit is more effective on a harder playing table, such as a hardwood, laminate, or mica surface. Seasoned veterans, however, would be remiss not to have it in their offensive repertoire. The throw can be used in a multitude of situations, but it is most effective in the later stages of the game when player's faculties are not 100%.</p>
<p>The high, short flight of the die can surprise unexpecting opposing players, who initially think the thrower made a mistake. They soon realize, however, that they must now catch the die as it is bouncing unpredictably towards them. In rare instances, a well thrown Huff Gambit will score a plunk; but it most frequently scores a plink or a drink when the opposition cannot catch it. The gambit can also be effective when thrown down the middle as the opposition has more time to think about it and catching assignments have a greater likelihood of being blown. One final benefit of the Huff Gambit is that it changes the pace of throws between players, making it harder for the enemy to get into a rhythm.</p>

<p>Poaching involves a partner intentionally and sometimes vigorously catching a die directed at his/her partner. This is most often done to prevent inexperienced or poor partners from costing the team points throughout the match. "Poaching" can lead to partner confusion and collision in an effort to retrieve the die, however when properly performed, the Poach can be a clutch move.</p>
<p>Other places call this "Die Hogging" or "Hanking," and one who does this is labeled a "Die Hog" or the "Hank."</p>
<p>If it is a competitive match (such as tournament play or an intense rivalry) Poaching is acceptable, however, in a friendly game, it is heavily frowned upon (though not illegal).</p>

<p>If a player cannont continue playing during a match (alcholol related), then the team is disqualified from the tournmanet unless the remaining one player drinks for both people. The player that did not finish his beer must leave the table and cannot return for the duration of the game. If a player continues to play alone he must drink double (normal team drinks) for the remainder of the game with no additional time limits and forfeiture of the throwing turn for the missing teammate. If the solo player is victorious his teammate may return for the start of the next game. Non-Alcohol Related - If your partner leaves for any non-alcohol related reason the same rules apply except that the player may rejoin the game, however, stalling penalties will be strictly enforced during tournament play. The application of “Casualty of War” should be used only in extreme situations and is strongly discouraged as 2 vs. 1 takes away from the feng-shui that is Beer Die. If however it comes to this, the person leaving the table will forfeit their toss, but the toss rotation will continue without change (ex: Player A1 tosses, Player B1 tosses, Player A2 tosses, [player B2 forfeits his toss], player A1 tosses, etc).</p>

<p>In the event of an odd number of tournament participants, one player from an existing team will be randomly selected to partner with the last odd number person. This player drawn becomes the "Dual Citizen" and will participate on two teams. If either of his teams win and stay on the table, his other team could in fact have their place at getting back on the table delayed to if/when the first team loses. Dual Citizen is a tough task, but is an honor and a chance to make an odd number of participants still work.</p>

<p>If a fourth player cannot be found, you may play with three players, two on one side, one on the other. Same rules apply, the lone player being responsible for his/her entire side of the table. Two beers should be used, just as if the 4th player was present.</p>

<p>In the unfortunate event that a 4th player cannot be located, a game of Cutthroat Beer Die may be played. The side with 1 player moves back and forth between the seats on his side, moving after he has both thrown and played defense with the person diagonal from him. After each match point, the three players rotate so that everyone takes turns being on a team alone. The side of the table with 2 players each get 1/2 of a match point for winning, where as the side with 1 player gets the entire match point for winning. This version was developed at Kansas State University at the Chase Manhattan Apartment Complex.</p>

<p>A variation of the above Cutthroat gameplay, it is a three man beer die match, in which there are two players vs. one. The one man team has only one seat on his side of the table and can position it anywhere of his choosing. The game then comences as a normal game, and once the game is completed all player rotate right one seat around the table, moving a new player into the singles seat.</p>

<p>If two roommates are playing together with no one else waiting for the table, then they follow the roommate rules. Every few tosses of the die, instead of throwing it underhand they throw it overhand directly at the opponent's cup. Winner is the person who passes out last.</p>

<p>To make the game more interesting for experienced BeerDie players, the choosing of partners could be random. Prior to a tournamnet, pairs of 40 oz beers are purchased equal to the amount of players in the tournament (the cheaper the beer the better). Caps from the 40's are chosen by the players out of a hat, which will decide your partner. The 40 must be finished before any player is allowed to play their first game. A. Villar (MA) master beer die player has said that the 40 Oz. has made a major impact in the competitiveness of the tournament.</p>

<p>Should a game reach a score of 6-6, any player may enact stoner rules whereupon play continues until one team gains a 2 point advantage over its competition, similar to add-in and add-out in a tennis match. It is theoretically possible for a game to never end in this fashion.</p>

<p>A full pitcher of warm beer is placed directly in the center of the table. If any player lands a toss in the pitcher, this player and their partner must drink the entire pitcher, or forfeit the game / tournament.</p>
<p>This is also called the "Death Cup." If a player says "death cup" in any other voice besides a low demonic growl, then they must take a sip of their beer. The same rules still apply if the die lands in the pitcher.</p>

<p>Follows all rules of normal beer die, but substitutes Mad Dog 20/20 in various flavors for normal beer. It should be noted that while traditional beer die can be played with any variety of beer, though tradition dictates this beer should be a low quality, domestic macrobrew (see Schaefer, Ice House, Coors Light, the Champagne of beers, Natty Light). Note: Playing with any of the following is a Bad Idea (or an Awesome Idea): Natty Ice, Wild Irish Rose, any sort of alcoholic punch, Bailey's Irish Cream.</p>

<p>A favorite game among fellow Zetes, this version of beer die is a variation played at the Alpha Pi chapter. The rules are closer to beer pong.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: The Setup">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Setup</span></h4>
<p>- Players do not sit at a table; they stand while the game is played.</p>
<p>- Each side starts the game with two full cups and two refills and the looser is decided when one team has empty cups and no refills.</p>
<p><a name="Throwing" id="Throwing"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Throwing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Throwing</span></h4>
<p>- Scoring is simple: if you hit, or "plink", half a beer is drunk from that cup. If you sink on a cup, or plunk, the remainder of the cup must be drunk.</p>
<p>- The throwing player must call their cup before throwing and their elbow cannot extend over the edge of the table.</p>
<p>- The die must be thrown in an under handed fashion and must clear a height of two and a half beer cans at the middle of the table. If the die does not reach that height and is not intentional the throwing side is given a "low warning". Throwing the die low again is penalized with a forfeited throw .</p>
<p>- Throws must hit the table on the table/cup before hitting the ground. If the die does not hit the table or a cup it is deemed a "overthrow," the throwing player is penalized with drinking a half cup (but the game cannot be won on an overthrow).</p>
<p>- If the die hits the table and then bounces off the table to the left or the right while not passing beyond the cup is ruled off the side and does not count as a drop</p>
<p>- Any all drinking must be done before the team can throw</p>
<p>- Drinks can be passed between team members, it is a "team" game</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Catching">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Catching</span></h4>
<p>- As with the other versions of beer die one member of the opposing side must catch the die (with one hand only) before it hits the ground.</p>
<p>- If in the event the die is trapped in the clothing of one member of the catching team, it must remain trapped for 5 seconds at which point it is declared caught. In other variations of beer die, trapping of any sort is not allowed.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Other Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other Rules</span></h4>
<p>- The number 5 has no consequences in this version due to a local secret of chapter.</p>
<p>- Respect can be earned by making trick shots or trick catches. This includes behind the back shots and kicking the die in the air and catching it. While these tricks do not equate to drinking more or less, they are in themselves worthy of celebration and praise.</p>
<p>- If a sink is made on a full cup, the opposing team must drink the beer and then roll the die. The person that threw the die then calls out a number between 1 and 6. If the die lands on that number the person who was "sunk on" must drink an additional full beer before the game is finished.</p>
<p>- If the die hits one cup and then hits the other cup the opposing side must drink a half beer from both cups. Or, in some of the more intense areas of the sport, the team whose cups were hit must dunk their nuts in their beer and drink the whole thing.</p>
<p>- In the rarest of all events that a die hits one cup and then lands in the other, the player that threw the die shall be known forever as being amazingly skilled and/or lucky.</p>
<p>- If in the case the die strikes a foreign horizontal surface after bouncing from the table a point is awarded to the throwing team. If a die strikes a vertical wall after bounching on the table it is still recognized as catchable. Players must be aware of their surroundings in playing areas with limited space as this is where injuries often occur.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Drinks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drinks</span></h4>
<p>- In the event that only two people are available to play, they may play with "quarter" rules. The only changed aspect of the game is that all previous rules to drink a half a beer are changed to quarter of a beer, and drinking a full beer is changed to half.</p>
<p>- The game can be played with other drinks if necessary. This includes but is not limited to Mad Dog, 40's, Mixed drinks, and straight liquor.</p>
<p>- *Warning* Liquor Die is not for the faint of heart or faint of liver. In 95% of cases it leads to blackouts (citation needed). Player discretion is advised.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Die_adb6.html" title="Edit section: Special Plunks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Special Plunks</span></h4>
<p>There are a number of potential "special" calls that a player may make when the die is in the air but before it has actually landed in the cup. These range from particular shouted sayings to specific body actions needed to complete the "special" nature of the plunk. Following is a list of the potential special plunks, though these can vary based on house rules.</p>
<p>The Ricky Henderson - This is a plunk that happens on the very first die toss during a game.</p>
<p>The Tiger Woods - After the die is tossed in the air, the player tossing the die leaves their chair and points as the die lands in the cup.</p>
<p>The Chinese - The die must first hit the ceiling and then land in the cup.</p>
<p>The Bitch - The die must first hit the table and then bounce in to the cup. This can also be seen in multiples (the Double or Triple Bitch) as well as in combination (the Chinese Bitch). Adhering to political correctness, this type of plunk is also referred to as a "Ground Rule Plunk."</p>
<p>The Rim Job- The die catches the rim of the cup then goes in. This plunk is usually characterized by having little or no spash.</p>
<p>The Peter Parker - The die bounces on the table and then climbs up the side of the cup and rolls in.</p>
<p>The Lil' John - While the die is in air, the tosser must shout "Yeah", "What" or "Okay" in the voice of Lil' John.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter - While the die is in air, the tosser must shout "Ryuken" or "Tut tut tut tieuyken" as in the game Street Fighter. This can be augmented with the appropriate hand actions.</p>
<p>The Zoolander - "It's a walk off!" This happens to score the buzz point and end the game.</p>
<p>The Yahtzee - After the beer has been chugged, the die must be tossed out of the now empty cup in an attempt to plunk the original tossers. If this happens, the points switch sides.</p>
<p>The Prepas - Any sink or "plunk" thrown by a player wearing sweat pants stained by spaghetti sauce and/or grease from McDonald's hash browns.</p>
