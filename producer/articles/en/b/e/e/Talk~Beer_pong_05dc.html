<p>Awsome to see that the article is a recognized <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">good article</a> after investing so much time into it over the years. In order to further advance the quality of the article, there are some tasks that we will need to undertake. Here is my current list, in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Referencing against various well-established rules sites such as those in general references.</li>
<li>Develop content on the effects on high schools/colleges/etc. I found a well-written article on High School beirut which I am probably going to use as a base for a discussion on high school play. <a href="http://silverchips.mbhs.edu/inside.php?sid=5860" class="external autonumber" title="http://silverchips.mbhs.edu/inside.php?sid=5860" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>References in TV/Movies/Media</li>
<li>A few more images. We obviously do not need to turn this into a <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> page of beirut games. But submissions of appropriate, properly referenced images are welcome. Reccomend 1st-party pictures so as to prevent dispute as to the origin of the picture and also to minimize any personal liability issues due to any persons depicted. Also these should be of the highest quality as possible, (much higher than my <a href="../../../r/a/z/RAZR_6602.html" title="RAZR">RAZR</a> V3c's 1.3 megapixel with no flash can provide indoors). Especially useful would be mages of:
<ul>
<li>Game in progress showing cups, formations, shot types etc.</li>
<li>Pics from professional matches i.e. World Series of Beer Pong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We may want to find a way to leverage some of the more advanced organizational abilities of wikipedia, like special tables etc. May or may not be appropo to this article.</li>
<li>Thorough proofreading for typos, etc.</li>

<p>Me and my friend (who has written a 30 page manual on beerpong) are going to be completely re-organizing the article. And definately add in some diagrams.</p>
<p>However, I firmly believe that Paddle beer pong should have its own article. Like what I tried to do with dartmouth pong, paddle pong should just have a brief introduction to the rules and then go its own main article. All we need to do is come up with a name, and i can go ahead with this small move (which will happen before the complete cleanup and improvement). I will be sandboxing this in <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarsinio_beerpong_8452.html" title="User:Larsinio/beerpong">User:Larsinio/beerpong</a> . if anyone is eager to help with this big improvement (a push to FA really), talk to me and we'll get serious --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarsinio_de8b.html" title="User:Larsinio">Larsinio</a> 17:42, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its unfortunate no one replied about my upcoming major cleanup. Heres the plan. I plan on making one of those nice templates for the series of drinking games with links to the different variations. Its gonnab e nice. But this article is going to be expanded ot hte point where its gonan be necessary for Paddle Pong or Beer pong (paddles) is its own article.

<p>Article expansion details: Detailed rules and variations, Diagrams of table with preferred dimensions and so on.

<p>All these plans sound good. I think diagrams will be especially useful, to make it easily digestable to someone who doesn't actually know about the game, since the page right now is kind of a "fansite" <a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERethcir_c834.html" title="User:Rethcir">Rethcir</a> 22:48, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does Dartmouth Pong get its own section? Are we going to make separate sections for every school that has its own variant of pong?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I believe Beer Pong is a different game from Beirut, so that Beirut might merit its own page, but I'm not sure. (I've never played either game, but I've had the distinction between Pong and Beirut explained to me.) Am I correct in saying that Beirut is a different game and merits its own page? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 13:14, 27 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>A broad generalization might be to say that balls are hand thrown in beirut, whereas beer pong uses a paddle. I'm not entirely sure that this should be merged with Dartmouth Beer Pong, since it seems to be a distinctive form of the game (IE paddles versus thrown ball) with different rules. I live in NH, and go to school in mass, and the game we call beirut uses thrown balls and is much more popular. Granted, thrown-ball Beirut may have evolved from paddle-ball beer pong, but I can't verify this. Anyone done any masters research on these games? (if you have, you're pretty much my hero!) <a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERethcir_c834.html" title="User:Rethcir">Rethcir</a> 00:16, Sep 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>A team is usually given a certain number of times that they can call a rerack and it is up to them to use it to best fit their strategy. The number of reracks is ranging anywhere from a 1 (used mainly for 6 cup) to 3 (used mainly for 10 cup). Although any number of reracks can be established to better suit the mood of the party of the level of competition, usually more reracks make the game move faster and easier for the unskilled unexperienced players.</p>

<p>I definitely agree that Beirut is played with your hands as a simple shot game, and Beer Pong is played with paddles (variations of the more specific rules vary with house and region). At least at Princeton, Univ. of Washington, MIT, and Boston College (all places I have played Beirut and Beer Pong excessively) this distinction between the names of the games was made. My friends at Dartmouth did not make this distinction, however, but they are the only ones I know who do not distinguish between the games.</p>
<p>It appears that Berkeley pong is identical to Dartmouth pong. Perhaps it would make more sense to describe "lob pong" as the generally accepted form of Dartmouth-style pong, and list the schools where paddle pong is popular. I think more pictures would make this more clear. Maybe I'll edit this page for clarity in the future.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree that "beer pong" means a paddle is used. I've played at George Washington, Cornell, Maryland, with Virginia Tech players, and at bars in Washington, DC, and we always have called it "beer pong," and never used a paddle. It must vary from college to college or city to city, which means we need to change some things. There's a lot of disagreement on this page about this, we should attempt to make the article more accurate. The idea about listing paddle pong schools is a good one. <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">Awiseman</a> 21:24, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's always been called beer pong and it always involves throwing the ball. I didn't even hear of beruit until my NH roommate mentioned the name. We still call it beer pong though. And what's with the picture of the homos? 72.224.120.101</p>

<p>for as long as i have been in college my older siblings and parents and their siblings all knew that beer PONG relates with the paddles like in ping PONG and that beruit is known as the game of throwing the ball into eachothers cup. so for the middle school graduate that "<i>didn't even hear</i>" of beruit being the throwing game, i <i>have never heard</i> of someone calling the best game ever beer pong. even in beerfest the extras talks about how the games are completely different and beruit should never be called beer pong because beruit has no paddles. i think people entering a beruit game should be slapped and told to leave if they call the game beer pong. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.101.131.239 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.101.131.239.html" title="User talk:129.101.131.239">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.101.131.239_1c91.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.101.131.239">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Names of the game</b></p>
<hr />
<p>Regardless of what some random Ivy leaugers did back in the day, if you go to any major college and say <i>"beer pong"</i> it means the same thing as "Beirut". The term "Beirut" came about because beer pong gained popularity in the 1980s when the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanese_Civil_War_d0a5.html" title="Lebanese Civil War">Lebanese Civil War</a> was raging. The city of Beirut was an urban war zone where Christian, Muslim, Syrian and at one point, Israeli soldiers were fighting. It was common during the city fighting for <i>mortars</i> to be used as well as soldiers firing machine guns from tall building windows. The concept of lobbing a ball into a cup is the macabe symbolism of firing down from a building at someone else.</p>
<p>The page for beer pong is done well but the photos absolutely suck. The photos focus on someone's gay lover and not on the game itself. I urge someone to get some photos uploaded that focus more on the table and game lay out. And maybe get some photos with GIRLS.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As much as your folk etymology of the name "Beirut" sounds reasonable, to make that claim would require some sources. Especially since there is a quasi-argument between the people who think the game is called "beer pong" and claim otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<p>- Agreed wholeheartedly.. i'm hoping to put together some table diagrams at some point and put them on there. And yeah, we need some girls on the page to er, accentuate the pan-genered nature of the game.</p>

<p>I went to school in the DC area, and we always called it beer pong and never used a paddle. I visited Cornell, Maryland, and Va. Tech, and they all called it beer pong too. I think the "Beer Pong is with paddles, Beirut is not" is not accurate.</p>
<p>Also I don't think that Matthew Atwan's "Notable Event" belongs here, unless people post similar records at their schools - I'm sure schools have all kinds of records like this. Maybe there should be a separate list for records at various schools.</p>

<p>I have been to schools ranging from university of maryland, frostburg, towson, over to xavier in cincinatti, and all the way down to Ole miss and the game is called beer pong. The game involves Beer and pong balls.. makes sense. Bei Ruit is a slum in Lebanon and should have no association.</p>

<p>The NYTimes recently ran an article about Beer Pong and Beirut, interesting to add to links if someone wants to: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html?hp&amp;ex=1129435200&amp;en=562392f92a6a286c&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage" class="external free" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html?hp&amp;ex=1129435200&amp;en=562392f92a6a286c&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/national/16games.html?hp&amp;ex=1129435200&amp;en=562392f92a6a286c&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage</a> Also, they stated "sometimes called Beirut for some reason", and a friend of mine posted something people from Beirut said after being taught the game: "I met some people from Beirut, and explained the game to them...not even knowing about it or the rules..they right away know why its called Beirut. They automatically knew it represented the "bombings" from East Beirut to West Beirut and vise-versa when they were at war in the 70's." Interesting history!</p>

<p>Dartmouth pong needs to be removed, as well as any other association to any group.

  I'm sorry, but it seems to me that someone from dartmouth is co-opting this particular article. Dartmouth is no more special than any other school. I think it should be removed from the main page, otherwise, we should add every other variant from various schools.

Every edit box says at the bottom that content must be verifiable, and links to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability policy</a> page.

<dd>I thought I included all the necessary information about copyright. Anyway the image is very crisp and clean and works well for a lead image, however I picture of a true beer pong game with standard rules might be better, the 600 cups is a rare variation and more common game pictures should be at the top.

Two teams of two players each assemble two racks of six cups on each side of the table. One beer is poured into each rack of six. The game begins with one player on each team in possession of a ball. The first shot of the game is taken simultaneously by both teams while looking into the eyes of their opponent. From this point on, every loose ball is fair game, provided is has touched a hard surface after leaving the hand of the shooter. Any action necessary to obtain the ball is warranted unless one is in clear possession of the ball. There are no roll-backs to ensure the steady flow of the game. Once a total of 6 or less cups remain on a side, they must be consolidated into a single pyramid but only if asked to do so by the shooting team. Failure to ask for a rerack will put the shooter at risk of having his ball swatted by the receiving team. The game is complete when all of the cups on one side have been made unless the team to make the last shot has only one cup remaining. This allows for one last <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption.html" title="Redemption">redemption</a></i> shot to be taken by one member of the losing team. If this shot is made, <i><a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudden_death.html" title="Sudden death">sudden death</a></i> overtime immediately ensues and the first team to make the next shot wins allowing a missed <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption.html" title="Redemption">redemption</a></i> shot from the other team. If at any point of the game two balls are made in the same cup, play of the game is paused while the receiving team <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotguns.html" title="Shotguns">shotguns</a></i> one beer each. This is called a <i><a href="../../../b/e/i/Beirut.html" title="Beirut">Beirut</a></i>. Full contact beirut is not for the weak as games can become fairly intense and sometimes escalate to extreme violence. <i><a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">Hospital</a></i> visits are common and have led some to wear athletic gear including padding and <i><a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmets.html" title="Helmets">helmets</a></i>.</li>

<p>I'm not arrogant enough to assume that Dartmouth is more notable than every other college in america, but I think this comes under the worldwide view criticism raised above. The game that this article is describing is called "Beruit" by the majority of its players. Pong with paddles (at dartmouth and elsewhere) is referred to as pong. Obviously more people play beruit than pong but do more people refer to beruit without paddles as pong than with paddles? Beer pong honestly refers to basically any game involving paddles and beer.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yea, New England calls it beirut. the name is much better, as it immediately differentiates between <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Pong_%28paddles%29_4e16.html" title="Beer Pong (paddles)">Beer Pong (paddles)</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_Pong_4d09.html" title="Beer Pong">Beirut</a>. alas, this so called "logic" is confined mainly to new england (and also, i suppose, the north east). I know very few people outside of these 6 or 7 states that call it beirut. another example of new england simply being better, i suppose. 82.82.169.103 09:55, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Problem: YOU'VE seen it called Beirut, but the fact is that MANY people play "beer pong" without paddles. Sure, it would be nice to have different names so that it is immediately clear whether one is referring to the game with paddles or without, but what is best is NOT what should dictate. Instead, society dictates. By this, I mean that yes, "beer pong" was _probably_ first played with paddles (and only paddles), BUT IN TODAY'S WORLD, people do in fact play "beer pong" without paddles. I would also suggest (although I do not have any source, I'm guessing you do not either, but I am confident that I am in a position that exposes me to more of the players of the world than any position you are in) that it is not safe to say that a "majority" of players call the game Beirut.</p>
<p>Out of fairness, I must admit that I learned the game "beer pong" at undergrad without paddles, and I also saw the game of "beer pong" (again, without paddles) in grad school - both schools were in separate parts of the country. As I already alluded to, however, I have seen substantial evidence that a large number of people do play "Beer Pong" without paddles. At the same time, I firmly believe that it is not proper to disrespect history and try to say that "beer pong" does not mean you cannot play with paddles. Any person that suggest beer pong means strictly WITH or WITHOUT paddles is simply immature and must be more openminded. My observations (NOTE: this is NOT based on my personal upbringing or how I personally play the game) have shown that people play "beer pong" both with and without paddles . . . period. It is also obvious that "Beirut" is strictly known as the version of the game played without paddles. Accordingly, the only fair way to define these terms (and again, not based on my personal feelings but based on what SOCIETY is doing) is to say that "beer pong" is a more broad term that refers to the game both WITH and WITHOUT paddles, and "Beirut" refers to the game as played without paddles.</p>
<p>Bottom line: people need to stop trying to define the terms based on how they personally learned the game because (1) they may have learned the game in a geographic region that does not adequately represent society in general, and/or (2) the definition of "beer pong" may have shifted since the time the person learned the game. Get over YOUR definition, and define the term based on how SOCIETY is using it. That is all . . .</p>

<dd>Hey, buddy, chill - we're on the same side. Due to the general public's utter lack of logical thinking skills, the game in question has begun to be referred to as "beer pong," despite this making no sense; this leaves only the more cognizant sections of the country (i.e. New England) to refer to it by it's proper name. As you see, this point is <i><b>al</b></i>luded to in my origninal response (well, hell, it's more than an allusion - I straight out said it), but the finer points of "comprehension" might have <i><b>el</b></i>uded you. Bottom line: though it is unfortunate, common usage means that the bastardized name of "Beer Pong" must be used to refer to a game which should rightfully only be called "Beirut." 82.82.175.70 12:20, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'll second that. One thing that pisses me off is people that claim to be some type of official authority on beer pong. There are no official rules, there is no official table, and there is no official league/association. There's maybe a site or so that could claim to have some type of official stand on beer pong, but it/they seem to take the position that there is no official anything.</p>

For Version 0.7, we are focusing on making sure that we get articles selected mainly on the basis of their <i>importance</i>. We hope (using a bot for help) to get 5-10,000 articles in this release, which means we may be able to include 30 articles related to US sports. We want these to be some of the most important topics in the field. In order to include this article, we would have to rank it as more important than topics like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> (neither of which are yet included). I consider it to be less important than topics such as these. However, we are planning on expanding the scope of our releases, and so we can probably include this article in a later release (it will automatically be renominated for all future release versions).
