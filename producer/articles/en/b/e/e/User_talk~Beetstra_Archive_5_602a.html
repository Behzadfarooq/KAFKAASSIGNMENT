<div align="center" style="color:#FF0000"><b>ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL</b></div>
<p>There are several discussions about my link removal here, and in my archives. If you want to contact me about my view of this policy, please read and <b>understand</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, and read the discussions on my talkpage or in my archives <b>first</b>.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">My view in a nutshell:<br />
External links are not meant to tunnel people away from the wikipedia.</div>
<br />
<p>Hence, I will remove external links on pages where I think they do not add to the page (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>), or when they are added in a way that <i>wikipedia</i> defines as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a> (understand that wikipedia defines spam as: '... wide-scale external link spamming ...', even if the link <i>is</i> appropriate; also read <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#External_link_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">this</a>). This may mean that I remove links, while similar links are already there or which are there already for a long time. Still, the question is not whether your link should be there, the question <i>may</i> be whether those other links should be there (again, see the wording of the policies and guidelines).</p>
<p>Please consider the alternatives before readding the link:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the link contains information, use the information to add <i>content</i> to the article, and use the link as a reference (content is not 'see <a href="http://www.example.org" class="external text" title="http://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information').</li>
<li>Add an appropriate linkfarm like {{<a href="../../../d/m/o/Template%7EDmoz_e80e.html" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>}} (you can consider to remove other links covered in the dmoz.</li>
<li>Incorporate the information into one of the sister projects.</li>
<li>Add the link to other mediawiki projects aimed at advertiseing (see e.g. <a href="http://www.aboutus.org" class="external text" title="http://www.aboutus.org" rel="nofollow">this</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the linkspam of a certain link perseveres, I will not hesitate to report it to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">wikiproject spam</a> for blacklisting (even <i>if</i> the link would be appropriate for wikipedia). It may be wise to consider the <i>before</i> things get to that point.</p>
<div align="center" style="background-color:#FF0000">The answer in a nutshell<br />
Please consider if the link you want to add complies with the policies and guidelines.</div>
<br />
<p>Pertaining links on pages about chemicals: If the link is a regular source of chemicals, consider adding the link to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemical_sources_67a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemical sources">wikipedia:chemical sources</a>, and add the template {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChemicalSources_9571.html" title="Template:ChemicalSources">ChemicalSources</a>}} to the external links sections of the chemicals' page(s) (when not there). If you would like to see my proposed special:chemicalsources be activated, please vote for <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7514" rel="nofollow">bug 7514 on bugzilla</a>.</p>
<p>If you have other questions, or still have questions on my view of the external link policy, disagree with me, or think I made a mistake in removing a link you added, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">please poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a>.

<div align="center"><b>Reliable sources</b></div>
<p>I convert inline URL's into references and convert referencing styles to a consistent format. My preferred style is the style provided by <a href="../../../f/o/o/WP%7EFOOT_ead9.html" title="WP:FOOT">cite.php</a> (&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;references/&gt;). When other mechanisms are mainly (but not consistently) used (e.g. {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}}/{{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}}-templates) I will assess whether referencing would benefit from the cite.php-style. Feel free to revert these edits when I am wrong.</p>
<p>Converting inline URLs in references may result in data being retrieved from <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">unreliable sources</a>. In these cases, the link may have been removed, and replaced by a {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}}. If you feel that the page should be used as a reference (complying with <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html" title="Wp:rs">wp:rs</a>!!), please discuss that on the talkpage of the page, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beetstra&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">poke me by starting a new subject on my talk-page</a></p>
<p>Note: I am working with some other developers on mediawiki to expand the possibilities of cite.php, our attempts can be followed <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=423" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" class="external text" title="http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you like these features and want them enabled, please vote for these bugs.</p>

<div style="margin-top:.1em; margin-bottom:.1em; border:1px solid #8DB9F6; background-color:#E9F2FE; padding:.1em">
<div align="center"><b>Stub/Importance/Notability/Expand/Expert</b></div>
<p>I am in general against deletion, except when the page really gives misinformation, is clear spam or copyvio. Otherwise, these pages may need to be expanded or rewritten. For very short articles there are the different {{<a href="../../../s/t/u/Template%7EStub_4533.html" title="Template:Stub">stub</a>}} marks, which clearly state that the article is to be expanded. For articles that do not state why they are notable, I will add either {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}. In my view there is a distinct difference between these two templates, while articles carrying one of these templates <i>may</i> not be notable, the first template does say the <i>article</i> is probably notable enough, but the <i>contents</i> does not state that (yet). The latter provides a clear concern that the article is not notable, and should probably be {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}}ed or {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfD_4f30.html" title="Template:AfD">AfD</a>}}ed. Removing importance-tags does not take away the backlog, it only hides from attention, deleting pages does not make the database smaller. If you contest the notability/importance of an article, please consider adding an {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert-subject_82ba.html" title="Template:Expert-subject">expert-subject</a>}} tag, or raise the subject on an appropriate wikiproject. Remember, there are many, many pages on the wikipedia, many need attention, so maybe we have to live with a backlog.</p>
<p>Having said this, I generally delete the {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}}-template on sight. The template is in most cases superfluous, expansion is intrinsic to the wikipedia (for stubs, expansion is already mentioned in <i>that</i> template).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">re: Rob Dickinson</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for the note. I, of course, respectfully disagree with your dismissal of my edits.</p>
<p>The four interviews (from four different sources) I linked to fit within this guideline: "Sites with other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article, such as reviews and interviews."</p>
<p>Each one of the interviews I linked to provides a wealth of personal insight and information about the subject - often in the subject's own words. This is relevant, meaningful, original content that cannot simply be appropriated for the main document. (Some topics covered the demise of his previous band, his life philosophies, how he has spent the last five years, and other similarly informative topics.)</p>
<p>In encourage you to independently review these interview links to see for yourself the quality and depth of the content.</p>
<p>I also updated the "categories" section, again, within entirely appropriate (read: relevant) parameters.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dirk, for your time and consideration.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">PrinterSetup Page</span></h2>
<p>It seems the Wikipedia article for PrinterSetup was deleted. If you feel that this is advertising that is fine. However, the page was setup with the intention of providing informative information for systems administrators rather than commercial advertising.</p>
<p>We will respect your wishes to not add the links to the software hosted for download on our site if you believe that such links are not appropriate. However, these links were added to the article because they were perceived to be relevant and useful for wikipedia readers. The link means that the reader will not be required to perform a search for the software.</p>
<p>PrinterSetup is not for sale. PrinterSetup is free. PrinterSetup is open-source (GNU GPL v2) software and is useful for systems administrators and people who are interested in automatic print queue creation software.</p>
<p>The article was originally written to provide information on setting up printers. With the hope that there would be feed back on the product, and alternative products along with methods for setting up printers to be added to the page by wikipedia editors. We originally developed PrinterSetup because nothing like it existed. We added the page to Wikipedia so that there would be non-biased information about the software available to the world. It would be great to have a complete list of System Administration tools on Wikipedia with notes and feed back about the benefits and disadvantages of these tools.</p>
<p>If you still believe that the PrinterSetup article is inappropriate please let us know. Our contact information from available from our site&#160;: <a href="http://lucidsystems.org" class="external free" title="http://lucidsystems.org" rel="nofollow">http://lucidsystems.org</a>. We would like to understand why this content is not appropriate, because if it is inappropriate we probably do not understanding the Wikipedia philosophy. Lucid would like to provide Wikipedia with useful content. Other open-source software tools are listed on wikipedia such as <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snort_%28software%29.html" title="Snort (software)">Snort_(software)</a>. We are suppressed that PrinterSetup is not able to be included as well. We like Wikipedia so much we are simply attempting to bring something back to the wikipedia community.</p>
<p>Perhaps the idea for the page made sense but you found the content provided was not appropriate? If this is the case, would you please provide some tips on how to improve the page. Or simply make the appropriate modifications. Rather than deleting the page.</p>
<p>If you have changed your mind and believe that the information regarding the setup and management of printer queue is appropriate, would you please re-establish the PrinterSetup page, or provide the go-ahead for us to recreate the page.</p>
<p>Your consideration on this page is appreciated, by us and also many unix systems administrators.</p>
<p>We look forward to supporting the Wikipedia project. However, we do not understand why linking to external websites is such a problem.</p>
<p>Looking forward to some feedback or seeing the page reestablished.</p>
<p>All the best from the Lucid Team.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Storage service provider</span></h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Regarding the wikipedia article&#160;: <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storage_service_provider.html" title="Storage service provider">Storage service provider</a></p>
<p>We are not affiliated with the companies which we setup external links to on the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storage_service_provider.html" title="Storage service provider">Storage service provider</a> wikipedia page. In fact those links were to competitors in this market. We added them to the page to make the page as unbiassed as possible. We believe that since we added the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storage_service_provider.html" title="Storage service provider">Storage service provider</a> article to wikipedia, it grew to be a list of storage service providers with links to websites and today, it is turning into an informative page for people interested in this topic thanks to the help of people like you.</p>
<p>There is still content on this page, that we submitted on the original page. It is great to see that page develop. However, we are concerned that editors feel we are adding links to get page ranking in search engines. I imagine there are better ways to do this, particularly as many editors have stated that follow for spiders is disabled on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Please understand that we simply did our best to write a unbiased article. Perhaps if it had been on farming soya beans, we would have included links to companies like monsanto. In this case the page was written from our experience and contained a link to our site for both information references and as a provider of information storage solutions. The link is not for our benefit, but rather for Wikipedia readers who would like more information about either our services, or some of the general white papers which have general information on information storage technology.</p>
<p>Our intention is not advertising. It is to setup freely available information with unbiased information. We believe that this is the job of being an editor on wikipedia. We thank you for your hard work making wikipedia what it is today. However, external links to websites should not be seen as advertising if they are in an objective context.</p>
<p>Please let us know if it is still a problem to post links or references in articles which refer back to our site.</p>
<p>All the best. From the Lucid team.</p>

<dd>I assume you are referring to the additions by Lucidsystems (<a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucidsystems_e72c.html" title="User talk:Lucidsystems">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lucidsystems_2583.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lucidsystems">contribs</a>), though I see this IP has a similar addition pattern.</dd>
<dd>First, the article printersetup was written as an advertisement, not in a neutral way. The article might be appropriate when written according to the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, although I might still contest if it is notable enough to be mentioned in the wikipedia. Please see the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> guidelines.</dd>
<dd>Second, the majority of edits was the addition of an external link. You were, repeatedly, pointed to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, I invite you to read the guidelines there. If you believe that the link is of value to the article, please discuss addition on the talkpage first.</dd>
<dd>Please understand that wikipedia is not a linkfarm, it is not the yellow pages, and it is not a vehicle for promotion of products. We are writing an encyclopedia here. Thank you. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 08:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>I encourage you to look at what PrinterSetup is doing. It simply makes print queues. It is free software.</dd>
<dd><br /></dd>
<dd>It would be great if there was a unbiassed Wikipeida page with information regarding system administration utilities.</dd>
<dd><br /></dd>
<dd>Please understand there were never any intentions to use Wikipedia to generate interest in PrinterSetup. The external links were appropriately placed to the official site of the software tool.<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>We have been suppressed at how many people are using PrinterSetup. The tool was developed with a client, and was released for the benefit of the systems administration community. Again we would like to reiterate that the Wikipedia page was not setup to gain higher search engine ranking, as you have suggested.<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>Other than the external links (which we still believe were completely appropriate) are there any other reasons for the deletion of this page?</dd>
<dd>The only other foreseeable reasons for the page deletion is that PrinterSetup is not large notable enough, or that it was deleted because the page was started by the institute who developed the project. In either case, we have decided to never re-build this Wikipedia page. Instead we will wait for someone else to build this page.<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>Again thank you for your editing of Wikipedia. You are doing a great job.</dd>

<p>Hello Dirk, I just got a message saying you deleted a link I added to the Canadian comedian Jeremy Hotz. I'm wondering if this was in error. The link I added was an interview I conducted with Hotz. I found this on the Wikipedia instruction page about what to link: "Sites with other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article, such as reviews and interviews." Since it's an interview (and one I conducted myself), shouldn't it be put back up?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">interviews</span></h2>
<p>Hi again, Dirk, I got one message from you regarding an interview I linked to the Jeremy Hotz page. Since then, I've noticed that several other interview links I've added have been removed, while others haven't. This is confusing. The reason I am adding my interviews (which can be found en masse at <a href="http://comedycouch.com/interviews.htm" class="external free" title="http://comedycouch.com/interviews.htm" rel="nofollow">http://comedycouch.com/interviews.htm</a>) is because I noticed that some of them have already been added, and not by me. I cover comedy for a living in Vancouver, Canada, and I believe these transcripted interviews are extremely valuable to any serious fan of comedy. So I was in the process of adding links to the individual pages when I noticed that they were being taken down almost as fast as I was putting them up. And many of these pages have other interviews linked. I'll put my interviews up against anybody's for shere information and entertainment value. Many of the other linked interviews are quite lightweight and superficial, yet they remain. Curious. Could you please elucidate?

<p>Hello Dirk, I´m new at the Wikipedia community but reading the wikipedia policies I don`t understand so good why you have removed all my external links sections from the pages I created. Magister Musicae host videos with master classes from the professor and it adds information to the article; People will not only be able to read about his biography, but also to watch his teachings through the videos in the link. Moreover there is a link for see the page Magister Musicae in English. I would like to know if its possible that you put back my external links if I put the English url of Magister Musicae. Thank you for your attention. --Cada2 16:57, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">last try</span></h2>
<p>Hi again, Dirk, In your response to me, you wrote that you also have noticed other interviews "but that does not mean a) that others should be added, especially not en mass, and b) maybe the other links should also be removed".</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines spam as "posting advertisements or useless posts on a forum". It's not simply the fact of doing several entries in one sitting. Obviously you have to be wary of anything that looks like it might be spam, but when faced with evidence to the contrary, you should see your mistake. Since my interviews have no (zero) advertising, and no one gets paid for any hit, it doesn't fall under the "posting advertisements" heading.</p>
<p>Are they useless? That's subjective, but one thing you have yet to respond to (either to me or others on your page) is how you reconcile removing the interviews when your very own guidelines for external links says interviews should be included. I'd like to hear your answer to this. And not just the fact that Wikipedia isn't a link farm, because that's not consistent with the guidelines which says interviews are not only fine, but "should" be included.</p>
<p>In another message to me, you wrote that it looked like the links were promotional. How can I respond to this other than to say that wasn't the intent; I just happened to have conducted the interviews. Since I noticed three of my interviews linked by someone else, should I infer that only third parties can add external links?

<ul>
<li>Re definition. <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> says "There are four types of wikispam: advertisements masquerading as articles, wide-scale external link spamming, bandspam (tangential references instead of disambiguation which promote some entity) and "Wikipedian-on-Wikipedian" spamming or, "canvassing" (also known as "internal spamming" and "cross-posting"). ", and I define this as 'wide scale external link spamming'. I don't see where I make a mistake when an editor is <i>only</i> adding external links and no content.</li>
<li>Re link farm. Why yours, and not a number of other interviews. In other words, if we allow yours, we should allow many others as well. As such, we either make the choice of not being a linkfarm, and hence not including them, or we are biased towards one. The section about what should be linked comes way after the introduction of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, which describes the alternatives.</li>
<li>Re extra information. If these interviews are indeed giving extra information, then why not use them as a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">reference</a> (reading <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> from top to bottom: "If the site or page to which you want to link includes information that is not yet a part of the article, consider using it as a source first. Refer to the citation guideline for instructions on citing sources. This guideline refers to external links other than citations."</li>

<p>dirk.... okay... so, i'm very new to this wikipedia thing. as a journalist, wikipedia is my first source of information when i am researching a subject/band that i am interviewing... so, as a courtesy, i was returning the favor and posting links to articles on my site so others may have the same availability to information and outside sources. i'm not doing it for promotion. (believe me, i'm already well-known as a journalist, as is my site.) i don't have a staff or assistants or interns or even children to help me with postings, so therefore, I do these things myself. In fact, I am the entire office staff of crushermagazine.com so tell me, do you not consider these links viable external information if they are interviews with and/or are relevant to the subject within the last two years? please advise. editatrix<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Editatrix (<a href="../../../e/d/i/User_talk%7EEditatrix_ee6f.html" title="User talk:Editatrix">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Editatrix_f975.html" title="Special:Contributions/Editatrix">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>yes, well, i see your point with the gentleman above, as he was posting only his own articles...i was posting links to articles on my site which were not only conducted by myself, but also my freelance writers. why don't i include them in the body of the articles and cite them as references? basically because i don't have the time, dirk. i run a full-time online music magazine over here where i do all the editing, photo editing, and html coding, plus i'm a single mom...just not enough hours in the day, my friend. would you suggest posting the links in the talk section of each page and making them available for others to use as reference material??? that could possibly be a solution if i one day find time for it. some of these interviews that my writers do are really quite good and very informative, as is evidenced by the fact that some have already been cited as references on some of your pages already [i.e., thornley (band)]...in any case, since my time is very limited, this will likely be a project for another day, entirely. i regret that i can't spend hours upon hours dithering here over your content and style concepts as they are interpreted by each new online editor such as yourself (not to insult you, just saying each person's perception is different) and since all here is carved in sand and not stone, i must bow out of the wikipedia community until such a day when i have the time to properly devote to it.</dd>

<dd>So, what you basically say, is that we should allow you to spam your links to 20 articles in 1 hour and 45 minutes (I presume the 21st link was in another session), because you don't have time to actually contribute actual content to one article...</dd>

<p>You say instead of posting the interview, I should consider adding the relevant information to the article and citing the interview as a reference. All well and good for those with time. I write for a living and have a family and don't have time to write and edit articles for free. As a journalist, I love seeing as many outside sources as possible when researching a subject. Links, so far as they're not spam in the conventional sense but rather worthwhile, are valuable to me and I appreciate coming on to Wikipedia and not only reading the original article, but accessing other sources. So my aim in adding links to my interviews was only as a help to others. I enjoy reading the other interviews linked on Wikipedia and thought mine might be of use, too, to someone.

<p>Now that I've read about external links, copyrights, attribution and linking to myself, articles with URL's that are not linked (so you have to copy and paste), there's on one question left: how do I delete my Wikipedia account?</p>
<p>A link is the most important thing in the world wide web. If everyone links to WP and WP doesn't link back, we'll all end up here. According to "What should be linked", point 3. "Sites that contain neutral and accurate material that cannot be integrated into the Wikipedia article due to copyright issues, amount of detail (such as professional athlete statistics, movie or television credits, interview transcripts, or online textbooks) or other reasons." my site seems to be OK (amount of detail) for a link, but I have to ask others to do this. The Layla article cites a lot of personal websites as source, which are "no reliable source" according to WP's own attribution rules. No one cares. The two links at the bottom? One containing copyrighted lyrics (I have removed from my site), the other a mediocre review. No one cares. But a link to the musical background of the album is removed, because I submitted it myself.</p>
<p>Take a look at the "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs" article. There is even no source cited in the whole article! Two external links - a fanzine and a personal review (without any name/contact information/disclaimer), not to the artists home page according to the WP's own rules.</p>
<p>I understand that WP has to fight against spamming and misuse. No question. But an article about Layla in the world wide web should contain a link to a prominent site with more details about the music itself. Otherwise WP should in general disallow any external links.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12barde (<a href="../../../1/2/b/User_talk%7E12barde.html" title="User talk:12barde">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12barde_58eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/12barde">contribs</a>).</small></p>

It's like the cop who doesn't understand the "spirit of the law" when handing out a ticket to someone who ran a red light at 4 in the morning with no other traffic on the streets. Technically, yes, it's illegal. But the spirit of the law is to maintain traffic flow in order to avoid accidents. Or the Nazi soldier who claims he was just following orders. The spirit of the "no spam" rule is to avoid real and pernicious spam that does nothing to add to enriching anything but the pocketbooks of the senders.

<p><sub>I don't insist. Now it's just a matter of the policy and enforcement that boggles my mind. Yes, it's so much more difficult to add "content". I know because from each of these interviews I write stories that run in various newspapers here. I get paid for my efforts. It takes time to read, then extract relevant passages and put into your own words. It takes little effort to add a link. You say "external links do not enrich the encyclopedia, content does". As a user of said "encyclopedia", I can tell you for a fact that external links other than mine do indeed enrich the encyclopedia. To read someone's take on what someone else says is never as useful as hearing it from the horse's mouth in context. I've been around reporting long enough to have witnessed firsthand quotes used out of context by unsxcrupulous or incompetent reporters. So I'm not insisting anything, Dirk. I just think it's a misguided policy. All the more so if all the editors aren't on the same page and it's inconsistent. I don't get your police analogy at all. Speeding through a city would be analogous to "real" spam (that everyone -- not just the editors of Wikipedia) constitutes as spam: dangerous, pernicious, unhelpful to all. My example of proceeding through a red light in the middle of the night with no traffic around is analogous to "spam" as you see it, which is benign, even helpful. Examples of my links and others in your talk session here. Maybe it's a language thing. Maybe it's different in Dutch, I don't know. Oh, and I tried to discuss my issue in the talkpages but haven't heard back. Or maybe I did it wrong. Gmacp 03:13, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</sub></p>

<dd><sub>There are some guidelines and policies which give some rules to improve the wikipedia. Although we are writing an online wikipedia, which is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> the same as a paper encyclopedia, the efforts are there to actually bring this onto CD/into print (for people without internet, or with slow internet), which would render the external links useless (and propably information that could have been incorporated is missing, because it relied on external links). Hence the policies and guidelines in question here (parts of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, and in lesser extend <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>), they are all pointing towards incorporating information, not to linking information.

<dd><sub>What I meant with my speeding analogy, it is wrong, whatever car you have. There are only very few cases where a judge would be lenient to a case of speeding in a city (or driving through a red light, a good cop would not allow that, even when streets are totally empty; in the Netherlands the traffic cameras on certain crossroads do not turn off when it is dark). Certain rules don't bend, and I think that <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> should not bend because a link is not promotional (which in a way I still would contest, you are involved in the target of the link). Many, many links are questionable under <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> anyway (and some pages get cleaned drastically); I have already mentioned that it states early in <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> that external links should be considered to be used as a reference first. In all cases, if your link is adding information, and you believe that your link should be in the external links section on a page, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> does give you another alternative: discuss the linkaddition on the talkpage of the page you want the link added to, and when consensus is reached, the link can be added.

<ol>
<li><sub>You were adding the links to a number of pages (and you were only adding links). That is, under the wikipedia definition, <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spamming</a> (it does not matter whether or not the links are appropriate).</sub></li>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><sub>The links are not specific to information on Rembrandt, Plato, but were to the homepage of the organisation. If we would allow that, then every library that has a book on Rembrandt or Plato could put their link in the external links section (per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a> - wikipedia is not a list of external links). Moreover, one could then also consider to add a link to all search engines, which can also be used to find more information on Rembrandt or Plato.</sub></li>
<li><sub>The site europeanlibrary.org is <i>only</i> accessible with Internet Explorer (6.0+), Firefox or Mozilla/Netscape (on windows, other operating systems have even lower access). In other words, all the users that do not have availability over these browsers would not be able to read the contents (see <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, links to avoid, #7). I am using Opera, and after accessing the site the only way to get back to wikipedia was by closing the window and opening a fresh one to go to wikipedia (the back-button did not work).</sub></li>
<li><sub>Per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, the information can be incorporated, and it is better to use specific information as a reference (again under policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a>).</sub></li>

I have stated in my edit summary on the pages the reason why I have removed the library homepage from a number of wikipedia pages. Links to specific information on the librarysite have not been deleted, though these should all get a remark that the information is not accessible for all browsers.

<h2><sub><span class="mw-headline">Recipe links</span></sub></h2>
<p><sub>Why not remove just the offending link(s)? It seems that great many people come to food articles from Google and other search engines, where respective WP entry is usually first or at least in top 10 - and they are usually not looking for Wikipedia article, but for recipes. It is a common practice to have few recipe links in food articles. Of course, link farming is a totally different issue and such links should always be removed - but good links to food sites (esp. ad-free sites, such as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/" rel="nofollow">BBC Recipes</a>) should be there, in my opinion. In case of BBC, they usually have also a very good review of the "foodstuff" in question. That said, I am not going to put the links back there - but perhaps you should consider reinstating some of the "good" links (to noncommercial sites - see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/tortilla_11230.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/tortilla_11230.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://lawdy.wordpress.com/2007/01/29/how-to-make-tortillas/" class="external autonumber" title="http://lawdy.wordpress.com/2007/01/29/how-to-make-tortillas/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, probably few others).

<p><sub>What you think is inappropiate I find to be very appropiate. I put that link on Jessie Daniels site because I play her songs. This station is non profit in the truest sense. It sells no products. It plays artists that are on the charts and ones I personally like. Jessie Daniels isn't on the charts anymore. Everytime I play one of her songs, it is logged and she gets paid a royalty. This does more for her than any fansite. The like is non descript. It doesn't use any marketing jargon. It doesn't have explanation points. So, if you still think it's inappropiate then you need to go and take off every fansite under every artist (many of them make money by the way). Also, you might want to consider taking off that interview on her site.</sub></p>
<p><sub>I dedicate my time and money to creating a place where people can hear artists like her. Someone thought that she was worth the time and money to interview her. Others thought she was worth it to make a fansite. Many christian artists and record labels use the concept of "Street teams". I am part of that. I spread the word by bringing people to the station, play their music and promote them. Radio is a part of every musicians life. Have you looked at her website? She is selling stuff. She is pushing her alblum. I am too. So, tell me how is it inappropiate? Tell the truth, face the facts of life. Don't jump to conclusions so quickly.</sub></p>

<dd><sub>Thank you for your assumption of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>. The answer is simple. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a linkfarm</a>. Moreover, one of the links got spammed heavily around wikipedia, whereupon these edits got reverted and I encountered large linkfarms of recipes. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> clearly state, that external link sections should be kept to a minimum, and there are in this case two alternatives available, both {{<a href="../../../d/m/o/Template%7EDmoz_e80e.html" title="Template:Dmoz">dmoz</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/o/o/Template%7ECookbook_6266.html" title="Template:Cookbook">cookbook</a>}} could replace this on many pages (which, now I think of it, actually is 'incoporating the data into wikipedia' (well, a sister-project), so now suddenly the whole of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> applies, and these links should not be there at all). Moreover, having these links there does invite more links to be added (as seen yesterday with the spammer), many of the links do rely on advertising, and without the links the articles could also reach featured article status. Again, thank you and hope to see you around. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 20:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</sub>

<dd><sub>OK, I should have been a bit more clear. The one link that got spammed wás mexicanfood.about.com. Upon that I encountered many linkfarms, and I have cleaned a number of them. And I think I explained why these links violate <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, the recipes can be incorporated in wikibooks, and hence, they do not need to be in external links sections.
