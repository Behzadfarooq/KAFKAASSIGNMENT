<p>Late one night in spring 1827 (presumably <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">March 26</a>, the night he died), <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_van_Beethoven_69c9.html" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> has completed his masterpiece, his <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._10_%28Beethoven_Cooper%29_f771.html" title="Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)">tenth symphony</a> (which in reality, was never completed).</p>
<p>Just as this work is finished, Fate and her son Twist (as in 'Twist of Fate') arrive in his home, and inform the composer of what he had expected for a long while: that this night was the night of his death.</p>
<p>After this explanation, the devil <a href="../../../m/e/p/Mephistopheles.html" title="Mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a> arrives to claim Beethoven's soul. He <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pact_with_the_Devil_b1cb.html" title="Pact with the Devil">offers the composer a deal</a>; Mephistopheles will allow Beethoven to keep his soul if he may erase the memory of Beethoven's works from all mankind. Beethoven is given one hour to consider, and Mephistopheles leaves the room.</p>
<p>Beethoven turns his anger to Fate at having been dealt a hard life, and now, this decision. In consolation, Fate allows Beethoven to travel back through his life in order to review it and make any changes that he wishes. Beethoven accepts this, and they begin with Beethoven's experiences as a child.</p>
<p>Beethoven comes into his room while the young Beethoven has just been slapped by a tutor for failing to receive appointment to the Imperial Court. Beethoven turns to Fate and informs her that he did not need the hardships that he had faced, with his mother dead and a painful childhood. He requests that she remove the experience from his life. After being told that such a request would remove the inspiration for his <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._6_%28Beethoven%29_1031.html" title="Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)">sixth symphony</a>, he changes his mind.</p>
<p>Fate and Beethoven then go to one of Beethoven's happier moments, meeting the composer <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart_a085.html" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> in the city of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. Fate then reminds Beethoven of his "immortal beloved"<sup id="_ref-immortal_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-immortal" title="">[1]</a></sup> Theresa, and after experiencing a fond remembrance, Beethoven explains his reasons for needing to leave her.</p>
<p>The pair venture to when Beethoven first realizes his deafness, and Beethoven explains that Theresa would not love him were she to know. He is then shown Theresa's reaction to his unexplained absence, and he realizes that his deafness is the cause of all his problems. Fate explains that if she cures his deafness, his music will suffer, as the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muse.html" title="Muse">Muses</a> would not be heard as easily through the everyday sound. He thus withdraws his request.</p>
<p>Beethoven is then shown that Theresa would have loved him forever, and he becomes very sorrowful. But Fate then offers visions of the countless musicians of the future who would be influenced by Beethoven's works. As one last, ultimate vision, he is allowed to improvise with the musicians of the past and future who were inspired by him. Realizing that removing the hardships from his life would destroy his music, Beethoven informs Fate that he will not change any part of his life.</p>
<p>At this point, Mephistopheles returns and Beethoven informs the devil that he will not allow his music to be destroyed. Desperate to receive the Tenth Symphony, Mephistopheles makes another deal: if Beethoven will give over only the Tenth Symphony, then Mephistopheles will not take the composer's soul. After an appearance by Mozart's ghost, Beethoven refuses this offer as well. As a final tactic, Mephistopheles points out the window to a young orphan, and describes the tortures that she will receive if Beethoven refuses to hand over his music. Heartbroken, Beethoven agrees to hand over his Tenth Symphony. After Twist's prompting, a contract is drawn up by Fate, stating the following:</p>
<p><i>It is agreed upon this night, March 26, 1827, between the undersigned, that the music of the Tenth Symphony, composed by Ludwig van Beethoven, first born son of Johann and Maria van Beethoven, of the city of Bonn, shall henceforth be the property of Mephistopheles, Lord of Darkness and first fallen from the grace of God. It is also understood that it is his intention to remove any signs of this music from the memory of man for all eternity. In exchange for the destruction of the aforementioned music it is also agreed that Mephistopheles and all his minions will remove themselves from the life of the child presently sleeping in the gutter directly across from the window of this room. This removal of influence is to be commenced immediately upon signing and to be enforced for all eternity.</i></p>
<p>_____________________<br />
<i>Ludwig Von Beethoven</i></p>
<p>_____________________<br />
<i>Mephistopheles</i></p>
<p>The contract is signed by both the parties, after which Mephistopheles thrusts the Tenth Symphony over a lit candle. When it does not burn, the fact is revealed that Beethoven is in fact the <i>second</i>-born son of his parents by the name Ludwig Von Beethoven, and thus, the contract does not apply to his music.</p>
<p>After Mephistopheles leaves in a fit of rage, it is revealed that the true destination of Beethoven's soul is actually <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">heaven</a> (as Twist explains, the devil was simply lying to him all along). Fate tells him to rest, and Beethoven's soul leaves his body for the great beyond. However, Twist also hides the manuscript for the 10th symphony.</p>
