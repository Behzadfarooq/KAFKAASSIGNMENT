<p>Is the title appropriately NPOV?</p>

I agreee with the tone of this article on a personal level, but I think it could benefit from the attentions of somebody wearing their NPOV glasses... <a href="../../../q/u/e/User%7EQuercusrobur_29af.html" title="User:Quercusrobur">quercus robur</a> 00:23 Mar 28, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The bit about "marginal constutituencies" appears definitely POV. Unless someone can come up with evidence - remembering of course that Wikipedia doesn't allow original research - that is you'll need to quote EXISTING research or literature on the subject! Exile 22:00, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But it has to be in the article, preferably in such a way that other people can verify it themselves. Too much of this article consists of "many commentators now agree" and "some people believe" and "others were of the opinion that" and "however, it was felt that", which is pseudoencyclopaedic, just like <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 11:41, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>" Where some lines would never have been profitable in 1963 they could well be profitable now, and could even have a major impact on reducing road congestion and pollution in those areas. However in many instances it would be prohibitively expensive for lines closed by the Beeching Axe to be reopened; although it was not stipulated in the report, since Beeching there has been a policy of disposing of surplus-to-requirements railway land. Therefore many bridges, cuttings and embankments have been removed and the land sold off for development; closed station buildings on remaining lines have often been either demolished or sold."</p>
<p>Since there are virtually no passenger railways either in the UK or elsewhere that are "profitable" this is clearly nonsense. The re-opened railways are certainly not profitable, although they carry more passengers than they did when closed originally. BR certainly had no interest in keeping vacant land they no longer needed just for the sake of it. Had the government wanted to retain old rights of way free of building they could have done so by converting them to roads or pedestrian routes - but in most cases they didn't. Recently the building costs of both road and rail infrastructure has knocked most big transport schemes in the UK on the head - although, curiously, other countries still manage it,some of them a great deal less wealthy than Britain. That was POV by the way and I wouldn't put it in the article!</p>

<dd>I've reworded that section to qualify the profitable bit, although I'm loathe to take it out completely as it's complex what is and isn't profitable in the modern world of the railway (c.f. Network Rail's current "profit" post massive subsidy, SWTrains, GNER etc make a "profit" and pay a premium to run services). Beeching had no crystal ball and recommended line closures that, with hindsight, a shifting, more mobile and growing population, and the passing of 40-odd years, was a mistake, however as you say, the real issue was not the closure but the subsequent wholesale disposal of the permanent way.<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBaseTurnComplete_1deb.html" title="User:BaseTurnComplete">BaseTurnComplete</a> 15:23, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Members of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Good_articles_8d89.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles</a> are in the process of doing a re-review of current <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a> listings to ensure compliance with the standards of the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">Good Article Criteria</a>. (Discussion of the changes and re-review can be found <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EGood_article_candidates_da1f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Good article candidates">here</a>). A significant change to the GA criteria is the mandatory use of some sort of in-line citation (In accordance to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) to be used in order for an article to pass the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and reference criteria. Currently this article does not include in-line citations. It is recommended that the article's editors take a look at the inclusion of in-line citations as well as how the article stacks up against the rest of the Good Article criteria. GA reviewers will give you at least a week's time from the date of this notice to work on the in-line citations before doing a full re-review and deciding if the article still merits being considered a Good Article or would need to be de-listed.

<p>Whilst i respect the comment above about profitability it would be interesting if a comparison with cited sources could be made into any existing studies into this against the total cost of something like the M6 toll road - a "from scratch" development with a number of toll areas (comparable perhaps to rail stations in size, scope and continued upkeep/wage bill) and new bridges and cuttings. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.108.42.194_620c.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.108.42.194">82.108.42.194</a> (talk) 14:36, 2 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
