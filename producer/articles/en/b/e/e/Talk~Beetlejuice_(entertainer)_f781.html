<p>Currently the article states first that his name came from the Tim Burton movie, then that some bullies in his old neighborhood made it up. I'm guessing that the bullies would have gotten the idea from the movie, so that would make Mr. Green 20 years old at the time - 'bullies' sounds more like 1st-12th grade stuff to me, so I have no idea how true the bully part is.</p>
<p>If nobody clarifies it somehow or other over the next few days, I'll just yank the bully part.</p>

I'm pretty sure that Howard Stern or one of his cohosts coined the term during one of Beetle's early appearances on the show. You are correct to note the anachronism of the name origin as currently stated. Bwalsh 23:11, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've seen Beetlejuice's first appearance on the Stern show and the people with him (including his manager, Sean) were already calling him by that name. So, it definitely wasn't coined by anyone from Stern's show.</p>

<p>OK, that's a good basis to build up from allowing only referenced material and in a balanced way. Trouble is you've actually removed referenced material. He obviously gets up to some outrageous things and this has to be shown in the article. That's not being derogatory about him - it's just telling the truth about him, which is an entirely different matter and needs to be shown, or the article is not accurate. Perhaps you could put some of this back in. Wikipedia is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wp:not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" rel="nofollow">not censored.</a> <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tyrenius, I know i removed some sourced material however getting his nuts shaved on Stern isn't exactly notable. I'm a huge Stern fan (I listen to the whole show every day) I'm not trying to censor, I just don't think we should add _every_ stunt to the article. We need to be more balanced. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELilDice_d087.html" title="User:LilDice">LilDice</a> 02:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would say it was very notable. It's not the sort of thing most people do, so it makes him stand out. Besides which the notability is for the subject of the article. We're not adding every stunt. At the moment there are no stunts at all. Before there were two referenced incidents that took place on the radio and are recorded on Stern's website. It is not balanced to leave out any mention of these things he gets up to. It creates a false sanitised picture. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's unusual, but not notable. Simply being part of the rundown on howardstern.com doesn't make it notable, it needs to be published somewhere else.<a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELilDice_d087.html" title="User:LilDice">LilDice</a> 12:07, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know where you get that from. Stern is a radio programme and this is the official web site for it (as far as I know - correct me if I'm wrong). This is quite enough for a source. It doesn't have to be in newspaper. If you're telling me that this is an obscure radio show and an insignificant blog type web site, then it wouldn't be a suitable source, but I understand that Stern is well known? If there is a biog of someone who does unusual things - and this is in the public domain - then you've got to mention that or it doesn't give an accurate picture of them. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's true he is doing unusual things on a national radio show. We must remember that everything that goes on in the show isn't encyclopedic. Some whack packers and employees (like Richard Christy) for example list every stunt ad nauseum, and they just aren't notable. I am not trying to sanitize this article. However, I don't want to have it turn into <a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFancruft_4a77.html" title="WP:Fancruft">WP:Fancruft</a>. I think it's fine to mention what he does on the show, but is it important to anyone but Stern fans that he got his nuts shaved? I think a good compromise might be to say that he is known for his outrageous apperances on the show and cite a few examples of what his appearances are like. Yes he has gotten his nuts shaved, but really that's not his usual appearance -- more often he's simply interviewed and goofed on for his non-sequitor answers. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELilDice_d087.html" title="User:LilDice">LilDice</a> 13:07, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, it's not important to say hghns <i>per se</i>. It's important to say he does outrageous things. It would be helpful to the reader to give an indication of what these are and an example or two of the most notorious, to show how far he goes. These are facts. Furthermore they are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. Then the article is informative. Otherwise the reader has to go to an external link to find out, and the aim of an article is that it provides adequate explanation in itself. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:34, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to start adding some categories to avoid the running logs that are common on the wack packers pages. This is Beetle belongs in here I think which is why I nominated it for merging. With the categories I'm having trouble thinking of what are his most notable appearances. Another thing to do would be to add his notable quotes "Who Me?" and others.

<dd>You are absolutely right. Those are two different Beetle songs; Staind covered one, Blues Traveller covered the second song. The second song is not discussed in this article, so I'm removing the B.T. reference from the article.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 19:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why not put something about the second version. Something like "Blues Traveler performed a variation on the initial song on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_29.html" title="December 29">12-29</a>, with very different lyrics from the original that Beetlejuice sang."&#160;? <a href="http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?month=December&amp;day=29&amp;year=2005" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?month=December&amp;day=29&amp;year=2005" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I know it isn't nearly as popular but being the 3rd version I think matters somewhat.

<dd>That's fine, but if you mention the second song, you should probably change the name of the article to Beetlejuice Song.

<dd>I was suggesting the merge back into the main <strong class="selflink">beetle article</strong>, since that has been chopped back to a stub. To me this song is only notable as a beetle song, not really a staind or a bt song. That would mean giving the main beetle article a section with Beetlejuice Song as the title, and would focus primarily on the main version. I'll leave it cut for now. Are you considering the BT song different enough to be it's own song, and the Christy/Staind versions entirely separate from it? BT said they "We wanted to totally f--- it up and not copy the song exactly." <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512503/20051028/staind.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512503/20051028/staind.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> But to me this is a cover that they screwed around with the lyrics, but not really a uniquely different. I'm going to see if I have a copy of the show to check, I doubt they will do this one on mastertape theater.(<a href="../../../o/p/t/User%7EOptigan13_6733.html" title="User:Optigan13">Optigan13</a> 05:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC))</dd>
