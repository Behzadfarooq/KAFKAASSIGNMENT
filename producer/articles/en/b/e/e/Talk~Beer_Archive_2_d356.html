<p>Where is the taste? I am surprised to note that in the whole beer project there isn't a single mention of the art of beer tasting, or any guide on how to taste beer, leave alone <a href="http://www.tastebeer.com.au/beer/143" class="external text" title="http://www.tastebeer.com.au/beer/143" rel="nofollow">how to organise a beer tasting</a>. I am not refering to an experts guide but information that anyone can use.</p>
<p>I feel that information on how to taste beer is worth its very own wiki document. I am passionate about this topic as I am associated with a site that focuses on it, namely <a href="http://www.tastebeer.com.au" class="external free" title="http://www.tastebeer.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.tastebeer.com.au</a>. Example articles: <a href="http://www.tastebeer.com.au/beer/132" class="external text" title="http://www.tastebeer.com.au/beer/132" rel="nofollow">How to taste beer</a> and <a href="http://www.tastebeer.com.au/beer/153" class="external text" title="http://www.tastebeer.com.au/beer/153" rel="nofollow">Discover the truth about beer taste</a>.</p>
<p>I am not asking to use tastebeer.com.au as a reference but I feel that a beer tasting document (or at least a section) should exist that provides visitors with information about beer tasting. I am looking for your input - I've never started a wiki document myself but if there're no takers on this subject I'll shall give it a try myself. Wyxel 07:13, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wyxel, the best way to go about getting other people interested is to start working on the article yourself. It may seem like it's not the "ideal" route, but that generally is the most likely way of getting your desired article moving or attracting other contributors to it. As they say around here, Be bold. BTW, it's an interesting idea, and I'd be interested in seeing where you head with such an article. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel11_f217.html" title="User:Daniel11">Daniel11</a> 07:49, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This list is serves little purpose - the top link Beer and nationality goes to a similar list. If people wanted to gain specific details on beer within a country they could follow that link.

<p>Made a section "Beer culture". I hope I did't break too much while restructuring. I will stop for now. There are still too many sections. Can "Etymology" and "Mythology" go to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_beer.html" title="History of beer">History of beer</a>? "Ingredients" belong under "Brewing". Does <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_beer.html" title="History of beer">History of beer</a> need to be renamed? I think <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer_brewing.html" title="Beer brewing">Beer brewing</a> could be a separate article, so that section could be cleaned up. Then this article could have a clean structure, with a main article for each of these sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>History</li>
<li>Brewing</li>
<li>Serving</li>
<li>Varieties</li>
<li>Beer culture</li>
</ol>
<p>Hmm, "Related beverages" can go to "Varieties" I think. "Health effects" does not really fit under "Beer culture". Please give some feedback as I have been a bit bold. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 16:10, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm following some of your suggestions to see how it looks. There is still some work needed, but certainly putting Ingredients in with Brewing makes sense. But that section now needs trimming as there is a fuller brewing article. I agree that Mythology and Etymology looked and felt inappropriate and are better served in the history section. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a></dd>

<dd>Interesting. While beer can be abused just as any alcohol can, perhaps you've missed some of the research in recent years showing that beer (in moderation) can help improve heart health, reduce the risk of kidney stones, reduce hay fever symptoms, reduce menopausal symptoms, reduce the risk of prostate cancer, and improves cognitive function. Not to mention it's chock full of B vitamins and, until the advent of sanitation, was much safer to drink than the local water. Plus a study out this week shows that social drinkers earn, on average, about 20% more than their teetotaling counterparts. I am certainly not advocating that beer is a "health drink", but for most people who enjoy it in moderation it is a tasty and enjoyable beverage. You're certainly welcome to not have any. That just means more for me and my friends. —<a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrathchild-K_cab0.html" title="User:Wrathchild-K">Wrathchild</a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../w/r/a/User_talk%7EWrathchild-K_6125.html" title="User talk:Wrathchild-K">talk</a>)</small></sup> 19:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I replaced the item, being very important to some of us, and it has since been edited. Whilst I may agree or disagree with the choice of editing, that's tough luck for me. What I appreciate is not having valid content wiped off, but being worked upon and (hopefully) improved. And it is not for me to say whether it is or is not better. I think it is important to note the difference between editing, and narrow-minded casting aside of an important subject which is pertinent to to the main section on beer (then linked to another section, in the same way as <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lager.html" title="Lager">lager</a> is). I also indicate to anyone reading, what is endanger of becoming a petty squabble, that there are a number of external sources listed, none of which I removed, and a link to an external non-commercial resource is very different to the existing link to <a href="../../../b/o/d/Boddingtons.html" title="Boddingtons">Boddingtons</a>, specifically, whether or not I would personally like to drink a pint of it.

I think I can help to clear up some of this dispute. In a way you're both right. Beer is made with barley. And as far as my understanding goes, someone who can't have gluten, can't have barley. On the other hand, many "beers" are made today without barley. A fine example here in Wisconsin, is New Grist, made by Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee. They market this beer especially for celiacs, and I've tried it. It's not bad. But in the literal definiton of Beer, it does'nt qualify. I don refer to it as beer, however, and I have no problem moving forward from past classifications, and calling that here, maybe with a side note.

<dd>Uhh...isn't the "technical" definition of beer a fermented beverage made from grain? The Rheinheitsgebot says it has to be barley, but that's only one definition. Beer can be made wheat and rye too, you know.

<p>This page said that beer bellies are considered to be due to over eating rather than the consumption of beer.

I also understood that heavy drinking of any alcoholic beverage on a regular basis could cause a beer belly. Please correct me if i am wrong.</p>

<p>Most beer is about 200KCal per pint. So if you consume more KCal than you use you will gain weight. Simple maths and biology; if you put more in a tank than you take it it fills up. However, it is generallly thought that excess food consumption is likely to be the primary cause of a pot belly than having a few pints the occational night - and perhaps most importantly the 1000KCal kabab or pizza you have on your way home from the pub. 199.4.27.1 12:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The current beer review sites listed are large, well established sites which have a wide variety of beers, including gluten free beers. They are notable sites, that is they are referenced by the world's media. They have significant web traffic as detailed by Alexa.com. There are many, many other beer review sites which we do not include as Wiki is not a web directory. There is a link to the special interest glutenfreebeerfestival.com website on the gluten free beer article. That is the appropriate place for it. Someone reading the general beer article would be looking for general beer links. Someone reading the gluten free beer article would be looking for a gluten free beer link. Gluten free beer is an important subject, and the article is developing very well. But it is not enough a part of the general beer scene to have a link on this page. We have to have limits as to what links are allowed on this page otherwise we would be overrun. The most appropriate place for the weblink is on the gluten free beer article - and a link is already there. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 13:25, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't "skunked" beer be in the article? Here's a good reference: "<a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0006B447-F5CB-1C63-B882809EC588ED9F" class="external text" title="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0006B447-F5CB-1C63-B882809EC588ED9F" rel="nofollow">Chemists Determine Cause of "Skunky" Beer</a>," <i>Scientific American,</i> 22 October 2001:</p>
<dl>
<dd>These days, beer is the beverage of choice at chemist Malcolm Forbes’s laboratory meetings at the University of North Carolina. That’s because their latest project aims to determine why beer exposed to light tastes bad. The results of their research, an explanation for this so-called light-struck flavor, will appear in the November 5th issue of Chemistry—A European Journal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The phenomenon of beer turning skunky after exposure to light has been reported in the literature for more than 100 years, Forbes notes, but only now have scientists pinpointed the underlying mechanism. Using a type of spectroscopy that exploits electron spin, the researchers compiled a computer simulation of the reaction by which light-sensitive molecules in hops degrade into unpleasant-smelling products. The mechanism is intriguing, Forbes says, because one part of the molecule absorbs light energy that then migrates through the molecule and causes a free radical to form at a different location. "The final product of the reaction turns out to be what we call 'skunky thiol,' an analogue of a compound found in skunk glands that produces a very bad taste and smell," Forbes says. The flavor threshold of the thiol is so low, the authors write, that concentrations of a few parts-per-trillion can make beer unpalatable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Breweries typically avoid the degradation of their product by packaging it in brown or green bottles to protect it from light. "Understanding mechanisms behind changes in beer tastes is important because the world beer industry is hoping to save money by storing, shipping and selling beer in less-expensive clear glass," Forbes explains. Currently beer manufacturers that package their product in clear bottles can use modified hops that produce different free radicals and result in less of the foul chemicals. But one company minimizes the impact of the skunky thiols through more ingenious means. "Corona is marketed extremely cleverly," Forbes says of that beer, which uses regular hops but has been sold in clear bottles all along. The company suggests that drinkers add a slice of lime to enhance the taste of the beer, not to mention its odor.</dd>
</dl>

Current research does indicate that beer predates wine by as much as two thousand years. Early grapes were not able to produce wine. But if the article hasn't cited sources then you are right in deleting the information. However, it would be wrong to move unsourced information over to other articles. STAN</p>

<p>"British ale tends to average 4.4%" Has anyone got a source for this official looking little fact, because I just averaged the first 15 ale bottles from my beer bottle collection and came up with 5.1% abv. Of the 15 only one was below the quoted 4.4% abv, I know its not exactly an exhaustive survey but I would certainly question what is written in the article.--<a href="../../../p/y/p/User%7EPypex_3906.html" title="User:Pypex">Pypex</a> 23:28, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wow, that's really scientific! And you do beer articles? No wonder the beer information on Wiki is so bad. How much do you actually know about British beer? Obviously very little. And your idea of research is to look at 15 beer bottles, when the majority of British ale is consumed in the cask. If you can't do better than that, then perhaps you should give up adding to the beer articles and go do something else. 4.4% is widely considered to be the average. Check out this years GBBF beer list - something a little more comprehensive than a few bottles! STAN</p>
<dl>
<dd>Calm yourself. I qualified my statement by saying 15 bottles is not exactly an extensive survey, but I maintain that you would not expect to come up with such a radically different figure if you picked 15 random bottles / beers hence I questioned the article. But you must remember I said I would question it, I did not say it was wrong.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the bottle cask thing I consume 90% of my beer bottled and I cant exactly walk into the local spar or even a local pub an get cask ale (with the exception of city center weatherspoons), I would assume this is also true of most people. Also my experience of beer festival beer lists is that they are heavily biased towards much stronger beers, with the GBBF being the exception rather than the rule. Regardless of you being right or wrong I suggest you read wikipedias many guidelines and policies and learn to conduct yourself properly before making any furtherer edits, and you may question the quality of my contributions when you have made more than 2 of your own.--<a href="../../../p/y/p/User%7EPypex_3906.html" title="User:Pypex">Pypex</a> 02:29, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>British beers do tend to average around 4.4%. The only British beer festivals where the average would be above 4.4% would be Winter Beer Festivals - which is what Pypex must be thinking of. Cask ales are available in most pubs. Failing that, there are keg ales. 5% is notable as the average strength of pale lager. 5.1% as an average of any sort of British beer - ale, lager, draught or packaged - seems a little high, though as Pypex says the sample was random and non-scientific (and quite possibly totally pointless as a result, but what the heck - each to their own!&#160;:) ). 4.4% is a figure I've heard and read many times. I think it is based on averages of a variety of festivals and samples. It's probably something I added to the article myself. If people feel that it is unscientific, then please just remove it. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 11:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the Statistical Handbook of the British Beer and Pub Association the average strength of all beer sold in the UK was 4.15% in 2002-2003. In 2002, the 58.3% of beer sold in pubs broke down like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mild 1.3%</dd>
<dd>Bitter (up to 4.1% ABV) 16.9%</dd>
<dd>Bitter (4.2% ABV and above) 2.9%</dd>
<dd>Stout (which is usually around 4% ABV) 4.2%</dd>
<dd>Lager (up to 4.2% ABV) 24.7%</dd>
<dd>Lager (above 4.3% ABV) 8.4%.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I reckon this puts the average strength of British ale definitely below 4.4% ABV, probably 4% ABV at most.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose it depends on how you look at the statement. Beer 1 is 4.1%, Beer 2, 3, 4 and 5 are 4.4%, beer 6 is 4.7% - this gives a nice average of 4.4%. However - Beer 1 accounts for 80% of volume, so the most beer sold in the UK would be 4.1%, even though the average of beers made in the UK are 4.4%. As there is some uncertainty here, the statement probably needs deleting. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 11:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The average strength given for Belgian beer - 8% abv - is also way out. 70% of beer sold in Belgium is Pils of around 5% abv. Only about 11% of sales in Belgium is of the stronger types - Trappist, Abbey and Strong Golden. These are the official figures from the Belgian brewers´ organisation. You can find them here: <a href="http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=630#Table_3" class="external free" title="http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=630#Table_3" rel="nofollow">http://www.beerparadise.be/emc.asp?pageId=630#Table_3</a></p>

<dd>The above comments on the British average of 4.4% apply here as well. It depends on how the statement is viewed - volume sales, or brand ales. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 11:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally find the concept of "average strength" of beers to be rather dubious, at least if you're talking about all beers. It does make some sense to talk in terms of average strength of a particular beer style, but there are many diverse styles of beer. To lump Classic Pilsener, barley wine, abbey ale, American light lager, and Irish stout together in this manner feels meaningless and indiscriminate. --<a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalimu59_7f54.html" title="User:Mwalimu59">Mwalimu59</a> 14:30, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. The whole concept of trying to average things is fraught with difficulties - and is easily misunderstood. While a statement can be made that an average strength of beer which includes the higher strengths and lower strengths and all the various colours and hopping levels may indicate an overall average, there are specific beers to which the average does not apply. Same as average height, average intelligence, etc. There are a variety of people around the world, and Asian people tend to be shorter than Scandinavian people, etc. I suppose in a sense global averages tend to sweep away distinctive characteristics of individuals and groups of individuals. It might be worth considering if averages serve any purpose at all. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 11:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must say I agree! 'Dark' is not a style of beer it is a characteristic. There are fantastic simple texts on beer that could be referenced to create a list of styles.

<dd>That's fine. This was not meant as a "comply or die" message in the least. Just a notice that (at that point, since the controversy had not happened), that the state of the good articles requirements changed, and that reviewers were looking at the existing GAs and re-reviewing them. It was the hope that a notice of the changes in rules would stop the shock of learing that an otherwise good article was being re-reviewed (and in some cases) delisted. The time period was to keep reviewers from delisting them before the article was given a fair chance to adapt, not as a line in the sand to the editors.</dd>

<dd><i>Cask- and bottle-conditoned beers are unfiltered and unpasteurised, and the beer contuinues to mature after it leaves the brewery. This provides a much more varied taste, even from barrel to barrel and bottle to bottle. However, the lack of standardisation, shorter shelf life, and the extra care required by the cellarperson was a key factor in the drive by big breweries to look for a cheaper option - the "keg" beers sterilised in the brewery and artificially-livened by extra carbon dioxide and chilling. Led by such organisations as the UK's <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign_for_Real_Ale_e070.html" title="Campaign for Real Ale">Campaign for Real Ale</a>, many consumers reacted to the change, and caused a revival in "live" beer production, particularly by smaller breweries. In the US and UK it is now not difficult to find cask-conditioned or bottle-conditoned beers, and in France, Belgium and Holland, there was perhaps never any danger of losing them. In the US, ther term "cask" beer is used - but it is the conditioning not the container that determines the quality of the beer; for instance, in the UK, keg beers and cask-conditioned beers will arrive at the pub in identical aluminium kegs.</i></dd>

<p>I would like to edit the section on strength to read as follows. Please offer suggestions and objections here. (This is a pretty significant overhaul of the strength section, so I don't want to do it without running it by people first.) I would also like to change the section title to "Alcoholic Strength", since "strength" is a bit coloquial. Other title suggestions are welcome.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The content of alcohol in beer is less than that of wine or distilled spirits. Beer ranges from less than 3% alcohol by volume (ABV) to over 12% ABV. Particular styles of beer have a range of alcoholic strength that is common for them; pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4-6%. Some exceptional beers have reached over 20% ABV, however, this is not typical of any style of beer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The alcohol in beer comes from the fermentation of sugars that are produced during mashing. The quantity of sugar in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Most of the sugar is derived from the process of mashing, however, sugar is sometimes added directly to the wort. Other ingredients in beer have no effect on the quantity of alcohol in the beer.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I like this better than the previous section because it focuses on general facts rather than minutia that look like a Guiness Book of Records entry.

<p>The article is in British English. For consistency the whole article should be in British English. The guideline is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Mistakes will happen. However, corrections back into British English should not be reverted. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 18:59, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the 1st two images, Dutch_beers.jpg &amp; Cask_Ales.jpg are not of higher quality as an article of this nature should contain. 1) Images only shows Dutch beers, it should be collection of world's beers, at least beers from a variety of major/traditional beer producing regions. 2) the background is not that atheistically pleasing. 3) Is not set in a table or in a bar.</p>
<p>The second images, just seems to be happy snap of one the authors who happens to be drinking beer. Sure the author might have done good work in contributing towards the article, but that pic should not be in there.</p>
<p>The pic should be replaced w/ pic of beer (glass &amp; bottle etc) or show people drinking beer at a pub/bar (not the bar's basement) etc.</p>
