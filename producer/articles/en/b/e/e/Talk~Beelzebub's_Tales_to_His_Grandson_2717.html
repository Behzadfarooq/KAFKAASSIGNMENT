<p>I'm unclear as to the usage of 'firewall' toward the top of the article. None of the links on the firewall disambiguation page clarify it for me... Could someone explain this to me or correct it? --<a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJECompton_af90.html" title="User:JECompton">JECompton</a> 07:29, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I expect (I did not write the entry) that the term 'firewall' refers to a secondary function of the text; a means to separate those Gurdjieff considered not prepared or unfit for 'the work' and more likely to be a unrepaid expense of energy than an aid or example.</p>
<p>The text is long (more than 1000 pages) and complex by current fiction standards. If someone showed up at his door who did not 'have something to offer' he could simply point them to the book and say 'come back when you are done (with the three prescribed readings)'. Should they return they would have to demonstrate their mastery of the material. Rise and repeat until the unsuitable become suitable or seek attention elsewhere and go away.</p>
<p>Thus 'Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson' is a firewall performing a separating function in either the construction or networking sense. The comment acts as a nice and understandable shorthand for some but is not helpful for most. I expect it should be made clearer for the general reader. Or not, and let the comment perform a similar function. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETino_Myan_7f84.html" title="User:Tino Myan">Tino Myan</a> 21:02, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>BorgQueen, I appreciate your clearing up on this article, as well I saw your request to have this article improved. What exactly did you have in mind? <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeuio_459b.html" title="User:Aeuio">Aeuio</a> 01:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well I wouldn't insist to nominate this article for FA if you are concerned that it might attract wrong attentions, but if the article gets improved enough, sooner or later someone will eventually come and nominate it, even if I do not. I would say it is better if we go through the process while you are here, rather than someone with far less discretion does it in a distant future, because you might not be around then. I sympathize with your concern and I do respect others' spiritual beliefs/philosophical thoughts, but, here in Wikipedia, we all live in glass houses. As soon as an article is created here, its privacy is over. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 04:12, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Alright, since you know wikipedia far better than me we'll give it a try. Although, I still believe that this article won't become FA due to one reason, and that's the book's plot. There's no way that it could be properly summarized in one article (I suppose that therefore we have to give a more broad overview).</dd>
<dd>So, can you give me some instructions on what would improve this article and what parts you feel should be improved. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeuio_459b.html" title="User:Aeuio">Aeuio</a> 14:22, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that we could write a broad description of the book's content. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Illuminatus%21_Trilogy_d8ab.html" title="The Illuminatus! Trilogy">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a></i> gives a good sample format, especially since it also does not have a conventional plot but the the contributors managed to describe its contents. And we could include the "characters" section like the site you recommended, although we obviously should not copy the site verbatim, for the copyright reason.</p>
<p>I think <i>Beelzebub's Tales</i> is a truly monumental work with a power to influence its readers' mind, whether positively or negatively, depending on each reader (if they are willing to work through the dense, obscure allegories, of course). I was hooked up with the work, actually by the Theta-Delta allegory. Gurdjieff tells in the book that the Greeks assigned the letter Theta with a Holy nature and Delta with an evil one (I am only quoting from memory, so the exact words might not be accurate) since Theta was the beginning of the word <i>Theos</i> (God) and Delta <i>Daimonos</i> (Daimon). I have always been fascinated with <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isopsephy.html" title="Isopsephy">isopsephy</a>, or Greek Qabalah, and that was an interesting viewpoint to look at the Greek letters. Perhaps Gurdjieff meant entirely different things in this allegory and I wasn't acquainted enough with his works to figure it out, but that was the start anyway.</p>
<p>There is no need to hurry - and Gurdjieff certainly wouldn't want us to&#160;:-D We can slowly start by creating the characters section, and it will be desirable to include what others like Martin Seymour-Smith said about the book, if we can find any. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 21:29, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I began to improve the article and to add details. The Summary section is going to have to be rewritten (I didn't focus on it now).</dd>
<dd>As for the Delta-Theta that you were talking about, besides of the history of the Greek letters which you mentioned, that's where it was being explained how the human pronunciation capabilities degenerated from hundreds of sounds to only thirty today. And the fact that Russians(I think) have huge trouble pronouncing the sounds theta and delta when they learn the English language. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeuio_459b.html" title="User:Aeuio">Aeuio</a> 22:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote the characters section and I think that it is fine the way it is. (Just in case you are wandering, I would be very against creating separate pages for the characters. As Gurdjieff went to great lengths to harden the book I would be opposed to making public summaries on it (if the other site already didn't do what it did I wouldn't have even done this) - if you weren't thinking of that then nevermind my comment). Although I'd be fine with writing some of the minor ideas of the book I would not go into much detail. I don't mean to be discouraging or mean with this and I hope you don't take it rudely (But I think you already would know this).<a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeuio_459b.html" title="User:Aeuio">Aeuio</a> 02:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh my, I discovered your last comment just now. (And I am really being honest.) I already expanded the characters section a bit, with citations from Sophia Wellbeloved and John Shirley. Is it okay from your viewpoint? The citations I've added are already available publicly, so I don't think it went too far. And no, I am not interested at all in creating any separate page for characters, since I don't think much could be written on them - they will remain as stub and be merged to this article anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I don't think we need a separate plot summary section - the characters section would tell enough. We are not writing a <i>Reader's Digest</i> edition of the Beelzebub book and I do not intend to go into excessive details; this is discouraged in any Wikipedia article. But those commentaries written by Wellbeloved and Shirley can safely be cited, I think. What would you say? I won't insist my view here. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 08:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am perfectly fine with what you did, and I encourage you to do it. That's a great idea to have the plot explanations in the character profile.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One thing tough, I was thinking of putting a section called "Allegorical Meanings", or something similar, where we could site some of the interpretations of Belzebub, Hassein and others (instead of putting them in the profile). But your way looks pretty good too, so I'll leave it up to you in whether we do that or not - I just think that this way some profiles will be a lot larger than others. And thanks for your contributions. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeuio_459b.html" title="User:Aeuio">Aeuio</a> 16:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think a little more detail on this will be helpful for readers. Why is it considered as a degeneration - a wrong translation, perhaps? And it will be excellent if we could cite a reference for it - specifically, who said it, and where.

<dd>This translated Beelzebub's tales was made after Gurdjieff's death and its purpose was to make the book easier readable and less complicated - which complication Gurdjieff struggled to make. For citation - last paragraph on page 5 [Moveable Feasts" at <a href="http://www.gurdjieff-bibliography.com/Current/20_link-to-pg23.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.gurdjieff-bibliography.com/Current/20_link-to-pg23.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gurdjieff-bibliography.com/Current/20_link-to-pg23.pdf</a>].

<dd>About their etymology - while I am aware that Gurdjieff laughed thinking about those who will conjure up etymologies for his invented words, it seems that he drew inspirations from already existing words in many cases. John Shirley says there are more than six hundreds new words in the book and it will be fascinating to look at their roots. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 01:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As it seems that you are fascinated by those things, I suppose that you are the most suited person to add that stuff in.</dd>

<dd>It is a good idea to explain his teachings and philosophy as long as they are directly relevant to this book. And we could give a brief background on the period of his life when he was writing and revising the book - like they described Hemingway's life in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea_638f.html" title="The Old Man and the Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a></i>, for example. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgQueen_c70e.html" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> 04:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I added the first paragraph of Gurdjieff's article (I think that its pretty good), and moved some content from publishing up. If you think that this should be expanded/changed let me know as I am not sure. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeuio_459b.html" title="User:Aeuio">Aeuio</a> 19:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I glanced through the article and, other for maybe a slight lack of pictures, it's as good as I hoped it would be. I am not willing to go through the FA, but if you are, feel free to do it. And thank you for contributing to this article BorgQueen. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeuio_459b.html" title="User:Aeuio">Aeuio</a> 02:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
