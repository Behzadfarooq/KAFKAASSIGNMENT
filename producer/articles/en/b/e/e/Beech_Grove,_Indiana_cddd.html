<p>Beech Grove is located at <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latitude.html" title="Latitude">latitude</a> 39°43'4" North, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longitude.html" title="Longitude">longitude</a> 86°5'29" West (39.717677, -86.091308).<sup id="fn_GR1_back"><a href="../../../g/e/o/Wikipedia%7EGeographic_references_2b06.html#1" title="Wikipedia:Geographic references">GR1</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Census_Bureau_2c85.html" title="United States Census Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the City has a total area of 11.1 <a href="../../../k/m/%C2%B2/Km%C2%B2.html" title="Km²">km²</a> (4.3 <a href="../../../s/q/u/Square_mile.html" title="Square mile">mi²</a>), all land.</p>
<p>The City's elevation, measured in feet above sea level, ranges from 766 (the Beech Creek waterway, where it is crossed by South 9th Avenue) to 845 (the northeastern portion of the <a href="../../../a/m/t/Amtrak.html" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> railroad property). It is higher than that of downtown <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis.html" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>.</p>
<p>The City contains several small non-navigable waterways. Beech Creek, McFarland Creek, Pullman Creek and Victory Run all feed into Lick Creek, which (after leaving the City limits) feeds into the West Fork of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_River_%28Indiana%29_3664.html" title="White River (Indiana)">White River</a>.</p>
<p>The City is located within parts of four of Marion County's townships. In order of City land size, those townships are Perry, Franklin, Center, and Warren. (In order of City population, the list is Perry, Center, and Franklin; the Warren Township section is uninhabited railroad land.)</p>
<p>The City is one of three towns/cities in the United States with this name. The other two are in <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. There is also a town in <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> which has the name as one word ("Beechgrove").</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beech_Grove%2C_Indiana_cddd.html" title="Edit section: Transportation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
<p>The City has direct access to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Highway_System_c11a.html" title="National Highway System">U.S. Interstate Highway System</a> as it straddles Exit 52 of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_465.html" title="Interstate 465">Interstate 465</a>. It is served by local public bus routes of Indianapolis's IndyGo system. There is no current light-rail or streetcar service, although both systems existed in the past.</p>
<p>Beech Grove maintains a distinct address-numbering system from nearby Indianapolis. Addresses are numbered as either East/West or North/South from the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue.</p>
<p>The City's street grid reflects two distinct urban planning styles. The original roadway connecting Beech Grove to Indianapolis was Churchman Avenue, running northwest from Beech Grove. The "original" City was built to the north of Churchman Avenue, on a north/south "grid" pattern with alleys, centered on the widened roads of Main Street and Fifth Avenue. While a parkway was planned for both sides of Lick Creek, only a small segment of it was actually established.</p>
<p>With the post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> "<a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Boom_fc74.html" title="Baby Boom">Baby Boom</a>" population growth, new streets were built south of Churchman Avenue in the modern style of sweeping curves and "cul-de-sacs".</p>
<p>The growth of Indianapolis toward Beech Grove, and the distinctness of both cities, led to the unusual result of different names for certain roadways. Indianapolis's Troy Avenue becomes Beech Grove's Albany Street; Indianapolis's Sherman Drive becomes Beech Grove's 17th Avenue; and Indianapolis's Emerson Avenue becomes (in places) Beech Grove's 1st Avenue.</p>

<p>Although geographically completely surrounded by <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis.html" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, Beech Grove maintains its own police, fire, public works, and parks departments and operates its own public library and senior-citizens' center.</p>
<p>Beech Grove's government was first organized as a "Town Board" system on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>. The system remained until <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, consisting of three elected Ward representatives and a Clerk-Treasurer. From <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, Board members were elected as representatives of locally-organized political parties (e.g., Progressive, Citizens' Ticket, Peoples' Ticket).</p>
<p>Upon legally becoming an Indiana Fifth-Class City in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, its first Mayor and four City Council members were elected (three District members, and one at-large). Beech Grove achieved Indiana Fourth-Class City status in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. The present City Council consists of five District members and two at-large members, plus an elected Clerk-Treasurer.</p>

<p>The City Flag was not adopted until the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, when a competition was held in which citizens were invited to submit designs. The winning designer was Mike Hart. The flag features an orange, black and white logo on a blue field; the logo shows the profile of an old-style railroad locomotive, in orange, with a white circle superimposed in the center. The circle contains a depiction of the tower complex of St. Francis Hospital, and bears the name of the City, the year "<a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>" and the motto "Where Tradition Welcomes Progress".</p>

<p>The City has its own school district, the Beech Grove City Schools, consisting of five facilities (Hornet Park; Central Elementary; South Grove Intermediate; Beech Grove Middle; and Beech Grove High). Its high-school athletic teams, the "Hornets" (colors: orange and black) participate as members of the statewide Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA), the Marion County Athletic Association and the Indiana Crossroads Conference.</p>
<p>The City's first school was opened in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a> in the upstairs of the Wheat Grocery Store at 423 Main Street. Between <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, a series of school buildings and additions were built on the 1000 block of Main; only the original Gymnasium remains from these structures. The High School was begun in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> and its first graduating class was in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>.</p>
<p>A new combined Junior-High/High School was built in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> at 1248 Buffalo Street, just northwest of the existing school site. The previous complex became Central Elementary. The new facility operated on a split-day schedule, with High School students attending in the morning and Junior High School students attending in the afternoon.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, the City's growth to the south prompted the building of South Grove Elementary (later Intermediate) at the 800 block of South 9th Avenue. With the population growth, the present High School was built in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> just east of the 4000 block of South Emerson Avenue and the 1955 facility remained as the Junior High (later Middle) School.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, the Kindergarten education experience was only offered in the City by private specialty schools (past examples being Cassidy's and Happy Time). As part of the State trend to incorporate this age level within the public schools, the City Schools joined with the City's Parks Department in the development of Hornet Park, a dual-use facility built on the grounds of the former Olympia Club (a private swimming/recreation club). Kindergarten (and, added recently, 1st-Grade) classes are held in the south part, while the City offers meeting rooms and exercise facilities in the north part.</p>
<p>At different times in the City Schools' history, certain grade-levels have been moved between schools. 9th-graders were moved from High School to Junior High School from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. 6th-graders were in Elementary School until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, when they were moved to Middle School level, but were returned to the Elementary level in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.</p>
<p>Also within the City limits are the Holy Name Of Jesus School (<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a>, grades 1 to 8 only), built in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, and the Nazarene Christian School (independent Nazarene). Many students from Holy Name Of Jesus continue their high-school studies at Beech Grove High School or the nearby Roncalli High School.</p>

<p>Beech Grove's oldest Churches have existed since the earliest days of the City. Father Peter J. Killian established the Blessed Sacrament Parish (<a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>) in the upstairs of his home in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>; its present name of Holy Name Of Jesus Parish was taken in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>. A Methodist Episcopal meeting in the Clapp family home in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> eventually led to the present Beech Grove <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Methodist_e7f9.html" title="United Methodist">United Methodist</a> Church. A noon-time Christian men's meeting of "Big Four" railroad employees in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a> was the genesis of the present Beech Grove Christian Church. In late <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, the First Baptist Church (since <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Association_of_Regular_Baptist_Churches_475f.html" title="General Association of Regular Baptist Churches">General Association of Regular Baptist Churches</a>) was organized and is now in its second location within the City.</p>

<p>By the turn of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_9dae.html" title="20th Century">20th Century</a>, the Beech Grove area was a rural section of Indiana's Marion County. Notable residents included poet and women's-rights activist Sarah Tittle (Barrett) Bolton (<a href="../../../1/8/1/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a>–<a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>), and Indianapolis financier Francis McClintock Churchman (<a href="../../../1/8/3/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a>–<a href="../../../1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>).</p>
<p>Bolton's farm, "Beech Bank" and Churchman's cattle farm, "Beech Grove Farm", both reflected the abundance of <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beech.html" title="Beech">beech</a> trees in this area. This would eventually provide the reason for the city's name, although an early railroad stop in the area was known as "Ingallstown". The city's Sarah T. Bolton Park, situated on some of the former Beech Bank farmland, still contains several large beech trees along its southern boundary.</p>
<p>The actual City came into existence as a 'company town' for a new railroad repair facility constructed by the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Cincinnati%2C_Chicago_and_St._Louis_Railroad_71a9.html" title="Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad">Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad</a> (nicknamed the "<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Four_315c.html" title="Big Four">Big Four</a>"). Through acquisitions and mergers over the years, the railroad "shops" have been run by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Central_1d72.html" title="New York Central">New York Central</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penn_Central_9184.html" title="Penn Central">Penn Central</a> and, presently, <a href="../../../a/m/t/Amtrak.html" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> rail systems. Although Beech Grove was incorporated in late <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>, it did not see rapid growth until the completion of the railroad facility in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>; by July <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>, for example, there were only four homes and two businesses in place.</p>
<p>Beech Grove grew with two annexations after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, with the final one (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>) taking place just before the Uni-Gov legislation which merged <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis.html" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> with most of the rest of Marion County, preventing future annexation.</p>
<p>Two famous actors have listed Beech Grove as their birthplace—<a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifton_Webb_2b87.html" title="Clifton Webb">Clifton Webb</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>–<a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>) and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_McQueen_1568.html" title="Steve McQueen">Steve McQueen</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">March 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>–<a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>). Webb was born before Beech Grove came into existence as a separate entity, while McQueen was born at the City's St. Francis Hospital. Both moved away from the area while they were still infants; neither one grew up or lived in Beech Grove.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, Beech Grove received the honor of a visit by a sitting <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_S._Truman_d2df.html" title="Harry S.

<p>Within the traditional focus in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a> on high-school basketball, the Beech Grove Hornets have earned one IHSAA State Championship--that of its girls' team, in Class 3A of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> tournament. From that team, senior Katie Gearlds won both the IHSAA's Patricia Roy Mental Attitude Award (for Class 3A) and the "Miss Basketball" honor for the entire State. She went on to be a 4-year starter for <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purdue_University_4925.html" title="Purdue University">Purdue University</a> from <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. During the single-class years before <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, the school had earned only three "Sectional" (first-round) titles (two by the boys' team, one by the girls' team).</p>
<p>The Hornets' most consistent State-level athletic success has come in wrestling, in which five students have won a total of seven Individual State titles (Ralph Edwards and Gary Pierson in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, Ethan Harris in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Danny Coyne in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, and a three-year unbeaten run by Steven Bradley from <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>). The <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> wrestling team endured the closest-ever runner-up finish in IHSAA wrestling history, ending up a half-point behind <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomington%2C_Indiana_e573.html" title="Bloomington, Indiana">Bloomington</a>. 59 Hornet wrestlers have qualified for the IHSAA State Finals (with several appearing two, three or four times), winning 55 placement medals. Also, in swimming, Andy McVey won two IHSAA individual titles in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, setting State records for that time; he had come back from being "false-started" out of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> finals, in which he had been favored to win.</p>
<p>Beech Grove High School's "Marching Hornets" band program has earned two Indiana State Music Association (ISMA) State Band Finals berths in its history, during the long service of former director James Williams. The present band, directed by alumnus Cory Wynn, has sought to return to that level of success, earning their first ISMA Regional Gold rating in nine years in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Some Beech Grove streets have been named in honor of notable citizens, such as Byland Drive (Mayor Richard Byland); Fletcher Lane (former Fire Chief, City Councilman and business owner Robert Fletcher); Killian Drive (Father Peter Killian); Newcomer Lane (Town Board member and businessman W. S. Newcomer); and Ticen Street (Town Board member Willard Ticen). A quartet of parallel streets in the northern part are named, in alphabetical order from south to north, for the cities of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany%2C_New_York_1b4f.html" title="Albany, New York">Albany</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Ohio_cd1a.html" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>.
