<p>I don't mean to sound like a nutjob, but you are greatly dimishing the severity of the US border being closed to Canadian beef, from a cow that had BSE that was from America. "Briefly closed" is an insult. It was closed for a good long while, really hurting the Canadian beef industry. Might I suggest someone make some changes to that?</p>

<p>This article is slanted a bit toward a meat-eater's point of view, and some mention should be made of the health risks of beef consumption.

<dd>I don't think the article is slanted as-is. I think your concerns are quite valid, particularly as regards the horrible reality of the mass production of beef, but I think that sort of thing should be covered in articles about modernized agriculture and/or vegetarianism. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeeves_f660.html" title="User:Jeeves">Jeeves</a> 01:36, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Be sure to thoroughly document the horrible cruelty that cattle are subjected to and don't just pick a few isolated incidents. For an article more to your liking see <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_farming.html" title="Factory farming">Factory farming</a>. In my experience, most of a cow's life is rather quiet and boring. Animals that are under constant stress do not gain well and get sick easily. Livestock producers have a vested interest in keeping their animals healthy and as stress free as is practical. Of course there are a few bad apples as in any industry, but don't fall victim to propaganda. And of course there are health risks from eating too much high fat food, but lean beef is very healthy. A little beef in moderation isn't going to hurt you. <a href="../../../h/2/o/User%7EH2O_a495.html" title="User:H2O">H2O</a> 06:35, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Edit - I actually was thinking on adding a large section on nutritional information, which would be a substantial addition, but I'm not sure when I'll get to it. It would certainly be better to be more specific, i.e. address the amount of saturated fat in beef, than to write simply that eating beef is associated with increased risk of heart disease, etc., because this is a characteristic shared by many foods rather than specific to this food source. Plus, there are positive nutritional benefits to beef, especially the bioavailability of its iron content.</dd>

<dd>You're probably right about it belonging in Wiktionary, but part of the concept of "beef" comes from its other-than-meat related uses in English. I think it's, er, <b>neat</b> that the word pops up so often in various idioms. I added a brief "usage" section at the end of the main article on beef in the Enlgish language. I was a little surprised that someone removed my phrase "who beefed?" in relation to flatulence - the edit was described as "spurious" slang. Spurious mainly means false, and I think most Americans would agree they've come across the phrase at least once in their lives. Maybe I'm crazy and it's just a New York thing - but then the Brits have a rhyming slang for the exact same act ("beef-heart"). I know flatulence (notice how I don't call it by the four-letter common name) is kinda gross, but <i>spurious</i>? A quick web search will produce at least three slang sites with the phrase. But hey, if people want to delete the usage section because it's not about meat, I'm cool with that. I'm still trying to feel the whole wikipedia vibe and put out interesting facts. I just wanted to spread the love about beef in our rich, meaty language. -- Thesmokingmonkey 29JUN05</dd>

<p>The article says, <i>"Beef is meat obtained from a <a href="../../../b/o/v/Bovine.html" title="Bovine">bovine</a>"</i>. The term bovine means a large group of related animals, including yak and buffalo. This can be most easily seen by clicking on the <a href="../../../b/o/v/Bovine.html" title="Bovine">bovine</a> link in Wikipedia&#160;:) Is the meat from this entire subfamily of animals called "beef", or is that reserved for meat from domesticated cattle <i>Bos taurus</i>? I know, for example, that meat from the American bison is popular in some parts of the US, and is not referred to as "beef", but as "buffalo meat" (though I have heard "beefalo" before). This may be just a marketing gimmick, since cattle meat is generally higher in fat than bison meat, or it may actually be incorrect to call bison meat "beef". Does anyone know?</p>

<p>I would like to add an additional defintion to beef but it keeps getting reverted. This is the definition:</p>
<p>Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep. Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets. Beef is when I see you guaranteed to be an ICU. Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep. Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep. Beef is when I see you guaranteed to be an ICU.</p>

<dd>The reason it keeps getting reverted is because it violates Wikipedia rules.</dd>

<p>Maybe something about why US Beef is banned in the EU can be added. I tried to find something by googling but failed. 82.152.179.226 19:57, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's politics as usual. I don't know what the current excuse is, but obviously the EU is protecting the local farmers from competition. The US does it too. Japan certainly does. China does. Well gee, can you name a place that isn't pulling this kind of stunt? Peanuts, sugar, steel, rice, cars, corn syrup, aircraft, gambling, ethanol... whatever it is, there are countries adding tariffs and pointless restrictions to exclude competition. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertCahalan_d719.html" title="User:AlbertCahalan">AlbertCahalan</a> 03:02, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The temps for grilling are way off. 300F is closer to smoking than grilling with temps of far greater than 650 being needed to actually sear.</p>

<p>An article on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_steak.html" title="Prime steak">Prime steak</a> has been created. The article provides no sources for the information, and at its core, it is a duplication of the USDA beef grades section in <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">Beef</a> It would seem that merging whatever is in there to the grade seciton makes more sense than a separate article on the prime grade. And even the, the name of the article is probably wrong as it really should be prime grade beef (not steak) -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 19:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Proposal that this section be removed into a separate article, or possibly deleted.</p>
<p>This does not belong in a Wikipedia article on beef. If a word has two meanings, and both are deserving of encyclopedia articles, then you need two different articles and a disambiguation page. Further, the discussion of cockney slang probably does not belong anywhere except an article on cockney slang.</p>
<p>I realize that it is hard sometimes to see that interesting subject matter does not belong in Wikipedia. I've gotten to edit my own articles because of this. But that's the rule.

<p>The cited reference does not agree with the "updated" information. The updated information was also useless because it didn't specify the initial conditions of the meat, or the size of the cut being cooked.

<p>Hi, I was just checking the USA grading system of beef - This is currently what it looks like.</p>
<p>Prime — most tender and highest in fat. Currently, only two percent of the steaks sold are USDA certified Prime. Choice</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://kyanelaut8227.googlepages.com/home" class="external free" title="http://kyanelaut8227.googlepages.com/home" rel="nofollow">http://kyanelaut8227.googlepages.com/home</a> Go There!</p>
<p>Select — the leanest grade commonly sold Standard</p>
<p>and then it goes on. What is the kyanelaut8227 link doing there? I have attempted to remove it but does not show up within the editor? Why/how has that happened?</p>
<p>EDIT: It has now gone - I dont know why or how. It doesn't even appear in my offline history... anybody shed any light?</p>

<dd>Even though wikipedia is not a cookbook, I think in an article about a certain type of food, it's reasonable to have information on how it is generally cooked. Perhaps we should include a link to beef recipes in the wiki cookbook (since actual recipes do not belong in an encylopedia.)--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendlefuzz_74b0.html" title="User:Grendlefuzz">Grendlefuzz</a> 14:38, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>beef can be cooked in a million different ways. maybe if this was article about cooking beef it would fly, but its not. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 17:36, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
