<p>Good afternoon, John. You are right that the honeybee page was linked above. Probably should delete the redundant link. I don't like leaving the "Diseases of the Honeybee" as a dead link, though. I am becoming more and more fond of a separate and expanded article on Diseases of the Honeybee. Let's make your link real. Unfortunately, I don't think I know enough about all the diseases to put something together without risking the breaking of a copyright. Can/will you take a crack at it?</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 22:25 May 6, 2003 (UTC) Good afternoon, John. You also added links to <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell.html" title="Cell">cell</a>. When I clicked through it, I saw a number of definitions, none of which really seemed to apply to the cells in a beehive. When I checked the links to <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female.html" title="Female">female</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male.html" title="Male">male</a>, they were just definitions.</p>
<p>I see limited value to creating links to a definition rather than to a substantive article. What I remember of the Wikipedia rules seemed to reinforce that point. Frankly, when I need to check a definition, the freeware program Atomica works better than using Wikipedia to duplicate a dictionary. It's a philosophical point and if you feel strongly that the links add value, I'll concede.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can see some possible value for <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male.html" title="Male">male</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female.html" title="Female">female</a>, especially if those articles might be improved in the future (though I must admit, I've been known to change links to reflect what's there at the moment, too), but yes, I could certainly live without those. As for <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell.html" title="Cell">cell</a>, I figured that would be an issue while I was linking it, and I was thinking it might be best disambiguated somehow, even if that did leave it linked to a nonexistent page, but I wasn't sure how. Cell (honeybee)? Cell (honeycomb)? Cell (bee)? Etc. So I decided to just leave it at <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell.html" title="Cell">cell</a> for the time being.</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Diseases_of_the_honeybee.html" title="Diseases of the honeybee">diseases of the honeybee</a> (caps or not?), tracheal mites are about the only ones I'm familiar with, and that only from an apiarist's point of view (which basically amounts to "mites <b>BAD!</b>"&#160;;), not a biologist's. So I couldn't do much there without considerable boning up. But leaving some nonexistent links isn't a bad thing, it encourages the creation of new articles, which can (almost) only be a good thing.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 22:43 May 6, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This colony of bees in South Tampa, Florida took up residence in a bird house. I have observed bees in bird houses on three occations. As the colony grows it produces new queens and when space is limited the colony simply divides. A colony will divide many times in a year when the cavity they have nested in is small.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a section on the aerodynamics of bees in flight. On Sunday <a href="../../../b/e/e/Image%7EBee_mid_air.jpg_a059.html" title="Image:Bee mid air.jpg">Image:Bee mid air.jpg</a> is due to be the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Picture of the day|Picture of the Day</a>. However, at the moment I'm not too happy with the caption as it is a bit too general.</p>
<p>When I was at college, I recall hearing the adage that "aerodynamically, bees can't fly" and it seems to be one of those ideas that persists despite being completely untrue — not only can bees fly, but the aerodynamics of how they fly appears to have been pretty well understood for quite a while. There is a good summary of the problem on <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_045.html" class="external text" title="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_045.html" rel="nofollow">Straight Dope</a>. More recently, I think that some research on <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vortex_street.html" title="Vortex street">Vortex streets</a> has been directed towards the same issue (see for example the last external link there). -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 09:10, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Cuckoo bees are bumblebee look-alikes that invade bumblebee nests and lay their eggs. The bumblebees raise the young as their own. Megachilid bees also have other megachilid Coelioxys bees whose young are placed into the already provisioned nests of these solitary bees.

<p>The article states three facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hives have a population of 40,000 bees or fewer.</li>
<li>The queen lays at least 1000 eggs per day to replenish casualties.</li>
<li>A honey bee lives three months, longer during the winter.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a queen lays 1000 eggs per day; a bee lives three months; and bees die only of natural causes, a hive would have a maximum population of 90,000 bees, more than double the estimated peak hive population.</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations to reconcile these numbers, at least one of which should be further explored to better capture a typical hive's lifecycle. They are, I presume, any combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Daily casualties' includes many hazards that cause premature death.</li>
<li>The queen lays fewer than a thousand eggs per day on average.</li>
<li>There are periods during the summer when the population spikes.</li>
<li>The average bee life span is shorter than three months, and there are periods during the winter with little to no egg laying when bees tend to live closer to their three month maximum life span.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>There is no simple math, as there is considerable variability. Queens lay at the maximum rate in spring during the buildup time, with the peak population occurring at the end of that time. The population may then drop drastically if the hive swarms, but good honeybee management aims to prevent swarming (analagous to having your calves run off to get lost in the woods). For honey production the beekeeper aims to have a very large population of adults and sealed brood at the beginning of the honeyflow, but of course no swarming. The queens can then cut back on egg laying, and indeed will be forced to cut back if cells are filled with nectar as quickly as new bees emerge from the cells. If queens are "shut down" by a honey flow, the beekeeper has not placed enough supers and the hive "plugs out" which is also poor beekeeping. At the end of the honeyflow the hive will consist of entirely old (and usually rather mean bees) and the hive population will crash severely. Better management has the queen merely slow down, keeping some young brood coming.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The cycles of queen laying and hive population are quite variable depending on the area, the race of bees, and whether honeyflows come normally or not. Drought, heavy rain, a cold spell, etc, can all have an effect. In some areas a serious honeyflow may only last for a couple weeks out of the entire year, and bees may have a time just maintaining their weight for the rest of the year.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For pollination contracts, beekeepers usually do not produce honey at the same time; indeed a honeyflow can be a problem during pollination. It is desired to have the bees with a pretty good population, but still early enough in the buildup period that there is a lot of open, unsealed brood. This means the bees will be compelled to seek pollen for brood feed, and they will be much more efficient as pollinators. A bee that deliberately is gathering pollen can be as much as ten times more efficient as a pollinator than one that is gathering nectar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is a good beekeeper who knows the cycles well, and plans for his productive periods, to make the most efficient use of the hives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Queens also will greatly reduce laying whenever there is a pollen shortage, there is cooling temperature, or likely as the sun moves lower in the sky with autumn. In colder areas the queen will entirely shut down during early winter and the only bees that carry on are the adults that began the winter season. Winter bees are physiologically different than the bees from the rest of the year, so they do live quite a bit longer. Population may drop quite a bit during winter. The first heavy flight during a warm late winter day may leave a lot of these old bees dead on the snow in front of hives and inexperienced beekeepers may be frightened by the loss. However, usually these are bees that have gone through the winter and have been used up in getting a new cycle started. When they go out to fly, it is simply their final flight and they are dying outside the hive for sanitation. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 21:37, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. They're synonyms when used in this sense. But it's not an obvious synonym so it makes sense to use the words in a way that teach readers how the terms are used. Not sure whay you meant with the second part of your comment (starting BTW:). I have never read that the bees add pollen when capping brood chambers. And neither is completely impervious to air or moisture. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 03:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I greatly appreciate your clarifying, as my native language is not English. Thank you and hope for help in the future&#160;:) As for capping brood cells, I meant it IS "not impervious", otherwise brood would suffocate, of course. That is the purpose of adding pollen to wax. I guess I should give some English-written source but I do not have any within reach. I thought this fact was not controversial and well known. It should be easy findable in any beekeeping textbook (as well as the phenomenon of laying workers&#160;:) Anyway, I will search by myself to cite references asap. <a href="../../../o/l/a/User%7EOlango_2551.html" title="User:Olango">Olango</a><small><a href="../../../o/l/a/User_talk%7EOlango_8994.html" title="User talk:Olango"><i>(talk)</i></a></small> 22:35, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Beard of Bees</i></dd>
<dd><i>The tradition of wearing a 'beard of bees' is one which has been popularised recently, possibly due to the revival in the fortunes of the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a>. Traditionally, the bee beard was formed by placing the queen honeybee in a box, and taping this box to the chin, but in recent years, a pheromone-laced disc is often used instead. The bees will swarm around the queen (or disc) and are shaped into a beard by a <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groomer.html" title="Groomer">groomer</a>.

<p>this line: "annoying or disgusting pests, humans hold bees in high regard, possibly the only insect species to be considered such." seems wrong to me. Humans like butterflys, grasshoppers, ladybugs that I can think of. Dragonflies too. I'm definitely no expert on insects, and maybe all these have solid reasons for exclusion (perhaps grasshoppers aren't so popular in areas of the world that still suffer locust plagues) but it seems untrue and unencyclopedic. --<a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactusnonverbus_68c7.html" title="User:Factusnonverbus">FNV</a> 18:34, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm doing a research project and it is on simple insects, if I end up doing it on bees, I'll post my research findings on here <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPaskari_d99d.html" title="User:Paskari">Paskari</a> 16:27, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Virtually all such research is on <i><a href="../../../a/p/i/Apis_mellifera.html" title="Apis mellifera">Apis mellifera</a></i> - accordingly, if you do wish to post any such information, please do so in (or linked to) the article for that species, and NOT to the "bee" article. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/y/a/User%7EDyanega_f44b.html" title="User:Dyanega">Dyanega</a> 18:41, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would it be more accurate to say that bees and wasps share the same evolutionary link, instead of saying, "The oldest bee fossil, of the genus Melittosphex, is 100 million years old and supports the theory that bees evolved from wasps [1]"? BTW, I just checked the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wasp.html" title="Wasp">wasp</a> site, noticing it has nothing about its evolution. Looks like it could use some work. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Pearson_1357.html" title="User:Brian Pearson">Brian Pearson</a> 01:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think what the former phrase is saying is that wasps came first, whereas your proposed change suggests bees and wasps had a common ancestor. I support the former phrase, as per the new DNA findings. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 05:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wasps are not a single lineage. "Wasp" is an artificial term for an artifical grouping - but the insects that bees evolved from were among the wasps. <a href="../../../d/y/a/User%7EDyanega_f44b.html" title="User:Dyanega">Dyanega</a> 19:10, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I heard in a documentary that some bees become notorious drunks and are kept out of the hives by "bee bouncers" until they sober up. When the bees are repeat offenders, the bee bouncers might punish them by chewing their legs off.
