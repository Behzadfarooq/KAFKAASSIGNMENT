<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/e/Beetlejuice_%28TV_series%29_a678.html" title="Edit section: Description of the show">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Description of the show</span></h2>
<p>The premise of the animated series was greatly changed from the film, to the point where one only superficially resembled the other. Where in the film, Beetlejuice is the antagonist who ends up nearly marrying a disgusted Lydia, in the series they are best friends, and Lydia, socially misunderstood in the living world, frequently visits him in the afterlife. The Maitlands, the most significant characters in the film, are nowhere to be found in the series.</p>
<p>One of the most notable stylistic changes was that the unnamed "<a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a> world" from the movie was renamed the "Neitherworld" for the cartoon, and the notion that it was the afterlife was only rarely given an explicit mention on screen. Episodes generally centered around the ghostly con-man Beetlejuice, his best (and only real) friend Lydia, and their adventures together in both the Netherworld and the "real world", a fictional <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> town called Peaceful Pines ("Winter River" in the film). Beetlejuice himself was more or less the same in personality, vulgar and absurdly rambunctious, but not anywhere near to the extent of which he had been presented in the original film. Lydia's character went through comparatively greater change; she became far less "<a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth_subculture.html" title="Goth subculture">goth</a>" than she was portrayed as in the movie and was presented as an upbeat girl who simply liked "weird" things such as spiders and horror movies (although, ironically, she tends to dress more gothically in the show than in the movie.) As in the film, Lydia could summon Beetlejuice out of the Neitherworld (or go there herself) by calling his name three times. The show's humor relied heavily on sight gags and wordplay, some of which was fairly sophisticated for its intended target audience, making it a favorite of a wide range of age groups. Many episodes, especially towards the end of the run, were <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodies</a> of famous films, books, and TV shows.</p>
<p>Throughout the series, Beetlejuice would often try to scam residents of the Netherworld -- and, sometimes, the "real world" as well (Lydia's parents were occasional unwitting victims of his pranks) -- through various means, whether it be via baby-sitting (in which he actually sits on the babies) or trying to beat them in a race. Only Lydia, it seemed, was immune to his tricks; it was explicitly stated at several points that she was the only person Beetlejuice couldn't deceive. It is also revealed that Beetlejuice is afraid of one thing more than anything else: Sandworms. This was hinted at in a single line of dialogue in the movie but expanded on greatly here. They appear as purple and green snake-like creatures with two pairs of eyes on top of each other and stegosaurus-like spines on their backs. Beetlejuice also has a major problem with nice things.</p>
<p>The series was a breakout hit for <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> in its initial season, and later became one of the first animated series to air on <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a>'s weekday afternoon children's lineup. This led to a situation whereby <i>Beetlejuice</i> was being seen Monday through Friday on <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_0a25.html" title="Fox Broadcasting">FOX</a> while still remaining on ABC's Saturday morning schedule, making it one of the few shows in American television history to be aired concurrently on two different broadcast networks. <i>Beetlejuice</i> has aired in re-runs on <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon_%28TV_channel%29_ac4d.html" title="Nickelodeon (TV channel)">Nickelodeon</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Network_8384.html" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a>, and will air on Warner Bros. and <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">AOL</a>'s new broadband internet channel <a href="../../../t/o/o/Toontopia_TV_7f7d.html" title="Toontopia TV">Toontopia TV</a>.</p>

Beetlejuice</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Beetlejuice</b> - The main character of the show. Name is derived from the Latin word "Betelgeuse", which is a transliteration of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> ابط <i>Bait al-Jauza</i>, meaning "armpit" (an <i>extremely</i> ironic turn of phrase, given that one of his favorite pastimes is making farting noises with his armpit). For unexplained reasons, Beetlejuice is virtually the most powerful denizen of the Neitherworld, able to change shape, transform objects, and perform other feats of magic, although his powers can be reduced by various circumstances and at times he must pause to think of exactly how to use his powers to escape a precarious situation unscathed (since Beetlejuice's enemies are almost invariably more intelligent than himself). It is Beetlejuice's power that afford him the (admittedly mostly self-declared) title of "The Ghost With The Most." Because of Beetlejuice's power, almost everyone in the Neitherworld is fair game for his pranks. He expresses his likes and dislikes via variations on a single <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catchphrase.html" title="Catchphrase">catchphrase</a> ala such examples as "<a href="../../../n/e/r/Nerd.html" title="Nerd">Nerd</a> humor...you know <i><b>I</b></i> love it!" or "Sandtraps...you know <i><b>I</b></i> hate 'em!"</li>

<p>Often, when Beetlejuice acts as part of Lydia's life in the living world, he puts on one of three different personas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Betty Juice: Beetlejuice uses this disguise to go to Lydia's school and/or to be with her human friends. In simple terms, he just changes into the same uniform as Lydia's school and styles his hair into a tacky ponytail while speaking with a feminine voice.</li>
<li>Mr. Beetleman (Form 1): Used when he involves himself in some business affair, often with the Deetzes. He pretends to be a jack-of-all-trades and is seen in white and black overalls.</li>
<li>Mr. Beetleman (Form 2): This form is similar to a sideshow host. BJ sports a thin mustache and is usually dressed in a red-white striped shirt, a straw hat, and cape.</li>
<li>Billy Juice: Only was used twice in the show when Beetlejuice wanted to be involved in Lydia's family reunion and when he took advantage of Charles's desire for male bonding. He takes on the form of a little kid and wears a white and black t-shirt.</li>
