<h2><span class="mw-headline">I apologize for a bad impression</span></h2>
<p>Beetstra, sorry that my comments seemed harsh. I welcome you and will do what I can to make your stay enjoyable. I also hardly know anything about machinery of WE, which is populated by some very dedicated folks. The leaders of the chem thing are very knowledgable about chemistry, the computational-informational business, and somehow manage to be nice always. I can only stay with this project for a while longer then I need to slow down. It would be great if you could do anything, including correcting writing or checking odd facts. I agree that the tough part is figuring out which cmpds are important. I dont think that holmium oxide would have rated high on many people's lists, but the organizers were probably aiming for coverage vs importance. Yes, I know, you could ask a thousand chemists and each would give you a different list of what is important. Personally, I have taken the tactic of figuring out which cmpds interest me enough to dig up info. Most of what I do benefits other parts of my life as a chemist. Also it is a hobby. So do let me know if I can do anything to repair my initial bad impression!

<dd>Ditto, I hope I didn't sound unfriendly! I was the person who originally proposed the goals, and I think they help target our efforts, but I would encourage you to work on things that you know about and that you enjoy. We really need every knowledgable chemist we can get, and I think you'll find we're a pretty friendly lot when you get to know us! Feel free to ask for help if you need it.

<p>Apologies accepted, <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a>. In a way you give away the trick to finding 'important' chemicals, is there a way to get the statistics on how often pages in a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Special%7ECategory_2e36.html" title="Special:Category">category</a> (e.g. <a href="../../../o/r/g/Category%7EOrganic_compounds_5518.html" title="Category:Organic compounds">Category:Organic_compounds</a>) are accessed (or better: searched for, but not found)?? That would tell us where the combined effords should lie (pick the highest compound from the list that has your interest). I think that that tactic would be better than (using the same example) putting a single <a href="../../../h/o/l/Category%7EHolmium_compounds_befa.html" title="Category:Holmium compounds">holmium compound</a> in the list. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> 09:44, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you could figure out what chemicals are viewed most often that would be helpful. That's beyond me. Probably something boring like KI.--<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 13:39, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Embargo TiCl3 for 10 days?</span></h2>
<p>Dear Dirk: As a few in the WE-Chem world know, I lead a group of 28 students that write wiki articles. While trying to partially address Wim's and Martin's goals, the course is aimed at training student in learning how to express relatively advanced chemical concepts in words. TiCl3 is one of our assignments - the student Kelly Kohnen is just about to start inserting content (and the semester ends next week). If you can give me and my students one week, then you will find lots of good raw material to refine, correct, beat on, embelish, whatever. Some previous student projects that overlap with your interests include ScCl3, Cp2TiCl2, Tebbe's reagent - you are welcome to work away at these. I have tried to fix some obvious problems but these articles would benefit from your knowledge. ScCl3 is especially awkwardly written. The students tend to be redundant, wordy, avoid meaty topics, and to not include useful references. The full list of my course's assignment is on my talk page. We're also doing Fp2, Ziegler-Natta. Cheers, --<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 17:47, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Smokefoot, I have had a look on the list and adopted some of the pages in my list as well (in general compounds that I have used, which does not mean that I thoroughly know them), stating the embargo as a personal reminder. I will stay away from editing the reserved pages until May 12, 2006. Interesting concept, using Wikipedia as a teaching aid. I presume that the students are chemistry students in university?</dd>
<dd>I am sure the raw material will be of sufficient quality, let me know when the students have finished, I might comment on the inserted material. I will have a look every now and then. Is it OK if I add teasers to the talk-pages? Wish them good luck. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> 18:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, You are welcome to correct things as the students proceed with their projects, but just avoid major edits. These are seniors in chemistry at a big university. Dont get your hopes up, the US chemistry undergraduate degree does not compare favorably with those from Europe - our kids are smart but they just dont know many facts and have little real world exposure. --<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 18:33, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hey Dirk, the student is done with Cp*H - all yours. The only ones we are playing with are on the talkpage and you already have them noted. It would be wonderful to have a real organometallicker "do" Cp*H. --<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 01:03, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Did something with Cp*H and CpH .. and in the meanwhile did something with Cp complexes as well. Especially the latter needs quite some work (the first two can be attacked by an organic chemist, first), but now I am tired, maybe tomorrow .. if I am not too fed up by undergrads showing me a two-layer system in a flask, and asking me if the upper layer is '<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ether_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Ether (disambiguation)">ether</a>' (I guess they mean <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diethyl_ether.html" title="Diethyl ether">diethyl ether</a> .. but how the **** should I know .. it could be anything) .. so I revert to an educational answer: 'what do you <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thought_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Thought (disambiguation)">think</a>?' .. and go back to solving solving the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudoku.html" title="Sudoku">Sudoku</a> in the last <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metro_%28Associated_Metro_Limited%29_4f7d.html" title="Metro (Associated Metro Limited)">Metro (Associated Metro Limited)</a>.</li>

<li>No real time today, sorry. I wanted to watch a movie, and I am tired. Although the demonstrating today was quite relaxing, not too many people around. Only some practical questions. Except for one, who wanted to know all about Co(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and the difference between <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrocene.html" title="Ferrocene">ferrocene</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelocene.html" title="Nickelocene">nickelocene</a>. I guess he should read in <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">Wikipedia</a> more often, especially since he remarked that it was the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Source_of_all_evil.html" title="Source of all evil">Source of all evil</a> (and now I am surprised this page actually exists ... but it is not the page I intended, maybe <a href="../../../r/o/o/Root_of_all_evil.html" title="Root of all evil">this</a> or <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">this</a> comes closer). How do people come up with these ideas, why would the Wikipedia be more evil than any other page on the internet? The information you find <a href="../../../h/e/r/Here.html" title="Here">here</a> (indeed an interesting concept) is also likely to be found outside the Wikipedia!!! But maybe he should now even think about finding the information to fill up the gaps in Wikipedia, since he has to find them for his assignments as well.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">carbene redirects</span></h2>
<p>Hi Dirk, i have noticed you reworked some of the redirects for carbenes. I will try to convince you that the way it was makes sense. Basically information gets destroyed when you change a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persistent_carbene.html" title="Persistent carbene">persistent carbene</a> redirect to a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbene.html" title="Carbene">carbene</a> redirect, In the <i>see also</i> section you would be able to see what other articles are relevant to persistent carbenes (other than carbenes) but not anymore. Also eventually as the number of edits increase persistent carbene is a candidate for splitting off as a separate article and this process is easier when the the new article takes with him the relevant links. I hope I have made myself clear. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../v/8/r/User%7EV8rik_a2ae.html" title="User:V8rik">V8rik</a> 15:25, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Makes sense, did not look at it like that, sorry. As a matter of fact I had thought of separating the persistent carbene/carbenes used as ligands in organometallic chemistry part of the main subject earlier, but found it not big enough (by far) yet. Guess I will have to monitor my own enthousiasm a bit .. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> 16:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On the other hand, one would have to go through the list 'what links here' anyway (and probably even do a search on other pages where the link would be useful), and what to do with the N-Heterocyclic carbenes vs. persistent carbenes (Let's continue this discussion on the talk page of carbenes). (I will put some time in returning some pages back to the state which they had this evening). By the way, I can't find the 'see also' section you mentioned above. <a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> 16:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right, the pages you mention are certainly not stubby anymore (PdCl2 might need some more data, but that will come as people come across that, I hope ..).

But well, I will have a look, I must say, it does point towards some things I did not see myself, and I see how it did it's job, it just takes the pages I have edited sofar, and looks at the pages those pages link to, and sees if there are 'stub', 'expand' marks etc. It might need some reprogramming, I think it should look a couple of levels deeper than that, to get to pages that are not that obvious to reach. And <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expand.html" title="Expand">expand</a> marks should be used with care, some pages just do not have more to tell than only 3 lines.

<dd>I was just starting a similar discussion on your talk-page. But I saw that you already posted something here. There are indeed some things that I feel should be there, and I did not see how to escape us working on the same section. In my opinion there should be information somewhere about having or not having a 'closed shell' (is this indeed a missing subject, it relates to s, p, d, ánd f block .. I saw you wanted to say something about TM; La/Ac; p-block), and the implications thereof. It gives openings to reactivities, para-, ferro- and diamagnetism (are these subjects covered in the Wikipedia?), and it explains the importance of ligands (another opening you introduced). There are some topics, which seem to be scattered around several pages, that might have a better place in their own page (e.g. the explanation of 'η' which was in cyclopentadienyl complex, which I tried to put into <a href="../../../h/a/p/Hapticity.html" title="Hapticity">hapticity</a>). Still some concepts that need explaining, I think.</dd>

<p>Beetstra, no need to move away from the electron counting site. I am done pretty much. The article looks like it is mainly about 18e rule anyway. No reason to start an 18e rule site because the ligand counting rules that you are laying out apply to any scheme. I just did it during my lunch break for relaxation.

<dd>That is my problem with the page, it is practically an <a href="../../../1/8/-/18-electron_rule.html" title="18-electron rule">18-electron rule</a> page, while it should give the rules of electron counting. Therefore I would like to move the 18-electron part into an own page, similar to the octet rule page, and make both pages aware of 'electron counting' (which will be more comprehensive then).

Think of an A-Level student trying to understand Werner's theory - there is almost nothing in the Complex article to help them, even though that topic should clearly be there. Think of an undergrad struggling with inorganic, trying to understand how to count electrons in complexes - <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrocene.html" title="Ferrocene">ferrocene</a> is not a simple example for a beginner. I would use something like Cr(CO)<sub>6</sub>, then move on to Fe(NH3)6<sup>2+</sup>, then do ferrocene. Wikipedia is not a textbook, so the article shouldn't just be a list of examples, but many people reading Wikipedia are students who are looking for examples to help them learn. Thanks for all your work on those pages, the 18e rule is one of my favourite things from inorganic chem (just read any of my transition metal compound articles, you'll see I overuse it!!)

M-NO2 is an excellent ligand, and I think more common. <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_cobaltinitrite.html" title="Sodium cobaltinitrite">[Co(NO2)6]3-</a> is a standard species, I think. Yes, you're probably correct that the O-bonded isomer is weaker field. You have possibly seen the rxn of OH- with linear MNO, which reminds me that one could add a section on reactions of coordinated ligands. But again, this is a topic of almost infinite scope (most of catalysis for example). Changing the subject, some reason, many people are under the impression that CN is ambidentate, but it isnt (IMHO). There are zero examples of M-NC complexes unless a proton or another M is sitting on the C. B-NC/B-CN and Si-CN/Si-CN I have seen, but not M-NC. Keep up the good work.--<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 00:06, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&gt;Dear Peter, I still have the 'dispute' about the chemical suppliers in the back of my head.</p>
<dl>
<dd>-)</dd>
</dl>
<p>&gt; What do you think about the following suggestion (and the accompanying .. 'yes, but how?'): Would it be an idea to make a page comparable to the ISBN search engine (e.g. Special:Booksources&amp;isbn=0002570122)</p>
<p>This didn't work for me - but I guess the idea is that there is an ISBN resolver.</p>
<p>&gt; working on the CAS number. Such a page could contain an infinite list with suppliers, making the data easily accessible, as well as (and probably more important) searches into many other search-engines. As announced, if the answer to this question is 'yes!' .. how are special pages made (I saw you are into cheminformatics .. hope I am asking the right person)? --Dirk Beetstra 07:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a good idea but it won't work&#160;:-(. All CAS numbers are copyright CAS and an authoritative search for *one* costs USD 5.80 last time I looked. I do not approve of some of CAS's policies, especially their attempt to close down PubChem - and I'm no public record. Because I work closely with IUPAC I am evangelising the IUPAC <a href="../../../i/n/c/InChI_a1b9.html" title="InChI">InChI</a> which is free of restrictions and does not depend on an authority. I would be keen to see InChI used for structure and substructure searches in WP.</p>
<p>I'm excited abou WP - unfortunately chemists as a whole are very conservative and most instinctively disapprove of something that free and created by volunteers. But we shall win through. I can see WP Chem becoming standard in undergraduate courses in a few years.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the watching (and correcting) eye. I know that, and that indeed gives a list, but somehow that does not work in <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a>. That's where I would like to see it. There is a work-around .. just put a nonsense-category in the template, wait for a moment, create a list in AWB from the nonsense-category (which does not actually exist, but pages about chemicals have them as a redlink for that moment), and remove the nonsense-category again.</dd>
<dd>I think, by the way, that the problem is at another level, many, many pages about chemicals are either not categorised, or not completely catagorised, I think I have edited most of the chemical substances (about 2300) in the last weeks (using different lists in AWB), but I am afraid I have still missed many. I could do an AWB run to categorise pages that now have the ChemicalSources template (willing to do that, though I should also prepare for a conference), but I would still miss the chemicals I have missed in previous runs.

<dd>See our existing discussion above, in Moronic Acid and also on my talk page. Dirk Beetstra is a man a little ahead of his time.</dd>
<dd>A nice bullet point item in an 'external links' section is a noun phrase, not a sentence. For comparison, in a Bibliography one does not craft a complete sentence ("The book <u>Ten Dogs</u> was written by John Doe in 1972 and published by Kraft Bookwvrks."), we use little noun phrase things such as ("John Doe, <b>Ten Dogs</b>, 1972, Kraft Bookwvrks.") Similarly, the link which takes us to a special wikipedia page on external sources of data and chemicals should be a noun phrase, not an imperative sentence or imperative fragment. Also, removing the imperative action verb improves the tone. So, rather than writing "For external links to blah, click <a href="../../../u/r/l/URL_e6b3.html" title="URL">here</a>.", I would rather see "<a href="../../../u/r/l/URL_e6b3.html" title="URL">External Links to Blah</a>".

<p>My point is that it should not called "external links" (those are already in the article), it should read something like "further information". "External links" is extremely confusing and misleading. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacycle_6f2f.html" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> 18:23, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I am open to these suggestions (it's not like I mind people tweaking the {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChemicalSources_9571.html" title="Template:ChemicalSources">ChemicalSources</a>}} template). For me this is an intermediate solution. This link for now allows to remove all biased links to external sources (because whatever they are, there are only a few links on the page, and commercial or not commercial, they are biased, <i>vide infra</i>). The text this template displays can change. I hope, that someone will help us create a way of linking CAS numbers and other unique 'chemical identifiers' these into the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Wikipedia%7EChemical_sources_67a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Chemical sources">Wikipedia:Chemical sources</a>-page (like the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" title="Special:Booksources">Special:Booksources</a>-page), after that, most of the links in most external links sections can be removed, along with the ChemicalSources template (just takes an AWB run)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About being biased: OK, if there are 1, 2 or 5 chemical companies named, they will be biased, it may be commercial, and they could be put there in a commercial way (though I, and many with me, are reverting those links quite fast). So that is clear. Putting them <i>all</i> there is senseless (can be done using this template, quite easy), but pages would grow to absurd sizes. Now, for some government or non-commercial organisations, they get paid by how much of their data gets used (bosses still want to see results, and they have to get their money somewhere). So if one organisation gets all the CAS links, and others dont, a shift of money or interest may occur because of the links in Wikipedia. So therefore my suggestion (or actually, that of the actuator of this, [[user:213.188.227.119), create a metapage. This has been discussed, and has found at least some consensus (though there are of course many people who I did not ask whether or not this was a good idea after all). Maybe I am on a quest here, which is senseless, and I should stop this. To me, it all makes sense, ISBN has a working meta-page. So booksellers have no reason to put links on the page, and everybody can find the additional information, so that must be possible for chemicals as well .. it's only for the programming of the special-page. I don't have a clue to do that.</dd>

<p>Nice infobox on <a href="../../../2/-/f/2-furanone.html" title="2-furanone">2-furanone</a>. I was interested that the systematic name apparently uses the "butenolide" base rather than "furanone"; the heterocyclic chem reference I looked at implied that these compounds are only named as butenolides in the natural products synthesis community. If the compound really is named as a butenolide, should the article then be located at <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butenolide.html" title="Butenolide">butenolide</a>, which is currently a redirect? <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 21:11, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cheers, though it is the same infobox that was first on <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furanolactone.html" title="Furanolactone">furanolactone</a> (except for the image). Principly, I don't care at which title the article resides, as long as it can be found via one of the ways people call this compound. I guess most people in the lab would call it 2-furanone. And as long as the data can be found it is OK with me (I prefer to keep it at the title the original creator chose). Thinking about it .. this is about the compound 2-furanone/2-Buten-1,4-olide, which is <i>a</i> butenolide. Strictly the redirect from butenolide is not warranted, it deserves an own article (I guess it should describe that a butenolide is a compound with a such-and-such framework, and that the simplest example is 2-furanone, and that ascorbic acid is another example). I hope this was helpful. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 21:21, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I created the 2-furanone article on the basis of the AfD on <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furanolactone.html" title="Furanolactone">furanolactone</a>.

I've converted <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butenolide.html" title="Butenolide">butenolide</a> to a stub on the class of compounds.

First, about hydrogen sulfide .. no, I did not miss that section, that section was more about the (biochemical) working of the toxin, that seemed like useful information (may need a bit of reworking).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stark spectroscopy</span></h2>
<p>Dirk, I think you're right. The page is not really a disambig. Regards, Evgeny. It is OK. You could turn it into one, or do the two types of Stark spectroscopy have a common basis? --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 17:02, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The common basis is the Stark effect, which relates the electric field applied and the splitting (or the broadening, if we're talking about a distribution of the field) of the atomic levels. So you either apply a known field and watch how the spectrum changes (and deduce something about atomic/molecular structure/bonds/...). Or, assuming the latter is known (usually can be calculated with a high precision for atomic/ionic species), by analyzing the changes in the spectrum you can say which fields are there - which in turn could mean e.g. diagnosing plasma density, or detecting plasma waves etc. So the page isn't truly disambig., but rather a starting point for explaining two different (albeit based on the same effect) techniques.</p>
<p>Say, microscope and telescope are based on the same effect; it's just the question from which side you're looking into it;-). --<a href="../../../e/v/g/User%7EEvgeny_25b3.html" title="User:Evgeny">Evgeny</a></p>

<dd>OK .. I get it. Then I would indeed describe the common basis in the article <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stark_spectroscopy.html" title="Stark spectroscopy">Stark spectroscopy</a>, and let the other two describe the specifics. For me, the setup of the page was not a disambig. That's why I changed it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Benzodiazepine Article</span></h2>
<p>Dirk, can you please comment on why you do not want links to support groups on the benzodiazepine web page?</p>
<p>I would appreciate your comments and why you consider the links to be spam?</p>
<p>The support groups do not promote any products nor do they sell anything. They are there to help and provide additional information with benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms based on their collective experiences with this class of drugs.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepine support groups are a collaboration of people who have "been there done that" with regards to benzodiazepine use and understand tolerance and withdrawal from these drugs better than anyone else.</p>
<p>My intention is not to sell products but to provide helpful information to individuals seeking answers to their questions with regards to benzodiazepine drug withdrawal. I believe that links to people who truly understand what it’s like to use these drugs would be a great service to people seeking help.</p>
<p>I posted this in the discussion section of benzodiazepine. I would appreciate your comments.

<p>Thanks for the note. I am also a chemist, and I work for a large pharma company in the US, though not the one that developed venlafaxine. I also have personal experience with venlafaxine withdrawal (fucking awful, to be blunt). I agree that pages on chemicals should stick to describing the chemicals themselves, and your edits seem appropriate. We should keep a paragraph describing venlafaxine-specific discontinuation syndrome, and link to the entry on <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a> for a larger discussion. This particular side effect is common to a class of drugs, though the intensity of venlafaxine withdrawal seems to be worse than other antidepressants.</p>
<p>One concern may be that venlafaxine is both a <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_b98a.html" title="SSRI">SSRI</a> and an SNRI (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), as well as a dopamine agonist, so a straight link to SSRI discontinuation may be a little misleading. I speculate that venlafaxine wihdrawal is aggravated because it acts on such a wide range of neurotransmitters, but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Wiki entries on controversial drugs tend to attract a lot of POV diatribes, and I think that the anon editor whose rant I deleted will be back eventually. I actually agreed with the substance of his edit, but as it violates a number of POV and original research guidelines it had to go.

<dd>Thanks a lot! The review process for core topics is mainly to check that the article is usable.

<dd>I revamped the list by Subst-ing in the bot table which nicely lists all of the articles already included. This was to save a lot of time doing that by hand, but it changes the procedure at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_0.5_Core_topics_review_8e59.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 0.5 Core topics review">Wikipedia:Version_0.5_Core_topics_review</a> - now you add a 0.5 into the version column (or not if it fails), and add comments if needed. If you find the code for the table horrendous to work with, though, let me know and we can probably deconvolute it to something more readable. I'm simply trying to keep the time to a minimum. How about if you start at the top of the table - A/B-Class, and I'll work up from the bottom with the Starts (which involve more of a judgement call)?

<dd>Just saw your posting on my page relating to <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep.html" title="Sleep">Sleep</a> as an example. Here is some elaboration:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Try starting at the first article in the table that does not have a 0.5 in the version column.</li>
<li>Look over the article to see if it looks reasonable. For core topics, references are not required, though they are preferred. If the article looks like something we would be embarrassed by, fail it on quality. If it looks usable - not perfect, but it provides some useful information, then you can pass it. If there is a POV war or terrible English, fail it.</li>
<li>Tag it with {{<a href="../../../v/0/2E/Template%7EV0.5_fc91.html" title="Template:V0.5">V0.5</a>}} for a B-Class article. We can worry about categories later.</li>
<li>Move on to the next article.</li>
</ul>
<p>You <i>shouldn't</i> need to fail any articles on quality among the B-Class articles unless things have changed a lot, or if you see something horrendous that we missed. That should make it easy! Thanks again for your help. BTW, I hope we can reactivate assessments again at WP:Chem, and your expertise will be very valuable there. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 06:09, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for looking at <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep.html" title="Sleep">sleep</a>. Your .."quite OK, some cleanup would be nice" sounds like a B. If you want to put in brief comments, you can add them by clicking the word "comments" in the V0.5 template and typing them on the page. These comments will eventually end up in the table, once I sort things out better. If you have a lot of detailed comments "This section needs copyedit, your need more refs for that part," etc, then you should put those on the article talk page. We only have a handful of active people at the moment, so we can't do a lot more review though we plan to compare the current and the assessed version before publication. You'll notice the Mathbot core topics table links to both the current and the assessed version directly (as does the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Chemistry_articles_by_quality_e1d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Chemistry articles by quality">chemistry table produced by Mathbot</a>). We do plan to do more versions - I'm suggesting V0.7 for early next year, and working towards Version 1.0. We can't get every article perfect for 0.5, or even for 1.0, but reviewing, tagging and feedback all help encourage people to work on these things. As for locking, we may get to such things when we have <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTABLE_bb95.html" title="WP:STABLE">stable versions</a>, but things will have to be pretty basic for Version 0.5!

<dd>I'll answer here, guess you are watching this page anyway.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep.html" title="Sleep">Sleep</a> was a B, indeed. While going through the article, you see some things while reading paragraphs, of which you think, these have a wrong style (in the case of <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep.html" title="Sleep">sleep</a>, I saw e.g. that the acronym REM (and NREM) were used a couple of times, before it stated Rapid Eye Movement). And there were more of those things. I really have to restrain myself to not repair these things, bacause then I might be busy for an hour (on average) with each article. Now there is still time for people to improve that, but say that sleep would have been one of the latest pages to be checked before a stable version was reached. I think that there should be a round of 'cleanup', where people are doing that type of copy-edit to an article before it goes into print (in a next round, a {{todo for V0.5}} on each selected article? --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 21:20, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The todo sounds a very interesting idea, if you can set that up I'd be grateful (I would probably get tangled up). For V0.5 itself, there will only be a handful of people available to do such copyedits, so we probably can't handle it for that. But if we can compile information on what needs to be done, that would be useful, and also leave it on the article talk page.</dd>

<dd>In the last week or so I've reviewed all the known elements (117 articles in all), and as a chemist it was hard sometimes to walk away from problems, but I can't fix everything in Wikipedia myself, or even everything in Version 0.5. What I do is (a) fix the really easy stuff and (b) list the harder stuff on the talk page if I see what can be done to fix it. The latter can be seen as "sowing seeds" for the future, delegating the cleanup to people who care and know about the subject.

<dd>With only a handful of people on Version 0.5 right now, we can't realistically do that amount of cleanup before publication (it would take literally years, by which time people would give up the project!). However, this is only a quick test, and remember that the German and Polish releases include essentially EVERYTHING except stubs and vandalised articles- warts &amp; all (though scripts remove obscenities); even for V0.5 our level of quality control is much higher (that's why we will release 1500 articles, and the Poles will release 250,000 this fall!) And your todo comments can initiate improvements that we'll see in version 0.7, 0.8, 1.0 etc. Thanks, <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 21:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly cleanup is not for now, it is now senseless anyway, because we haven't even really sorted out which articles dó go into a stable version, and pages are changing too much anyway. I'll do some reviewing for now, when I have the time, and keep the 'todo for V0.5' in thought. I am willing to give that plan a go in 0.528, 0.68, or 0.8<a href="../../../4/2/_/42.html" title="42">42</a>42 (or whatever subversion we get after this). A bot collecting the data on this 'todo-list' could give a feel for what really needs to be done. The items on this Template:Todo for V0.5 should have less items than on {{<a href="../../../t/o/d/Template%7ETodo_0cf6.html" title="Template:Todo">todo</a>}} (for articles that carry them), and could have predefined set of items that articles should go through For example with an item about the use of UK-English:<br />
<br />
{{todo for V0.5 | Usage_English = UK | English = good }}<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>Articles that get a 'bad' on a certain item can be easily selected, and corrected (maybe people normally editing an article already do that, after which we only have to upgrade the status).

<dd>Beetstra, I'm sorry but your changes we're very sloppy. I do see some pieces of good cleaning but many changes you made were for the worst. For example, you changed:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Endothermic refers to a transformation in which a system receives heat from the surroundings: <i>Q &gt; 0</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>to</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For an endothermic system the end state has a higher energy than the start state: <i>Q &gt; 0</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For one there's no such thing as an "endothermic system". Second, changes in the measures of the energy of a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamic_system.html" title="Thermodynamic system">thermodynamic system</a> between two <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamic_state.html" title="Thermodynamic state">thermodynamic states</a> is quantified by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_energy.html" title="Internal energy">internal energy</a> <i>U</i> not heat <i>Q</i>. You removed useful see also's such as <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exothermic.html" title="Exothermic">exothermic</a>. These are just a few of many examples where changes were for the worse. Please help clean and add to the article but please don't make detrimental changes to articles which end up putting strain on your fellow collaborators. To clean-up you're supposed clean-up is going to take a lot of work on my part? I will have pause on this matter for the moment.--<a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadi_Carnot_1e85.html" title="User:Sadi Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> 12:53, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, there may be flaws in my edits, I tried to get things going. I am sorry if there are things that are really wrong, but then revert and help me with improving the article. The article as it was, was incomprehendible to a non-chemist, I hope someone will pick up the things I did wrong, or either revert and try to get the <a href="../../../c/h/e/WP%7EChemCOTM_e233.html" title="WP:ChemCOTM">Chemistry Collaboration of the Month</a> running, and move on from there, and I am willing to help (maybe I can actually learn someting from it)!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">{{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">Chembox new</a>}}</span></h2>
<p>Yes, {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">Chembox new</a>}} has existed for several months now. It is a fully transclude version of the old chembox, with a few additions to cope with some non-standard boxes which I found along the way. All the values are added as parameters, eg <b>MeltingPt=0 °C</b>, and all are optional. It seems fairly stable, and is compatible with all the "old-new" chemboxes we have been using for the last year or so. Some editors have complained about table creep, so you may want to apply a little bit of self-censorship if you choose to use. However it has a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The format of the table can be changed (relatively) easily if wanted;</li>
<li>The table can be directly copied into foreign language projects (a recurrent request, given that we're doing all this work!)</li>
<li>Minor style faults can be bot-corrected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dirk, thanks for this, it looks very helpful, I'll look more closely at this tonight. I'm not the best person at working with templates, so it'll take me a little while to work out everything about it, and think how to use it best.
