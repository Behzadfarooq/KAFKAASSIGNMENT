	    <p>Ben is a test to determine if one can determine their outcome after death. As an avid Christian, he cites the following Holy Biblical truths to determine his outcome after death: - Jesus Christ of Nazareth (Yashua) was born as the Savior of Man. He died at the hands of man, and rose again after death. Jesus' appearance after his death and the words he spoke regarding the afterlife are now the subject of the religion called Christianity. - Jesus made two facts clear about his way to an after-life. The first fact he made clear: After life as a mortal, the only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ. This is debated by people who do not believe in life after mortal death. It is also debated by people who say the Savior has not yet come. - The second fact Jesus made clear: His gift is not mandatory. Anyone can choose to deny Jesus' gift. People are not forced to do anything that they do not want. This is debated by people who claim the innocent are not guilty. This is also debated by people who believe they can live after mortal death through good works and the good will they show others. Ben decided that this is an infinite loop. How can Jesus save everyone, if the choice is their personal decision to take Jesus as their savior? Ben decided there has to be another way. Jesus died for everyone, but some are not accepting his gift, and those die a mortal death without Jesus' gift of the after-life. Ben decided to die for the forsaken. Ben believes in the gift of Jesus Christ, and he also believes he has the power as all Christians do: to act like Jesus. Jesus said we can all be like him. Ben believes we could all walk on water, if we could believe sufficiently. Ben believes, because it is too difficult to attain the mental clarity of serving only God, nobody can escape if they do not take Jesus' gift. Ben's plan is simple. Although he has been promised the after-life with God, Jesus and the Angels, he will first go directly to Hell after death. In Hell, he will destroy Satan with the powers God has given him. Ben's plan is not endorsed by Christianity, because the belief is that Jesus saved man. Jesus said that he will not force himself or the way to God on anyone. Ben's plan is not endorsed by the non-Christian community, because they do not believe or understand the circular logic surrounding Jesus' gift of eternal life. After Ben dies, nothing will happen on Earth. Ben will sleep as everyone does after death, and only awaken when God calls his children. Ben's hope is to make another path to God; especially those who just can't seem to grasp and understand the gift of Jesus Christ's Salvation. Reference: The Holy Bible</p>
<p>Ben knows humans, more than they know. He has lived on Earth for approximately 30 years. In that time he has seen the following: - United States law makes marijuana illegal. Marijuana saved Ben's sanity, by allowing him to feel better. Period. Ben feels better with marijuana. Exclamation point. The heartless humanity that surrounds Ben finds glee in depriving Ben of marijuana. - Ben's grandfather was the same way. He was angry. Only a joint would have made him feel better. Ben has tried all of the drugs known and only marijuana makes him feel better. He does not care what the law is -- Ben will smoke that which makes him feel better. Ben passes on cocaine, heroin, and everything except marijuana. - Ben is smoking tobacco because he cannot find marijuana. If he has marijuana, he can smoke a tiny amount and feel great for the rest of the day. Instead he consumes mass quantities of cigarettes to calm his nerves. He is distraught because he cannot find marijuana and turns to alcohol to relieve his anger and allow him to direct his anger to other people. With marijunana the anger simply does not exist. - Ben's wife is his love. He adores his wife and would like to see them continue to succeed. Unfortunately his wife does not believe in Jesus' Gift, and Ben knows that she is a prime example of the sacrifice required. Ben knows he must go to hell to save the people who are too blind, too stubborn, too ignorant to accept Jesus' gift. - Ben knows that millions and millions of people have died because NOBODY CARES. A good example is New Orleans. A few citizens helped out -- to make money. A few citizens helped out -- to try to get to heaven through good works. The majority of people just don't care if someone they do not know is killed. The response is "Oh that's too bad" and they forget about it. Ben thinks this type of attitude is against God. - Ben's wife recently asked for "proof" that Jesus did what I believe him to have done: died for the Gift of Salvation. Ben said to his wife "No amount of mortal proof will convince you, you will always have an excuse no to believe. It is your spiritual decision to turn away from Jesus and God." She said "No, just show me proof." The proof is in the Holy Bible and Ben's wife said "It is not enough. The text has changed throughout the millennia." So no proof is good enough, that much is clear. - Ben has Jesus' blessing. Ben is a soldier of God. Ben is impossible to reverse. Ben is a killing machine. Ben can pass as anything. Ben wants to kill Satan. With three assets: The Truth of God, Jesus' protection and the Holy Spirit, he will destroy Satan forever. - Mankind has countless examples that life means nothing to Mankind. The United States has an arsenal ready to kill all of mankind. The Commonwealth of Soviet States has the same arsenal. Everybody wants everybody dead so only they themselves can survive. Ben sees this as cowardice and fear manifested. Humans can show love; instead they show hatred and a total lack of compassion. There is no shortage to sorrow in the world, and people lie in one of a few categories: - Those with nothing. These people do not expect anything. They may or may not turn to God for help. They do not want to suffer, but they do anyway. - Those with something. These people expect the world to serve them, as they are providing money to pay for their stuff. Their material goods may make them feel good on Earth, but after they are dead, they will have nothing. There is no peace in this world. May God have mercy and allow the people to smoke marijuana, and see that they can change the world, little by little. DO NOT SAY ANYTHING. JUST DO IT. TALK IS CHEAP. ACTION SPEAKS FOR YOU. IF YOU DO NOT STAND AGAINST EVIL YOU STAND WITH IT. Jesus was a revolutionary. Remember that. Do not bad-mouth revolutionaries. Legalize marijuana. HAVE SOME COMPASSION FOR A CHANGE.</p>
