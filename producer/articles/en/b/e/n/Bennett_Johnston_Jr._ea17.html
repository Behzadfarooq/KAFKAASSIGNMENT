<p>Johnston challenged <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_J._Ellender_209d.html" title="Allen J. Ellender">Allen J. Ellender</a> for Democratic renomination to the U.S. Senate in 1972. Ellender died during the campaign, and Johnston, with powerful name identification stemming from his <a href="../../../g/u/b/Gubernatorial.html" title="Gubernatorial">gubernatorial</a> bid only months earlier, won the primary easily. Johnston secured 79.4 percent of primary ballots, but 9.3 percent voted for the deceased Ellender. Johnston then defeated Republican <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_C._Toledano_bc00.html" title="Ben C. Toledano">Ben C. Toledano</a>, a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> attorney, and former Governor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McKeithen_b5fb.html" title="John McKeithen">John McKeithen</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia%2C_Louisiana_d1f4.html" title="Columbia, Louisiana">Columbia</a>, a fellow Democrat running as an independent in the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a>. Johnston received 598,987 votes (55.2 percent) to McKeithen's 250,161 (23.1 percent), and Toledano's 206,846 (19.1 percent). Another 28,910 voters (2.6 percent) chose the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Independent_Party_973b.html" title="American Independent Party">American Independent Party</a> candidate, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_M._Lyons_fcb9.html" title="Hall M.

(The position was filled from July to November 1972 by Governor Edwards' first wife, <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaine_S._Edwards_6309.html" title="Elaine S. Edwards">Elaine Schwartzburg Edwards</a>, who served as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interim.html" title="Interim">interim</a> senator.)</p>
<p>In office, Senator Johnston cultivated good relationships with the Louisiana media, for he realized that their collective portrayal of him would impact his electoral future. The state's newspaper gave Johnston wide coverage. The <i>Alexandria Daily Town Talk</i>'s managing editor, <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adras_LaBorde_e240.html" title="Adras LaBorde">Adras LaBorde</a>, for instance gave wide coverage to both Johnston and colleague <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_B._Long_2cf6.html" title="Russell B.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, Johnston defeated then Democrat, later Republican, State Representative Louis <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Jenkins_258a.html" title="Woody Jenkins">Woody Jenkins</a> of Baton Rouge in the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_primary.html" title="Jungle primary">jungle primary</a>, 498,773 (59.4 percent) to 340,891 (40.6 percent). In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, he secured 838,181 votes (85.7 percent) to Republican Robert Max Ross of tiny <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mangham%2C_Louisiana_2b0e.html" title="Mangham, Louisiana">Mangham</a> in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richland_Parish_7323.html" title="Richland Parish">Richland Parish</a> in northeast Louisiana, who received 86,546 votes (8.9 percent). (A second minor candidate polled 5.4 percent.) Ross had also been a minor primary opponent to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_C._Treen_d878.html" title="David C. Treen">David C. Treen</a> in the first ever Republican gubernatorial primary held in December 1971.

<p>Johnston's closest re-election race was in 1990 against former Ku Klux Klansman and Republican candidate <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a>, who was not endorsed by his party's leadership. One of his Senate Republican colleagues, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_C._Danforth_64ce.html" title="John C. Danforth">John C.

Johnston defeated Duke in the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_primary.html" title="Jungle primary">jungle primary</a>, 53-44 percent. Johnston retired after his fourth term ended in 1997; he was succeeded by his preferred candidate, fellow Democrat <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Landrieu_7a0b.html" title="Mary Landrieu">Mary Landrieu</a>, daughter of the Carter HUD Secretary and former New Orleans Mayor <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_Landrieu_fef3.html" title="Moon Landrieu">Moon Landrieu</a>.</p>

<p>A conservative within the Democratic caucus, Johnston broke with his party on some important issues. He voted to authorize use of military force in Iraq in 1991 and also in favor of the narrow confirmation of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_Thomas_9685.html" title="Clarence Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> to be Justice on the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>. However, in 1987, he had voted against President Reagan's choice of former Judge <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_H._Bork_e75a.html" title="Robert H. Bork">Robert H. Bork</a> to be on the high court.</p>
<p>Johnston was one of the few Senate Democrats to vote against the Budget Act of 1993, which was strongly supported by <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Clinton_d8be.html" title="President Clinton">President Clinton</a> and many prominent members of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic Party</a>. Johnston was a firm advocate of the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Desecration_Amendment_95d6.html" title="Flag Desecration Amendment">Flag Desecration Amendment</a> while opposing abortion and most gun control measures. However, Johnston vote repeatedly against the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balanced_Budget_Amendment_fd2c.html" title="Balanced Budget Amendment">Balanced Budget Amendment</a> and giving the President the line-item veto, both of which were measures strongly favored by fiscal conservatives in both parties. On foreign policy issues, he frequently voted with more liberal Democrats, like terminating restrictions on travel to Cuba, and support for the U.N. and foreign aid measures.</p>
<p>Johnson was the only member of either house of Congress to vote against a 1995 resolution to allow <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>'s president <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Teng-hui_9c5e.html" title="Lee Teng-hui">Lee Teng-hui</a> to visit the United States. <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=104&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00157" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=104&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00157" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>In 1989, Johnston sought the position of majority leader but lost to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_J._Mitchell_dd32.html" title="George J. Mitchell">George J. Mitchell</a> of Maine. From 1972 to 1987, Johnston's Louisiana colleague was Russell Long. The two agreed on many issues and formed a close working relationship to deliver federal spending to Louisiana. On Long's death, Johnston delivered a moving eulogy at the funeral. Johnston continued the same kind of partnership with Long's successor, former Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Breaux_0c48.html" title="John Breaux">John B. Breaux</a>, who served from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Since leaving the Senate, Johnston has been a Washington-based lobbyist. He was a maximum contributor in 2004 to the presidential campaign of his former colleague Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. His son-in-law, former Democratic Representative <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_J._Roemer_e759.html" title="Timothy J. Roemer">Timothy J.

<p>In 1997, Johnston was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnfield.html" title="Winnfield">Winnfield</a>. He is a member of the <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist_Church_46ee.html" title="Baptist Church">Baptist Church</a>; his wife, the former Mary Gunn, is <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a>.</p>
