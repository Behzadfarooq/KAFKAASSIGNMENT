<dd>Good catch; thank you. I was closing out old RFD discussions when I saw the first sentence of your response, which was "Done." I didn't read the rest of the comment... my mistake. I'll be sure to read it next time. Sorry about that, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><strong class="selflink">&#160;•</strong> 14:11, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, that was fast! Thanks! (No problem, BTW.)</p>
<p>One other thing, looking down the list of stuff you worked on: I was wondering if maybe the list of saved precedents shouldn't be on a page called /Precedents (following the example of VfD), rather than /Archive - in part to follow the example, and also since it's not really a comprehensive archive.</p>
<p>I do really like the way you put the actual debates on a separate page, as opposed to inline, the way VfD/Precendents does it - it makes for a much easier to read page. You might want to suggest on <a href="../../../v/f/d/WT%7EVfD_7a9b.html" title="WT:VfD">WT:VfD</a> that we do the same thing there - the VfD/Precedents page is really long, and hard to use. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 15:20, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hunh. It turns out there is a talk page for the VfD/Precedents subpage, at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_8fe5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia_talk:Votes_for_deletion/Precedents</a>. So I guess my suggestion immediately above ought to be directed there instead. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 00:39, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, thank you for the compliments you posted re: my article.<br />
Secondly: since you've posted in the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Talk%7ECross-dresser_bbe8.html" title="Talk:Cross-dresser">Talk:Cross-dresser</a> discussion now, I'm hoping you can help myself and Stbalbach finally bring this interminable bicker-session to a close. It was started and sustained by AlexR - who seems to have a consistent track record of causing the same problems he's now causing in the above discussion. Here's a brief background:<br />
When I attempted to clean up some of the historical information for the "Cross-Dresser" article - specifically with regard to a personage whom I specialize in as a historian - he set off an enormous fight over the changes which I and now also Stbalbach have agreed upon. To give some idea of his argument style, I'll use one subtopic as an example: despite my attempts to point out that many eyewitnesses related quotes from Joan of Arc herself explaining that she wore "male clothing" out of necessity, he keeps claiming that I've instead been citing subjective "interpretations" rather than direct quotes, therefore he thinks we should argue over the ability of others to make such "interpretations". When I try to point out (again) that these are quotes from Joan herself, he ironically accuses me of ignoring his arguments rather than vice-versa. This appears to be his pattern, judging from a remarkably similar ping-pong match he's managed to sustain in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_transgendered_people_0a21.html" title="Talk:List of transgendered people">Talk:List of transgendered people</a>. Glancing over that discussion, it looks like numerous people have asked that an obscure word should be properly defined in the article for the benefit of readers, but he has been resisting this common-sense change and repeatedly undoing every edit which the others make - all while accusing the others of being the unreasonable party rather than himself.<br />
I would ask that, if possible, you could please block him from further interference, at least in the Cross-Dresser discussion and perhaps others if such is merited. It is literally impossible to make improvements when one stubborn editor engages in this type of persistent behavior, and it would seem to be rather senseless to argue with him when he appears to deliberately make irrelevant comments just to keep the debate going indefinitely.<br />
Many thanks for your time and consideration. I joined Wikipedia with the intent of contributing some historical material, but thus far it has been a rather frustrating process.<br />

<dd>I will gladly do whatever I can to help. I'm very sorry that you have encountered such a difficult opposition to your edits so early on. Thank you for your patience and willingness to discuss in search of consensus. Those are key virtues for any Wikipedian, especially in cases where others forget the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility rule</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, no matter how much I would like to, I can not and will not block anyone simply for being stubborn and rude. It's against the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">blocking policy</a>. Unfortunately, this allows POV warriors to exist. That's why we have <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a> and <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">page protection</a> in place. In the worst cases, rude, argumentative editors dig themselves into a hole, with most of the community against them, and eventually get banned by the <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">arbitration committee</a>. It's slow, but in the interests of maintaining a fair, open-minded community, we <i>have</i> to do it this way, however slow and painful it may be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure you've seen this by now, but I've just finished a major edit at <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-dressing.html" title="Cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> to help settle the Joan of Arc issue. I hope this will help; if there's anything that didn't help please let me know on <a href="../../../c/r/o/Talk%7ECross-dressing_1281.html" title="Talk:Cross-dressing">Talk:Cross-dressing</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><strong class="selflink">&#160;•</strong> 07:44, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>As expected, AlexR has now gone in and completely changed your edits to that page, and has promised (in another place) to keep up an endless "edit war". This is a bit like dealing with an adolescent.</dd>
<dd>I had joined Wikipedia after someone posted a note to an academic list making the point, in essence, that historians really should edit Wikipedia articles for the sake of insuring accuracy. I'm finding out why more of them do not.</dd>
<dd>Would you at least revert the article back to the changes that you had made, and then protect the article from additional tampering? Otherwise this process will truly never end. - <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAWilliamson_c1f7.html" title="User:AWilliamson">AWilliamson</a> (Allen Williamson, Joan of Arc Archive ) 15:12, 11 Oct 2004</dd>

<p>Are you sure putting him on the same sub-page with her is valuable?

<dd>It's neither good nor bad to have two related VfD discussions on a single page. I did so because it was quicker and easier for me when I listed the article. If someone messes it up by doubling it, it will be fixed by excellent WikiJanitors like yourself (and I mean this as a strong compliment!) I've fixed doubling-resulting-from-edit-conflicts before, including on the main VfD page. It happens anywhere and everywhere. (Though let me tell you, I wasted quite a bit of bandwidth figuring the VfD doubling out.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, if you really want to split the VfD listing to give <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Richardson_bd09.html" title="Matthew Richardson">Matthew Richardson</a> its own page, feel free to do so. It's harmless either way, but thanks for your concern. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><strong class="selflink">&#160;•</strong> 00:34, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it rolls onto /Old in 19 hours, so i'm more interested in the principle than the case. BTW, it does occur to me that editors sometimes add out of sequence within a day, and doubling up keeps the items together (making sense of "the previous item") despite that! (But i sure was confused when i started troubleshooting the doubling; i hadn't conceptualized the obvious model that the transcluded-heading mechanism uses! Glad to do the Janitorial; i haven't got the bandwidth to spare, and felt like a slacker when my own contrib to doublings in the old monolithic VfD was just pulling the fire alarm.)

<p>What are the procedures for abitrating NPOV disputes? A Wikipedia administrator, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> insists on inserting his virulently Zionist POV into many Middle East-related pages and he ignores Talk page discussions questioning his actions. For instance, he deletes references to Occupied Territories, insisting that they are "disputed territories" a typical ruse of Zionist propaganda. He insists that Hamas is a terrorist organization and refuses to recognize that the label terrorist reflects his POV and is not universally shared. He constantly reverts edits by users he disagrees with (not just me) and insists that his view is the only acceptable view. He does not seek consensus, he does not discuss issues honestly, he just insists that he is right and everyone else must conform to his view. His behavior borders on vandalism and it discourages objective Wikipedians who are working sincerely to build pages with a NPOV. Any suggestions on dealing with this problem? Thanks! <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 00:31, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about working with me towards NPOV? That might work. Accurate summaries of my edits (unlike the fantasy listed above) would help too. Also, avoiding <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> comments in Talk: pages would be a definite plus. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 00:48, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can see that Jayjg is stalking my edits on multiple pages, even to your Talk page. He redirected <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupied_Palestinian_Territories_4a21.html" title="Occupied Palestinian Territories">Occupied Palestinian Territories</a> without even bothering to discuss it on the Talk page. He has systematically tried to revert many of my edits and new page creations of the past 24 hours for purely political purposes. Is this the way Wikipedia administrators are suppose to behave? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 01:15, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

I did not redirect <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occupied_Palestinian_Territories_4a21.html" title="Occupied Palestinian Territories">Occupied Palestinian Territories</a>, I listed it for deletion, which requires no Talk: discussion. And I'm not sure what "He has systematically tried to revert many of new page creations of the past 24 hours" means, I haven't reverted any of your new page creations in the past 24 hours, I've just listed one specific page for deletion. Also, if you have issues with me, the preferred method of dealing with them is to first discuss them with me, on my Talk: page. Why don't you take the discussion there? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 02:07, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alberuni, as long as Jayjg does not abuse his administrator-specific powers (i.e., deletion and blocking) at any time, the issue of him being an admin is irrelevant in the context of your unfortunate dispute with him. First and foremost, admins are Wikipedians. If Jayjg had abused his privileges, I would be among the first calling for investigation and arbitration. Admins should (and do for the most part, I believe) represent the friendliest, most hardworking and helpful face of Wikipedia. I have seen zero evidence of Jayjg abusing his admin status in this dispute.</p>
<p>About his "stalking" your edits: you're allowed to look at Jayjg's, mine, or any other user's contributions and follow up on them if you believe they are misrepresenting you. Jayjg has that right, too. I'm not saying you misrepresented him or vice versa; I am not yet familiar with the dispute. As long as Jayjg doesn't misrepresent you by editing your comments in bad faith, he's well within his rights to respond wherever and however he pleases within the bounds of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">Wikiquette</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7Eciv_3920.html" title="WP:civ">civility</a>, as are you.</p>
<p>That being said, your concerns are valid. Every Wikipedian has a right to speak his mind, so long as he keeps <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7Eciv_3920.html" title="WP:civ">civility</a> in mind at all times. I see that a request for comment about general user conduct regarding yourself exists at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Alberuni_34e6.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Alberuni">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Alberuni</a>. I also see that you have responded there. Keep in mind that if you feel Jayjg's conduct is inappropriate, you are free to open an RFC on him, though it must be seconded by another user within 48 hours of the listing in order to be considered. I would also recommend involving a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">mediator</a> and/or an advocate from the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssociation_of_Members%27_Advocates_d8b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Association of Members' Advocates">Association of Members' Advocates</a> (AMA).</p>
<p>In short, your options at this point include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to work it out with Jayjg on your own, without any <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>, keeping <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7Eciv_3920.html" title="WP:civ">civility</a> in mind at all times</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1619.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance">Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that I am currently neither a mediator nor a members' advocate. I may apply to be a mediator in the future, but my life is currently too busy, job-wise. Anyway, I hope all this helps in resolving your difficulties with Jayjg. I cannot emphasize enough that <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> are the single most harmful factor affecting the Wikipedia. Please avoid them like the plague. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><strong class="selflink">&#160;•</strong> 01:30, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I've <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html#Free_the_Rambot_Articles_project" title="User:Rambot">started a drive</a> to get users to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">multi-license</a> all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> Attribution-Share Alike (<i>CC-by-sa</i>) v1.0 and v2.0 <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">Licenses</a> or into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> if they prefer.

<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>.

<p>Hi, I'm in a potentially awkward position with an Administrator. I have read the Wiki pages on dispute resolution but I'm still not sure how to proceed.</p>
<p>The Admin ContiE has a personal grudge against me for reasons I do not fully understand. He has been this way since I began frequenting wikipedia.</p>
<p>I have done work improving the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furvert.html" title="Furvert">furvert</a> article. He has basically gone on a crusade against any edit I make. He controls every furry category article and several others ruthlessly. He is an iron fist and bans anyone he edit wars with. I had uploaded pictures and he deleted them with no talking. He seems to believe I am every person he has had an edit war against. He is always using personal attacks, calling me troll without reason. I uploaded them again and he voted them for deleted, but to his surprise the person who runs the images, thank you Nv8200p, found they were acceptable once I tagged them properly. Just recently he removed both the images without himself discussing it in the talk page (unless he was the same person who discussed only one) with the edit here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Furvert&amp;curid=725024&amp;diff=47755524&amp;oldid=46280786" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Furvert&amp;curid=725024&amp;diff=47755524&amp;oldid=46280786" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Then ContiE <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assumed_bad_faith.html" title="Assumed bad faith">assumed bad faith</a>, added his constant insult of troll in the talk page. It appears on a completed different wiki, a comedy one in all things, somebody else stole my username and I believe this was Conti himself and uploaded them. ContiE showed it as his reason. While vandalism like his, I would revert and mention it, he would ban me permanently if I undid his edit. That is why I am asking admins for help. He holds a couple of accounts on wikipedia and I think they are administrators so I have to be careful who I tell about this. Arights 06:18, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So then Ben, what happened to your proposal way back then to rearrance Renaissance where you been? why arent it done?</p>
<p>you fix it! Then I'll buy into it, and write a thousand pages. Pleeese don't put it altogether in one lump or it'll be too long and cumbersome.</p>
