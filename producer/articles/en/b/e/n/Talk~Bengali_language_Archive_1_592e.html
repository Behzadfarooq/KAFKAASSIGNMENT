<p>This is nonsense. Bengali is written with a script quite similar to but distinctively different than Devanagari - it has no other name in English than the Bengali script.

<dl>
<dd>We need to have a comprehensive account of the history of the language. It's very rich, and goes back to 11th century CE to Buddhist writing. I'm not familiar enough with it, and wouldn't want to write about it without studying first. I will do that, but can anyone start it up?&#160;:Also, it would be nice if a Bangladeshi, or someone versed in Bangladeshi literature (i.e. post-partition bengali lit. from East Bengal), could add some writers from there to the list of Bengali literature. --LordSuryaofShropshire 18:59, Mar 26, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Could someone also check the spelling of name of the Portuguese missionary mentioned in the History section? "Assumpcam" doesn't sound like a Portuguese name to me -- but I am not sure, since that was a few hundred years ago. However, I'm quite sure it should be "Assumpção", or something like that ("Assumpçam" would sound the same, but I doubt it was ever spelled like that). But "Assumpcam" sounds very strange: in modern Portuguese, "c" in that position has the sound of "k", while "ç" always has the sound of "s" as in "sink", so the name as it is written sound really weird to me (I'm Brazilian).</dd>

<p>Bengali as the 4th most spoken language? And with 190 million native speakers? Portuguese has, at minimum, 199 million speakers, using the population of each country from CIA World Fact Book, almost with only true statistic data from each country, and it is known as the 6th most spoken. It think that Bengali is the 5th most spoken from data that I've seen. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 17:03, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that's true. That's why I've searched for official numbers from each country. At least in Portuguese speakers, I'm sure that's ok.<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 23:28, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the "4th largest" ranking comes from the very reputable fieldwork done by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL)'s Ethnologue survey, whose latest numbers cite 207 million <i>native speakers</i>. See their <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=BNG" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=BNG" rel="nofollow">latest Ethnologue report</a>. I agree, though, that these rankings are often murky.

<p>There are about 140 million native Bangla speakers in Bangladesh, about 80 million in West Bengal, and there are Bengali speakers in Assam, Arunachal, Meghaloy, Mizoram, Andaman Nicobar Islands, Tripura, and elsewhere in the world such as Singapore, US, UK, Canada and Australia. Assamese, Orissa, Sikimese, and some other languages are very close to Bangla and are related. Today there are those who do not wish the inhabitants of these regions to know that they are one family... for obvious political reasons. Ongo (northern Bengal and northern Bihar, Bongo (central Bengal), Kolingo (Orissa), Pundro (western Bangladesh and West Bengal) and Odro (sorry I do not know the location at the moment)... were settled by 5 brothers and their people.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the most important difference is the result of what exactly is counted. CIA factbook like many others include non-native speakers. Now, whether than's right or not is a personal choice. I, for example, prefer surveys that only include native speakers. Bangla is either 4th or 5th. It's impossible to say since surveys in different countries happen at different times. I don't think the native speakers of Bangla are 190 million. Bangladesh itself has a population of 140 million (at least). West Bengal, Singapore, UK and Malaysia combine to only 50million? That sounds iffy to me.</dd>

<p>"Bengali is thus arguably the only language for which people have sacrificed their lives."</p>
<p>This appears to be a blatant falsehood. It may be true that the people who sacrificed their lives for Bengali are the only ones specifically recognized with a holiday.</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlmarks_3b4b.html" title="User:Carlmarks">Carlmarks</a> 21:48, 2004 May 12 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with Carlmarks. Since language is so often the most apparent part of one's culture, it seems probably that many people have lost their lives for speaking a language. For one example, see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan_language.html" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a>. Under Franco, people in Catalonia were killed for speaking their language. Also banned were <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_language.html" title="Basque language">Basque</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galician_language.html" title="Galician language">Galician</a>. I'm going to remove the sentence from the otherwise fantastic article. <a href="../../../l/e/l/User%7ELeland_9604.html" title="User:Leland">Leland</a> 07:49, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the POV is in you. In fact, there are more languages that people die for it. Galician (Portuguese dialect), Vasque, Catalan in Spain (I’ve heard moving commentaries about this by Spanish people, wounds that are open until today - I cant image how it is to be forbidden to speak its own language), and certainly others have died for other languages. But that sentence exists because of something and taking of or hiding useful information that could help one understands the value that the language has to a certain culture is not correct.</p>
<p>So the sentence should be: "Bengali is one of the various languages for which some people have sacrificed their lives." --<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 10:30, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, what would be the point of that? That's about the least interesting sentence I've ever read. I think it's obvious to any English speaker reading the article that people died for this language. <a href="../../../l/e/l/User%7ELeland_9604.html" title="User:Leland">Leland</a> 16:28, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>we're talking about minorized languages or languages in substitution. That doesnt happen with popular languages. If they got a holiday dedicated to the language, then it is more reasenable that it shoulb be stated. Many things in an encyclopedia are obvious. But, in fact, there can be hundreds of languages that people have sacrificed their lives. And for the asian languages I really doubt that there was really a sacrifice like those in Spain. Because beganli is widely spoken, i really doubt that the language was so much forbitten, if it was... there should be lesser number of speakers, what happens in Spain, were the minority languages are very influenced by Spanish and in the basque country, for ex., those who speak their language is a minority due to that attacks against the language. -<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 17:22, 8 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pedro, I don't mean to be rude here, but are you arguing with me or against me? How can you say there was no sacrifice for Bengali when the article states the opposite? <a href="../../../l/e/l/User%7ELeland_9604.html" title="User:Leland">Leland</a> 07:52, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>I'm not arguing, I'm just talking and put in "talk" my ideas (What I thing, my POV...) about the subject.&#160;:| -<a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedroPVZ_649b.html" title="User:PedroPVZ">Pedro</a> 09:29, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just note the sentence uses the word "arguably" and hence technically speaking it is right. (You <i>are</i> arguing on it, aren't you?)&#160;:-) It was safely written, but yes a better description could be</p>
<p>"Bengali is the only <i>mass-spoken</i> language for which people have sacrificed their lives." Any ideas on this? I know mass-spoken sounds vague but well it distinguishes Bengali from languages that are spoken by some 1000 people in some remote part of Siberia, for example.</p>
<p>They gave their lives to establish Bangla (the largest language of the then Pakistan) as a state language. The then Pakistani government decided to make Urdu the only state language, however, Urdu speakers represented only 4% of the total population and Bangla represented more than 50%. Even today in Pakistan only 8% speak Urdu, yet it is the state language ignoring Punjabi which is spoken by 44%. (NOVO)</p>

<p>I've never heard this term used to describe what is known in English as Bengal from the people I know (I'm Bangladeshi-American). We use the terms "Bengal" and "Poshcheem Bengal".

<li>Bangladesh commonly also refered to Bengal until Bangladeshi independence, after which it was politically incorrent to use Bangladesh to mean Bengal. (You will see several post-Indian-independence West Bengali movies and novels which use Bangladesh to describe Bengal).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bangladesh was also called:
<ol>
<li>Purbo Bongo/Purbo Bangla (the exact areas of Bangladesh and East Bengal are NOT same, but it is more or less accurate: greater Kustia district was part of Poshchim Bongo before the separation): the term is more of a regional rather than a political description and has been used throughout time, although less in recent days</li>
<li>Purbo Bangla/Purbo Bongo and then Purbo Pakistan: during Pakistan regime (1947-1971)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My revisions</span></h2>
<p>Hello to my fellow Bengalis and Bengalophiles! I'm new to Wiki, but as a linguistics graduate student who is of both West Bengali and East Bengali heritage, and who uses both dialects of Bengali (and researches on both), I thought I'd try my hand at fixing up this article. I started this morning with the "Variation" section, which--while not half-bad--was written by somebody with a noticeably West Bengali bias and which lacked terminological precision (especially when it came to describing the sound changes). So I changed that around. Clearly the next thing to do is to describe the script (§4) and sounds (§6) of Bengali in a systematic way--I'd like to utilize the Unicode characters, but don't know very well how to do this yet, so I appreciate help from one who knows more than me about this. Also, kudos to those who wrote and edited §1 through §3--I don't have much to add to those.</p>
<p>I'd like also to respond to two points made in the immediately preceding post here: yes "bongo" [bOngo] (vanga) is the standard Bangla word for "Bengal." I too grew up mostly in America but have routinely heard West and East Bengalis alike refer to "poshchim bOngo" and "purbo bOngo." (I'm using [O] to represent the open "aw" sound). The term is said to come from Sanskrit "vanga," although this is contested. On the other hand, on the observation that the Wiki article (before my revision) made the Bangla of Dhaka "sound like a pidgin"--well, yes and no. A <a href="../../../p/i/d/Pidgin.html" title="Pidgin">pidgin</a> is a technical term, and the previous author did not claim that Dhakaiya Bangla was a pidgin, but you correctly detected some bias (see the new version, it's been totally changed). For the record, Muslim Bengalis don't "substitute" Sanskrit words with Perso-Arabic---this was a very misleading way to phrase it. The real story, which I'm going to have to work on and put online, is that all kinds of native Indic (Sanskrit and Prakrit-derived) as well as Perso-Arabic words were used by Bengalis of both religions...but Calcutta Brahmanical elites of the late 18th and 19th ceunturies attempted to purge Bengali of its non-Sanskritic elements, and Muslim writers responded, especially in the 20th century, with turning more and more to Perso-Arabic words. What is striking is, despite the socially and politically motivated linguistic divergence in Bengali, the news broadcasts from Dhaka and Kolkata are essentially in the same language--even the same dialect and style--- while the broadcasts of "Urdu" from Islamabad and "Hindi" from New Delhi show linguistic divergence to the point of mutual non-comprehension.</p>
<p>But to return to the issue of bias: there's nothing biased in presenting one dialect as the "standard." The Calcutta version of "cholti bhasha" is the standard--this doesn't connote any kind of value judgment about the language, though many people assume the "standard" language is somehow "better." My point is simple: if you listen to news broadcasts or speeches or lectures given in Dhaka, they are in a standardized version of the language that is essentially identical to the standard used in Calcutta, and which originates from Calcutta speech in the late 19th century (Tagore popularized this "Cholti Bhasha"). Incidentally, I changed the references from Chalit Bhasha to Cholti Bhasha because that is the more frequent term (the article, pre-revision, flip-flopped between "Cholti" and "Chalit" haphazardly).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Language differences in two parts of Bengal</span></h2>
<p>The author of the section on differences in language seems to be a little biased about which one is the standard Bangla. I think the entire notion of standard Bangla is arguable.</p>
<p>Major arguable topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bish being a Bangladeshi term only: not true, both bish and kurhi are equally used in Bangladesh and West Bengal.</li>
<li>language of educated people: well, educated people on both sides of the border speak standard Bangla; so why is the reference made to West Bengal only?</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">What is "standard" Bangla, if there is one?</span></h3>
<p>If somebody is bent on defining "standard Bangla", well in Bangladesh, <i>Bangla Academy</i> works on laying out standards. Historically, it's not Kolkata language that's considered standard, but it's the language of Krishnonogor. This is the common notion of people and has little scientific basis. However, this was not "standard"; it is more like the "best-sounding" version of Bangla.</p>
<p>What is now considered standard is not the language of any region in particular (not any I know of). I have been to Kolkata; commonly spoken Kolkata dialect today (espcially under non-Bangla influence) is as far from standard Bangla as is Dhaka dialect. However, local dialects of erstwhile Nodia district (also includes Kustia, Chuadanga, Jhinaidah and Meherpur districts in Bangladesh) are extremely close to the standard Bangla.</p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="red"><b>&gt;&gt;</b></font> 1. The standard/dialect debate always remind me of the famous saying&#160;: "A (standard) language is a dialect with an army and a navy"(Max Weinreich ). In other words, it's just another <i><b>dialect</b></i>, of or chosen by and forced onto others, by the elite class of a country/nation. Period. Nothing else is special about it, no inherent merit whatsoever. All statements regarding relative inherent merits are completely subjective opinions (eg. "best-sounding" above) and practically meaningless.</dd>
<dd>Trying to draw lines between languages and dialects is like trying to chop up the rainbow.</dd>

<dd>There's a bit more to a standard language than just a choice of vocabulary and pronunciation of the elite. The elite is always influential in the creation of a standard, but the standard can <i>never</i> actually become popular (i.e. an actual standard) without the consent of the wider audience that is intended to eventually use it in public life. Language standards are tools of democratic reform and equality by providing a reasonably neutral form of communication as much as they're weapons in the hand of dialect-opressors.</dd>
<dd>The use of a standard in formal or official situations doesn't mean that it oppresses dialects. It's only when the standard is forced upon people in situations of a private or local nature that it truly becomes oppressive.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Grammatical differences</span></h3>
<p>In recent days the most important difference in what is considered standard in West Bengal and Bangladesh is the way dates are said.</p>
<p>In West Bengal, 1st of Boishakh is Pohela Boishakh. In Bangladesh, 1st of Boishakh is Ek Boishakh. This change was implemented by Bangla Academy, fairly recently (in 2001 if I am not mistaken). Some debates persist as to the accuracy of this method. I am uncertain of the reasons, but this should be mentioned.</p>
<p>Pronunciation and vocabulary differences are associated more closely with the geographical division made by river Padma (Padda) and not with the political border. Sirajganj and Faridpur are the only districts West of the river that have dialects similar to the East.</p>
<p><a name="Pronunciation" id="Pronunciation"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Pronunciation</span></h3>
<p>This could go on for ever. It's a regional issue. In general, the region between the border and the Padma river (Khulna and Rajshahi divisions) speak dialects more similar to West Bengal dialect than to Eastern Bangladesh dialect. What is commonly perceived as Bangladeshi dialect by the people from the West, is actually the dialects of Dhaka and Barisal divisions.</p>
<p>Dialects of Chittagong region is practically unintelligible to people from the rest of Bangladesh. Dialect of Sylhet, while less of a problem in terms of comprehension is still very different from any other dialect of Bangladesh. Sylhetis commonly refer to themselves as Sylhetis and not as Bengalis. Both of these regions have a huge number of words that are not present in standard Bangla (as defined by Bangla Academy).</p>
<p><a name="Vocabulary_differences" id="Vocabulary_differences"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Vocabulary differences</span></h3>
<p><i>Jamay</i> This word is the source of several misunderstandings between the East and the West, even inside Bangladesh. The word means "bride-groom". However, West of Padma river (including West Bengal), it means "son-in-law". On the East bank of Padma, it means "husband". The confusion is bound to happen.</p>
<p>A slight variation is <i>Jamata</i> which means "son-in-law" on both sides of the river.</p>
<p><a name="Existence_of_Muslim_influence.3F" id="Existence_of_Muslim_influence.3F"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Existence of Muslim influence?</span></h3>
<p>As for Perso-Arabic words, well, these were promoted initially by the Muslim rulers and then by authors who tried experimenting with language. However, these have little links with people's religion. For example, both the West and East Bengal use the word "kolom" to mean pen. This word is of persian origin.</p>
<p><a name="Greetings" id="Greetings"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Greetings</span></h3>
<p>Most Hindus in Bangladesh, comfortably use pani to mean water and some even go to the limits of using "salam-walaikum" as a greeting - something that not even all Muslims do! Muslims in Bangladesh have a tendency to say "Adab" when greeting Hindus. Although, in current day, this use is becoming less and less frequent. Newer generations indifferently use the salam for official reasons and skip a greeting for informal purposes. Older Hindu generations continue to stress on use of "nomoshkar".</p>
<p>Hope this gives some idea of Bangla as it is used in Bangladesh today. I have been born and brought up in the true East Bengal (Eastern part of Bangladesh) but my family strictly imposes use of standard Bangla at home. So, any questions regarding differences in Bangla can be directed to me. I will be happy to answer.</p>

I am guessing that if a word is not "native" Bengali then it's very unlikely it will be native "Hindi" since both languages have similar roots.

<p><br />
Due to the Islamization movements in Bangladesh (formerly part of Pakistan) some Hindi words were absorbed partially. They were taken in the guise of Urdu and said to be more Islamic than the Bengali words. (Actually, some Islamists still declare the language Bangla to be Hindu and Urdu to be Islamic. LOL). The word for water in Bangla is Jol... now most Muslim Bangalis use Pani (Hindi &gt;&gt; Urdu). To say Jol is considered Hinduani (Hinduistic). There are other words taken from Hindi (Urdu) and fed into Bangla as Islamic substitutions!!! So there are funny adoptions of Hindi words into Bangla. (NOVO)</p>

<p>This is not true that Bangla or Bengali language is evolved from or its a somewhat derivative of Sanskrit. Bengali follows a totally different track of evolution where it owes its origin to New Indo European root. It descends from Indo European language through Magdhi Apabhrangsha or Magdhi Prakrito which is totally different than Sanskrit.</p>

<dd>Hmmm, upon some googling, I found the following statement by Dr. Rajendra Prasad in 1950 <i>"The composition consisting of words and music known as Janaganamana is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations as the Government may authorise as occasion arises, and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honored equally with Janaganamana and shall have equal status with it.

<dd>Interesting that you would call "choltibhasa" a part of this so-called "West Bengal dialect". I think "cholitbhasha" is just a colloquial form of the word "cholitobhasha". There are some other words in which people assume "implicit hoshonto" when there shouldn't be one or reverse, although I can't think of one off the top of my head right now. The difference between cholti and cholito is not of regional dialect I believe. cholti is what choltibhasha calls itself, while cholito is the shadu form of the work cholti! I don't think cholit is wrong; so while it should be mentioned, the proper word to use is cholti, in my opinion. -- <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">Urnonav</a> 04:43, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">reasons for reverting the recent changes</span></h2>
<p>"shemiz/kamiz" - turns out bangla borrowed the same word twice - once from french, as "shemiz" from "chemise" (the french pronunciation of a pan-mediterranean word) and once from spanish or simultaneously from urdu/farsi/arabic as "kamiz" from "qaamiis" (the arabic pronunciation of the same word). the words do not mean the same thing in bangla - they refer to different articles of clothing.</p>
<p>anyhow, the two words ultimately come from the same place, but it's still important to distinguish the paths of borrowing, as "shemiz" and "kamiz" were borrowed from different modern languages at different times in different contexts.</p>
<p>about "daoat" instead of "dawat", the reasoning is because [w] is a sound that does not occur in that sort of phonological position in bangla. in fact, that is the reason why many bengalis have trouble pronouncing english words like "power" and "hour", sounding more like "paoar" and "aoar". i suppose this may be something only native english speakers notice! furthermore, the way we have been transliterating bangla on wikipedia makes no use of [w], using [u] or [o] instead depending on the exact pronunciation. for example, "khaoa" is written with an [o] although "kaua" (dialectical word for "crow") is written with a [u]. phonetically, only "kaua" has a [w], defined as a high-back glide, while "khaoa" has a nonsyllabic "o", not a [w]. anyhow i am probably not making sense the way i am explaining this, but i just thought i'd explain why i don't think we should be using [w] (or [y] for similar reasons) in transliterating bangla.</p>

So more than 70% people on internet cannot see many characters used in the IPA/unicode, instead they see a ractangular blank box in that character place, that is why we need to explain things in another alternative way. To make a clear conception of correct pronunciation, using example of different words, as well as IPA, is completely fine, and in my opinion, even better. Using only <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a>, doesn't clarify the pronunciation.

<dd>Well, if we are to follow that logic, we are to dedicate a paragraph to every article on a non-English name. Articles need to be concise and encyclopedic, your addition is a non-standard, non-encyclopedic paragraph explaining something which is already there. This is not a reader for kindergarten kids, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> notation is the standard way of doing this.

<p><br />
If you want you can simply bring that 3 or 4 words related to IPA, down into the second paragraph which is explaining the pronunciation correctly, faster, better. Here in USA, 90% people, even some Bangladeshies also often pronounce it wrong, specially when in front of other non-native Bengali speakers. And many make bad jokes about the bad meaning of "Bang" (pronounced like Bangladeshi word for "frog"). This paragraph teaches the correct pronunciation, thus reducing harassment/confusion.<br />
Including the para below ...<br />
Actual pronunciation of "Bangla" is ... <i>bäng-lä</i> ("Bung-laa") ... the letter "a" in the "<i>Bang</i>" is pronounced like the beginning of the word "<a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungalow.html" title="Bungalow">Bungalow</a>" (single story house), or pronounced like the sound of the letter "ä" in the word "<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a>" or "fathar". "<i>La</i>" is pronounced like the beginning of "<a href="../../../l/a/v/Lava.html" title="Lava">Lava</a>" or "<a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky.html" title="Lucky">Lucky</a>".<br />

<p><br />
If someone pronouncing the word "Bangla" in a wrong way, how do you correct him&#160;? do you or does anyone else carry IPA list like bible in their pocket&#160;?&#160;?&#160;? So you can show IPA character and teach him the meanings of those symbols, or find corresponded pronunciation word/characters&#160;? No, no one does that, not even you. We easily give example of commonly used words, so the correct pronunciation becomes easy to understand and speak. Easily pronounciable words can co-exist with IPA. There is nothing wrong in that. These logics are not hard to understand, but if you're blindly ignoring it, then it is different.<br />

<dd>i don't agree that adding "familiar english words" for comparison is a good idea. there is no way an english speaker, using only english sounds, can pronounce the word "bangla" in the bengali way. adding the "familiar english words" would not help the english speaker any more than not giving any pronunciation guide at all. and i can say for sure that writing "bungalow", "father", etc. will not help native english speakers, considering the "u" in "bungalow" and the "a" in "father" or "art" are not even the same sound (although they may be the same in a bengali speaker's pronunciation). even worse, none of those sounds would actually be the same as the "a" in the bengali pronunciation of "bangla". so even with all the extra work, english speakers would sound just as off as if they just saw boxes for the IPA.</dd>

<dd>And the move shouldn't be to <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangla_language.html" title="Bangla language">Bangla language</a>, but simply <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangla.html" title="Bangla">Bangla</a> since there's nothing else called "Bangla". "Language" is a general disambiguator, not an integral part of the name.</dd>

<dd>But the official name of the language in Bangladesh, as dictated by the Constitution of Bangladesh (written in English) is "Bangla". So we have at least one country that recognizes Bangla as the official language, calling it "Bangla".

<dd>The Bangladeshi constitution is not an appropriate arbitrator for these kinds of issues. This is an question of langauge <i>usage</i>, not of language <i>policy</i>. Even if Bangladesh has a constitution written in English, the population of the country do not make up a majority of the world's English speakers, especially not if we're talking about native speakers. We're supposed to follow the conventions of the English-speaking world as a whole, not just that of Bangladesh. Now I'm not exactly sure what's most common, but some very authoritive sources, including Encyclopedia Britannica and the Ethnologue use "Bengali". "Bengali" also seems to be more common in dictionaries while "Bangla" appears to be in more widespread use in contexts that relate to the Bangla-speaking community. If you have any claims or sources that contradicts this, please present them.</dd>
<dd>A consistent use of "XXX language" in an article is just not good English. A language name is an autonomous noun, even it often coincides with an adjective. "Bangla" can not be confused with "Bangladesh" in standard English usage.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Peter Isotalo that "Bengali" is a more correct word to use for the Bengali/Bangla language. "Bengali" has been used in English for centuries and is established as an English word. The fact that the Bangladeshi contitution uses "Bangla" does not mean that it is the correct English word - one constitution does not overrule 300 years of English dictionaries, encyclopaedias, academic texts etc. Also, the contitution of India, in English, mentions Bangla/Bengali as "Bengali". However, while "Bengali" is more correct, there is no harm in using "Bangla", as although Bengali is in more common usage (at least in the U.K., where most people will have heard of "Bengali" but have no clue about "Bangla"), Bangla is still used in several contexts and I have seen it used quite a bit, so I suppose both are correct. There's no point changing it all back to "Bengali" and all this bickering over this minor issue is hardly very useful. What's so wrong with using "Bangla" - as long as there is some kind of mention of the fact that Bangla is often known as Bengali, there would be no ambiguity and everyone would understand it properly. Besides, Bangla is being used more and more nowadays, so it's not exactly the same as referring to "French" as "Francais" and "German" as "Deutsch", because "francais" and "deutsch" are not English words, but, nowadays at least, both "Bengali" and "Bangla" are English words. Just thought I would give my opinion... Regards, <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanzeel_1945.html" title="User:Tanzeel">Tanzeel</a> 11:45, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that people will complain about it in an FAC. The only comment on article contents in the last PR concerned this very issue. I agree that this is really quite insignificant, but it is confusing if we use one term in the title, establish it in the lead as the most common and then suddenly switch after a few sentences. It smacks of language prescription.</dd>

<dd>Well, I would type out an argument, but frankly, it's just not a big deal to me, either. Bengla probably will gain enough "currency" one day to merit a change, but it seems now isn't it.

If you are talking of Bangla call it Bangla! Bengali is a misnomer created by the British... no need to continue the ignorance. Let people know the real name of the language! (NOVO)</p>

<dd>I am partial towards the idea of sticking to the term "Bengali", but I don't feel that strongly about it one way or another. I feel that there is nothing derogatory or incorrect about the term "Bengali", just as there is nothing derogatory or incorrect about the term "Spanish", "German", "Chinese", or "Arabic". I would think it very strange for the Wikipedia entries on these languages to be entitled "Español", "Deutsch", "Zhongwen", or "al-`Arabiyyah". Similarly, I wouldn't expect the Bengali Wikipedia entry on English to be called "English". I would expect it to be called "Ingreji". There is a distinction between language names like "Persian", which is a cover term for a number of languages including "Farsi", and language names like "Bengali", which are basically equivalent to "Bangla" with respect to language. If anyone wants to make a change, I'd support it, but if people want to keep things the way they are, I am totally fine with that as well. I just don't think it's right to say that "Bengali" is "not the real name" or "just a relic of British colonialism". Honestly guys let's lose the melodrama. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> 06:24, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The name "Bangla" is not widely used in English I'm afraid, so this article really should stay at "Bengali Language". I agree with everything <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> has written above. This has nothing to do with colonialism, nor is Bengali being singled out for 'derogatory' treatment. It is simply that the names for foreign languages in English are normally different from the names in the languages themselves, it's not a big deal. Wikipedia should stick to the most common English usage. <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 17:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we've reached a consensus. I was initially in favor of using "Bangla", but I've since then changed my position, and I too support using Bengali consistently throughout the article. Of course, we need to mention in the header page that the language's native name is "Bangla".

<li>One big thing this articles suffers from is too much specific information. Most people interested in learning about Bangla are not looking for the specific manner in which the inflection of verbs the Kolkota vernacular is different from the formal language. The layman reader will be interested in knowing there is a pronounced difference in Sadhubhasha and Cholitibhasha and would benefit from examples, but what's there now is just overkill.

<dd>I think my tone came out as a little harsh. I am a little irritated because I've been staring at this thing for an hour trying to see what I can do to improve the article without actually changing content. (It was with much hesitation that I've beent trying to pidgeon-hole the former <i>Variation in dialect</i> section into the little subsections of "Geographic distribution".) Much hard work was put into the sections that I would instantaneously dimiss, and that's wrong. To whoever added the things I complained about, if they still read this, thanks for the information.

<dd>Considering the large vocabulary lists and tables are my fault, I should probably offer my thoughts on these suggestions. With respect to the lists, I definitely agree - there are only three things we can do with the lists: (1) move them to a later section, (2) move them into a separate article altogether, or (3) remove them. It's true I spent a lot of time on the vocabulary lists, but I understand that it's neither easy to read nor professional.</dd>

<dd>With respect to the tables, however, I definitely disagree. I think that the tables are much clearer than the prose. Tables like these are used in other language articles, especially those articles with a neat, organized structure. It makes it much easier for linguistically-oriented people to find reliable information, while it allows more casual readers to get a feel for the system of the language. I don't know, maybe I'm alone on this, but I am strongly attached to all the tables!

By the way, I just moved a lot of the dialectal variation information back down into another section that I just entitled "phonological variation", under "variation in dialects". I agree that this is highly specific information and should not be included in the first mention of dialects. In the "geographic distribution/dialects" section, I added a more basic overview of dialect groups, without really going into any detail on any particular dialect. Does this look a little better? --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> 12:55, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a wikipedia article on a subject, it is not correct to talk irrelevantly about wikipedia. Sure, not too many people from Bengal are into wikipedia. That's not, in any way, a measure of any type of status of a language. There are 100s of other factors. But most importantly, talking about wikipedia and other things in a wikipedia article about a language is not encyclopedic, and irrelevant.</p>
<p>Next, the social status of Bangla is nowhere as low as mentioned. In Bangladesh, it is true that the most affluent 1 or 2% may look into English as a social status symbol, but the rest of the 98%, and most media DO focus on Bangla. A look into contemporary media in Bangladesh (TV, news, drama etc) would justify that completely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>While 22 major languages are recognized as "Official Languages" by the Constitution of India, Hindi, in the Devanagari script, is often wrongly assumed by many people in India to be the only national language of the union (federal) government of India. While Hindi has been adopted along with English as the official language of the central government, no special status is bestowed on either Hindi or any other language as the sole 'national' language of India.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<dd>And, of course, there are all things in our article. Basically, Bangla's status in India is complicated. I think it might be easier to answer the second question, strange as that is. I'd say that most Bangla speaking communities are limited to the US and Commonweath nations. I might throw in places like Malayasia, Singapore, and Japan. And of course, there's the middle east (specifally the Gulf countries). I really can't of other places were you would find large Bangla-speaking populations.</dd>

<dd>Grammar sections that are divided into sub-sections based on individual word classes are problematic. They tend to get fractionalized, make for very tedious reading and make it harder to get a general overview. With the word class-division they also attract a lot of tables and lists. May I suggest you try writing more generalized? Try to focus on what makes Bangla unique compared to a) other languages around the world b) closely related languages and c) neighboring, but unrelated languages.</dd>

<dd>I disagree. I think that organizing it into subclasses and using tables makes it an easier read, as people can just skip to what they want to read about, instead of sifting through a generalized grammatical overview. Of course, it would be great to start the grammar section with a sort of simple overview of the language, but using such a paragraph to replace what we have now would be basically ignoring most of the richness of the language. If readers can't tell that the charts show what makes Bengali interesting and different, then they probably won't appreciate it even if we say "this is what makes Bengali interesting and different". --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> 07:05, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Phonology transcription</span></h2>
<p>The article is coming along nicely, but I'm skeptical about the double set of phonology tables right now. They should be merged to make them easier to read. It might also be a good idea to use normal Latin orthography to avoid too much difficulty with browsers that have problems with Unicode, but in that case, the use of "ţ", "đ" and "ŗ" rather spoils the whole idea since they seem like fairly obscure characters. I would also recommend trying to use &lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; to display <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/bʰ/</span>, instead of using /bh/ (or /bhh/ for that matter) since I'm pretty sure it shows up even on rather restricted browsers.<br />
And is /ê/ really less problematic to display than /æ/?</p>

<dd>It's unfortunate, but there's not that much that can be done about making the transliteration all that easier for browsers. It's tough when the language in question has so many more distinctions to deal with. We could start making a capital-lower case distinction, but I really think that that is visually not so pleasing and would make people not realize the phonemic distinction at hand. For the IPA, if the browser can't support it, I don't think it's a big deal. The IPA is used in all the best language articles, and I don't think it's necessary to make adaptations to fit everyone's browser, since we use the transliteration throughout the article anyway. About /ê/ and /æ/, the difference is just to keep consistency within the system. Both of them are basically equally prevalent for most browsers, and the /ê/ works better with the fact that it is phonologically the front counterpart of /ô/, while /æ/ looks like the front counterpart of /a/ (as in Farsi or English). Also, it makes it easier to see correspondences with related languages like Assamese, which would have an [ɛ] for the /ê/ sound. Anyhow... let's first see if anyone else has any thoughts instead of having me blab on! --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> 07:13, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we can make it easier for people to read our notation we should do it. There is no point in throwing up our hands because it requires some compromises.</dd>
<dd>If "ţ", "đ" and "ŗ" are just as difficult to decode as the equivalent IPA, then IPA should be used. The same goes for /ê/, /ô/. The relevant system is a phonology of Bangla in IPA. If the IPA here is incorrect accordnig to available sources on Bangla phonology, then fix the transcription, but don't use nonstandard (non-IPA) transcription unless necessary. How /a/ may be pronounced in other languages isn't relevant.</dd>

<dd>I agree about "ţ", "đ" and "ŗ". If they really are just as hard to encode as the IPA equivalents, let's just go with something else. I wouldn't suggest the IPA because we've been trying to stick to letters that have both a capital and lower case version for these articles. Unfortunately, the IPA doesn't have capital retroflexes. Any ideas from anyone out there? If there really is nothing easier, I'd say we stick to the system we have for now.</dd>

<dd>With respect to the vowels, I don't think I made myself understood. First of all, the IPA is not an adequate system for transcribing the phonology of any language. It's meant to serve as a phonetic transcription tool, not a phonemic representation. That's why we have both IPA and Romanization versions. When I said that we should keep ê and ô in the Romanization, my reasoning was not that they are more phonetically accurate, or that we should respect the guidelines of other languages' Romanizations, but that they best represent the Bengali phonology itself. The fact that Bengali has patterns of high- and low-mid vowel harmony between e and ê, and o and ô makes it best to maintain some visual pattern in the transcription. If we went with the IPA or some other system, it'd be difficult to see why some verbs switch between [e] and [æ] or [o] and [ɔ]. These would look like random patterns to someone not trained in the IPA. Even someone who has never seen ô and ê before can see that they must be something close to o and e, as is true in the Bengali phonology. Also, when transcribing a language with the sounds [æ] and [a], it is generally understood (even in the IPA-savvy world) that the [a] represents a back vowel (even if this is not true following very strict IPA), as it is presumably being differentiated from a front [æ]. However, when there is only an [a] and no [æ] in the language, the [a] is assumed to be more central/front (as it is in Bangla). Romanizing the [æ] as [ê] instead of [æ] keeps the phonology- or phonetics-trained reader from mistaking the Bangla vowel system for the Assamese style front-[a] and back-[ɒ] system or the English/Farsi style front-[æ] back-[ɑ] system. Anyhow, let's see what others think about this.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Literature in a linguistic article</span></h2>
<p>It really pains me to point this out only now, when plenty of work has been done on it, but the section on literature doesn't belong in an article about a language. While it's certainly relevant to Bangla, the article is about linguistics, not literature, and hence a separate section on literature simply isn't included in the language template nor do any FAs have a section on literature. On the other hand, it would make a wonderful addition to <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_literature.html" title="Bengali literature">Bengali literature</a> which currently has no references.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edited Examples of E-W Variations</span></h2>
<p>hello,</p>
<p>i deleted two examples of different but synonymous bengali-derived words, one used in West Bengal and the other in bangladesh.</p>
<p>first, i have lived in calcutta and other WB districts for more than 30 years, and very, very few people actually call turmeric 'haldi'. the overwhelming majority call it 'holud', just as in bangladesh. so i deleted that line.</p>
<p>secondly, 'thakurjhi' is not the *name* of the relationship; the husband's sister is still referred to as 'nonod', as in bangladesh. it is only when she is *addressed* is the word 'thakurjhi' sometimes used, and even then not always. other salutations like the simple 'didi' are at least as common. i deleted that line, too.</p>
<p>i added an example to this section, the usage of 'bari' as opposed to 'basha', which has always struck me as important, especially so when i visited dhaka in 1996. however, i do not know how to write the 'daw-e-shunno raw' of 'bari' in the roman script, so i just wrote 'bari'. someone please correct this, if a correction is needed.</p>
