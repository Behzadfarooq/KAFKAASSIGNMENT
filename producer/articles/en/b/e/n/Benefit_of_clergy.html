<p>Prior to the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a>, traditional English law courts had been jointly presided over by a <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> and a local secular magistrate. In <a href="../../../1/1/6/1166.html" title="1166">1166</a>, however, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a> promulgated the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assize_of_Clarendon_4d08.html" title="Assize of Clarendon">Assize of Clarendon</a>, legislation that established a new system of courts that rendered decisions wholly by royal authority. The Assizes touched off a power struggle between the king and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Becket_4204.html" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Becket asserted that these secular courts had no jurisdiction over clergymen, because it was the privilege of clergy not to be accused or tried for crime except before an <a href="../../../e/c/c/Ecclesiastical_court.html" title="Ecclesiastical court">ecclesiastical court</a>. After four of Henry's knights murdered Becket in <a href="../../../1/1/7/1170.html" title="1170">1170</a>, public sentiment turned against the king, and he was forced to make amends with the church. As part of the Compromise of Avranches, Henry was purged of any guilt in Becket's murder, but he agreed that the secular courts had no jurisdiction over the clergy. The only exceptions were for <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_treason_in_the_United_Kingdom_482c.html" title="High treason in the United Kingdom">high treason</a>, highway <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbery.html" title="Robbery">robbery</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">arson</a>.</p>
<p><a name="The_Miserere" id="The_Miserere"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_of_clergy.html" title="Edit section: The Miserere">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Miserere</span></h2>
<p>At first, in order to plead the benefit of clergy, one had to appear before the court <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonsure.html" title="Tonsure">tonsured</a> and otherwise wearing ecclesiastical dress. Over time, this proof of clergy-hood was replaced by a <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literacy_test.html" title="Literacy test">literacy test</a>: a defendant demonstrated their clerical status by reading from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. This opened the door to secular, but nonetheless literate defendants also claiming the benefit of clergy, and in <a href="../../../1/3/5/1351.html" title="1351">1351</a> under <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_III_of_England_1878.html" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a> this loophole was formalized in statute, and the benefit of clergy was officially extended to all who could read.</p>
<p>Unofficially, the loophole was even larger, because by tradition the Biblical passage used for the literacy test was inevitably and appropriately <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Psalms_adda.html" title="Book of Psalms">Psalm 51</a> (Psalm 50 according to the <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> numbering), <i>Miserere mei, Deus, secundum misericordiam tuam</i>. (<i>O God, have mercy upon me, according to thine heartfelt mercifulness</i>). Thus, an illiterate person who had memorized the appropriate Psalm could also claim the benefit of clergy, and Psalm 51 became known as the <b>neck verse</b>, because knowing it could save one's neck by transferring one's case from a secular court, where <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanging.html" title="Hanging">hanging</a> was a likely sentence, to an ecclesiastical court where both the methods of trial and the sentences given were more lenient.</p>
<p>In the ecclesiastical courts, the most usual form of trial was by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compurgation.html" title="Compurgation">compurgation</a>. If the defendant swore an <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oath.html" title="Oath">oath</a> to their own innocence and found twelve <i>compurgators</i> to swear likewise to their belief that the accused was innocent, they were acquitted. A person convicted by an ecclesiastical court could be <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defrocking.html" title="Defrocking">defrocked</a> and returned to the secular authorities for punishment, but over time, the English ecclesiastical courts became increasingly lenient, and by the <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a>, most convictions in these courts led to a sentence of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penance.html" title="Penance">penance</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_of_clergy.html" title="Edit section: Tudor-era reforms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tudor-era reforms</span></h2>
<p>As a result of this leniency in the ecclesiastical courts, a number of reforms were undertaken to combat the abuse of the benefit of clergy. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VII_of_England_2c03.html" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII</a> decreed that non-clergymen should be allowed to plea the benefit of clergy only once: those taking the benefit of clergy, but not able to prove through documentation of their holy orders that they actually were clergymen, were <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_branding.html" title="Human branding">branded</a> on the thumb, and the brand disqualified them from pleading the benefit of clergy in the future. (In <a href="../../../1/5/4/1547.html" title="1547">1547</a>, the privilege of claiming benefit of clergy more than once was extended to <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peers of the realm</a>, even illiterate ones.)</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/5/1/1512.html" title="1512">1512</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_of_England_590f.html" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> further restricted the benefit of clergy by making certain offences "unclergyable" offenses; in the words of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute.html" title="Statute">statutes</a>, they were "felonies without benefit of clergy." This restriction was condemned by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Leo_X_6993.html" title="Pope Leo X">Pope Leo X</a> at the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Lateran_Council_7f2c.html" title="Fifth Lateran Council">Fifth Lateran Council</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/1/1514.html" title="1514">1514</a>, and the resulting controversy was one of the issues that would lead to Henry VIII splitting the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> from the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1532.html" title="1532">1532</a>. By the end of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>, the list of unclergyable offences included <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning.html" title="Poisoning">poisoning</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petty_treason.html" title="Petty treason">petty treason</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrilege.html" title="Sacrilege">sacrilege</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft_Act_a455.html" title="Witchcraft Act">witchcraft</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burglary.html" title="Burglary">burglary</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theft.html" title="Theft">theft</a> from churches, and <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickpocket.html" title="Pickpocket">pickpocketing</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/5/7/1575.html" title="1575">1575</a> a statute of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a> radically changed the effect of the benefit of clergy. Whereas before, the benefit was pled before a trial to have one's case transferred to an ecclesiastical court, under the new system the benefit of clergy was pled after conviction but before sentencing, and it did not nullify the conviction, but rather changed the sentence for first-time offenders from probable hanging to branding and up to a year's <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarceration.html" title="Incarceration">incarceration</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Later_development" id="Later_development"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_of_clergy.html" title="Edit section: Later development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later development</span></h2>
<p>By this point, benefit of clergy had been transformed from an ecclesiastical privilege to a mechanism by which some first-time offenders could obtain partial clemency for some crimes. Legislation in the 17th and 18th centuries further increased the number of people who could plead benefit of clergy, but decreased the benefit of doing so.</p>
<p>Women acquired the benefit of clergy in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1624.html" title="1624">1624</a>, although it was not until <a href="../../../1/6/9/1691.html" title="1691">1691</a> that they were given equal privileges with men in this matter. (For example, prior to <a href="../../../1/6/9/1691.html" title="1691">1691</a>, women could plead the benefit of clergy if convicted of theft of goods valued less than 10 <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shilling.html" title="Shilling">shillings</a>, while men could pray for their clergy for thefts up to 40 shillings.) In <a href="../../../1/7/0/1706.html" title="1706">1706</a>, the reading test was abolished, and the benefit became available to all first-time offenders of lesser felonies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an increasing crime rate prompted Parliament to exclude many seemingly minor property crimes from the benefit of clergy. Eventually, housebreaking, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoplifting.html" title="Shoplifting">shoplifting</a> goods worth more than 5 shillings, and the theft of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheep.html" title="Sheep">sheep</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle.html" title="Cattle">cattle</a> all became felonies without benefit of clergy that earned their perpetrators an automatic <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_punishment.html" title="Capital punishment">death sentence</a>.</p>
<p>When the literacy test was abolished in <a href="../../../1/7/0/1706.html" title="1706">1706</a>, the lesser sentence given to those who pled benefit of clergy was increased to up to 6-24 months <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_labour.html" title="Hard labour">hard labour</a>. Under the <a href="../../../1/7/1/1718.html" title="1718">1718</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transportation_Act_9f8b.html" title="Transportation Act">Transportation Act</a>, those who pled benefit of clergy could be sentenced to seven years' <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banishment.html" title="Banishment">banishment</a> to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1776.html" title="1776">1776</a> disrupted the ability to apply this punishment, and with the abolition of branding in <a href="../../../1/7/7/1779.html" title="1779">1779</a>, benefit of clergy was no longer an option in most cases. It was formally abolished by Parliament in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1827.html" title="1827">1827</a>. It had already been taken away from federal courts by an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Congress_abc5.html" title="Act of Congress">Act of Congress</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1790.html" title="1790">1790</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, but it survived well into the mid-1800s in some state courts (for example, South Carolina granted a defendant benefit of clergy in 1855) and may even remain technically available in some states today. While many states have abolished clergy by statute or judicial decision, in some it has simply fallen into disuse without formal abolition.</p>
