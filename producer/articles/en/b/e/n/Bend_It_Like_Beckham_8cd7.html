<p>The film is a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_of_age.html" title="Coming of age">coming-of-age</a> tale about 18-year-old Jesminder "Jess" Bhamra (<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parminder_Nagra_3a1e.html" title="Parminder Nagra">Parminder Nagra</a>), a <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> girl living in the western suburbs of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, not far from <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heathrow_Airport_fd3a.html" title="Heathrow Airport">Heathrow Airport</a>. Her first-generation <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjabi.html" title="Punjabi">Punjabi</a> immigrant parents push her hard to study to get into university and become a <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor.html" title="Solicitor">solicitor</a>, and wish to <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arranged_marriage.html" title="Arranged marriage">arrange a marriage</a> for her in due course. Jess instead dreams of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>, inspired by one of England's most famous players, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>. She displays unusual talent for the game in park matches with the local boys, running them ragged with her evasive skills.</p>
<p>While playing in the park Jess is spotted by Juliette "Jules" Paxton (<a href="../../../k/e/i/Keira_Knightley_4f51.html" title="Keira Knightley">Keira Knightley</a>), the star player at the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Hounslow.html" title="Hounslow">Hounslow</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrier.html" title="Harrier">Harriers</a>, a local amateur women's football club. She happily accepts Jules's invitation to join the club, even though she knows her parents would disapprove. Jess becomes a key member of the side and Jules's best friend. She also develops a special bond with the team's coach, Joe (<a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Rhys-Meyers_2667.html" title="Jonathan Rhys-Meyers">Jonathan Rhys-Meyers</a>), a young man whose dreams of football stardom were shattered when he injured his knee. Meanwhile, there are rumours that a scout from an American college is looking for players for the school's women's team. The resulting situation sets up a number of culture clashes ranging from the comical to the serious, as Jess, her friends (both from the <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> community and the football club), and family, try to negotiate their way between the expectations of two cultures and their own dreams and desires.</p>

<p>The movie also shows that immigrant families are not unique in their adherence to tradition. Jules's mother (<a href="../../../j/u/l/Juliet_Stevenson_f19a.html" title="Juliet Stevenson">Juliet Stevenson</a>), who has very conventional views of femininity, pressures her daughter to wear frilly <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingerie.html" title="Lingerie">lingerie</a> rather than <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_bra.html" title="Sports bra">sports bras</a> and fears that her <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomboy.html" title="Tomboy">tomboy</a> daughter is in a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> relationship with Jess. Instead of the standard plot device of the unyielding father and the understanding mother, the roles are reversed with the father having the wisdom to let his daughter fulfil her dreams and the mother clinging to her ideas and traditions. In Jess's case, her father (<a href="../../../a/n/u/Anupam_Kher_79df.html" title="Anupam Kher">Anupam Kher</a>) decides to let her play in the football tournament even when it means leaving her sister's wedding early. In Jules's case, her father encourages her to play football instead of chasing boys and doing normal "girl things".</p>
<p>When he realises she has sneaked out to play football, Jess's father takes ten minutes to watch Jess in her game and sees just how good she really is. He is surprised to find her a fantastic player and a key member of the team, but he is not as impressed when he finds her hugging her coach. During the wedding party, Jess's father allows her to go to the final football match, saying it would be the only way to see her happy on her sister's wedding day - her joy of playing is contrasted with her sister's joy of getting married, in a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montage_sequence.html" title="Montage sequence">montage</a> reminiscent of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a>.</p>
<p>The American scout sees Jess and Jules at the game and offers them a place at a college in the USA with a well known and successful women's soccer program (<a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Clara_University_e9a3.html" title="Santa Clara University">Santa Clara University</a>). Jules accepts straight away, but Jess does not as she knows her parents would never let her. She returns to the wedding party (which was just finishing) and tells her best Indian friend - Tony (a gay man who is infatuated with David Beckham) what has happened. Tony sees how much Jess wants to take up this opportunity, so he tells Jess's parents that he and Jess want to get married but he wants her to have a chance to go to the college of her choice first (i.e. the college in America which she has been offered a place at). Jess realises that she cannot let Tony make such a sacrifice for her, and she also wishes to stop deceiving her family, so she speaks up and asks permission to go to America.</p>
<p>Her father grants her permission to go, as in his youth he wanted to play <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> for England but he was unable to because the English men who were at the club he wished to play at made fun of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turban.html" title="Turban">turban</a> he wore and 'kicked him out like a dog'. He realises that Jess really wants to take up this opportunity and gives a speech in front of the relatives and friends there about how he was discriminated against and how he wants Jess to take up the opportunity he never had. Consequently Jess goes to America. The film concludes with family and friends assembled at the airport to bid Jess and Jules farewell. Jess and Joe, who throughout the film found themselves attracted to the other despite the restrictions of family and his position, kiss and decide to tell Jess' parents of the relationship when she comes back at Christmas. The credits roll with Joe and Jess`s father playing cricket.</p>

<p>The film was popular with audiences around the world, including the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, where David Beckham was little known at the initial time of its release.</p>
<p>Some critics compared it to <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Elliot_f342.html" title="Billy Elliot">Billy Elliot</a></i> ("with football instead of ballet") or felt it mined the same vein of humour as <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Big_Fat_Greek_Wedding_3529.html" title="My Big Fat Greek Wedding">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a></i>, even though <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i> was released first. Critic <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Sailer_834e.html" title="Steve Sailer">Steve Sailer</a>, in a mildly favourable review <a href="http://www.isteve.com/Film_Bend_It_Like_Beckham.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.isteve.com/Film_Bend_It_Like_Beckham.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, dubbed the movie <i>My Big Fat Sikh Heading</i>. However it received enthusiastic reviews from influential critics with <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> calling it 'a perfect coming of age movie'.</p>
<p>The 9th <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyongyang_Film_Festival_9bec.html" title="Pyongyang Film Festival">Pyongyang Film Festival</a>, held in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> in 2004, screened a dubbed and censored version of <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i> and the U.S.-produced South African drama <i><a href="../../../c/r/y/Cry%2C_The_Beloved_Country_%28film%29_07de.html" title="Cry, The Beloved Country (film)">Cry, The Beloved Country</a></i>. <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i> reportedly delighted the limited audience of less than 100 that was allowed to see it.
