I wouldnt waste so much time editing these articles if this werent true...scientific terms may not make sense to everyone yet should be included and i create links on all terms i feel the lay person may not be familiar with, surely some of the info will be updated by specialists familiar with the specific animals yet its all pretty much in the right ballpark<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 23:22, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>well there is the case where people put in info they feel should be there...yet there are cases where people just tamper and meddle to make mischief...and of the later perhaps eventually the human population will grow to a level of maturity so that this no longer is much of a problem...for now i contemplate more aggressive moves to block those obviously just putting in pure and obvious vandalism and especially gibberish...i am thinking there should be a three day to one week period of registration before one can edit, esp. if ur first three edits get called vandalism or gibberish and u cant eloquently defend it...no more random users...u have to create a name and say a brief spiel on ur user page...make people invest a little time if they want to then edit...user name is in one color for the first month(red for watch out!)...then another after 3 months of contribution(yellow/orange?)...then another after one year of successful contribution(green)...i dont know...yet it is ridiculous some of this stuff people try and throw in...gibberish even...its wasting responsible peoples time...its a fine project creating a free encylopedia on the net...yet its difficult enough managing different peoples takes on the subjects, without even any gibberish and malicious or mischievous editting...wikipedia gets popped up right away in searches for many things...so its bound to have thousands of adolescents hitting it and then trying to make mischief...we need to fight back against these meddling kids (sometimes in adults bodies)..."benji moves to the right in wikipedia politics" we need to take more aggressive steps people!!!...do something jimmy wales!...create an internet scene!..."wikipedia is going to move to the right making it more difficult to edit unless people act more responsibly" <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 17:53, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What the heck!!!

<p>Hey <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a>, thanks for your comments. I know my user page makes me look like a bit of an elitist. I guess I would rather see the school become "important" first before being added as an article. I think I have just seen too many "This is my school and the principal is ... and my friends are ..." articles that sent me off on that rant. But if fans are willing to do lots of research and come up with decent articles, great! Anyway, I'm off skiing in Switzerland tomorrow (that's why I have been reading up on it&#160;:-) -- sorry about reverting some of your changes by accident, usually you get a conflict editor but it didn't come up this time for some reason.

<dd>Hey, thanks for the kind offer to crash! I actually haven't got the faintest idea where exactly we're going, a friend who used to go there with his family every year booked everything... I just know it's near the Italian border and has plenty of snow at the moment. It sounds like a beautiful place, some village at 2000 m accessible only by gondola, I'm sure it'll be great!

<p>Hello, and thanks for your contributions to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canton_of_Berne_fdff.html" title="Canton of Berne">Canton of Berne</a>.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>your blanking behaviors have been deemed partisan</i>. Again who had made this determination and on what evidence? Can you please reference me with some examples of this behaviour. It is my believe that I have "blanked" out material that was not supported by references. Either there were no refernences made or the references cited did not suport the argument. If you can supply me with examples where this is not the case then I appologise and promise to be more careful in future.</li>

<li><i>your blanking behaviors have caused harm to your positions and the industries you support</i>. Care to provide evidence to back this claim?</li>

<li>Correcty me if I am wrong but Wikipediea is supposed to be encyclopedic. This means that it should present facts and not point of view. In an encyclopedia, criticisms and negative stories should be based on fact not opinion. If it is a fact there should be a credible reference to backup the fact. I believe it is my duty to delete content that is not factual. This is not a debating society - it is an encylopedia.</li>

<dd>Are you ...129.132.239.8 that posted to my talk page 14:21, 26 January 2007 (UTC)?</dd>
<dd>Lets look at some of the edits you are concerned about.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roundup&amp;diff=92683358&amp;oldid=92682614|canadian" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roundup&amp;diff=92683358&amp;oldid=92682614|canadian" rel="nofollow">court case about GM pollen blowing into a farmers land</a> . As stated in the edit summary this was deleted because it did not belong in an article on Glyphosate. It belongs in an article on Roundup ready crops or genetically modifed food. The very existance of the link on the Glyphosate page is non NPOV. The link stated</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Supreme Court of Canada lawsuit involving a Canadian farmer who was sued for having <i>Roundup Ready</i> seeds growing on his land. The farmer claimed that the seeds had blown onto his land from the wind"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This link basically says "The big bad evil multinational sued a poor inocent farmer for pollen blowing on to his land". A. this case is not that simple and this is a facually incorrect reading of the case. and B. the article is on Glyphosate not on roundup ready crops, not on GM food, not on intelectual property rights and biotech. So I deleted it A because of irrlevance to the article and B because of lack of NPOV. If you want reinsert the link and use some NPOV text to introduce it then by all means do so. Improve the article - do not go around threating people who make edits that do not suit your POV. You might also look at <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetically_modified_food.html#Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser" title="Genetically modified food">GM Food article</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser_69eb.html" title="Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser">Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser</a> for a bit more detail on the facts in this case.
<ul>
<li>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roundup&amp;diff=92682614&amp;oldid=92276578|SuperWeed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roundup&amp;diff=92682614&amp;oldid=92276578|SuperWeed" rel="nofollow">deletion in Glyphosate article</a>]. This is a controversal issue and the text as written was not NPOV. The link that existed in this section was a 9 year old article from [<a href="http://www.mindfully.org/GE/Roundup-Ready-Weeds.htm|Bob" class="external text" title="http://www.mindfully.org/GE/Roundup-Ready-Weeds.htm|Bob" rel="nofollow">Hartzler</a> ] at Iowa State University. No where in the article is the word superweed mentioned. The article talks about glyphosate resistant weeds not superweeds. The term superweed was invented by the GM naysayers to scare people. But a glyphosate resistant weed is not scary to anyone except farmers and the makers of glyphosate. Why - because farmers will have to use a different herbicide if they have glyphosate resistant weeds. The inclusion of the term superweed makes the article non-NPOV. If you can write something about glyphosate resistant weeds that is NPOV and does not use the term superweed then put it in. I deleted it because it was not NPOV because it used the term superweed.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>BTW - where in "the literature" is the term superweed used? What "literature" are you talking about?</dd>

<p>to "DS"...if something was removed i apologize...i restored two links to news articles concerning the polar bears and pollution that someone had removed, one a nice BBC article, which i had not noticed as they were summarized as minor edits and were removed by a brand new editor...i ended up pulling back an older version of the page...yet go ahead and restore if u havent yet...ill just write the links back in now...there likely were other additions that were removed as well when i pulled up that older page...i just wanted it up front so i could compare it to newer versions...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 10:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>wait a second here...it was even i that removed an intro sentence describing the bears as land mammals...i have added many sentences along with likely half the scientific info on the polar page, and repeatedly described them as marine mammals...yet in the evolutionary section it is appropriate to note that they do in fact spend large amounts of time on land and that for all intents and purposes they technically really are a cross between a land mammal and a marine mammal...this is less true of perhaps sea otters...yet as to polar bears we do happen to class them as marine mammals many of us...as they are intimately tied to the ocean...their diet stems mainly from the ocean...yet in the evolution section when discussing their differences with brown bears it is appropriate to note them as somehow in between still and not fully marine as a cetacean would be...when u deal with evolution, people, u have to note that there are not always blacks and whites...these transitions are not instantaneous...creatures can be in phases in between...we class them as marine instead of land as they lean more towards this in several categories we deem important and for practicality...yet they do in fact spend the majority of their time in the air and not in liquid water...at some point in the future, particularly if the ice melts, (very slowly to give them thousands of years to adjust, barring radical mutations)...they could go fully either way...marine or land...and as to the 3 revert rule...i have come no where near that...that rule is for one day...ur barking up the wrong tree...the last insertion i made to the page was not at all controversial and in the interests of science...i agree a couple of sentences i had added before could be classed as original research...yet not the last insertion i made...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 10:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I deleted your section on polar bears because it was not referenced correctly and it was a load of drivel. I note that you put it back with a more complete reference. But it was still a load of drivel. I note that it lasted for 1hr and 16 mins until Snalwibma removed it. Presumably because he recognised it as a load of drivel too. If the reference means anything you don't have to go on and on about the qualifications of the authors etc etc. Very un-encylopedic. BTW for living creatures there is no such thing as an intermediate form since this implies that evolution is going somewhere. It is only after another species evolves from the polar bear sometime in the future can it be said that the polar bear is an intermediate form.<a href="../../../t/t/g/User%7ETtguy_687f.html" title="User:Ttguy">Ttguy</a> 08:37, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Benjiwolf, just to be clear, in my last Talk entry i was responding to this quote by you: "yall even got me blocked wrongly for 1 RR to try and reinsert my explanation...in fact yall blocked the entire university here in zurich switzerland." to the best of my knowledge, "yall" means "you all," and in that entry you were, in fact, referring to not only Xiner but also to myself - and this did seem to suggest to me that you believed we were somehow working together to get you blocked. but i'm sorry for any misunderstanding, and i believe you when you say that you are too. i realize that you just want a decent article. - <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetanoid_7d84.html" title="User:Metanoid">Metanoid</a> 16:57, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Howabout you stop "restoring" and do some editing then. There are good and justifiable reasons for my edits. This page is controversial and each statement needs a reference to back it up. And the reference must be verifiable. This means primary references where possible. I have been finding primary references and you go and "restore" secondary references from potentially unreliable sources. Greenpeace is not a reliable source for scientific information. Greenpeace maybe able to point you in the direction of some reliable information but you need to look at the primary source to see if their interpretation is accurate. If there is a letter to the Lancet about glyphosate then an exact year, volume, author and page numbers should be able to be supplied.<a href="../../../t/t/g/User%7ETtguy_687f.html" title="User:Ttguy">Ttguy</a> 20:27, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your concern but this is an article about a non-public crime victim. <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> is rather strict to keep Wikipedia from being sued for libel. As the BIO page says, "Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures. <b>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm".</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid. It is not our job to be sensationalist, or to be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about people's lives." Because of that, I do not see a reason to unprotect the page. That said, I will bring this to the attention of other admins and if the consensus is to recreate the page then we'll do it.

<p>I am familiar with the type of things that get added to the GM articles and I am familiar with ttguys edits. He does a pretty good job of keeping things balanced and tidies up old, outdated and poorly sourced (things from obviously biased sources etc.; see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>). With the "controversy" over GM there are a lot of editors come along, add the latest thing they read on GM watch, regardless of the accuracy and then take off again. Also a a lot of material was removed from the GM food article recently when Ed Poor did a hatchet job on the article and removed all the controversial details to another article, an edit which had absolutely nothing to do with ttguy. Now your behavior is an issue, it is not your role as an editor to threaten another editor because you have editorial differences; discuss it on talk pages and stop making threats, see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. --<a href="../../../p/d/h/User%7EPDH_bc7b.html" title="User:PDH">Peta</a> 22:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

The ghost of benjiwolf?...or a magicians trick?</div>
</div>

<p>i have stated plainly i am retiring this neutralist wikipedia character "benjiwolf"...i have not at all tried to hide the fact that this character is disappearing, and that i have created a hard right character somewhat the antithesis to this character...i may no longer edit at all...i may decide to edit with the hard right character "silence of the wolves" on some few occasions...yet this character "benjiwolf" is leaving wikipedia, when i say things i generally mean them, this character is history and is merely clearing up a couple of things on a talk page or two...this character has a thing or two to respond to and add to talk pages, yet i think i havent edited any article pages with this character since i retired this character, and i will not in the future edit any articles with this character...so i have not at all then, been "sock puppeting"...in fact my new wikipedia character wishes many things this previous character "benjiwolf" stated to be erased even, and has a policy of disclosing or contributing very little to english wikipedia, and is mainly an editor that likes to edit things out if at all possible under wikipedia guidelines, such as not properly referenced material the character happens to wish removed, POV statements etc...the new character may contribute new material however on non-english wikipedia sites...so as i said the character "benjiwolf" is essentially dead..."you merely hear the voice from the grave on a talk page or two before the passing is complete and benjiwolf has left the world of wikipedia forever"...(whether the character belongs in "wikiheaven" (wikipedia heaven) or "wikihell" (wikipedia hell) after leaving "wikipurgatory" is a matter of debate i suppose, and depends somewhat on the reference point of the observer)...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 13:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benjiwolf, it really sucks that people are such one sided jerks in editing wikipedia. That's why I'm not such a big editor anymore I got tired of people's ego's getting in the way of knowledge. I wish i could help you, i've just started a very gruelling school schedule and don't have the time to really look into the issue. I would recommend brining the concerns that you brought to me to a moderator or other superuser. sorry wish i could be more help, articles need to show both sides of the debate, even the side that doesn't make companies look good <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitaniumDreads_5b9b.html" title="User:TitaniumDreads">TitaniumDreads</a> 06:01, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>how could i be threatened by FOX news?...I live in Switzerland, i left the states permanently, and FOX news has no effect on us...its the americans that FOX news hurts...yet y'all will see that im fine with that, if the americans feel they need top stupify themselves then no one is really standing in the way of that...its just nice to rub it in that the chinese profit from FOX news, (in more ways than just the half chinese kids) and that a chinawoman is one half the couple that own it...its just nice to rub that in, as the FOX news viewers are the type that would boycott a news channel with connections to the chinese, and this makes it oh so very ironic...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 19:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>anyways i cant really write this on ur talk page anna as im blocked, yet.......well anna foxlover that was a start blanking the secret numbers, yet someone can just pull up the history and find them still, (even if u somehow erased the histories, someone at the NSA could pull up that number no problem and collect ur gift, not that theyd care)... however if you change the secret number as i suggested, then it doesnt matter, and its even super sneaky to have suggested a number on ur talk page, but you really have another number...&amp; its a slightly higher level of deception than just blanking the number, so if you change the actual secret number and just keep it in ur head, not even the CIA, MI6, or the FSB/KGB would be able to figure it out (unless they came to ur house and queried you, but lucky for you they all have more important matters to attend to)(depending on the reference point of the observer of course, ur secret number may actually be more important to an objective observer anna)...</p>

<dd>The fact that you admit to editing anonymously to avoid a block is cause enough to extend the block on your account. The problem is that you don't understand this.

<p>oh!...<b>so you want to start crying "benjiwolf" too auburnpilot???</b> want to try and start tracking me all around wikipedia like the editor that keeps putting up little puppet images on this page? Well <i>you are totally out of line auburnpilot</i>. This editor Ttguy has been harrassing me on wikipedia...in fact look at most recent comments from this editor Ttguy March 7 12:55..."so you really are as dumb as i thought"...and "up <i>shit</i> creek".......well just what sort of encyclopedic tone is that?...I am fully for freedom of speech, but there is such a thing as taste, and that just doesnt quite sound like an encyclopedic tone to me!...and I will not be harrassed and followed around on wikipedia by this edior Ttguy! If you wish to stalk benji-wolf around wikipedia well think again! If i want to engage this editor i know where to find him, he lurks around the pesticide/herbicide pages and the genetically modified food pages and thats about it! I on the other hand make contributions to wikipedia on hundreds of different issues and subjects besides just these, and that have nothing to do with GM food or agriculture. Therefore i have switched to roving anonymous IPs to avoid harrassment from this suspect one-account lobbiest sock puppet! I always edit in good faith. I try and make valuable contributions to wikipedia. There may be a joke here and there on the talk pages yet i have <i>never</i> resorted to such foul profane language as this editor that keeps harrassing me on wikipedia! So you want to get in bed with this editor auburnpilot and gang up with him thats fine! that is your right, but my roving IPs now give me the advantage of being immune to stalking by the both of you! Quite frankly there is nothing you can do! I can hop on a train from here in switzerland and in less than an hour be in a half dozen different bordering countries with entirely new IPs. A 20-40 euro plane ticket and i can be in around 20-30 countries in an hour! You can only track me if I allow it by making clear it was a benji-wolf edit!...Plus all you can do is block someone elses computer from editing on wikipedia, if you block this IP for instance all you do is block the university here in Zurich and not me! now this case is unusual i suppose, I dont suggest to other wikipedia editors to use such evasive tactics unless they are being stalked disruptively by other editors, I always say that all wikipedia editors, whether anonymous or not, should make a clear good-faith attempt to improve or otherwise cause benefit to wikipedia if they are to roam around the site in respect for the many editors that do so...anyways I'm not suprised auburnpilot! After all you were in the gang that disruptively tried to remove good faith edits fully referenced to a half dozen major newspapers as I stated the owners of News-Corporation and FOX news and their citizenships, as well as the inheritance issues around the profit and controlling shares, I made no statements pro or con agfainst FOX on the article page and just stated facts, and i would have been open to moving this factual relevant information to other locations in the article. Anyways, I am neither liberal nor conservative, in fact my last few edits have jumped to the defense of Ann Coulter's freedom of speech none-the-less, yet I have a right to bring factual, referenced material to wikiepdia without being blocked disruptively. I was never warned about that 3RR on my talk page, people made ridiculous excuses that it was OR or something or not referenced to valid souces, on the very few occasions i have been in a possible 3RR situation I have always been warned on my talk page, and I have always disisted from the third RR. In fact in several ways you have violated wikipedia policy in that block, so dont start <i>crying benjiwolf</i> when i may happen to flaunt the rules somewhat also!...<a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.132.239.8.html" title="User:129.132.239.8">129.132.239.8</a> 19:53, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>block it for as long as you want auburnpilot! I already said I'm not editing under this name anymore. Yet I'll sign in here to autograph the page again with a genuine benjiwolf signature! and to make a little response...<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 16:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>whoops! by signing in with the benjiwolf account and its mere 6 week block do I limit the University computer block to just 6 weeks, or does it stay the indefinite block if crystalizedangels signed in earlier? how does that work y'all??? to be safe its probably better if crystalizedangels signs in again!-<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjiwolf_0a3e.html" title="User:Benjiwolf">Benjiwolf</a> 16:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Benjiwolf,</p>
<p>I have been following your battles with that facist Monsanto appologist ttguy on roundup. Congratulations on socking it to him. Fascinated to read on your user page that you are a "professional writer or journalist." I really like your stuff and would like to read more. What newspapers have you been published in? What by line to you go by? Have you written any books? 124.254.108.7 22:45, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its quite flattering comment, but is there possibility this is australian ttguy sock puppet? Please tell us more about yourself user 124.254.108.7! You seem very interesting user. Only one edit ever. And it is on this issue of roundup &amp; benjiwolf, how in world did you come across that thread? As its clear from talk that ttguy and auburnpilot have now gone behind the shadows, exchanging email addresses with each other to make dates and such, and plans for the future, perhaps they have decided on some type scheme to better track benjiwolf. I feel like we are dealing with nixon's henchmen or something on wikipedia these days, but we perhaps could take your edit here in good faith until we know more. Good day!-from an interested swiss user-85.1.215.108 15:22, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
