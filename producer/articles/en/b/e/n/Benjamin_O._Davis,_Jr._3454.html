<p><b>General Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr.</b> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a> – <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>) was an American general, commander of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_Airmen_f325.html" title="Tuskegee Airmen">Tuskegee Airmen</a>.</p>
<p>Davis was the first <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> general in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a>. During World War II Davis was commander of the <a href="../../../3/3/2/332nd_Fighter_Group_1060.html" title="332nd Fighter Group">332nd Fighter Group</a>, which escorted bombers on air combat missions over Europe. Davis himself flew sixty missions in <a href="../../../p/-/3/P-39.html" title="P-39">P-39</a>, <a href="../../../p/-/4/P-40.html" title="P-40">P-40</a>, <a href="../../../p/-/4/P-47.html" title="P-47">P-47</a> and <a href="../../../p/-/5/P-51.html" title="P-51">P-51</a> fighters.</p>
<p>Davis was born on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. His father was a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">U.S. Army</a> officer, and at the time was stationed in <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming.html" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> serving as a lieutenant with an all-black <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> unit. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_O._Davis%2C_Sr._49f1.html" title="Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.">Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.</a> served 42 years before he was promoted to brigadier general.</p>
<p>At the age of 14 the younger Davis went for a flight with a barnstorming pilot at <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolling_Field_b6f2.html" title="Bolling Field">Bolling Field</a> in Washington, D.C. The experience led to his determination to become a pilot himself. He was the first cadet to get his wings from the Tuskegee Army Air Field on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">March 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>.</p>
<p>After attending the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, he entered the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Military_Academy_177e.html" title="United States Military Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Point%2C_New_York_847c.html" title="West Point, New York">West Point</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>. He was sponsored by Representative <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_De_Priest_6b7c.html" title="Oscar De Priest">Oscar De Priest</a> (R-IL) of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>, at the time, the only black member of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">Congress</a>. During the entire four years of his Academy term Davis was shunned by his classmates, few of whom spoke to him outside the line of duty. He never had a roommate. He ate by himself. His classmates hoped that this would drive him out of the academy. The "silent treatment" had the opposite effect. It made Davis more determined to graduate. Nevertheless, he earned the respect of his classmates, as evidenced by the biographical note beneath his picture in the 1936 yearbook, the <i>Howitzer</i>&#160;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"The courage, tenacity, and intelligence with which he conquered a problem incomparably more difficult than plebe year won for him the sincere admiration of his classmates, and his single-minded determination to continue in his chosen career cannot fail to inspire respect wherever fortune may lead him."</i><a href="http://www.wwiivets.com/IssueXXI-Summer_2003/IssueXXI_Tradition.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wwiivets.com/IssueXXI-Summer_2003/IssueXXI_Tradition.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He graduated in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>, 35th in a class of 276. He was the academy's fourth black graduate. When he was commissioned as a second lieutenant, the Army had a grand total of two black line officers — Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. After graduation he married Agatha Scott.</p>
<p>At the start of his senior year at West Point, Davis had applied for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Corps_f227.html" title="United States Army Air Corps">Army Air Corps</a> but was rejected because it did not accept blacks. He was instead assigned to the all-black 24th Infantry Regiment (one of the original <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_Soldier_a48a.html" title="Buffalo Soldier">Buffalo Soldier</a> regiments) at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Benning%2C_Georgia_b089.html" title="Fort Benning, Georgia">Fort Benning, Georgia</a>. He was not allowed inside the base officers club.</p>
<p>He later attended the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Infantry_School_4c1b.html" title="U.S. Army Infantry School">U.S. Army Infantry School</a> at Fort Benning, but then was assigned to teach <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">military tactics</a> at <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_Institute_4cc7.html" title="Tuskegee Institute">Tuskegee Institute</a>, a black college in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>. This was something his father had done years before. It was the Army's way to avoid having a black officer command white soldiers.</p>

Capt. Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr., of Washington, D.C., climbing into an Advanced Trainer. Tuskegee, Alabama. January 1942</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Early in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> administration, in response to public pressure for greater black participation in the military as war approached, ordered the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_War_9516.html" title="United States Department of War">War Department</a> to create a black flying unit. Captain Davis was assigned to the first training class at Tuskegee Army Air Field (hence the name <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_Airmen_f325.html" title="Tuskegee Airmen">Tuskegee Airmen</a>), and in March 1942 won his wings as one of five black officers to complete the course. He was the first black officer to solo an Army Air Corps aircraft. In July that year, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was named commander of the first all-black air unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron.</p>
<p>The squadron, equipped with <a href="../../../p/-/4/P-40.html" title="P-40">P-40</a> fighters, was sent to <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunisia.html" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> in North Africa in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>. In <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2.html" title="June 2">June 2</a>, they saw combat for the first time in a dive-bombing mission against the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a>-held island of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantelleria.html" title="Pantelleria">Pantelleria</a>. The squadron later supported the Allied invasion of <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>.</p>
<p>In September of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, Davis was called back to the United States to take command of the 332d Fighter Group, a larger all-black unit preparing to go overseas.</p>
<p>Soon after his arrival, however, there was an attempt to stop the use of black pilots in combat. Senior officers in the Army Air Forces recommended to the Army chief of staff, General <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Marshall_cbfa.html" title="George Marshall">George Marshall</a>, that the 99th (Davis's old unit) be removed from combat operations as it had performed poorly. This infuriated Davis as he had never been told of any deficiencies with the unit. He held a news conference at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pentagon_612d.html" title="The Pentagon">The Pentagon</a> to defend his men and then presented his case to a War Department committee studying the use of black servicemen.</p>
<p>Marshall ordered an inquiry but allowed the 99th to continue fighting in the meantime. The inquiry eventually reported that the 99th's performance was comparable to other air units, but any questions about the squadron's fitness were answered in January 1944 when its pilots shot down 12 German planes in 2 days while protecting the Anzio beachhead.</p>
<p>Colonel Davis and his 332d Fighter Group arrived in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> soon after that. The four-squadron group, which was called the Red Tails for the distinctive markings of its planes, were based at Ramitelli and flew many missions deep into German territory. By summer 1944 the Group had transitioned to P-47s.</p>
<p>In the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, Davis took over the all-black 477th Bombardment Group, which was stationed at Godman Field, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>.</p>
<p>During the war, the airmen commanded by Davis had compiled an outstanding record in combat against the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>. They flew more than 15,000 sorties, shot down 111 enemy planes, and destroyed or damaged 273 on the ground at a cost of 66 of their own planes. They never lost a friendly bomber to enemy fighters on their escort missions.</p>
<p>Davis himself led dozens of missions in P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs. He received the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Star_18bc.html" title="Silver Star">Silver Star</a> for a strafing run into <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_%28USA%29_be6a.html" title="Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for a bomber-escort mission to <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In July of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, President <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_S._Truman_d2df.html" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> signed an executive order ordering the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_integration.html" title="Racial integration">racial integration</a> of the armed forces. Colonel Davis helped draft the Air Force plan for implementing this order. The Air Force was the first of the services to integrate fully.</p>
<p>Davis served at the Pentagon and in overseas posts over the next two decades. He again saw combat in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> when he assumed command of the <a href="../../../5/1/s/51st_Fighter_Wing_804b.html" title="51st Fighter Wing">51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing</a> and flew an <a href="../../../f/-/8/F-86.html" title="F-86">F-86</a> in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korea</a>. He gained the three stars of a lieutenant general in May <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, when he was the chief of staff for American forces in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. He was later commander of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirteenth_Air_Force_7fd2.html" title="Thirteenth Air Force">Thirteenth Air Force</a>, based in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, and assistant commander of the United States Strike Command, with headquarters in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of Davis's retirement in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, he held the rank of Lieutenant General, but on December 9, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> President <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> awarded him a fourth star, raising him to the rank of full general. After retirement, he headed the federal <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_marshal.html" title="Sky marshal">sky marshal</a> program, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> was named Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Environment, Safety, and Consumer Affairs. Overseeing the development of airport security and highway safety, Davis was one of the chief proponents of the 55 mile per hour speed limit to save gasoline and lives. He retired from the Department of Transportation in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> served on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Battle_Monuments_Commission_9e5b.html" title="American Battle Monuments Commission">American Battle Monuments Commission</a>, on which his father had served decades before. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> he published his autobiography, <i>Benjamin O.
