<p><b>Benjamin McLane Spock</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">May 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> â€“ <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>) was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pediatrics.html" title="Pediatrics">pediatrician</a> whose book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Common_Sense_Book_of_Baby_and_Child_Care_c43d.html" title="The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care">Baby and Child Care</a></i>, published in 1946, is one of the biggest best-sellers of all time. Its revolutionary message to mothers was that "you know more than you think you do." Spock was the first pediatrician to study <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoanalysis.html" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> to try to understand children's needs and family dynamics. His ideas about childcare influenced several generations of parents to be more flexible and affectionate with their children, and to treat them as individuals, whereas the previous conventional wisdom had been that child rearing should focus on building discipline, and that, e.g., babies should not be "spoiled" by picking them up when they cried.</p>

<p>Born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut_109e.html" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, Spock was expected by his parents to help with the care of his five younger siblings. Spock's father was a lawyer for a railroad company. His family were considered "Boston Brahmins." Spock received his undergraduate education from <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>, where he became a member of <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scroll_and_Key_583d.html" title="Scroll and Key">Scroll and Key</a> and the <a href="../../../z/e/t/Zeta_Psi_a2e4.html" title="Zeta Psi">Zeta Psi</a> fraternity, and was a <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport_rowing.html" title="Sport rowing">rower</a>.

<p>He married his first wife, Jane Cheney, and they raised children. Jane also helped him with his books. She later claimed that she received insufficient credit.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, he served as a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatrist.html" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_Reserve_14ee.html" title="United States Navy Reserve">U.S. Navy Reserve</a> Medical Corps, ending with the rank of lieutenant commander.</p>
<p>Spocks's baby book was a perennial bestseller. According to the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records_9c82.html" title="Guinness Book of World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>, it outsold all other books in the Nonfiction category except the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. The royalties made him a wealthy man.</p>
<p>Spock was an ardent sailor: he kept one sailboat, named "Carapace", in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Virgin_Islands_8844.html" title="British Virgin Islands">British Virgin Islands</a>, where he frequently visited the Peter Island Yacht Club; he kept a smaller boat in <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a>.</p>

<p>In 1976, Dr. Spock married a second time, to Mary Morgan, who had formerly arranged speeches and workshops for him. They built a home near <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogers%2C_Arkansas_d6e8.html" title="Rogers, Arkansas">Rogers, Arkansas</a>, on a lake, where Ben would row his scull early in the morning. Mary, the ex-wife of an Arkansas physician, quickly adapted to Ben's life of travel political activism, and she was arrested with him several times for <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_disobedience.html" title="Civil disobedience">civil disobedience</a>. She also introduced Ben to massage, yoga, and a macrobiotic diet, which reportedly improved his health. Mary helped him revise <i>Baby and Child Care</i> in 1976, incorporating <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-sexist_language.html" title="Non-sexist language">non-sexist language</a> and making other substantive changes.</p>
<p>For most of his life, Spock wore <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooks_Brothers_a835.html" title="Brooks Brothers">Brooks Brothers</a> suits and shirts (with separate collars), but Mary Morgan got him to try blue jeans, at 75, for the first time in his life.

<p>He learned a great deal about life as a step-parent from Mary's daughter Ginger (Virginia) Councille, who was 11 when they met. Years later, he walked her down the aisle, as illustrated in biographies.</p>
<p>Spock died at his rented home in <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Jolla%2C_California_7cd2.html" title="La Jolla, California">La Jolla, California</a> after a long battle with cancer. The expenses of his treatment consumed most of his wealth.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Spock_c797.html" title="Edit section: Books">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Books</span></h2>
<p>In 1946, Spock published his book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Common_Sense_Book_of_Baby_and_Child_Care_c43d.html" title="The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care">The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care</a></i>, which became a bestseller. By 1998 it had sold more than 50 million copies. It has been translated into 39 languages. Later he wrote three more books about parenting.</p>
<p>Spock advocated ideas about parenting that were at the time, considered out of the mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about a major change, if not a reversal, in the opinions of those who considered themselves to be the experts. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to sleep through the night (a notion that borrows from <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behaviorism.html" title="Behaviorism">behaviorism</a>). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them. The First Edition of Baby and Child Care followed the conventional wisdom on <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a>: he recommended it, although he was not circumcised himself (oddly enough, circumcision of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentile.html" title="Gentile">gentile</a> babies had first became fashionable in "Boston Brahmin" families like Spock's). In "The Sixth Edition" (1985) he wrote about circumcising healthy children, "There is no excuse for the operation â€” except as a religious rite. So I strongly recommend leaving the foreskin alone. Parents should insist on convincing reasons for circumcision â€” and there are no convincing reasons that I know of."</p>
<p>Later in life Spock wrote a book entitled "Dr. Spock on Vietnam" and co-wrote an autobiography entitled "Spock on Spock" (with Mary Morgan Spock), in which he stated his attitude toward aging: "Delay and Deny".</p>
<p>Other writers, such as Lynn Bloom and Thomas Maier, have written biographies of Dr. Spock.</p>

<p>Some have seen Spock as the leader in the move toward more permissive parenting in general, and have blamed him for what they saw as the negative results. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Vincent_Peale_cf4d.html" title="Norman Vincent Peale">Norman Vincent Peale</a> claimed in the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> that "the U.S. was paying the price of two generations that followed the Dr. Spock baby plan of instant gratification of needs."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Vice President <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiro_Agnew_94aa.html" title="Spiro Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> denounced him as the "father of permissiveness," claiming that Dr. Spock's child rearing principles encouraged lawlessness among young people in the 1960s.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Spock's supporters believed that these criticisms betrayed an ignorance of what Spock had actually written, and/or a political bias against Spock's left-wing political activities. Spock himself, in his autobiography, pointed out that he had never advocated permissiveness;<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> also, that the attacks and claims that he had ruined American youth only arose after his public opposition to the Vietnam war.

<p>Spock advocated that infants should be placed on their front when sleeping, commenting in his 1958 edition that "if [an infant] vomits, he's more likely to choke on the vomitus." This advice was extremely influential on health-care providers, with nearly unanimous support through to the 1990s.<sup id="_ref-gilbert-sleeping_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gilbert-sleeping" title="">[1]</a></sup> Later empirical studies, however, found that there is a significantly increased risk of <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome.html" title="Sudden infant death syndrome">sudden infant death syndrome</a> (SIDS) associated with sleeping in this position. Advocates of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence-based_medicine.html" title="Evidence-based medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> have used this as an example of the importance of basing health-care recommendations on statistical evidence, with one researcher estimating that as many as 50,000 infant deaths in Europe, Australia, and the US could have been prevented if this advice was altered in 1970 when such statistical evidence was available.<sup id="_ref-chalmers-healthreport_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chalmers-healthreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1957, Spock was one of the founders of <a href="../../../s/a/n/SANE_120f.html" title="SANE">The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy</a>. Spock was politically outspoken and active in the movement to end the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. In 1968 he was prosecuted by then Attorney General <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsey_Clark_7775.html" title="Ramsey Clark">Ramsey Clark</a>, alongside four other men, on charges of conspiracy to counsel, aid, and abet resistance to the draft. Spock and three of his alleged co-conspirators were convicted although the five had never been in the same room together. His two-year prison sentence was never served, as the case was appealed and in 1969 a federal court set aside his conviction.</p>
<p>In 1967, Spock was to be nominated as Dr. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr._19fa.html" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>'s vice-presidential running mate at the National Conference for New Politics over Labor Day weekend in Chicago. However, according to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_F._Pepper_a5f5.html" title="William F. Pepper">William F. Pepper</a>'s <i>Orders to Kill</i>, the conference was broken up by <i>agents provocateurs</i> working for the government.</p>
<p>Spock was the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Party_%28United_States%2C_1970s%29_4c6d.html" title="People's Party (United States, 1970s)">People's Party</a> candidate in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1972_dee0.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1972">1972 United States presidential election</a> with a platform that called for free medical care, the repeal of "<a href="../../../v/i/c/Victimless_crime.html" title="Victimless crime">victimless crime</a>" laws, including the legalization of abortion, homosexuality, and marijuana, a guaranteed minimum income for families and the immediate withdrawal of all American troops from foreign countries. <a href="http://rwor.org/a/v19/950-59/951/spock.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://rwor.org/a/v19/950-59/951/spock.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> In the 1970s and 1980s, Spock demonstrated and gave lectures against nuclear weapons and cuts in social welfare programs.</p>
<p>Spock embraced women's and girls' equality relatively early. Editions of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_and_Child_Care_853f.html" title="Baby and Child Care">Baby and Child Care</a> issued in the mid-1970s were edited to refer to babies and children as "she" about half the time. This was a departure from the norm at that time. Especially among established authors of Spock's age, there was still a strong school of thought claiming that the pronoun "he" was correct for all persons unless speaking of a specific female or female matters. Spock's book was the first major/mainstream book to abandon that view and usage.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

Based on Fort Dix regulations 210-26 and 210-27, General David refused the request. Spock, Hobson, Jenness, Pulley, and others then filed a case that ultimately made its way to the United States Supreme Court (424 U.S. 828 -- Greer, Commander, Fort Dix Military Reservation, et al., v. Spock et al), which ruled against the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaintiff.html" title="Plaintiff">plaintiffs</a>.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular rumor, Dr. Spock's son did not commit suicide. Spock had two children: Michael, formerly the director of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Children%27s_Museum_8998.html" title="Boston Children's Museum">Boston Children's Museum</a> and since retired from the museum profession. However, Spock's grandson Peter did commit suicide on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> at the age of 22 by jumping from the roof of the Boston Children's Museum. He had long struggled with mental illness.</p>
<p>It is common to see "Dr. Spock" confused with the fictional character "<a href="../../../s/p/o/Spock.html" title="Spock">Mr. Spock</a>" of <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> fame, particularly in references from people unfamiliar with the field of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>. Reportedly, Trek creator <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Roddenberry_868c.html" title="Gene Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> did not intentionally name the character after Dr. Spock; this was a coincidence.</p>
