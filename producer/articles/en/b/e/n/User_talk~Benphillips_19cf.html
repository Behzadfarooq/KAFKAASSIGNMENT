<p>Hi Benphillips, Great work on the 2nd Guards Taman. I assume from your WPMILHIST note that you may push on with other Guards divisions of the Russian Ground Forces. I linked the 2nd Guards into place in the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Ground_Forces_2b92.html" title="Russian Ground Forces">Russian Ground Forces</a> article as you can see. Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 22:51, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks Ben for your note. I'd say the 4th Guards Tank is probably the next priority, yes. Keep up the good work! <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 19:49, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Great work on building up the 4th Kantemirov entry. One thing that might improve it is listing your sources at the bottom of the article. Which one do you intend to do next? Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 20:56, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, there are some good sources that you only need to run through Babelfish. Look at <a href="http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/glavn.htm" class="external free" title="http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/glavn.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www8.brinkster.com/vad777/glavn.htm</a>. Babelfish has a feature of linking between translated pages, so you should be alright. The Kantemirov Division returned to the Moscow area in Autumn 1945 (so I've just read) and has stayed there ever since. Probably it's first deployment since 45 was Chechniya. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 21:32, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you going to push on with the 106th? Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 18:51, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Great work on the 106th Guards. I think the thing you should do next is add a little note on sources, saying either:</p>
<p>-newspaper stories, New York Times etc or</p>
<ul>
<li>David Glantz, (2006) 'The Russian Army in the Third Milennium', Buckshot Publishing, p.101</li>
</ul>
<p>This was because I was reading through your article on the 106th and wondering where the info came from. One further note, Mark L. Urban in Soviet Land Power (1985) listed the honorifics of the 106th as 'Dneiper-Transbaikal'. Please be careful and don't list the division's current home base as the actual honorific. Please don't take these thoughts as criticism; you're doing brilliantly, though these minor tweaks would be helpful. Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 02:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Have a bit more info on the 'Dneiper-Transbaikal' business. Albert Conner &amp; Robert Poirier (1985), Red Army Order of Battle in the GPW, lists 106th Rifle Division as having both those honorifics. Urban may have made a mistake, because it seems from your writing that whatever the predecessor to 106 VDD, and 106 RD, they were both active during the Second World War. Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 08:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, my preference would be 10th Guards 'Ural-Lvov' Tank Division, former 10 GTC, former 30 TC; there's masses of info on the 76th all over the place. This was the division that was 'dumped into the open fields' at Boguchar when it returned from Germany and was told to build its own barracks - I'll source that quote. Regiments have stayed the same since conversion from Tk Bdes when it transitioned to a Tk Div. Be careful with 6th MRR, at Kursk - it is the ex 6 MRB, the Berlin garrison brigade, and it is still in existance (Duncan, JIR, 1996), despite what some sources may say (Feskov, I think, says it disbanded). Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 01:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC) Source it to: Pavel Baev, The Russian Army in a Time of Troubles, International Peace Research Institute, Oslo, 1996. Keep up the good work..! Cheers <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 23:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Noticed you had removed references to 'Motorised Rifle Regiment's in the 2 Gds Taman article. Whether you prefer 'Motorised Rifle' or 'Motor Rifle' the 'Rifle' should be mentioned, as that is the literal Russian. Shouldn't be just 'Motorised Regiment'.
