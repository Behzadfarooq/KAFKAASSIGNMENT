	    <p>Lawsuit Discussion Interesting discrepancy I found on "The Hoya" Website, the newspaper for Georgetown. In the September 22 article found at <a href="http://www.thehoya.com/news/092206/news1.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.thehoya.com/news/092206/news1.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehoya.com/news/092206/news1.cfm</a> stated as a fact that Mr. Maniaci was removed and taken to be "detained near the Bunn Intercultural Center." While the President of Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine Hammad Hammad claimed that after being "escorted out of Healy Hall" that he saw Mr. Maniaci standing "unaccompanied after the incident". He wrote this in a editorial letter found at <a href="http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092606/view8.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092606/view8.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092606/view8.cfm</a> so this means that either the official report is lying and Mr. Maniaci was not taken and detained at Bunn Intercultural Center or the President of the Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine is conspiring something. Interesting.</p>

Don't make unreasonable page moves. By Wikipedia policy, there is only one article per topic. Creating a second article on the exact same topic with a different title is against this policy.

<p>Hello again, Bill. I'm glad you haven't given up yet. You should always try to resolve disputes on Wkipedia through collaborative discussion on talk pages, through e-mail, on IRC, etc. But occassionally consensus cannot be reached on some controversial issues. Therefore, Wikipedia has established a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_Disputes_5b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving Disputes">dispute resolution process</a>, consisting of several different avenues for reaching consensus. In my opinion, the most appropriate avenue for the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Defense_League_6e46.html" title="Jewish Defense League">JDL</a> dispute is a <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERFM_dd02.html" title="WP:RFM">Request for Mediation</a>. Since you are the Deputy Chairman of the organization in question, I don't think you would be jumping the gun by requesting mediation. Wikipedia has a number of mediators who would be happy to work with you to fix the article. If they feel that you should try another means of dispute resolution, they will let you know. Of course, you may voluntarily select another avenue of dispute resolution if you prefer. If you need any help setting up a request for comment or mediation, or if you need any other help finding your way around the Wikipedia community, you know where to find me. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride">Tantalum</a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride">T</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride">lluride</a> 04:30, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bill -</p>
<p>I don't know if you have had a chance to see it, but this weekend I drafted a proposed rewrite for the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Defense_League_6e46.html" title="Jewish Defense League">Jewish Defense League</a> page. It is at <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_Jewish_Defense_League_22ee.html" title="User:Twp/Jewish Defense League">User:Twp/Jewish Defense League</a> if you would like to review it.</p>
<p>I expect that the draft I wrote is not the one you'd like to see up there. That's understandable. My goal was to write a description of the JDL that sticks as closely as possible to existing sources of specific events, and one that (I hope) avoids speculation and generalization entirely. I've included the entire article structure that you wrote, and included the JDL mission statement from your web site, and I think included just about every link that you have submitted to document your position. It also includes some of the links that other people submitted in support of their positions. I've tried to turn the result into something that, I hope, is fair to everyone.</p>
<p>I'm very interested hearing your comments, and seeing if we can move toward a result that everyone can live with. Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>G'day Bill,</p>
<p>this note is about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jewish_Defense_League_%28The_Real_Story%29_d167.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jewish Defense League (The Real Story)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jewish Defense League (The Real Story)</a>. You expressed confusion about AfD and the concept of a "fork". Basically, what the AfDers were saying was that <i>Jewish Defense League (The Real Story)</i> existed solely to write about the JDL from a different point of view. All articles on Wikipedia are (or should be) written in accordance with our <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> policy. If you don't feel that an article is neutral ("NPOV"), the appropriate thing is to discuss your issues on the talkpage, and to fix up the original article yourself. Creating a new version of the article to address point of view issues is called a "POV fork", and people don't tend to like them very much.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on my talkpage, or by email. Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:09, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shalom Bill. I thought you might want to know, I've removed the JDL from the "list of terrorist organizations" page. I felt that as per the JDL article, and this line in it "The National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT) says in its knowledge base that the last known attack by JDL was on February 26, 1992 and that "(t)oday, JDL is not actively engaged in terrorist actions."", it no longer qualifies to be on the terrorist list alongside the likes of Hamas, etc. Just thought I'd let you know. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester">Swatjester</a> 16:01, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
