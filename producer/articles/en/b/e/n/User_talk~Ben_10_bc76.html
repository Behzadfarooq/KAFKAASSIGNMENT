<p>hey Ben10, I really like all the info you are putting into the Bambi 2 page. But I think you don't quite understand how to write that info down. You're not supposed to address the reader in any way, and you have done that an awful lot. Also you shouldn't use phrases like, "you'll just have to see for yourself" and "...ends up utilizing a skunk's, ahh, signature weapon". I think it's extremely important for you to understand that the entries here on wikipedia are not conversations. They are encyclopedic text. If you need a reference, just look in an encyclopedia. That should be your format. Also you shouldn't use quotes like "as one viewer said". Not only are these quotes unable to be cited, but they also serve really no purpose. There's no reason to read between the lines and add in your own personal opinions about different things. As an editor, you must take an unopinionated side and give ONLY the facts presented in the movie. I really do enjoy your info, and I also had a few bumps when I started writing for this website, but you'll get the hang of it. Just think more encyclopedia rather than conversational.--<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinklewtt_29dd.html" title="User:Linklewtt">Linklewtt</a> 10:13, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That's cool that that Disney Encyclopedia website runs that way (in fact, can you give me the web address), but it's just different here on Wikipedia. Trust me, I was not into writing the way you have to on here, but I learned that it really is the best and most concise way to get information across.</p>
<p>For one thing, when you put in little things about waht certain fans say about this or that, it doesn't work. A big thing about Wikipedia is its sources and references, and let's face it - fans are not references. That's why I delete a lot of your stuff that says, "As one fan put it". It just is not the way an article should be written. Now on the Disney website, it could be written that way because all those people are fans of Disney. But Wikipedia represents articles of so many different topics, so all the articles need to be written in a similar fashion. That's the only reason why I get o your case about stuff.</p>
<p>I read your Faline article, and I was impressed. However, I did need to correct certain "fan" instances. You are correct that you cannot interview these characters; that is why it is very very important to only talk about the facts presented. If everyone goes off on their opinions, then we have an opinionated article full of unverifiable texts and ideas. See what I mean? Wikipedia is not the place for brainstorming; that Disney website is. Thousands of people view these articles for information that they want to know. And it is our responsibility to tell them the correct information.</p>

<p>Hi Ben 10&#160;:-) Whether or not you can use an image on your user or talk page depends on the type of licence the image has. I looked at the licence for *Image:Ben10showlogo.JPG* thinking maybe that was the one you were interested in using on your user page. Since that image does not have a <i>free content type licence</i> it can only be used in articles under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> policy exceptions. Images under this licence can not be added to talk pages or user pages (see #9) only on articles. Sorry, if that was the image you wanted to use. You might see other people doing this wrong. They will be asked to remove the image when some clueful editor sees it. If you want me to check on another image for you let me know. Take care, <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 15:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The beliefs of the Chinese Calendar is not the same as astrology. Or rather not the same as Greek astrology. It comes from a different culture (China) and is alike with Greek astrology in certain aspects, but should not be labeled as just astrology but Chinese astrology.

<p>Hello, Ben10. I was looking at the discussion box for the Dragons in Our Midst article and I believe you said that you were the one who first made the article? I'd like to help expand the article a bit (although I don't think I can get any pictures). I have read all four of the original series and I just finished reading Eye of the Oracle of the Oracles of Fire series. I was thinking, do you think we should also include information about the Oracles of Fire series into the article too? Or should there be a seperate page for Oracles of Fire? I was just asking for your opinion.</p>
<p>Also, sorry to stray away from the main topic, but I have to say I like your user info, you are a lot like me in many aspects. I was wondering, did you make all of those user boxes? If so, may I request that I may use some for my user page as well? Thank you for your time and patience in reading this message. <a href="../../../u/n/k/User%7EUnknown_Dragon_ef15.html" title="User:Unknown Dragon">Unknown Dragon</a> 23:06, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, this is <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_10_28bc.html" title="User:Ben 10">Ben 10</a>. Sure you can expand the article on <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragons_In_Our_Midst_dd19.html" title="Dragons In Our Midst">Dragons In Our Midst</a>. That's what Wiipedia is for! Just make sure you keep it accurate. I don't know what the norm is for a connected series, but having a separate article for Oracles of Fire sounds like a good idea to me. To the best of my knowledge any two related articles (say a movie and its sequel) will have links to each other and sometimes info about each other, although generally speaking an article will mostly refer to its own specific subject. For example, the "Teaching and Ministry" section of the article about <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> has a list of other articles at the top in case someone wants more info, but the Jesus article itself contains little info on, for example, the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Apostles_56fc.html" title="Twelve Apostles">Twelve Apostles</a>. I suggest you don't worry about it too much. If you're doing something wrong, someone'll let you know (trust me, I goofed up plenty when I was getting used to the system too).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Concerning the userboxes you asked about, knock yourself out&#160;:) The only ones I made myself are the ones about <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bambi.html" title="Bambi">Bambi</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dragon_Jake_Long_61cd.html" title="American Dragon Jake Long">American Dragon Jake Long</a>, the <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnitrix.html" title="Omnitrix">Omnitrix</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_Rovers_ce69.html" title="Road Rovers">Road Rovers</a>, and <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragons.html" title="Dragons">dragons</a>, and I'd be happy to let you or anyone else use them. As far as I know you don't have to ask about putting userboxes from anyone else's page onto your page. And since I've been collecting boxes made by other users for months now with no complaints, I'm pretty sure that means it's OK. It's nice of you to be so concientious about it, though.</dd>
