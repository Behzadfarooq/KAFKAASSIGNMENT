<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_McCulloch_3dee.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>He was born <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1811.html" title="1811">1811</a> in <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutherford_County%2C_Tennessee_7491.html" title="Rutherford County, Tennessee">Rutherford County, Tennessee</a>, one of twelve children and the fourth son of Alexander McCulloch and Frances Fisher LeNoir. His father, a <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> graduate, was an officer on Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Coffee_e042.html" title="John Coffee">John Coffee</a>'s staff during the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creek_War_98f6.html" title="Creek War">Creek War</a> of 1813 and 1814 in <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> (and apparently of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_New_Orleans_435a.html" title="Battle of New Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a> in 1814); his mother was a daughter of a prominent <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">planter</a>. The family had been wealthy, politically influential, and socially prominent in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a> before the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> but Alexander had wasted much of his inheritance and was unable even to educate his sons. (Though two of Ben's older brothers had briefly attended a school in Tennessee taught by their neighbor, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Houston_9901.html" title="Sam Houston">Sam Houston</a>.) One of Ben's younger brothers was <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Eustace_McCulloch_8baa.html" title="Henry Eustace McCulloch">Henry Eustace McCulloch</a>, also a Confederate general officer. Another brother, Alexander, served in the Texas Revolution and as a captain in Mexico.</p>
<p>Ben, who never married (claiming it was because he was always away from home for such long periods), was described as being about five foot ten inches tall, though of slight build, with light hair and brilliant blue eyes.</p>
<p>The McCulloch family, like many on the frontier, moved often by choice or necessity; in the twenty years following their move from North Carolina and Ben's birth, they lived in eastern Tennessee, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, and then western Tennessee, finally settling at <a href="../../../d/y/e/Dyersburg%2C_Tennessee_9271.html" title="Dyersburg, Tennessee">Dyersburg</a>, where one of their closest neighbors was <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Crockett_8071.html" title="David Crockett">David Crockett</a> -- a great influence on young Ben.</p>
<p>In 1834, McCulloch headed west. He reached St. Louis just too late to join the fur trappers headed for the mountains for the season, tried to join a freight company headed for <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Fe%2C_New_Mexico_6a40.html" title="Santa Fe, New Mexico">Santa Fe</a> as a mule skinner but was told they had a full complement, and moved on to <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> to investigate the lead-mining business but found all the best claims already staked by the large mining companies. In the fall of 1835, he returned to Tennessee.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_McCulloch_3dee.html" title="Edit section: Texas career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Texas career</span></h2>
<p>When Crockett went to Texas in 1835 (following his defeat in his third <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">congressional</a> campaign), Ben McCulloch -- tired of farming, seeking adventure, and with no formal schooling but considerable natural ability for getting things done -- decided to accompany him, as did Henry, planning to meet Crockett's Tennessee Boys at <a href="../../../n/a/c/Nacogdoches%2C_Texas_a604.html" title="Nacogdoches, Texas">Nacogdoches</a> on Christmas Day. Ben contracted measles, however, and was bedridden for several weeks; they arrived too late at Nacogdoches but pressed on toward <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio%2C_Texas_74ae.html" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio</a>. The delay prevented them from arriving in San Antonio until the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alamo_Mission_in_San_Antonio_c743.html" title="Alamo Mission in San Antonio">Alamo</a> had already fallen.</p>
<p>McCulloch joined the Texas army under Sam Houston in its retreat to east Texas. Assigned to Capt. Isaac N. Moreland's artillery company at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_San_Jacinto_6a01.html" title="Battle of San Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">21 April</a> <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>), he commanded one of the "Twin Sisters" -- two six-pounder (2.7 kg) cannon sent to aid the Texans by the citizens of <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_33af.html" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati</a>. He made deadly use of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapeshot.html" title="Grapeshot">grapeshot</a> against the Mexican positions and received a battlefield commission as <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_lieutenant.html" title="First lieutenant">first lieutenant</a>. For his service (dating before 18 April 1836), McCulloch was issued Texas Bounty Certificate No. 2473 for 320 acres (1.3&#160;kmÂ²). In 1839, he also received Donation Certificate No. 776 for 640 acres (2.6&#160;kmÂ²), for service at San Jacinto.</p>
<p>McCulloch was then attached to Capt. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_H._Smith_17c2.html" title="William H. Smith">William H. Smith</a>'s cavalry company, but left the army to revisit Tennessee and returned a few months later with a company of thirty volunteers under the command of Robert Crockett (Davy's son).</p>
<p>By 1838, he had taken up the profession of surveying land for the new <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Texas_b889.html" title="Republic of Texas">Republic of Texas</a> in and around the community of <a href="../../../s/e/g/Seguin%2C_Texas_9525.html" title="Seguin, Texas">Seguin</a>, and later joined the Texas Rangers as lieutenant to Capt. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Coffee_Hays_d372.html" title="John Coffee Hays">John Coffee "Jack" Hays</a>. He soon acquired a reputation as an Indian fighter, favoring <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotgun.html" title="Shotgun">shotguns</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pistol.html" title="Pistol">pistols</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowie_knife.html" title="Bowie knife">Bowie knives</a> to the regulation <a href="../../../s/a/b/Saber.html" title="Saber">saber</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbine.html" title="Carbine">carbine</a>.</p>
<p>Largely on the strength of his new fame, he was elected to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Texas_b889.html" title="Republic of Texas">Republic of Texas</a> House of Representatives in 1839. The campaign was contentious, and McCulloch fought a rifle <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duel.html" title="Duel">duel</a> the next year against Col. Reuben Ross, resulting in a wound that left his right arm crippled for life. Ben considered the matter closed but it flared up again the following year, this time involving Henry, who killed Ross with a pistol.</p>
<p>In 1842, McCulloch went back to surveying and intermittent military service. At the Battle of Plum Creek, <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">12 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840.html" title="1840">1840</a>, he served as a scout against the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comanche.html" title="Comanche">Comanches</a> and then commanded the right wing of the Texas army. When a Mexican raiding party under Gen. <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Vasquez_85d0.html" title="Rafael Vasquez">Rafael Vasquez</a> invested San Antonio in February 1842, McCulloch was prominent in the fighting that pushed the Mexicans back beyond the <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_Grande_d569.html" title="Rio Grande">Rio Grande</a>. A second Mexican raid led by Gen. <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Woll_d1d5.html" title="Adrian Woll">Adrian Woll</a> in September of the same year again captured San Antonio, and McCulloch again served as a scout for Capt. Hays's Rangers. He and his brother, Henry, subsequently took part in the failed Somervell expedition and both men escaped very shortly before most of the Texans were captured at Mier, Mexico in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamaulipas.html" title="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">25 December</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1842.html" title="1842">1842</a>.</p>
<p>Samuel Reid, a volunteer from <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> described McCulloch and his Ranger company as "men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger, and a brace of pistols around their waists, [who] were occupied drying their blankets, cleaning and fixing their guns, and some employed cooking at different fires, while other were grooming their horses. A rougher-looking set we never saw. They were without tents, and a miserable shed afforded them the only shelter. Captain McCulloch introduced us to his officers and many of his men, who appeared orderly and well-mannered people. But from their rough exterior, it was hard to tell who or what they were. Notwithstanding their ferocious and outlaw look, there were among them doctors and lawyers and many a college graduate."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_McCulloch_3dee.html" title="Edit section: War with Mexico">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">War with Mexico</span></h2>
<p>In 1845, McCulloch was elected from <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonzales_County%2C_Texas_e1d8.html" title="Gonzales County, Texas">Gonzales County</a> to the first <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislature_of_Texas_a5a4.html" title="Legislature of Texas">Texas state legislature</a> following entry into the union. In the spring of 1846, a law was passed appointing him Major General in command of all Texas militia west of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_River_4ec7.html" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a>. That same year, at the outbreak of the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican-American_War_f1a1.html" title="Mexican-American War">war with Mexico</a>, he raised a company of Rangers that became Company A of Col. Hays's 1st Regiment of Texas Mounted Volunteers, and who were known for their ability to regularly travel 250 miles in ten days or less. He subsequently was named chief of scouts under Gen. <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachary_Taylor_d92b.html" title="Zachary Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, with the rank of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a>, and became known nationwide for his daring exploits in northern <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. (His company of scouts included George Wilkins Kendall, editor of the New Orleans <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_Picayune_11ed.html" title="New Orleans Picayune">Picayune</a></i>.) By this time, McCulloch was fluent in Spanish and his woodsman's skills enabled him to slip back and forth across the lines undetected -- more than once penetrating to within a mile of Santa Anna's own tent.</p>
<p>McCulloch led his scouting company as mounted infantry at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Monterrey_fe24.html" title="Battle of Monterrey">Battle of Monterrey</a> and his expert reconnaissance work preceding the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Buena_Vista_4bfb.html" title="Battle of Buena Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a> probably saved Taylor's army from disaster. After Buena Vista he was promoted to the rank of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">major</a> of U.S. Volunteers.</p>
<p>After the war, McCulloch scouted for Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_E._Twiggs_fa8b.html" title="David E. Twiggs">David E. Twiggs</a> but joined the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Gold_Rush_e2d6.html" title="California Gold Rush">rush</a> to the California gold fields in 1849. And while he did not strike gold, he was elected <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff.html" title="Sheriff">sheriff</a> of <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento%2C_California_50bc.html" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento</a>. (His old commander, Col. Hays, had been elected sheriff of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco%2C_California_b6e2.html" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a> on the same day.) His old friends, Sam Houston and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_Rusk_a6af.html" title="Thomas Jefferson Rusk">Thomas J. Rusk</a>, both now in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a>, tried to arrange for his appointment to command a frontier army regiment, but his lack of formal education was against him and the appointment never went through. In 1852, Pres. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Pierce_eb91.html" title="Franklin Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> promised him command of the U.S. Second Cavalry, but Secretary of War <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> gave command instead to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Sidney_Johnston_bdce.html" title="Albert Sidney Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a>.</p>
<p>McCulloch was appointed U.S. marshal for the Eastern District of Texas in 1852, serving throughout the Pierce and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">Buchanan</a> administrations. However, feeling his lack of formal military education, he actually spent much of his term of office studying military science in libraries in Washington, D.C. In 1858, as one of the peace commissioners sent to negotiate with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a> in <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah.html" title="Utah">Utah</a> (the other being former Gov. <a href="../../../l/a/z/Lazarus_W._Powell_d6eb.html" title="Lazarus W. Powell">Lazarus W. Powell</a> of Kentucky), he helped to prevent open <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_War_b353.html" title="Utah War">warfare</a> between the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_93f0.html" title="History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Mormons</a> and the federal government, which had sent troops under the command of Gen. Johnston.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_McCulloch_3dee.html" title="Edit section: Civil War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Civil War</span></h2>
<p>Texas <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">seceded</a> from the union on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>, and on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_14.html" title="February 14">14 February</a>, McCulloch received a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">colonel</a>'s commission from Jefferson Davis, with the comment that "to Texans, a moment's notice is sufficient when their State demands their service." He was authorized to demand the surrender of all federal military posts in the state, and on the morning of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_16.html" title="February 16">16 February</a>, Gen. Twiggs, finding that more than 1,000 Texas troops had surrounded his government installations in an orderly manner during the night, turned over to McCulloch all federal property in San Antonio, in return for his troops being able to leave the state unharmed. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_11.html" title="May 11">May 11</a>, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed McCulloch a brigadier generalâ€”the second in rank by date of commission and the first appointed who was not presently serving in the military.</p>
<p>McCulloch was placed in command of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Territory_1bdc.html" title="Indian Territory">Indian Territory</a>, set up his headquarters at <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock%2C_Arkansas_8f37.html" title="Little Rock, Arkansas">Little Rock</a>, and began piecing together an Army of the West, with regiments from Texas, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, and Louisiana. He disagreed strongly with his superior, Gen. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling_Price_4982.html" title="Sterling Price">Sterling Price</a> of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, but with the assistance of Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Pike_b090.html" title="Albert Pike">Albert Pike</a>, he was able to build alliances for the Confederacy with the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee.html" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choctaw.html" title="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creek_%28people%29.html" title="Creek (people)">Creek</a> nations.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>, McCulloch's troops, though relatively poorly armed, handily defeated the army of Gen. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathaniel_Lyon_0453.html" title="Nathaniel Lyon">Nathaniel Lyon</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Wilson%27s_Creek_7d68.html" title="Battle of Wilson's Creek">Battle of Wilson's Creek</a>, Missouri. "We have an average of only twenty-five rounds of ammunition to the man," McCulloch reported, "and no more to be had short of Fort Smith and Baton Rouge." He did not have a high opinion of Price's Missourians, noting that they were undisciplined, commanded mostly by incompetent and inexperienced politicians, and possessed only a poor mix of weapons and equipment. For some 5,000 of them, their enlistment time was up and they were anxious to go home. Cooperation between the Arkansas and Missouri contingents was feeble, with "little cordiality of feeling between the two armies." His lack of confidence in the Missourians led McCulloch to hesitate when a bold attack might well have destroyed Lyon's smaller force and given Missouri to the Confederacy.</p>
<p>The continuing feud between McCulloch and Price led to the appointment of Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Van_Dorn_5be1.html" title="Earl Van Dorn">Earl Van Dorn</a> to overall command, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Heth_1e71.html" title="Henry Heth">Henry Heth</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braxton_Bragg_2201.html" title="Braxton Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a> having declined the honor. When Van Dorn launched an expedition against <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, a strategy McCulloch strongly opposed, it was again McCulloch's reconnaissance that contributed most to what little success Van Dorn's plan was able to achieve.</p>
<p>McCulloch commanded the Confederate right wing at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pea_Ridge_5633.html" title="Battle of Pea Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a>, Arkansas (or Elkhorn Tavern), and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">7 March</a> <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>, after much maneuvering, he overran a key Union artillery battery. Union resistance stiffened late in the morning, however, and as McCulloch rode forward to scout out enemy positions, he was shot out of the saddle and died instantly. McCulloch always disliked army uniforms and was wearing a black velvet civilian suit and Wellington boots at the time of his death. Credit for the fatal shot was claimed by sharpshooter Peter Pelican of the 36th <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> Infantry.</p>
<p>McCulloch's next in command, Brig. Gen. James M. McIntosh, commanding the cavalry, was killed a few minutes later in a charge to recover McCulloch's body. Col. <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_H%C3%A9bert_%28colonel%29_8f99.html" title="Louis HÃ©bert (colonel)">Louis HÃ©bert</a> was captured in the same charge, and the Confederate division, with no remaining leadership, slowly fell apart and withdrew. Historians generally blame the Confederate disaster at Pea Ridge and the subsequent loss of undefended Arkansas on the untimely death of Gen. Ben McCulloch.</p>
<p>McCulloch's body was buried on the field at Pea Ridge but was subsequently removed with other victims of the battle to a cemetery in Little Rock. He was later reinterred in the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_State_Cemetery_09a5.html" title="Texas State Cemetery">Texas State Cemetery</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin</a>; the gravesite is in the Republic Hill section of the Cemetery, Row N, No. 4. His papers are housed at the Center for American History (previously the Barker Texas History Center) at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_at_Austin_7a6d.html" title="University of Texas at Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>. <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCulloch_County%2C_Texas_a45b.html" title="McCulloch County, Texas">McCulloch County, Texas</a>, formed in 1856 and located in the present geographical center of the state, was named for him. He is also one of thirty men inducted into the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Fisher_6b8e.html" title="Fort Fisher">Fort Fisher</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco%2C_Texas_3edc.html" title="Waco, Texas">Waco</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after Pea Ridge, Albert Pike, now a brigadier general, constructed Fort McCulloch as the principal Confederate fortification in the southern section of the Indian Territory, naming it after his late commander. It was built on a bluff on the south bank of the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_River_5db9.html" title="Blue River">Blue River</a> and is now located in <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_County%2C_Oklahoma_a41a.html" title="Bryan County, Oklahoma">Bryan County, Oklahoma</a>. It was placed on the U.S. <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1971.</p>
<p>Camp Ben McCulloch was established near Austin in 1896 as a reunion site for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Confederate_Veterans_8e07.html" title="United Confederate Veterans">United Confederate Veterans</a> and is the last such site still owned by the UCV's descendant group, Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy. It is now a public recreation facility of some 200 acres (0.8&#160;kmÂ²) and is a popular location for Central Texas musical festivals.</p>
<p>Several other members of McCulloch's family followed him to Texas, including his mother, who died in <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_County%2C_Texas_ff3a.html" title="Ellis County, Texas">Ellis County</a> in 1866 at the home of another son, John C. McCulloch, who had been a captain in the Confederate army. Her remains were exhumed in 1938 by the State of Texas and reinterred beside those of Gen. McCulloch, and a joint monument was erected. Other siblings lived in <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonzales%2C_Texas_b433.html" title="Gonzales, Texas">Gonzales</a> and in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walker_County%2C_Texas_3817.html" title="Walker County, Texas">Walker County</a>.</p>
