<p><b>Benjamin Randell Harris</b> was a British infantryman who served in the British army during the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. He is most widely remembered today as the author of a memoir of his time in the army entitled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Recollections_of_Rifleman_Harris_9a1a.html" title="The Recollections of Rifleman Harris">The Recollections of Rifleman Harris</a></i>, which affords us a rare insight into the world of the enlisted man in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Wellington</a>'s army. Most memoirs published after the war came from serving officers, and the experiences of ordinary soldiers were overlooked due to the illiteracy of so many people at that time. Harris himself was illiterate, his recollections were recorded for him at some stage in the middle of the 1830s by an officer who knew him, Captain Henry Curling. Curling then kept the manuscript until <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>, when he succeeded in getting it published.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Randell_Harris_7eeb.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Benjamin Harris is vague about his origins in his text, but investigations by Eileen Hathaway <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> have revealed that he was born in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsea.html" title="Portsea">Portsea</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hampshire.html" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> to Robert and Elizabeth Harris around the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_28.html" title="October 28">28 October</a> <a href="../../../1/7/8/1781.html" title="1781">1781</a>. His family however were shepherds from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalbridge.html" title="Stalbridge">Stalbridge</a> in North <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset.html" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, and it was here that Benjamin grew up, in a large family with whom he remained until <a href="../../../1/8/0/1803.html" title="1803">1803</a>. In that year he was drafted into the <a href="../../../6/6/t/66th_Regiment_of_Foot_3239.html" title="66th Regiment of Foot">66th Regiment of Foot</a> somewhat against his will, and forcibly marched to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester.html" title="Winchester">Winchester</a>, where he underwent training in preparation for deployment against the French as the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Amiens_80ac.html" title="Peace of Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a> was drawing to a close. It was whilst stationed there that he was randomly selected as part of a <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firing_squad.html" title="Firing squad">firing squad</a> to execute a deserter, and action which he reports <i>"for many years afterwards remained deeply impressed on my mind"</i> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. Shortly afterwards he was despatched as a garrison force to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and served duty in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28city%29.html" title="Cork (city)">Cork</a> and in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, where he met and joined a newly formed regiment, the <a href="../../../9/5/t/95th_Regiment_of_Foot_1f08.html" title="95th Regiment of Foot">95th Regiment of Foot</a>, the now infamous green-jacketed riflemen.</p>
<p>From Ireland, Harris was returned to England following a period with a recruiting party, and rapidly settled into regimental life, learning to become a <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobbler.html" title="Cobbler">cobbler</a> in addition to his regular duties, by which means he made a substantial amount of money which later enabled him to afford medical treatment which saved his life. Harris' first experience of military service came in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>, when he participated in the brief land campaign which accompanied the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Copenhagen_%281807%29_7be6.html" title="Battle of Copenhagen (1807)">Bombardment of Copenhagen</a>. He saw action in the skirmish at Køge (which was also the first action of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> following his return from India). Soon afterwards, he and his unit returned to England on captured Danish vessels.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Randell_Harris_7eeb.html" title="Edit section: Peninsula War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Peninsula War</span></h3>
<p>Harris was soon moving again, sailing to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugal.html" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> to participate in the opening actions of the British involvement in the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsula_War_a0d2.html" title="Peninsula War">Peninsula War</a>. Harris was at the very first action, a skirmish at the town of <a href="../../../o/b/i/Obidos.html" title="Obidos">Obidos</a>, where he saw Lieutenant Ralph Bunbury fall, the first British casualty of the war. On the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a> he was in the hotly contested skirmish line at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Rolica_c7b8.html" title="Battle of Rolica">Battle of Rolica</a>, and saw serious opposition for the first time, reporting it as an exhilarating and terrifying experience. Many of his companions were killed at this action and the ensuing <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vimeiro_4e48.html" title="Battle of Vimeiro">Battle of Vimeiro</a>, but Harris remained unhurt, continuing the march to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salamanca.html" title="Salamanca">Salamanca</a> before becoming trapped in northern Spain with the rest of Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Moore_%28British_soldier%29_e1c6.html" title="John Moore (British soldier)">John Moore</a>'s army. Harris missed the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Corunna_8c7e.html" title="Battle of Corunna">Battle of Corunna</a> which culminated the campaign, but the sights and horrors of the march remained with him for decades to come, and he was lucky to escape, claiming to be the very last man collected from the beaches at <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigo.html" title="Vigo">Vigo</a>, and embarkign for England in a severely weakened state.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Randell_Harris_7eeb.html" title="Edit section: Walcheren">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Walcheren</span></h3>
<p>The biggest unheval in Harris' life was the disastrous <a href="../../../1/8/0/1809.html" title="1809">1809</a> <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walcheren_Expedition_eb29.html" title="Walcheren Expedition">Walcheren Expedition</a>, in which a British force was sent to the islands of <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walcheren.html" title="Walcheren">Walcheren</a> of the Dutch coast with the aim of destroying the dykes and lock gates there to render the port of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> unusable for the French navy. The expedition totally failed, as it was unable to take any of the islands major towns and bivouaced in squalid conditions during the summer, resulting in a plague of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhoid.html" title="Typhoid">typhoid</a> which killed over 4,000 soldiers and permanently disabled 12,000 from a force of 40,000. Harris was amongst those disabled, spending months in plague wards from which he was never expected to recover, and on at least one occasion only surviving through the extra medical care he received thanks to his financial reserves. Although he was recalled to his regiment in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a> for service in Spain, he was unable to attend due to recurring bouts of malaria, and spent much of the period between 1809 and <a href="../../../1/8/1/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a> in hospitals or his father's home in Stalbridge, especially after Wellington had decreed that no men who served in Walcheren were to be sent to the Peninsula as they were unfit for further service. Those few months when he was able to live normally he spent in London with Veterans Battalions of unfit and wounded men, including numerous French deserters.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Randell_Harris_7eeb.html" title="Edit section: Later life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later life</span></h2>
<p>Since Harris was unfit to rejoin his unit in the <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Days_b2fa.html" title="Hundred Days">Hundred Days</a> campaign in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a>, the War Office withdrew his pension, leaving Harris with no choice but to reenter the work force as a cobbler, which trade he plied in London. In the 1830s an acquaintance, Captain Henry Curling, found him as a worker in a cobblers and bootmakers in the city and persuaded him to relate his war experiences, which Curling collected into a manuscript. Harris disappears from the historical record not long after this, but it is known he own his own cobbling shop in London between <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/3/1839.html" title="1839">1839</a> and was alive to see his manuscript published in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a>, because in that year he received the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_General_Service_Medal_44a9.html" title="Military General Service Medal">Military General Service Medal</a> with Peninsula clasp. Nothing more is known of Harris' life or death, and his memoirs were not well known at the time, only becoming well read much later by historians of the twentieth century. Harris did however leave a postcript to his manuscript, which reads:</p>
<center>
<p><i>"I enjoyed life more whilst on active service than I have ever done since, and I look back on my time spent on the fields of the Peninsula as the only part worthy of remembrance"</i>.</p>
