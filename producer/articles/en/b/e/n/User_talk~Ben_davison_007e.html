<p>Hi there - good work on the football articles you've created so far! Just a note about signatures - we don't add signatures to the end of articles, as people can look the history page to see the list of authors. Feel free to sign all your comments on Talk: pages, User: pages and so on, just not the articles themselves.

<p>Hi. I had a question about the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa_1893.html" title="Genoa 1893">Genoa 1893</a> article. Is the start date for the trainers credited to technical commission meant to be 1883, as it displays, or 1893, when the club was founded? thanks. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 08:06, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your edit and reorganisation with added information is welcome, but a few points have been omitted. These were taken from the references shown under "External links".

<p>When you put someone in a category, make sure to use the |: [[Category:English footballers|Mortensen, Stan]] as opposed to just [[Category:English footballers]] (the former will put Stan Mortensen under "Mortensen" and the latter under "Stan"). I fixed some of the pages you got listed on your user page, but not sure if you made some other ones. Also, we have a new stub for players: <i>footybio-stub</i>.

Please would you have another look at the changes that you made and consider whether you may have over-wikied things.

<p>Not really. I grew out of taking offence at 'ha ha' when I was about 7. If you'll notice, I took the 'telling off', changed what i had done, and received a kind message in reply.

<p>Just a friendly reminder to use minor edits for things like spelling, formatting, syntax, etc. If you are actually adding content (i.e. adding Jeanne Calment to day articles), please do not mark that as minor, and please write in the edit summary what you've done. it saves the time of others&#160;:)</p>

<p>Just a helpful comment: it is not necessary to add articles to categories if they are already in a subcategory of that. eg <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_business_people_bc25.html" title="Category:Scottish business people">Category:Scottish business people</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/a/Category%7EGlaswegians_57c7.html" title="Category:Glaswegians">Category:Glaswegians</a> are both sub categories of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish_people_f9d2.html" title="Category:Scottish people">Category:Scottish people</a> (as all 'Scottish business people' are by definition 'Scottish people' etc).

<p>The <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Office_Rifles_c167.html" title="Post Office Rifles">Post Office Rifles</a> founded in 1868 was a volunteer infantry battalion formed from employees of the Post Office. The Army Postal Corps founded in 1882 was actually a <i>postal</i> corps of the regular army. The section of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Engineers_bc48.html" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> article you quote actually says that the RE Postal Section was formed in 1908 and is the direct predecessor of the current RLC Postal and Courier Service. Since the Post Office Rifles existed until after WWI, they can hardly be the same unit. It's the mention of the APC in the Post Office Rifles article that's misleading. They were entirely separate units. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 20:15, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We started a proposal <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely.</p>
<p>Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki, please visit the page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiethics_d174.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiethics">Wikipedia:Wikiethics</a> with your suggestions on the policy. We have two subpages: Arguments and Sections. You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know you are interested in christianity, and I recently started a new wiki over at wikicities which is on the subject of christianity. <a href="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" class="external text" title="http://christianity.wikicities.com/" rel="nofollow">Christian Knowledge Base</a> is the site.</p>
<p>The goal is to have a knowledgebase on christianity from a distinctly "C(hristian)POV" rather than the NPOV. It is not meant to be a mere Christian Encyclopedia, but to foster a real sense of community. I'd like to include things like current events, news, stories, and anything that would add to both an understanding of Christianity, but also its enjoyment. I'm looking for help to build a resource that could really enrich the lives of Christians.</p>
<p>I know you are busy but I am actively seeking new sysops/admins to help me build this site up, and I would be positively thrilled if you could contribute in any capacity whatsoever. <a href="../../../n/s/a/User%7ENsandwich_4afa.html" title="User:Nsandwich">nsandwich</a> 05:51, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please add the <i>location</i> of blue plaques to the articles, not just the category; that way the presence of the plaque can be sourced and verified. See <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_0080.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories">Wikipedia:Categories</a> for the requirement that it be obvious why X is in the category by looking at the article; for example, with Palmerston, not just that he was PM, and so notable, but which building the plaque is on.

<dd>I didn't mean to be hostile at all. It's just odd to see a category like this appear in an article where nothing in the text bears it out. Remember, I had no way to know you were basing this on a list. But looking now at the list, there are no specifics there on what Auerbach is said to have declined, and it doesn't have any real citation either: just "a confidential document containing over 300 names of such people was leaked to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sunday_Times_%28UK%29_b3d9.html" title="The Sunday Times (UK)">The Sunday Times</a></i>". I'm willing to believe that is probably true, but shouldn't it cite an article in <i>The Times</i> that bears that out? Again, nothing hostile here; I happen to have a strong interest in Auerbach as an artist, this was totally new to me, and usually categories are somehow encapsulations of material already in a given article; otherwise, they'd completely slip by the usual requirements for <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:47, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like the <i>Sunday Times</i> article is no longer available online, and they don't let the <s>Web Archive</s><b><a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Archive_a5d5.html" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a></b> archive their site. Googling '"Sunday Times" 2003 "Honor Blackman"', '"Sunday Times" 2003 "Frank Auerbach"', etc. turns up some interesting stories on it, including one in <i>The Guardian</i>, but at least among the first few hits there was no comprehensive list. Similar methods would probably verify any given one of these, but a comprehensive list would sure be nice to have. I'll see what I can do to follow this up, too. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:26, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wasn't sure if that WikiProject was still active? I posted an invitation on the Talk page but I noticed you were also interested in implementing 1.0 assessments. We have that infrastructure in place that you guys would be able to use without having to do the coding yourself. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlange_d466.html" title="User:Plange">plange</a> 02:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
