<p><b>Bengali Novels</b> occupy a major part of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_literature.html" title="Bengali literature">Bengali literature</a>. Though the first <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_language.html" title="Bengali language">Bengali</a> novel was <i>Alaler Ghorer Dulal</i>, the Bengali novel actually started its journey with Durgeshnondini written by <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankim_Chandra_Chattopadhyay_48e8.html" title="Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay">Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>. According to Ananda Sanker and Lila Ray, 'when the novel was introduced in Bangla in the middle of the 19th century, the form itself was new, the prose in which it was written was new, the secular tone was new in a country hitherto wholly dominated by religion, and the society in which and for which it was written was new’ (Page 168). But some great novelists like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankim_Chandra_Chattopadhyay_48e8.html" title="Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay">Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabindranath_Tagore_9e00.html" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, Tara Shankar Bondopadhyay, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarat_Chandra_Chattopadhyay_90ff.html" title="Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay">Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay</a> developed the newly introduced genre in such a way that ‘new’ changed into ‘matured’ through their works.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_novels.html" title="Edit section: Bangladeshi novels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bangladeshi novels</span></h2>
<p>Novels of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> fall almost fifty years behind the Bengali novels. (First Bengali novel <i>Alaler Ghore Dulal</i> was published in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1858.html" title="1858">1858</a> and <i>Anowara</i> was published in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>.) In its history of about one hundred years, novels of Bangladesh got a good number of novels where creative emancipation of the writers has been established.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_novels.html" title="Edit section: Themes of Bangladeshi novels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Themes of Bangladeshi novels</span></h3>
<p>In the early stage, glorification of the religious beliefs and lives was the theme of most of the novels. Later on, picturization of real Bangali life became a common topic. By the end of the fifties, the novelists gradually turned to human mind and its analysis. A great change of the theme came after <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. Novels about the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_War_of_Bangladesh_827d.html" title="Liberation War of Bangladesh">Liberation War of Bangladesh</a> began to come forth. Even till now it has not ceased to be an interesting topic.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Content.html" title="Content">content</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Form.html" title="Form">form</a> of the novels saw various changes in the last fifty years. Starting from ordinary narration, now it has reached to magic realistic presentation through <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stream_of_consciousness.html" title="Stream of consciousness">stream of consciousness</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_realism.html" title="Literary realism">realism</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surrealism</a> etc.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_novels.html" title="Edit section: History of Bangladeshi novels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of Bangladeshi novels</span></h3>
<p>To many, <i>Anowara</i> was the most significant one among the earlier novels written in Bangladesh. This novel was written by Mohammad Najibar Rahman in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>. But the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milestone.html" title="Milestone">milestone</a> in the modern novels of Bangladesh is <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Waliullah_90bb.html" title="Syed Waliullah">Syed Waliullah’s</a> Lalshalu (Published in 1948). The history of Bangladeshi novels can be categorized in 3 major parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-partition (1947) Era</li>
<li>East-Pakistan Era</li>
<li>Bangladesh Era</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Pre-Partition_Era" id="Pre-Partition_Era"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_novels.html" title="Edit section: Pre-Partition Era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-Partition Era</span></h4>
<p>Before <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, events like Separation of Bangla in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>, Foundation of Muslim League in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a> and Unification of Bangla in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> inspired the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> community of <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> to establish a new identity in the horizon of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a>. Mohammad Najibar Rahman, Kazi Imdadul Huq, Kazi Abdul Wadud, Sheikh Idrish Ali, Akbaruddin, Abul Fazal, Humayun Kabir etc were among the novelists who tried to enrich the novels of the then <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Pakistan_505e.html" title="East Pakistan">East Pakistan</a>, present <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>.</p>
<p>Mohammad Najibar Rahman’s Anowara was the first notable novel and it moved the whole Bangla Muslim community after publication. According to Rafiqullah Khan(ref) ‘The novel could not create any novelty from artistic point of view, but it carried great importance for its picturization of socio-economic and political culture and ideals of the uprising populace’ (Page 25, Translation). Main theme of most of the novels in this era was Muslim society and belief and orthodoxy. Examples of novels incorporating these theme is Najibar Rahman’s <i>Premer Somadhi</i> (published in 1919) and <i>Goriber Meye</i> (1923), Sheikh Idris Ali’s <i>Premer Pothe</i> (1926). In this time, for the first time the life of the Bengali <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farmers.html" title="Farmers">farmers</a> took an artistic delineation through Kazi Abdul Wadud’s <i>Nodibakshe</i> (1919).</p>
<p>Then Kazi Imdadul Huq sprinkled a new wave. His famous novel <i><a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah.html" title="Abdullah">Abdullah</a></i> was published in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodicals.html" title="Periodicals">periodicals</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> and it came into book form in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>. According to Biswajit Ghosh(ref) this novel was ‘bourgeois and humanitarian revolt against devotion to Peers, religious dogmas, purdah-system and disparity between Ashraf and Atraf (Page: 134, Translation). Later, 'Kazi Abdul Wadud and Humayun Kabir extended this attitude' (ref:Syed Akram Hussain:page 97). Another novelist Abul Fazal exposed human psychological analyses in his novel <i>Chouchir</i> (1927). He afterwards continued with his own style and wrote <i>Prodip O Patongo</i> (1940) and <i>Shahoshika</i> (1946). It is well accepted that this type of psychological approach was a first attempt in novels of Bangladesh, though not for the first time in Bangla novels.</p>
<p>A progressive novelist Humayun Kabir wrote an English Novel <i>Rivers and Women</i> which was published in 1945. Later the Bengali form was published in 1952 by the name of <i>Nodi O Nari</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_novels.html" title="Edit section: East Pakistan Era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">East Pakistan Era</span></h4>
<p>The incident of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence.html" title="Independence">independence</a> of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_rule.html" title="British rule">British rule</a> bore more importance for the people of then <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal.html" title="Bengal">Bengal</a>. Since then the Bangla speaking community were divided into two parts – the East and the West Bengal. It turns into the smashing of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennium</a> old <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> and unity of Bangali nation. Moreover the existence of language became a great question just after the creation of Pakistan. The West-Pakistan ruling government tried to impose <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> as the principal language on the Bangali people. But the whole society reacted strongly. This leaves a permanent impression on <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_literature.html" title="Bengali literature">Bengali literature</a>. In this tumultuous era, <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Waliullah_90bb.html" title="Syed Waliullah">Syed Waliullah’s</a> <i>Lalshalu</i> (1948) was published. It was the foremost successful novel, both from art and reality points of view. Later Syed Waliullah translated it in English by the name <i>Tree without roots</i>. Mahbub-ul Alam wrote <i>Mofijon</i>, also published in 1948.</p>
<p>In the first years of Pakistan regime the authors mostly took <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village.html" title="Village">village</a> life as their <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_%28literature%29.html" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a>, but they gradually diversified their interests. Newly born urban society began to establish itself as worthy to be literary contents. Along with them political developments also took place in fiction. (ref: external link1). Among the first novelists of Pakistan period, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Fazal_be15.html" title="Abul Fazal">Abul Fazal</a>, Akbar Hossain, Shaukat Osman, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Rushd_e7bc.html" title="Abu Rushd">Abu Rushd</a>, Kazi Afsaruddin, Daulatunnessa Khatun, <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Waliullah_90bb.html" title="Syed Waliullah">Syed Waliullah</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarder_Jayenuddin_fcb7.html" title="Sarder Jayenuddin">Sarder Jayenuddin</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ishaque_1f87.html" title="Abu Ishaque">Abu Ishaque</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamsuddin_Abul_Kalam_c608.html" title="Shamsuddin Abul Kalam">Shamsuddin Abul Kalam</a> etc were most prominent ones.</p>
<p>Then came a whole generation of extra ordinary novelists. Chowdhury Shamsur Rahman, <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyen_Sen_627e.html" title="Satyen Sen">Satyen Sen</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abujafar_Shamsuddin_1ac0.html" title="Abujafar Shamsuddin">Abujafar Shamsuddin</a>, <a href="../../../a/h/s/Ahsan_Habib_0528.html" title="Ahsan Habib">Ahsan Habib</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nilima_Ibrahim_6871.html" title="Nilima Ibrahim">Nilima Ibrahim</a>, Abdur Razzak, Khondkar Md. Eliash, <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_Karim_e4cd.html" title="Rashid Karim">Rashid Karim</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahidulla_Kaisar_0e86.html" title="Shahidulla Kaisar">Shahidulla Kaisar</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Pasha_ceed.html" title="Anwar Pasha">Anwar Pasha</a>, Abdar Rashid, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alauddin_Al-Azad_9427.html" title="Alauddin Al-Azad">Alauddin Al-Azad</a>, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Gaffar_Choudhury_03cf.html" title="Abdul Gaffar Choudhury">Abdul Gaffar Choudhury</a>, <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahir_Raihan_b683.html" title="Zahir Raihan">Zahir Raihan</a>, Syed Shamsul Haq, Humayun Kadir, Shahid Akhand, Razia Khan, Shawkat Ali, Dilara Hashim, Indu Saha, Ahmad Sofa were notable names.</p>
<p>In this time diversity of contents of the novel was noticeable. Village life was the core theme of a huge number of novels. Sometimes it centered the superstitious village mind or the oppression by the influential groups on the common people, some other times depressed <a href="../../../w/o/m/Womanhood.html" title="Womanhood">womanhood</a> took this place. Love between men and women in <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">pastoral</a> context were also a subject of many novels. <i>Lalshalu</i> by Syed Waliullah, <i>Kashboner Konna</i> by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamsuddin_Abul_Kalam_c608.html" title="Shamsuddin Abul Kalam">Shamsuddin Abul Kalam</a>, <i>Surjo Dighol Bari</i> by <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ishaque_1f87.html" title="Abu Ishaque">Abu Ishaque</a>, <i>Meghabaran Kesh</i> by Ishaq Chakhari, <i>Adiganta</i> by Sardar Jayenunddin, <i>Mohuar Desh</i> by Tasadduk Hossain, <i>Janani</i> by Shaukat Osman, <i>Jhar</i> by Syed Sahadat Hossain, <i>Karnafuly</i> by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alauddin_Al-Azad_9427.html" title="Alauddin Al-Azad">Alauddin Al-Azad</a>, <i>Sareng Bou</i> and <i>Sangsaptak</i> by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahidulla_Kaisar_0e86.html" title="Shahidulla Kaisar">Shahidulla Kaisar</a>, <i>Aranya Mithun</i> by Badruddin Ahmad, <i>Modhumoti</i> by Rabeya Khatun, <i>Hazar Bachhar Dhore</i> by <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahir_Raihan_b683.html" title="Zahir Raihan">Zahir Raihan</a>, <i>Bobakahini</i> by <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasimuddin.html" title="Jasimuddin">Jasimuddin</a>, <i>Pannamoti</i> by Sardar Jayenuddin etc incorporated these themes.</p>
<p>Middle class society began to evolve in this time. Urban life, its problems and complexities, uprising middle class people, their social context and love in their life started to be portrayed in a good number of novels. <i>Jibon Pother Jatri</i> by Abul Fazal, <i>Pother Porosh</i> (1957) by Daulatunnessa Khatun, <i>Bhorer Bihongi</i> (1958) by Satyen Sen, <i>Surjer Niche</i> (1958) by Atahar Ahmad, <i>Pathasranta</i> (1959) by Nilima Ibrahim, <i>Shesh Bikeler Meye</i> (1960) by <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahir_Raihan_b683.html" title="Zahir Raihan">Zahir Raihan</a>, <i>Kanyakumari</i> (1960) by Abdur Razzak, <i>Uttam Purush</i> (1961) by <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_Karim_e4cd.html" title="Rashid Karim">Rashid Karim</a>, <i>Ek Path Dui Bank</i> (1962) by Nilima Ibrahim, <i>Akash Jodi Nil Hoi</i> (1962) and <i>Ihai To Prem</i> (1963) by Syed Sahadat Hossain, <i>Prasanno Pashan</i> (1963) by Rashid Karim, <i>Pingal Aakash</i> (1963) by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawkat_Ali_67fa.html" title="Shawkat Ali">Shawkat Ali</a>, <i>Akasher Rong</i> (1964) by Zobeda Khanam, <i>Panna Holo Sobuz</i> (1964) by Shahid Akhand, <i>Nirjan Megh</i> (1965) by Humayun Kadir, <i>Ghar Mon Janala</i> (1965) by Dilara Hashim, <i>Aronyo Nilima</i> (1965) by Ahsan Habib, <i>Antahshila</i> (1967) by Kazi Md. Idris, <i>Digonter Swapno</i> (1967) by Razia Majid, <i>Mon Ek Shet Kopoti</i> (1967), <i>Shaheb Bazar</i> (1967) and <i>Ananto Aneysha</i> (1967) by Rabeya Khatun, <i>Bipani Mon</i> (1968) by Mir Abul Hossain, <i>Sourav</i> (1968) by Anis Chowdhury, <i>Anishchita Ragini</i> (1969) by <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Rushd_e7bc.html" title="Abu Rushd">Abu Rushd</a>, <i>Borof Gola Nodi</i> (1969) by <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zahir_Raihan_b683.html" title="Zahir Raihan">Zahir Raihan</a>, <i>Rajabagh Shahimar Bagh</i> (1969) by Rabeya Khatun etc are significant novels of this stream.</p>
<p>But the background of another major event was being prepared in this time. The country began to experience turmoil. The political situation of the country became more and more prominent in the novels also. In novels like <i>Nongor</i> by <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Rushd_e7bc.html" title="Abu Rushd">Abu Rushd</a> and <i>Mon Na Moti</i> by Anis Siddique, <i>Jibon Khuda</i> by Abul Monsoor Ahmed exposed the context of <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> Movement. Communal picture out of this movement and the restoration of Hindu-Muslim harmony also became core content in a number of novels including <i>Ranga Probhat</i> by Abul Fazal, <i>Khuda O Asha</i> by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alauddin_Al-Azad_9427.html" title="Alauddin Al-Azad">Alauddin Al-Azad</a>, <i>Neer Sandhani</i> and <i>Nishuti Rater Gatha</i> by <a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Pasha_ceed.html" title="Anwar Pasha">Anwar Pasha</a> etc.</p>
<p>Then came the historic event of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_movement.html" title="Language movement">Language Movement</a>. The keen eyes of the novelists were nowhere but on this tremendous incident. Jahir Raihan’s <i>Aarek Falgoon</i> was the most significant effort on language movement. Other political incidents like the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_conflict.html" title="Class conflict">class conflict</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a>, and movement in the cultivators was depicted in the novels like <i>Dui Mohol</i> (later on renamed as <i>Alamnagorer Upokotha</i>) by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamsuddin_Abul_Kalam_c608.html" title="Shamsuddin Abul Kalam">Shamsuddin Abul Kalam</a>, <i>Surjo Tumi Sathi</i> by Ahmad Sofa etc. Shaukat Osman wrote wonderful symbolic political novels <i>Kritodasher Hashi</i> and Raja Upakhyan. Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury’s <i>Chandradwiper Upakhyan</i> and <i>Nam Na Jana Bhore</i> portrayed the uprising farmer society and its conflicts.</p>
<p>There were some historical novels also. <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abujafar_Shamsuddin_1ac0.html" title="Abujafar Shamsuddin">Abujafar Shamsuddin</a>’s <i>Bhaowal Gorer Upakhayan</i> about the Faraizi Movement, Sardar Jayenuddin’s <i>Nil Rong Rokto</i> about the Indigo revolt, Satyen Sen’s <i>Kumarajiva</i> about the spread of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and <i>Oporajeyo</i> about the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepoy_Revolt_354b.html" title="Sepoy Revolt">Sepoy Revolt</a> etc. are a few examples among them. Some novelists favoured psychological complexities. With his unique presentation and language of his own, <a href="../../../s/y/e/Syed_Waliullah_90bb.html" title="Syed Waliullah">Syed Waliullah</a> wrote <i>Chander Amabashya</i> and <i>Kando Nodi Kando</i> keeping psychological analysis in the centre.</p>
<p>Another trend of novels having emphasis on the sexual behaviours and deviations of the characters began to mark its own place during the sixties. Razia Khan’s <i>Bot-tolar Uponyas</i>, and <i>Anukolpo</i> was among the first novels of this trend. <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alauddin_Al-Azad_9427.html" title="Alauddin Al-Azad">Alauddin Al-Azad</a>’s <i>Teish Nambor Toilochitro</i>, <i>Shiter Sheshrat Boshonter Prothomdin</i> and and Syed Shamsul Haq’s <i>Ek Mohilar Chhobi</i>, <i>Anupama Din</i>, <i>Simana Chhariye</i> etc are mentionables in this regard.</p>
<p>Afterwards came the most memorable days of Bangali nation. After <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">ten month long war</a> Bangalis became independent nation. After the massacre of three million people and huge violation and harassment of womenfolk and loss of property <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> emerged as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> and democratic nation on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, and Bangladeshi novel enters into a new era.</p>
<p><a name="Bangladesh_Era" id="Bangladesh_Era"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_novels.html" title="Edit section: Bangladesh Era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bangladesh Era</span></h4>
<p>Most of the writers who were contributing in the pre-liberation period were also very creative in this period. <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_Karim_e4cd.html" title="Rashid Karim">Rashid Karim</a> wrote novels based on middle-class society and their societal and psychological analysis. <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alauddin_Al-Azad_9427.html" title="Alauddin Al-Azad">Alauddin Al-Azad</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawkat_Ali_67fa.html" title="Shawkat Ali">Shawkat Ali</a>, Razia Khan and Dilara Hashim, Mahmudul Haque, Ahmad Sofa, Syed Shamsul Haq is among other notable names. Syed Shamsul Haq, commonly known as Syed Huq, wrote a good number of novels along with a huge number of books of other genres. He is always very experimental in both technique and form. <i>Khelaram Khele Ja</i> placed him in great controversy for his open delineation of human sexual behaviour. In his novels like <i>Duratto</i>, <i>Mahashunye Poran Master</i>, <i>Ek Juboker Chhayapoth</i> etc. <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">Liberation war</a>, its consequences, hopeless human existence and analysis of human mind and society take sharp pen-picture. Another powerful writer <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawkat_Ali_67fa.html" title="Shawkat Ali">Shawkat Ali</a> wrote <i>Prodoshe Praakritojon</i>, which is a real representation of the twelve century Bangla during King Lakhkhan Sen. His trilogy <i>Dakshinayaner Din</i>, <i>Kulaya Kalasrot</i> and <i>Purbaratri Purbadin</i> deserve much compliment. Mahmudul Haque wrote <i>Anur Pathshala</i> before <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">liberation war</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. He wrote <i>Nirapod Tondra</i>, <i>Khelaghar</i> (written 1978, published 1988), <i>Kalo Borof</i> (written in 1977, published in 1992), and <i>Matir Jahaj</i> (written in 1977, published in 1996). Ahmad Sofa, wrote novels with different tone. In <i>Onkar</i> (1975) he portrayed the suppressed Bangali mind of the pre-liberation period in a very artistic and symbolic way. In <i>Gaavi Brityanto</i> he presents the contemporary picture in a meticulous allegory. <i>Ardhek Nari Ardhek Ishwari</i>, a novel of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_love.html" title="Romantic love">romantic love</a>, is widely considered as his <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masterpiece.html" title="Masterpiece">masterpiece</a>. His <i>Pushpa Brikhkha Ebong Bihongo Puran</i> is a narration of true human affinity to <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature.html" title="Nature">nature</a>.</p>
<p>After the liberation war, freedom fight became a unique subject. The first of this discipline is <a href="../../../a/n/w/Anwar_Pasha_ceed.html" title="Anwar Pasha">Anwar Pasha</a>’s <i>Rifle Roti Awrat</i> that he wrote during the war. Shaukat Osman’s <i>Jahannam Hoite Bidai</i>, <i>Nekre Aranyo</i>, <i>Dui Soinik</i>, Rashid Haider’s <i>Khanchai</i>, <i>Andho Kothamala</i>, Shawkat Ali’s <i>Jatraa</i>, <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selina_Hossain_1fe6.html" title="Selina Hossain">Selina Hossain</a>’s Hangor Nodi Granade, Mahmudul Huq’s <i>Jiban Aamar Bone]], Syed Shamsul Haq’s</i> Nil Dangshon<i>,</i> Nishiddho Loban<i>, Harun Habib’s</i> Priyo Joddha Priyotoma<i>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humayun_Ahmed_bbfa.html" title="Humayun Ahmed">Humayun Ahmed</a>’s</i> Jochona O Jononir Golpo <i>etc. are examples of novels which directly deal freedom fight as their subject. Besides this, novels like</i> Amar Jato Glani <i>by Rashid Karim,</i> Ferari Surjo <i>by <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabeya_Khatun_ec93.html" title="Rabeya Khatun">Rabeya Khatun</a>,</i> Abelay Ashamoy <i>by Amjad Hossain also portray the different facets of liberation war. Rashid Karim’s</i> Prem Ekti Lal Golap<i>,</i> Ekaler Rupkotha <i>or</i> Sadharon Loker Kahini <i>are presentation of the hopeless picture of Bangladesh after the war. 'Critics say that though after the liberation huge number of novels was written about our war, none of them could depict the historic incident in necessary epic form'. (ref:externallink 1)</i></p>
<p>New faces appeared in the literary world after the liberation. Among them <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selina_Hossain_1fe6.html" title="Selina Hossain">Selina Hossain</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humayun_Ahmed_bbfa.html" title="Humayun Ahmed">Humayun Ahmed</a>, Hasnat Abdul Hye, Rizia Rahman, Bashir al-Helal were most prominent.</p>
<p>Selina Hossain started with <i>Jalochchhwas</i> and till now she has authored more than twenty-one novels. Her <i>Hangor Nodi Granade</i> is a success written on Bangladesh Liberation war. She has written novels like <i>Taanaporen</i> on coastal life and natural disaster. <i>Gayatree Sondhya</i> (3 volumes: published in, 1994, 1995, 1996), <i>Kalketu O Fullora</i>, <i>Chandbene</i> are some of her <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_novels.html" title="Historical novels">historical novels</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdur_Rouf_Choudhury_766c.html" title="Abdur Rouf Choudhury">Abdur Rouf Choudhury</a>'s novel <i>Natun Diganta</i> (Three volumes: published in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality work of art by any standard and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation war. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel <i>Natun Diganta</i> (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity - these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury’s thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet reasonableness but to trials in the rough and tumble of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding of the mind and will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation’s dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and material property, 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Humayun Ahmed, perhaps the most popular novelist in Bengali after Sarat Chandra Chatyopadyay, apeeared with his novel <i>Nondito Noroke</i> and then <i>Shonkhoneel Karagar</i>. Later he gradually turned to less serious things. Almost all of his novels are best sellers. Some of his titles are <i>1971</i>, <i>Daruchinir Deep</i>, <i>Brihonnola</i>, <i>Joyjoyonti</i>, <i>Kobi</i> etc. Humayun Ahmed’s <i>Tomader Jonno Valobasa</i> is the first <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangla_Science_Fiction_4747.html" title="Bangla Science Fiction">Science Fiction</a> novel in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>.</p>
<p>A serious poet, essayist and literary researcher <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Mannan_Syed_fe5b.html" title="Abdul Mannan Syed">Abdul Mannan Syed</a> published his first novel <i>Pariprekshter Dasdashi</i> in 1974. Later on he wrote <i>Kolkata</i>, <i>Poramatir Kaaj</i>, <i>O Te Ojogor</i>, <i>Hei Songsar Hei Lota</i>, <i>Khudha</i>, <i>Prem</i>, <i>Aagun</i>, <i>Shyamoli Tomar Mukh</i> etc. Hasnat Abdul Hye, arrived with his <i>Suprobhat Bhalobasa</i>. By now he has written at least twenty novels. Along with his other novels he has introduced a different form of novels called <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographical.html" title="Biographical">biographical</a>. <i>Sultan</i>, <i>Ekjon Aaroj Ali</i> and <i>Novera</i> are example of this form. All of these novels are based on the biographical sketches of giant Bangali characters. Rizia Rahman’s <i>Uttar Purush</i> came in black and white in 1977. She wrote some fifteen novels in the eighties. Her voluminous <i>Bongo Theke Bangla</i> is an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epic_poetry.html" title="Epic poetry">epic</a> composition about the past culture and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage.html" title="Heritage">heritage</a> of Bangali nation. Her other major novels are <i>Rokter Okhkhor</i>, <i>Alikhito Upakhyan</i>, <i>Ekal Chirokal</i>, <i>Prem Aamar Prem</i>, <i>Ekti Phuler Jonyo</i>, <i>Harun Fereni</i> etc. Bashir al-Helal’s <i>Kalo Elish</i> was published in 1979. His other novels include <i>Ghritokumari</i>, <i>Shesh Panpatro</i>, <i>Nurjahander Modhumas</i> etc.</p>
<p>In the eighties Bangladeshi novel got some senior writers who wrote novels for the first time along with some promising young ones. Among the earlier writers Abubakar Siddique’s, <i>Jalarakshas</i> and <i>Kharadaha</i> appeared with much novelty. His important later novel is <i>Ekatturer Hridoybhashma</i>. Makbula Manjoor started in the late years of the sixties, but most of her novels came out in the eighties and nineties. <i>Kaler Mondira</i> is one of her most notable work. <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahat_Khan_2035.html" title="Rahat Khan">Rahat Khan</a> wrote novels about middle class city people, their joys and sorrows, love and separation. His significant works include <i>Omol Dhabol Chakri</i>, <i>Ek Priyodorshini</i>, <i>Chhayadampoti</i> , <i>Hai Shunyota</i>, <i>Sangharsho</i>, <i>Shahar</i>, <i>Hai Anonter Pakhi</i>, <i>Modhyomather Khelowar</i> etc.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/k/h/Akhtaruzzaman_Elias_8415.html" title="Akhtaruzzaman Elias">Akhtaruzzaman Elias</a> , one of the most artistic but least productive writers, wrote only two novels. He has started his journey with <i>Chilekothar Sepai</i>. His most prestigious work <i>Khoabnama</i>, which came out in 1996, is considered as a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milestone.html" title="Milestone">milestone</a> in the history of Bangla novels.</p>
<p>Another senior novelist <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ishaque_1f87.html" title="Abu Ishaque">Abu Ishaque</a>’s second novel <i>Padmar Palidwip</i> was published in 1986, after thirty-one years of his debut novel <i>Surjo Dighal Bari</i>. Appearance and disappearance of Chars (strip of sandy land), their effect on nearby humanity etc. have taken a keen narration in Padmar Palidwip.</p>
<p>Haripada Datta is also a worthy name. His two volume novel <i>Ojogor</i> (Vol. I -1989, Vol. II-1991) chronicles the recent past history very remarkably. His previous novels are <i>Eshane Ognidaho</i> and <i>Ondhokupe Janmothsob</i>. In 2000 he has written an epic volume titled <i>Jonmo Jonmantor</i>.</p>
<p>From the early years of the eighties, the arrival of some young novelists who, later on, obtained enough popularity, was heard. Monju Sarkar, <a href="../../../i/m/d/Imdadul_Haq_Milon_2901.html" title="Imdadul Haq Milon">Imdadul Haq Milon</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/i/Moinul_Ahsan_Saber_b998.html" title="Moinul Ahsan Saber">Moinul Ahsan Saber</a> are the few but most common names in this regard. Monju Sarkar’s <i>Tamosh</i>, <i>Nagno Agontuk</i>, <i>Protima Upakhyan</i> and <i>Abashbhumi</i>, Imdadul Haq Milon’s <i>Jabojjibon</i> (written in 1976, published in 1900), <i>Nodi Upakhyan</i>, <i>Bhumiputro</i>, <i>Poradhinota</i>, <i>Rajakartontro</i>, Moinul Ahsan Saber’s <i>Adomer Jonye Opekhkha</i>, <i>Pathor Somoy</i>, <i>Char Torun Toruni</i>, <i>Manush Jekhane Jai Na</i>, <i>Dharabahik Kahin</i>, <i>Opeksha</i>, <i>Kobej Lethel</i>, <i>Tumi Amake Niye Jabe</i>, <i>Prem O Protishodh</i>, <i>Songsher Japon</i> got much recognition from the literati. Shahidul Zahir, wrote his first novel <i>Jibon O Rajnoitic Bastobota</i>, published in 1988 while his second, till now the last, <i>Shei Rate Purnima Chhilo</i> came out in 1995. Magic realism, which is a recent trend of the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_American_fef7.html" title="Latin American">Latin American</a> novels, takes place in Shahidul Zahir’s narration.</p>
<p>The last decade of <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_century.html" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a> is comparatively fruitful for Bangladeshi novels. <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Mahmud_8df0.html" title="Al Mahmud">Al Mahmud</a>’s novelistic exposition, Bipradas Barua’s Buddhist life, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humayun_Azad_262b.html" title="Humayun Azad">Humayun Azad</a>’s brave creations, Akimun Rahman’s novels about womanhood, <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasreen_Jahan_5d08.html" title="Nasreen Jahan">Nasreen Jahan</a>’s novels of magic realism, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamsuddin_Abul_Kalam_c608.html" title="Shamsuddin Abul Kalam">Shamsuddin Abul Kalam</a>’s historic work <i>Kanchongram</i> is few mark of this decade. Syed Shamsul Haq’s <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masterpiece.html" title="Masterpiece">masterpiece</a> <i>Bristi O Bidrohigon</i>, published in 1998, is a milestone on the past heritage and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">liberation war</a>. Senior poet Al Mahmud’s debut novel <i>Dahuki</i> came out in 1992 which was followed by <i>Kobi O Kolahol</i> , <i>Upamohadesh</i>, <i>Kabiler Bone</i>, <i>Purush Sundor</i>, <i>Nishinda Nari</i> etc. Bipradas Barua’s major novels are <i>Somudrochar O Bidrohira</i>, <i>Muktijoddhara</i>, <i>Shromon Goutam</i> etc.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/m/Humayun_Azad_262b.html" title="Humayun Azad">Humayun Azad</a> commenced his novelist carrier with <i>Chhappanno Hajar Borgomile</i> in 1994, which was a courageous slap on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_law.html" title="Martial law">martial law</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a>. In no time the novel brought its writer much name and popularity. His later novels include <i>Sob Kichhu Bhenge Pore</i>, <i>Subhabrata</i>, <i>Tar Samparkita Susamachar</i>, <i>Rajnitibidgon</i> etc. <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Nurul_Huda_4898.html" title="Mohammad Nurul Huda">Mohammad Nurul Huda</a>, a renowned poet, had also two attempts in novel. Excepting <i>Janmajati</i> and <i>Moinpahar</i> he did not make any third attempt. <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akimun_Rahman_97b7.html" title="Akimun Rahman">Akimun Rahman</a> is the first novelist ever in Bangla language in whose writing the untold and unknown secrets of <a href="../../../w/o/m/Womanhood.html" title="Womanhood">womanhood</a> are getting tongue. She has by now written four novels, <i>Purusher Prithibite Ek Meye</i> , <i>Roktopunje Genthe Jawya Machhi</i>, <i>Pashe Shudhu Chhaya Chhilo</i>, and <i>Jeebaner Roudre Udechhilo Kayekti Dhulikana</i>. Another notable novelist is <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasreen_Jahan_5d08.html" title="Nasreen Jahan">Nasreen Jahan</a>. Her first novel <i>Urukku</i> arrived with much appreciation. In her novels like <i>Chondrer Prothom Kola</i>, <i>Chondrolekhar Jaadubistar</i>, <i>Sonali Mukhosh</i> , <i>Ure Jai Nishipakhkhi</i> etc, she manipulated the elements of magic realism. Anisul Huq, a <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a> by profession, has established himself as a popular writer. His <i>Andhokarer Ekshaw Bachhar</i> presented him a very honourable place but in no other novel he could revive that honour. Imtiar Shamim is also a young but promising name for the novels of recent Bangladesh. In <i>Dana Kata Himer Bhetor</i> he presented a NGO-world. His <i>Amra Hetechhi Jara</i> encompassed a very touching story of the sorry saga of post-independence Bangladesh life.</p>
