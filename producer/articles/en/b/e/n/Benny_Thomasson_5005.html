	    <p><b>Benny Thomasson</b> was a creative, innovative, and extraordinarily talented fiddler in the Texas style of oldtime fiddling. He is considered as important to that style as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Monroe_573c.html" title="Bill Monroe">Bill Monroe</a> is to <a href="../../../b/l/u/Bluegrass_music.html" title="Bluegrass music">bluegrass</a>, or <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_db29.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a> to <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>. He may confidently be compared to another Benny, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Goodman_95f2.html" title="Benny Goodman">Goodman</a> for virtuosity, style, and legendary status in his art.</p>
<p>Benny Thomasson was born in <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runnels_County%2C_Texas_a673.html" title="Runnels County, Texas">Runnels County, Texas</a>, on April 22, 1909, and raised in <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatesville%2C_Texas_daaa.html" title="Gatesville, Texas">Gatesville</a>. His parents were Lucas "Red Luke" and Sarah Elizabeth Wright Thomasson. Both his father and uncle, Ed, played fiddle. Notably, Luke Thomasson wrote the well-known tune "Midnight on the Water." Benny was one of 10 children in a family where music was not only encouraged, it was a key ingredient of life. Benny began fiddling at the age of three, from as soon as he could hold the instrument up without dropping it. He was influenced by renowned fiddlers such as <a href="../../../e/c/k/Eck_Robertson_c71c.html" title="Eck Robertson">Eck Robertson</a> and Lefty Franklin, who were friends of the Thomasson family.</p>
<p>Benny entered his first fiddle contest at the age of 19. He expected to place among the top at the competition, but found himself disappointed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"This was a pretty big occasion right there, and I thought I was a real good fiddler. And I went up to this contest and there was I guess over 200 fiddlers up there. They was pretty good ones, but I still thought I ranked along about the top numbers there.... And when it come my time to play, .... I thought I was really getting after [my three tunes]. Come to find out nobody even noticed. And so when that come about, I decided right then that something had to be done, so I could be up there amongst the rest of the good fiddlers. So I went to work on these old tunes there, and didn't change the tune or anything like that, but actually what I did was just to make the different variations of the same parts, but maybe in a different location on the fiddle, or rounded them out, and smoothed them out to where finally they began to give me a little recognition there. And that made me work harder, so I worked on those things for years and years."</i> (from the liner notes of <a href="http://www.voyagerrecords.com/LN345.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.voyagerrecords.com/LN345.htm" rel="nofollow">Say Old Man Can You Play the Fiddle</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that humble start, Benny worked hard and took home many trophies. He won the Texas State Championship 15 times, the World Championship (held in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crockett%2C_Texas_e8b2.html" title="Crockett, Texas">Crockett, Texas</a>) 3 times in a row (1955, 1956 and 1957), and the National Oldtime Fiddlers' Championship in Weiser, Idaho, among innumerable smaller contests. In 1972, Benny placed third at Weiser behind <a href="http://www.fiddlersfrolics.org/HOF/pages/Dick%20_Barrett.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fiddlersfrolics.org/HOF/pages/Dick%20_Barrett.htm" rel="nofollow">Dick Barrett</a> and J.C. Broughton, and third again in 1973, behind Herman Johnson and Barrett. In 1974 though, Benny won both the senior division and the open division at Weiser a feat since barred by limiting registration to one division.</p>
<p>Benny and his brother Lewis, the latter playing guitar, were featured for a while on a radio show sponsored by the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears%2C_Roebuck_and_Company_1c2e.html" title="Sears, Roebuck and Company">Sears Roebuck Company</a>.</p>
<p>In 1928, Benny Thomasson married Beatrice "Bea" Hollander, in <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taos%2C_New_Mexico_9fc4.html" title="Taos, New Mexico">Taos, New Mexico</a>. Together they had four children.</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>, where Benny spent most of his life, working as an auto body shop, the Thomasson's moved up to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a> state in the early 1970s to be nearer their son Dale. In Washington, Benny connected with many up and coming fiddlers and his influence can still be felt in the region.</p>
<p>Benny improved and improvised on many simple traditional tunes. He practiced and developed controlled improvisation (see Matt Glaser's thesis "<a href="http://library.tufts.edu/search/aglaser%2C+matt/aglaser+matt/1%2C1%2C4%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=aglaser+matt&amp;1%2C%2C4" class="external text" title="http://library.tufts.edu/search/aglaser%2C+matt/aglaser+matt/1%2C1%2C4%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=aglaser+matt&amp;1%2C%2C4" rel="nofollow">Controlled Improvisation in Texas-style Fiddling</a>"), keeping the tune true to its melody while embellishing and expanding that melody. When asked whether his playing resembled that of his father's Benny answered</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Well, no. I'll tell you what. See those old tunes, back in those days was just little two-part tunes and they never had any variation to 'em. Now I play the same old tunes, but then I have arranged variations of the same parts in different positions on the fiddle, see. And like you'd be playing an old tune like "Dusty Miller" or something, and the low part there, and then you get up there on your higher positions and make it sound... get a little bit different variation, and get a good sound out of it. And it don't make it come back to the same old monotonous. two-part deals there..."</i> (from <a href="http://slidingscalemusic.com/articles/Benny%20Thomasson/Benny%20Thomasson%20Texas%20trad.pdf" class="external text" title="http://slidingscalemusic.com/articles/Benny%20Thomasson/Benny%20Thomasson%20Texas%20trad.pdf" rel="nofollow">Mendelson</a>, p. 4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benny is duly acclaimed as one of the monumental parents of the great Texas fiddling tradition. He generously taught many fiddlers and influenced countless others. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_O%27Connor_d3da.html" title="Mark O'Connor">Mark O'Connor</a> is probably Benny's most acclaimed student. Other students from the Northwestern United States include: Joe Sites and Barbara Lamb among many others. Students from Texas include <a href="http://www.fiddlersfrolics.org/HOF/pages/new_page_33.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fiddlersfrolics.org/HOF/pages/new_page_33.htm" rel="nofollow">Dale</a> and <a href="http://www.fiddlersfrolics.org/HOF/pages/new_page_17.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fiddlersfrolics.org/HOF/pages/new_page_17.htm" rel="nofollow">Terry Morris</a>; also among many others. Benny also passed on his love of music to his son Jerry, who may be heard accompanying him on the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenor_guitar.html" title="Tenor guitar">tenor guitar</a> on recordings.</p>
