<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">February 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge was the scene of a spectacular and costly accident. An ocean-going tanker <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ship.html" title="Ship">ship</a>, the 5,700 ton, 523-ft long <a href="../../../s/2E/s/S.S._Marine_Floridian_d62c.html" title="S.S. Marine Floridian">S.S. <i>Marine Floridian</i></a>, was eastbound, heading downriver from Richmond. As the ship rounded a bend in the channel of the James River at the confluence of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appomattox_River_41df.html" title="Appomattox River">Appomattox River</a> near <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Point%2C_Virginia_89b8.html" title="City Point, Virginia">City Point</a> and began the approach to the Benjamin Harrison Bridge, the steering gear malfunctioned, and the pilot lost control of the ship.</p>
<p>The bridge tender had placed the lift span in the "raised" position in anticipation of the ship's passage, and motorists were sitting in their vehicles behind the warning gates waiting. As the large ship veered off course to the north, the occupants of southbound vehicles waiting on the bridge saw the ship coming directly toward them, and managed to get out of their cars and run to safety before the ship rammed the bridge. <a href="http://www.sfcav.org/2002_bridges06.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfcav.org/2002_bridges06.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>The ship missed the open portion and struck part of the fixed span. Four unoccupied vehicles tumbled into the river, and part of the bridge structure collapsed onto the deck of ship, which was wedged under the wreckage of the bridge. The bridge tender, a state employee, was trapped in the control booth located on the raised lift span near the south end. Despite the massive damage, there were no serious injuries.</p>

<p>While river traffic was restored in relatively short order, the loss of the bridge as a highway artery caused substantial hardship to commuters and the communities on both sides of the river beginning immediately after the collision. Clearly, repairs would take quite some time before the bridge could reopen to highway traffic and would be costly.</p>
<p>Prior to completion of the bridge in 1966, an automobile-carrying passenger <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferry.html" title="Ferry">ferry</a> service had operated at this location, but the docks had rotted and silt had filled in the areas where the large ferryboats, if their service was to be restored, would need to dock. Due to a dredging restriction in place because of <a href="../../../k/e/p/Kepone.html" title="Kepone">Kepone</a> contamination, it was not feasible to restore the automobile-carrying ferry service, although a similar operation was still serving about 35 miles downstream at the <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamestown_Ferry_272f.html" title="Jamestown Ferry">Jamestown Ferry</a>.</p>
<p>Alternative driving routes were unacceptably lengthy. The only fixed crossing downstream was the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_River_Bridge_d1de.html" title="James River Bridge">James River Bridge</a>, which would require an additional 130 mile drive. The nearest highway bridge upstream was located on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_95.html" title="Interstate 95">Interstate 95</a> at Richmond, necessitating an additional driving distance of over 50 miles. The existing <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamestown_Ferry_272f.html" title="Jamestown Ferry">Jamestown Ferry</a> service about 35 miles downstream between <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_Wharf%2C_Virginia_f5ea.html" title="Scotland Wharf, Virginia">Scotland</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surry_County%2C_Virginia_7527.html" title="Surry County, Virginia">Surry County</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glass_House_Point_7d80.html" title="Glass House Point">Glass House Point</a> in <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_City_County%2C_Virginia_5d1f.html" title="James City County, Virginia">James City County</a> was already operating at capacity, with delays during peak commuting hours.</p>
<p>Later on the day of the accident, state officials called upon local <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxicab.html" title="Taxicab">taxicab</a>, and water transportation providers, including both <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greyhound_Lines_ff03.html" title="Greyhound Lines">Greyhound Lines</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trailways.html" title="Trailways">Trailways</a>, to offer potential solutions for the commuters. Virginia Governor <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mills_E._Godwin_Jr._902b.html" title="Mills E. Godwin Jr.">Mills E. Godwin Jr.</a>'s Office of Emergency Services identified an innovative solution, selecting a hybrid combination of land and water services of two local contractors to comprise a unique system for commuters.</p>
<p>Richmond-based <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Overland_Transportation_9a1a.html" title="Virginia Overland Transportation">Virginia Overland Transportation</a> (VOTC), which managed several of the state's older <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban-suburban_bus_line.html" title="Urban-suburban bus line">urban-suburban bus lines</a>, was contracted to implement a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus.html" title="Bus">shuttle bus</a> and passenger van system on each side of the river. This was to be coordinated with a passenger ferry system contracted by VDOT from another company. The passenger ferry had small craft which could utilize the old ferry landings without dredging operations.</p>
<p>Both services were to accommodate the individual schedules of commuting citizens impacted by the bridge closure. The contractors were given only 3 business days to have their emergency operations in place. The contractors met the state's deadline, and their service was in place three days later, essentially operating from dawn to dusk, with schedules adjusted to suit commuters as much as possible. Virginia Overland used two-way radio-equipped vans and <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_bus.html" title="School bus">school buses</a> based on each side of the river to coordinate with the passenger ferries. Expanded parking was provided by VDOT at both docks. During this operation, commuters would drive to the ferry dock area on the side of their residence and literally "Park, Ride, and Ride."</p>
<p>The van and bus service on the south shore ran between the dock at Jordan's Point and various schools and places of employment, including many businesses in Prince George County, Hopewell and notably <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Lee_c467.html" title="Fort Lee">Fort Lee</a>, a large base of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> located nearby.</p>
<p>In the opposite situation, some workers who lived on the south side of the river, parked and rode the ferry, and then vans or buses transported them to employment, mostly at Charles City County schools and other governmental agencies.</p>
<p>By acting quickly, major disruptions to commuters and employers was primarily limited the initial few days. Since the state (and ultimately the ship's insurers) bore the expense of the passenger ferries and shuttle services, some commuters found budget savings in their commuting expenses as a meaningful offset to the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Additionally, a light-duty car-float was later introduced which could transport a small number of automobiles and light trucks during favorable weather conditions to supplement the passenger ferry and shuttle bus/van arrangements, providing the commuters with a choice. However, the car-float, which rode quite close to the water, and resembled a raft, was considered somewhat unstable by some commuters, and the original "Park and Ride and Ride" services continued for 20 months until the bridge was reopened.</p>

<p>About 10 days after the initial collision, the damaged south tower which was supporting one end of the lift span (which had been askew with the north end down along with the north tower, and the south end still up) collapsed into the river. A total reconstruction of the lift portion of the bridge and several spans of the the north approach was required.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the damaged bridge was to cost millions of dollars and take 20 months to complete. One design change incorporated was relocation of the bridge tender's station to a fixed portion of the structure which did not go up and down with the lift span.</p>

<p>The NTSB issued a report, MAR-78-01, which was adopted on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>. The investigation made recommendations for future prevention. The State of Virginia filed suit in U.S. District Court against the shipping company operating the <i>Marine Floridian</i>, which was found to be liable for the damages, a decision affirmed by the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The rebuilt Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge was reopened to traffic in the fall of 1978.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Harrison_Memorial_Bridge_7886.html" title="Edit section: Peregrine falcons program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Peregrine falcons program</span></h2>
<p>Eastern Virginia has long been a habitat for endangered birds, notably eagles and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peregrine_falcon.html" title="Peregrine falcon">peregrine falcons</a>. The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has come to learn that some of its high bridge structures closely match their preferred nesting environment on cliff faces and in high trees.</p>
<p>In an award-winning program, nesting boxes for these rare birds were established in several bridges, including the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge. Bridge pairs now represent approximately 30 percent of the Virginia peregrine falcon population. In a major victory for the endangered species, and VDOT's environmental efforts, in the spring of 2003, nearly a dozen peregrine falcon chicks were hatched. Most were taken from their nesting boxes on various VDOT bridges for banding and release.</p>
<p>That spring, three chicks or "eyases" on the Benjamin Harris Bridge on Route 156 over the James River were banded with a transmitter for tracking purposes, and two were released at <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shenandoah_National_Park_f50e.html" title="Shenandoah National Park">Shenandoah National Park</a>. Environmentalists like to leave one chick with its parents when possible, but the birds have a better chance of staying alive when released in the wild. One concern is that a falcon learning to fly may not survive a fall onto a bridge or even the water below.</p>
<p>VDOT employees who work on the bridge can see the nesting box on top of the tower from where they work. They can see into the nest when they go up into the tower to work on the mechanisms used to open the drawbridge. The drawbridge is opened on demand sometimes three or four times a day, but some days not at all. The openings do not disturb the peregrine falcons. Bridge employees keep the Center for Conservation Biology at the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_William_and_Mary_3d3c.html" title="College of William and Mary">College of William and Mary</a> informed of the birds' movements.</p>
<p>Peregrine falcons were listed as federally endangered in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> under the Endangered Species Conservation Act. At that time, there were virtually none in the east, and the population in the rest of the country had fallen by 80 to 90 percent. Beginning in the 1970's, a national effort was undertaken to recover breeding populations and to restore the species. Their population has significantly recovered over the past 30 years, thanks to conservation efforts such as VDOT's. Today, more than 1,500 breeding pairs have been counted in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>Along with the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Fish_and_Wildlife_Service_423a.html" title="U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>, the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Department_of_Game_and_Inland_Fisheries_3b53.html" title="Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries">Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries</a> and the Conservation Center, VDOT monitors the falcons on each bridge to ensure they and their habitat are doing well. VDOT has even established falcon-specific contract requirements for the Structure and Bridge Division as it continues to identify other nesting sites.</p>
<p>Through placement of nesting boxes on 10 bridges maintained by VDOT, the endangered peregrine falcons -- considered the world's fastest birds -- once again fly high over Virginia's eastern seaboard. Because of the significant role it played in the recovery of the peregrine falcon in Virginia, VDOT earned the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Highway_Administration_1b3c.html" title="Federal Highway Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> Excellence Award in the category of Environment Protection and Enhancements.</p>
