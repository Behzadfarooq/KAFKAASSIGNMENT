</dl>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/g/Figured_bass.html" title="Figured bass">Figured bass</a> doesn't have "rules" as such - it's a system of notation rather than anything else. Perhaps it is meant to mean that it was condemned for not following the rules of harmony used in the 18th century, but if it does it should say that (and I doubt that would be true anyway - music in England at that time wasn't the most forward-looking in the world, but it wasn't <i>that</i> bad). The whole "commentary" section, indeed, needs work - "The present contributor considers..." is not a suitable way of writing for the Wikipedia (don't have time to work on this right now though). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<p>Benjamin Britten's continental influences will probably preclude him forever from the fame and respect he truly deserves in Britain. However fortunately his music does travel well and is appreciated in the rest of the world. The reactionary nature of the natives of Aldeborough STILL refuse to erect a statue of him because of his sexuality. Little do they realise that without Britten's putting Alborough on the map many of them would not have a thriving tourism and bed and breakfast income . <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorwikian_2eda.html" title="User:Norwikian">Norwikian</a> 09:07, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm questioning whether it's appropriate to have a "commentary" section such as this article has—it is proper to report critical commentary, but not for a wikipedia author to function as a critic himself. Someone familiar with this topic (not I) should review this section, though I think there are interesting observations/critiques in there. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 23:48, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

I think there's a case for saying a bit more - not to be prurient, but to point out that Britten and Pears were openly gay at a time when it was illegal in Britain to have male-male-sex. They couldn't give a damn who knew about their love life.

<p>I query the addition of the "pederasts" category. Is it beyond dispute that "Britten's children" amounted to pederasty? --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 11:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. Terms like "pederast" and "pedophile" have strict scientific definitions that may include people like Britten. However, these words are laden with tabloid hysteria and even some dictionary definitions presume that pederasty is defined by particular sexual acts. Also the point of categories is surely to focus on the things that make a person notable: Britten is a world-famous composer, not a world-famous pederast! <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluewave_f9db.html" title="User:Bluewave">Bluewave</a> 12:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

</dd>
<dd>Surely if there is any evidence of this, it is noteworthy and worthy of such categorisation. No one has raised whether it is true or not. If untrue, then I agree it should not place the composer in a category such as Pederast or Pedophiles, but I would hate to see any cavilling at a fact, if it is a fact. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlpheus_0c3a.html" title="User:Alpheus">Alpheus</a> 11:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The guidelines on categories say "Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category." At the moment it is certainly not self-evident and uncontroversial (based on the content of the article). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluewave_f9db.html" title="User:Bluewave">Bluewave</a> 14:46, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There was once a reference in the article to Britten's attraction to young boys, but it was removed anonymously some time ago. It read:
<dl>
<dd><i>The role of Miles in the last named [The Turn of the Screw] was created by the twelve-year-old <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hemmings_9677.html" title="David Hemmings">David Hemmings</a> with whom Britten, always drawn to young boys, became infatuated. The use of the boy's voice as a symbol at once of innocence and temptation is a recurring motif in Britten's music.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There is information on this topic in the Carpenter biography and in <i><a href="../../../b/r/i/Britten%27s_Children_5737.html" title="Britten's Children">Britten's Children</a></i>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilus_9e68.html" title="User:Wilus">Wilus</a> 13:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK then, there's two arguments here. Firstly, some of the facts from those books would have to be included in the article. Secondly, there is a judgement as to whether the facts amount to "pederasty". I've got 2 dictionaries on my shelves, both of which define pederasty in terms of "sodomy" and "sexual acts" between men and boys. I am pretty sure that neither the Carpenter biography (which from recollection is very cautious about the subject of Britten's relationships with boys) nor the "impeccably unsensational" Bridcutt book would support that suggestion. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluewave_f9db.html" title="User:Bluewave">Bluewave</a> 13:36, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I doubt that any encyclopaedic value is served by the reference to Britten's being born on the Feast of St Cecilia, patron saint of music, as there are thousands of Anglican and Roman Catholic saints, and many more famous people born on saints' days, but I imagine that any correlation is rarely if ever mentioned in any prestigious encyclopaedia.
