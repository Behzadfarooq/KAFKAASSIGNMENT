<p>Does anyone know what makes Connecticut a more likely state for the show than any other state? 24.130.126.57 03:13, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would guess because <i>Soap</i> was set in Connecticut, but that's hardly conclusive evidence. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 17:09, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I never thought of the Soap connection before, but I too always thought it was Connecticut. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nygoodliving (<a href="../../../n/y/g/User_talk%7ENygoodliving_6e87.html" title="User talk:Nygoodliving">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nygoodliving_4310.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nygoodliving">contribs</a>) 00:56, June 4, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>
<dd>I, too, thought it was Connecticut. Probably due to the fact that Benson had a map on his wall showing New Jersey, New York and Connecticut (in Benson's budget director office). However, when <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Land_3c48.html" title="TV Land">TV Land</a> ran a marathon, I noticed the left stage wall had a picture of the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> region (a southern continuation of the other map). The map that included Connecticut was more prominent, as it was clearly visible when there was a dialog scene in Benson's office. —<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwigboy_0aad.html" title="User:Twigboy">Twigboy</a> 15:48, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think Benson was set in Illinois, during the episode when Benson proposes to Senator Hartford, she hints that the party meeting in SpringField wants Bensen to run for governor.
<dl>
<dd>Presumably, you are implying that this is because Springfield is the capital of Illinois. However, Benson takes place in the state capital - why would they be referring explicitly to Springfield if they were <i>in</i> Springfield? Other than that... most states have a Springfield.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I put in a setting section, but it was removed. I understand the concern about the Chesapeake, but there is a section on setting for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, which has a similar ambiguity about location. Why should there not be one for Benson? Jm307 19:46, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There should be, as long as we can expand it beyond the fact that <i>Soap</i> was set in CT. Would we put references to disqualified states (such as Arizona and New Mexico, because they were referenced as travel destinations)? How about regional references (it never snowed, making it likely to be a southern state)? Or, does that suggestion qualify as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>? As I said before, I'm all for it, just needs expanding. —<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwigboy_0aad.html" title="User:Twigboy">Twigboy</a> 20:43, 5 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, the section I added was intended to be a start, not a be-all and end-all. Was the Snowbound episode supposed to take place in the same state? Also, in the episode Old School Ties, where they sent Katie to school, they said it was 300 miles away, but still in the same state, which would indicate that it was set in a state at least 300 miles wide in some direction (eliminating Connecticut). Jm307 22:49, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It cannot be Connecticut by evidence in the episode "Jessica" where Jessica, from Soap, is warned not to cause a scandal in the state as it might hurt the governor. According to notes that I took during the marathon I have ruled out the following states: Oregon, Colorado, Connecicut. The above mentioned "300 mile rule" (from the episode where they attempt to put Katie in bording school which was on the "other side of state.. 300 miles" indicating that the capital is at least 300 miles from a east-west border). This eliminates all of the New England states and most of the midatlantic states - looking at the map and culture evident in the show I think the most likely candidates are Frankfort, KY and Richmond, VA.--Usikyle 16:51, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is around 375 miles from Albany, NY to the border with Lake Erie and Pennsylvania. That, plus the presence of the map, is suggestive that it might be New York State. Jm307 02:45, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I added yet another setting section. This time, it is more NPOV. But it doesn't include all possible clues from the show (as I haven't seen every episode). Feel free to contribute... Jm307 03:04, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh dear. The <i>Setting</i> section really is too much. Clearly this, and many other shows, are absolutely set in a fictional place that <i>does not exist</i>. This is different from the show being set in a real place that is never named. The multiple script writers over the many years the show runs all turn in their scripts full of jokes and gags that are coined to get a laugh. They aren't making sly hints about the real-life town the show is set in. Words like "we came 1000 miles?!", "that's 100 miles to the <i>East</i>", "this ain't California!" etc are used not as hidden clues about the real place the show is set in, but because the writer thought that that gag worked in that script. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 22:21, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was thinking about it and actually remember watching the finale when it originally aired and I'm pretty sure they were watching the tv and heard the announcer say "the winner is..." and then the shot froze and the normal credits began. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nygoodliving (<a href="../../../n/y/g/User_talk%7ENygoodliving_6e87.html" title="User talk:Nygoodliving">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nygoodliving_4310.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nygoodliving">contribs</a>) 00:56, June 4, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Question: From the TV show "Benson," the Governor is a widower. How was the death of his wife explained?</dd>
<dd>Answer: She was eaten by horses.</dd>
</dl>
<p>How can this be confirmed?</p>
<p>I stumbled upon several cases of people eaten by horses, some from classic mythology: <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mares_of_Diomedes_f43f.html" title="Mares of Diomedes">Mares of Diomedes</a> ate <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abderus.html" title="Abderus">Abderus</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diomedes_King_of_Thrace_1e03.html" title="Diomedes King of Thrace">Diomedes King of Thrace</a>; also <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glaucus.html" title="Glaucus">Glaucus</a> of Potniae was torn apart by horses gone wild. Then goolge gave me this here ref. I don't know whether this trivia will be of any use for wikipedia, but what the heck? `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 06:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I strongly believe the governor is a democrat as evidenced in the first episode in which the governor tells Benson his daughter hates him and then Benson asks, "Why? Is she a Republican?" If there are no other facts to contradict this please add it somewhere to the article.</p>
