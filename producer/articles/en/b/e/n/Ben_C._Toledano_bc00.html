<p>Prior to filing as the lone <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> candidate for mayor, Toledano had been a member, first, of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a>, and, then, of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/States%27_Rights_Party_d127.html" title="States' Rights Party">States' Rights Party</a>. He sought to succeed the retiring two-term Democratic Mayor Victor H. Schiro in 1970. The Democrats had a slugfest for the office in two primaries held in the fall of 1969. The more <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> candidate, <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_Landrieu_fef3.html" title="Moon Landrieu">Maurice "Moon" Landrieu</a> was placed in a runoff -- this was before Louisiana had its <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_primary.html" title="Jungle primary">jungle primary</a> format -- with the more <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> former City Councilman <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Fitzmorris_4401.html" title="Jimmy Fitzmorris">James Edward "Jimmy" Fitzmorris, Jr.</a>, who would be elected lieutenant governor three years later and served from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>.</p>
<p>When Landrieu defeated Fitzmorris with a vow to carry on the liberal legacies of his predecessors, including <a href="../../../d/e/l/DeLesseps_Story_Morrison_9dc2.html" title="DeLesseps Story Morrison">deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr.</a>, (service: <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>), and then Mayor Schiro, Republicans sensed a rare opportunity in the Crescent City. Toledano appeared initially to be a strong contender for the position, for he picked up the support of many Fitzmorris leaders and waged an intense, well-organized, and heavily-financed campaign. Toledano noted that blacks had voted overwhelmingly for Landrieu, who would later serve in the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> administration as secretary of housing and urban development, but he mostly stressed the "need-for-a-change" theme always available for nearly any southern Republican seeking office at that time.</p>
<p>The 1970 mayoral race concluded with the highest turnout until that time in the history of the city, some 70 percent of registrants. Black participation in the general election surpassed what it had been in the Landrieu-Fitzmorris runoff. It was estimated that 80 percent of blacks cast ballots, and 98 percent supported Landrieu, the father of the state's current Democratic U.S. Senator <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Landrieu_7a0b.html" title="Mary Landrieu">Mary Landrieu</a> and Lieutenant Governor <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_Landrieu_563a.html" title="Mitch Landrieu">Mitch Landrieu</a>. Indeed, the Landrieus built a political dynasty, with their strength also demonstrated statewide.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_Landrieu_fef3.html" title="Moon Landrieu">Moon Landrieu</a> received 94,332 (59 percent) votes, compared to 65,558 (41 percent) for Toledano. The Republican won 60 percent of the votes of whites. Two shifts in the voting behavior of whites in New Orleans, soon to become a distinct minority of the city's population, occurred between the Democratic runoff and the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a>. A number of upper and middle income precincts in the Uptown University area and in <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algiers%2C_Louisiana_58b6.html" title="Algiers, Louisiana">Algiers</a>, switched from Landrieu to Toledano, mostly those which had voted Republican]] for president in the past. The 25 white precincts with the highest socio-economic status switched from Landrieu to Toledano. The other white voter change occurred in the mid-city area, where numerous middle-to-lower economic status precincts which had favored Fitzmorris in the runoff remained with the Democratic nominee in the general election. Otherwise, the Toledano vote pattern was similar to that for Fitzmorris.</p>
<p>Toledano's vote was patterned more on that of the 1968 <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_C._Wallace_c125.html" title="George C. Wallace">George C. Wallace</a>, Sr., support in New Orleans than the tabulation for the Republican ticket of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_M._Nixon_16b3.html" title="Richard M. Nixon">Richard M. Nixon</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiro_T._Agnew_f5e7.html" title="Spiro T. Agnew">Spiro T. Agnew</a>. Nixon had won 26.7 percent in <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orleans_Parish_af61.html" title="Orleans Parish">Orleans Parish</a>, compared to 32.7 percent for Wallace, and 40.6 percent for Vice President <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_Humphrey_c118.html" title="Hubert Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a>. In the runoff, Landrieu scored well with former Nixon supporters, but he lost to Toledano a number of white precincts which Nixon had carried less than two years earlier. Three Louisiana political scientists who analyzed the New Orleans mayoral returns concluded that Republicans could never become competitive unless they appealed to "the more moderate instincts of the upper and upper-middle socio-economic status white voters . . . as well as the black voters." Of course, the racial composition of New Orleans changed drastically in the coming decade, and the white vote was significant thereafter only as a swing bloc vote between two black candidates. The political scientists underestimated the attrition of the white population from New Orleans. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> elected its first black mayor, and all mayors since that time have been blacks.</p>

<p>Toledano's showing propelled him in 1972 to seek the U.S. Senate seat held by 36-year incumbent Democrat <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_J._Ellender_209d.html" title="Allen J. Ellender">Allen J.

Ellender died on July 27, and Johnston was left as the <i>de facto</i> Democratic nominee. Former Governor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McKeithen_b5fb.html" title="John McKeithen">John McKeithen</a> then filed as an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_%28politician%29.html" title="Independent (politician)">independent</a> because the time had passed for Democrats to enter the primary. Johnston entered the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a> as the prohibitive favorite even though McKeithen had been the only governor up until that time to serve two consecutive terms and even though <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> appeared to be coasting to an easy reelection and might have some level of coattails for a candidate like Toledano.</p>
<p>Johnston polled 598,987 votes (55.2 percent); McKeithen drew 250,161 (23.1 percent), and Toledano finished third with 206,846 (19.1 percent). <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_M._Lyons_fcb9.html" title="Hall M.

<p>Toledano's performance was extremely weak. His best showing was a meager 30 percent in <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Parish_fbed.html" title="Jefferson Parish">Jefferson Parish</a>, which supported Treen for Congress and Nixon for president. In previously inclined Republican parishes <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia_Parish%2C_Louisiana_f884.html" title="Iberia Parish, Louisiana">Iberia</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/d/Caddo_Parish%2C_Louisiana_9243.html" title="Caddo Parish, Louisiana">Caddo</a>, for instance, Toledano failed to win even a fourth of the vote.</p>

<p>Toledano returned to his law practice, with his political ventures seemingly in his past. Years later, he emerged as a columnist, author, and political thinker, writing for <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_F._Buckley_6696.html" title="William F. Buckley">William F. Buckley</a>'s <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a></i> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fleming_107c.html" title="Thomas Fleming">Thomas Fleming</a>'s <i>Chronicles Magazine</i>, a <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleoconservative.html" title="Paleoconservative">paleoconservative</a> publication from <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockford%2C_Illinois_fc91.html" title="Rockford, Illinois">Rockford, Illinois</a>. Paleoconservatives generally follow the viewpoints of such individuals as the defeated presidential candidate <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_J._Buchanan_5d32.html" title="Patrick J. Buchanan">Patrick J. Buchanan</a> or the late columnist <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Francis_94e5.html" title="Samuel Francis">Samuel Francis</a>. They believe that "neoconservatives" in national Republican administrations have "sold out" traditional Republican values to keep the United States involved in endless war to promote "democracy" and to promote international trade agreements which lead to outsourcing of American jobs. Toledano hence writes in the Buchanan-Francis mold by taking what the media would call "hard-right" positions on issues. Over the years, Toledano alienated many politicians.</p>
<p>In 1981, Governor <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Washington_Edwards_f7d7.html" title="Edwin Washington Edwards">Edwin Washington Edwards</a> said that he expected to draw considerable Republican support when he ran for a third term in 1983 against sitting Republican Governor Treen. But, Edwards clarified, "I would not want Ben Toledano supporting me … he’s poison. I don’t want him involved in my campaign." Toledano replied: "Most people don’t receive very many special compliments in a lifetime. I am deeply flattered by Edwards’ remarks. Love me most for the enemies I have made."</p>
<p>In 2004, Toledano wrote a review of <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Phillips_3360.html" title="Kevin Phillips">Kevin Phillips</a>'s <i>American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush</i>. Toledano was as critical of the Bushes as any Democrat had been: "There was a time when people in high places believed in avoiding even the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appearance_of_impropriety.html" title="Appearance of impropriety">appearance of impropriety</a>. Phillips' book suggest that the Bushes do not even know what propriety is." Toledano continued, in reference to the religious conversion of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>: "I choose not to question the sincerity of George W.’s conversion and faith . . . Unlike his father, whose deeds defy and defile his words, he may well be a true believer even if he uses his beliefs to obtain political support and votes."</p>
