<p>Rush was born in the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Consolidation%2C_1854_86df.html#Byberry.2C_Township_of" title="Act of Consolidation, 1854">Township of Byberry</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_County%2C_Pennsylvania_1728.html" title="Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia County</a>, which was about 14 miles from the center of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>. The township was incorporated into Philadelphia in 1854, and now remains one of its neighborhoods. His father died when he was six, and Rush spent most of his early life with his maternal uncle, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reverend_b654.html" title="The Reverend">the Reverend</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Finley_1351.html" title="Samuel Finley">Samuel Finley</a>. He attended Samuel Finley's academy at Nottingham which would later become <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Nottingham_Academy_60a4.html" title="West Nottingham Academy">West Nottingham Academy</a>.</p>
<p>He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree at the College of New Jersey (now <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>), and then obtained a medical degree at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Edinburgh_53c2.html" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>. While in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> practicing medicine, he learned <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>. Returning to the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirteen_colonies.html" title="Thirteen colonies">Colonies</a> in 1769, Rush opened a medical practice in Philadelphia and became Professor of Chemistry at the College of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It has been alleged that, prior to his marriage to Julia Stockton, Dr. Rush had been engaged in 1774 to a Miss Sarah Eve, daughter of gunpowder manufacturer and pro-British Loyalist, Oswell Eve Sr., but she died while under the care of Dr. Redman, through the consultation of Dr. Rush, two weeks before the wedding was to take place on Christmas.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1781.html" title="1781">1781</a> Dr. Rush and his wife Julia, bought a plantation in <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Township%2C_Philadelphia_County%2C_Pennsylvania_a7b3.html" title="Oxford Township, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania">Oxford Township</a>, Pennsylvania; this was their summer residence until it was sold on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1792.html" title="1792">1792</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Facts about the summer residency were long under dispute until the recent discovery of an advertisement confirming the Summer Home ownership and residency.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...the Improvements consist of a large stone Mansion House, Kitchen, &amp;c. suitable for a large family, formerly the summer residence of the late Dr. Rush: a stone Spring House, a Pump of excellent water, a frame Barn and Stable, a good Garden, two Orchards of prime fruit; also, a tenant’s House, with Garden and Orchard, &amp;c. There are on the farm an Excellent Building and Whet Stone Quarry, both Of which may be worked to great profit, known by the name of Harper’s Quarry. This farm is plentifully supplied with water from a number springs, and from <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankford_Creek_09da.html" title="Frankford Creek">Frankford Creek</a>, which forms a part of the boundary line...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One advertisement appeared in several newspapers, proving the Oxford Township Plantation, which served as Dr. Rush's cottage farm and summer residence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Philadelphia, March 22, 1786.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By virtue of a Writ of <i>venditioni exponas</i> to me directed, will be exposed to Public Sale by Vendue, at the premises on SATURDAY the 1st day of April next, at two o'clock in the afternoon, a certain Plantation, Tract or Piece of Land, situate, lying, and being in the township of Oxford in the county of Philadelphia, containing about 189 acres, (5 acres thereof meadows and 30 woodland) within 6 miles of the city of Philadelphia and from the village of Frankfort, being on the road which leads from Frankfort to the old York road, and bounded by lands of Dr. Rush, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Redman_8839.html" title="John Redman">Dr. Redman</a>, Captain Eves, Frankfort Creek, &amp;c.

</blockquote>
<p>The proximity of the Rush summer residence may tie into the studies he had done on the Harrowgate Mineral Springs located about a half mile away.</p>
<p>He published the first American textbook on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">Chemistry</a>, several volumes on medical student education, and wrote influential patriotic essays. He was active in the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sons_of_Liberty_d147.html" title="Sons of Liberty">Sons of Liberty</a> and was elected to attend the provincial conference to send delegates to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Congress_9db6.html" title="Continental Congress">Continental Congress</a>.

He was appointed to represent Pennsylvania and signed the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>In 1777 he became surgeon-general of the middle department of the Continental Army. Conflicts with the Army Medical service, specifically with Dr. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shippen%2C_Jr._32b5.html" title="William Shippen, Jr.">William Shippen, Jr.</a>, led to Rush's resignation.</p>
<p>As General <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> suffered a series of defeats in the war, Rush campaigned for his removal, as part of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conway_Cabal_cf82.html" title="Conway Cabal">Conway Cabal</a>, losing his trust and ending Rush's war activities. Rush later regretted his actions against Washington. In a letter to John Adams in 1812, Rush wrote, "He [Washington] was the highly favored instrument whose patriotism and name contributed greatly to the establishment of the independence of the United States."</p>
<p>In 1783 he was appointed to the staff of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Hospital_fec4.html" title="Pennsylvania Hospital">Pennsylvania Hospital</a>, of which he remained a member until his death.</p>
<p>He was elected to the Pennsylvania convention which adopted the Federal constitution, and was appointed treasurer of the U.S. Mint, serving from 1797-1813.</p>
<p>He became Professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> in 1791, though the quality of his medicine was quite primitive even for the time: he advocated bleeding (for almost any illness) long after its practice had declined. He became a social activist, an abolitionist, and was the most well-known physician in America at the time of his death. He was also founder of the private liberal arts college <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dickinson_College_23d7.html" title="Dickinson College">Dickinson College</a>, in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlisle%2C_Pennsylvania_abf5.html" title="Carlisle, Pennsylvania">Carlisle, Pennsylvania</a></p>

<p>Rush believed that Americans should enshrine the right to medical freedom in their <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Constitution_b784.html" title="United States Constitution">Constitution</a>, much as the right to freedom of religion is expressly guaranteed in that document.</p>
<p>Rush is reported to have argued that "Unless we put Medical Freedom into the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> . . . to restrict the art of healing to one class of men, and deny equal privilege to others, will be to constitute the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastille.html" title="Bastille">Bastille</a> of Medical Science.

<p>As a prominent Presbyterian doctor and professor of chemistry in Philadelphia, Benjamin Rush provided a bold and respected voice against slave trade that could not be ignored. The highlight of his involvement to abolish slavery could be the pamphlet he wrote that appeared in Philadelphia, Boston, and New York in 1773 entitled "An Address to the Inhabitants of the British Settlements in America, upon Slave-Keeping." In this first of his many attacks on the social evils of his day, he not only attacks the slave trade, but the entire institution of slavery. In 1787 Rush became an ardent abolitionist after having a dream in which the ghost of Benezet, who had died in 1784, came walking down the beach to meet a group of Africans who had been relating stories about the horrors of slavery to Rush. He awoke from the dream determined to fill the gap left by Benezet's death. Though still a slaveowner himself, in 1788 he also promised freedom to his slave, William Grubber. He co-founded, served as secretary, and later president (1803-13) of America's first abolitionist society named the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Anything less than freedom for all men, black and white, would, he knew, give the lie to the republican idealism of '76. Influenced by this resolve, In 1766 when Rush set out for his studies in Edinburgh, was outraged by the sight of 100 slave ships in Liverpool harbor. In his efforts to aid Philadelphia's black community, Rush was heavily involved in promoting the African Church. He also recruited Richard Allen, Absalom Jones, and other blacks to help him attend the sick during the yellow fever epidemic of 1793.</p>
<p>Dr.Rush argued scientifically that Negroes were not by nature intellectually or morally inferior. Any apparent evidence to the contrary was only the perverted expression of slavery, which "is so foreign to the human mind, that the moral faculties, as well as those of the understanding are debased, and rendered torpid by it."</p>
<p>Rush died in 1813, just as his former pupil, Charles Caldwell, was gaining national recognition for his theories on innate racial differences and the inferiority of Africans and their descendants - a position that Rush had spent much of his life attempting to disprove to a young America, paving the way for the eventual realization for mankind to surrender prejudice to the universal truth that "all men are created equal."</p>

<p>Rush was an advocate of forced psychiatric treatment. According to psychiatry historian <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Szasz_eb3d.html" title="Thomas Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a>, one of Rush's favorite methods of treatment was to tie a patient to a board and spin it rapidly until all the blood went to the head.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> He even placed his own son in one of his hospitals for 27 years, until he died. He was also an advocate of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloodletting.html" title="Bloodletting">bloodletting</a>.</p>
<p>Rush believed that being black was a hereditary illness, which he referred to as "negroidism". In an address to the American Philosophical Society, Rush said that the only evidence of a "cure" was when the skin color turned white. Rush drew the conclusion that "Whites should not tyrannize over [blacks], for their disease should entitle them to a double portion of humanity. However, by the same token, whites should not intermarry with them, for this would tend to infect posterity with the 'disorder'... attempts must be made to cure the disease."</p>

In fact, he is considered the "Father of American Psychiatry", publishing the first textbook on the subject in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, <i>Medical Inquiries and Observations upon the Diseases of the Mind</i> (1812). Rush was also an advocate of insane asylums, believing that with proper treatment mental diseases could be cured. An Asylum was even constructed in the area of his birthplace (See <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_State_Hospital_7697.html" title="Philadelphia State Hospital">Philadelphia State Hospital</a>). The emblem of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychiatric_Association_f5df.html" title="American Psychiatric Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> bears his portrait. Benjamin Rush was also responsible for the invention of the idea of <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addiction.html" title="Addiction">addiction</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to his work, drunkenness was viewed as being sinful, and a matter of choice. Rush introduced the idea that the <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> loses control over himself, and identified the properties of alcohol, rather than the alcoholic's choice, as the causal agent. He developed the conception of addiction as a form of medical disease, and finally developed the idea that abstinence is the only cure for addiction.</p>
<p>Rush is sometimes considered the father of therapeutic <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horticulture.html" title="Horticulture">horticulture</a>, particularly as it pertains to the institutionalized. In his book 'Medical Inquiries upon Diseases of the Mind' published in 1812 Rush wrote:</p>
<p>"It has been remarked, that the maniacs of the male sex in all hospitals, who assist in cutting wood, making fires, and digging in a garden, and the females who are employed in washing, ironing, and scrubbing floors, often recover, while persons, whose rank exempts them from performing such services, languish away their lives within the walls of the hospital".</p>
<p>Besides his contributions to <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatry.html" title="Psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, Benjamin Rush wrote a descriptive account of the <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_fever.html" title="Yellow fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic that struck Philadelphia in 1793 (during which he treated up to 120 patients per day), and what is considered to be the first case report on <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dengue_fever.html" title="Dengue fever">dengue fever</a> (published in 1789 on a case from 1780).</p>
<p>Rush lived during the <i>Age of Heroic Medicine</i> (1780-1850), and is considered a strong advocate of “<a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroic_medicine.html" title="Heroic medicine">heroic medicine</a>”.</p>
<p>During his career, he educated over 3000 medical students, and several of these established <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Medical_College_d653.html" title="Rush Medical College">Rush Medical College</a> (Chicago) in his honor after his death. One of his last apprentices was <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_A._Cartwright_15e9.html" title="Samuel A. Cartwright">Samuel A. Cartwright</a>, later a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate States of America</a> surgeon charged with improving sanitary conditions in the camps around <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicksburg%2C_Mississippi_ea1a.html" title="Vicksburg, Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>, and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Hudson%2C_Louisiana_aa2c.html" title="Port Hudson, Louisiana">Port Hudson, Louisiana</a>.</p>

Additional new notes* on the advertisement: (1) "Captain Eves" was Captain John Eve, brother of Sarah Eve, who by then was operating the Frankford powder-mill, as his loyalist father, Oswell Eve, was in exile in Nova Scotia and latter settled on Cat Island in the Bahamas. (See American Loyalist Records, A0 13/18 page numbers (folios) 17, 20-87 <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/</a> ) (2) Dr. Redman is Doctor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Redman_8839.html" title="John Redman">John Redman</a>, mentor of Dr. Benjamin Rush. (3) In the early days, Frankford Pa. was also spelled as Frankfort. (4) The "road which leads from Frankfort to the Old York road" could be either Adamsroad or Fisher’s Lane. (5) Adamsroad led to Whitemarsh while Fisher’s Lane led to Germantown, and was also referred to as "the road to Germantown." (6) Many roads, that were not Adamsroad or Fisher's Lane, also shared the name "the road to Germantown," as many other area roads also led to Germantown. (7) Today these roads are called Adams Avenue and E. Fisher's Lane. They are still in use today, but are broken streets by the design of the City of Philadelphia.</li>
