<p>On the Jeff Rense Show on Sept 22, 2006 the guest named William H. Kennedy claimed that he got Brad Patrick to remove his entry from Wiki and that you were a Protestant Bigot from Nothern Ireland! Thought you would want to know. Yo Yo Go Go 00:50, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no Wikipedia entry on William H. Kennedy check for yourself. There used to be and now its gone. Brad Patrick caved in -- what a wimp! Kennedy was on the Jeff Rense show on Sept 22, 2006 and did call you a Protestant Bigot! If you are so divorsed from reality that you cannot assess hard facts than you are a typical Wikipedia editor!

<dd>No I mean who says I'm a Protestant? Also I don't believe my name appeared on some silly radio show spouting such incorrect items about me.

<dd>Well Jeff Rense has over 8 million listeners per day and you were mentioned. Check for yourself at www.rense.com -- you can fact check that yourself. If you are not Protestant than you can sue Rense for allowing Slander on his show. I sent the interview to Gerry Adams's group and others who do not like your kind. You are not from a Catholic background and it is for you to prove differently. I hope the Brit rule ends in Northern Ireland and it will as Catholics out breed the frigid Protestant men!

<p>Sorry you appear to have me confused with someone else. I'm not an Orangeman or a member of the Orange Order and I find the thought that you would think I am quite offensive. I cannot stand the 12th July and have no time for bigoted people on either side of the so called petty religious divide that exists just because some people cannot get along with their neighbours. Also you have not been able to tell me anything I've supposedly done. I've been accused of being a radical Unionist, and a radical Republican on Wikipedia and I can guarantee you I'm neither of those. I really should have been born Swiss or Swedish, neutral people who can get on with others. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 19:55, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But the links I added were relavent to those properties seeing the games does go indepth on the whole Alien and Predator universe in detail. AvPvM is not one of those here today, gone tomorrow fan sites. It has been around for years. The detail in the game (which I do not own or contribute too) goes in detail for Marines, Aliens, and Predator species independantly.</p>
<p>Have you even looked at **<a href="http://www.avpvm.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.avpvm.com/" rel="nofollow">AVPVM</a> to claim it does not follow all three species?</p>

<p>You must have a lot of time on your hands. It seems to me that you are wasting your time spending your days changing your things from Ireland to Rep. of Ireland and from Ireland to Northern. This is an obvious political issue for you. According to Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">Country</a>, it states that <b>In the English language, the terms nation (cultural), country (geographical) and state (political) do have precise meanings, but in daily speech and writing they are often used interchangeably, and are open to different interpretations.</b> When we are stating the country that a player or person comes from, we are merely stating a geographical location. Its obvious that your actions, are political and you are trying to make a political statement on each page. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrainc_cc24.html" title="User:Frainc">Frainc</a> 16:27 20 September 2006</p>

<dd>Um excuse me? I have no political motivations whatsoever with these edits, merely altering the items in question so the "Country of birth" points to the country article. Do you have a political motivation then to want it to point to the article on the island of Ireland rather than the country of Ireland when that isn't what the information is stated to be representing? Anyway nation, state and country are all Republic of Ireland, commonly referred to as Ireland. Also note that I am not altering the text of the articles, and I presume you're talking about the GAA articles here, to say Republic of Ireland, simply the linking to link to the country it is talking about. I have no political motivations whatsoever beyond striving for some degree of consistency and accuracy of definition on Wikipedia and these edits are by no means useless as you seem to imply. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:58, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi - you've just sent me a message complaining about my deleting content from Wikipedia. What I've actually done is move a biography of an individual on the Popular Alliance (UK) article into a separate article for the individual concerned. What's more I intend to do the same with the other bio. The objective is to make the page more like an encyclopedia and less like a soapbox for the Popular Alliance (UK). I don't see why this is considered vandalism but if you've got any advice or comments on how to do this better then please let me know. Dennett p 11:29, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ben instead of just targeting me and telling me not remove warnings, which are false and hypocritical,I suggest you take a look at what <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">User:Hkelkar</a> and his accomplice or could be sock puppet <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">User:bakasuprman</a> been up to.

<dd>You removed valid warnings, you have been blocked for them last week. Removal of valid warnings is construed as vandalism. Also accusing <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">User:bakasuprman</a> of being a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">User:Hkelkar</a> is just preposterous is you spend even 10 seconds looking at those user accounts, they are not the same person.

Note that he continually vandalizes <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kancha_Ilaiah_e7d5.html" title="Kancha Ilaiah">Kancha Ilaiah</a> page by removal of links, I have given him a warnings before and have given him a final warning.

<p>Ben this fellow <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">User:Hkelkar</a> continues to remove the legitimate warning left for continually vandalizing Kancha Ilaiah page. He continually removes relevant links from Kancha Ilaiah page that I have to re-add constantly. I don't care if he claims a so called "anti-hindu" platform, which is a smoke screen to browbeat people and devalue and try to discredit other people. He has used this as a excuse long enough.</p>
<p>He seems to make a agenda of making harsh attacks against people that might remove bias or add relevant items to biographies of people he doesn't agree with. He is becoming quite a problem and he is hypocritical in that his first actions are to attack and make stupendous claims and warnings but will remove any legitimate warning from his page. He has been warned many times before, actions might need to be taken, as he is not taking seriously what civility means on wikipedia and thinks hes above others in being able to vandalize pages.</p>

I actually think kathanr's a pretty nice guy.I don't consider his edits (most of them anyway) to be in conformity with wikipedia policy so I criticized them as is my duty as a wikipedian. I continue to be disappointed at the partisan biases on wikipedia articles which shoot the scholarly value of the encyclopedia straight to the Ninth Circle of Hell guided there by certain wikipedia Kerberoses (being such a Christian-lover, I'm sure Kathanar knows what that means). The reason why I joined up on wikipedia is because of it's reputation for inaccuracy which I am doing my level best to correct. I do not believe that we can let non-knowledgable editors mess up the process until they learn wikipedia policy and learn to do good research in order to make their edits. I am happy to help Kathanar in this regard provided he stops hatemongering and bugging me.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 19:49, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree with your personal attacks against any edit I make. I ask for a NPOV on my edits. You have demonstrated in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Talk%7EProhibition_f6a1.html" title="Talk:Prohibition">Talk:Prohibition</a> that you discuss without even reading about the topics in question (you claimed to be an expert on Prohibition before having read the article Prohibition (drugs))!!</p>
<p>It´s you who should read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Neutrality arises from colective edition of the wikipedia. You are preventing that with an agenda of your own, and stubborn reverting. I disregard your vandalism on my edits. I insist: I would like to hear criticism from neutral and informed editors, but not again from you or your friends (who pop immediately to support you and your agenda) who for example say in Talk:Prohibition that alcohol is not a drug, and tell me POV because stating that it is.</p>
<p>That´s not serious, much less neutral from your team of reverters <a href="../../../d/r/c/User%7EDrcaldev_d54c.html" title="User:Drcaldev">Drcaldev</a> 06:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And what friends would you be talking about? Just because other editors appear and support my position doesn't mean I'm soliciting them to do so. In fact with regards to your accusing me of calling up friends (something I haven't done), you in fact tried to rally round support for one of your set of changes from users in the Wikipedia community and they ended up voting against you. Calling terms that you may personally disagree with ad hoc proganda terms, is not a neutral perspective. Changing "<b>Addiction</b> is a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_disease.html" title="Chronic disease">chronic disorder</a> " to "<b>Addiction</b> is a pejorative, historical term to refer to <a href="../../../d/e/p/Dependence.html" title="Dependence">dependence</a> on substances (such as analgesics) or behaviors (such as gambling)," is not neutral. You very obviously have a deep seated interest in one side of the discussions on these terms and the criminalisation of certain drugs in the United States. If you have such deep seated interests in promoting one sides POV and feelings then you can find difficulty in writing about a topic neutrally. I have no strong opinions on this matter, I simply am fixing disruptive agenda and POV pushing edits to Wikipedia which many of your edits unfortunately are. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ben, I agree with the idea of leaving legitimate warnings on one's talk page. However, what you've reverted on my talk page is not a legitimate warning. Indeed, it is a content dispute, which <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">User:Mantanmoreland</a> refuses to address. Furthermore, you've got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion/Removing_warnings" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion/Removing_warnings" rel="nofollow">this</a> to consider, As well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=71958262&amp;oldid=71957815" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SlimVirgin&amp;diff=71958262&amp;oldid=71957815" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and the best one of all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mantanmoreland&amp;diff=65842854&amp;oldid=65842659" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mantanmoreland&amp;diff=65842854&amp;oldid=65842659" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<p>It is sheer ludicrousness for you to compare references to 'County Derry' to renaming London as Berlin, and I'm sure you are intelligent enough to know it. There are <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22County+Derry%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22County+Derry%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">stacks of pages</a> mentioning 'County Derry'. There are also lots of places commonly known by an abbreviated form of their name: the city on the Humber is not called 'Hull' but Kingston-upon-Hull; Bo'ness is really Borrowstounness. And what about Rhodesia? The formal renaming of Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia never happened (was never given assent).</p>
<p>The fact is that most nationalists refer to County Derry and indeed the Wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Londonderry_9cae.html" title="County Londonderry">County Londonderry</a> begins "County Londonderry or County Derry". <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. “<a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>”. 18:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that Wikipedia should be consistent in whatever it chooses for the name -- certainly not have "Bateau" used where the page is titled "Batou," for example. Based on the original edit at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batou.html" title="Batou">Batou</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBatou_769e.html" title="Talk:Batou">Talk:Batou</a>, I thought that Bateau had the stronger claim; I followed up with some Googling, where Bateau seemed to be in common usage, and found that where names were spelled in DVD sleeves and such, it was Bateau. Since we have to choose one for consistency, that seems the better option to me. (Direct transliteration of the Japanese isn't always appropriate when western words are being used; e.g. <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Elric_148c.html" title="Edward Elric">Edward Elric</a> certainly shouldn't be "Edowado Erurikku".) <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKundor_08ba.html" title="User:Kundor">Kundor</a> 16:58, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that Batou is both much more common, and the official spelling used by Production IG <a href="http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works_sp/47_/s03_/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works_sp/47_/s03_/index.html" rel="nofollow">Production IG Site</a>. There is nothing wrong most of the time with direct transliteration of the Japanese in these cases, Edowado Erurikku is a very bad example as that is actually the best way they could translate into Japanese the name Edward Elric. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 17:02, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My point was that both Edward Elric and Bateau are European names which were transliterated into Japanese, and as such we should use the original Western spellings in English. Given that Production IG uses it, I have no real objection to either spelling being used; I just want it to be consistent. I still think that Bateau has a slight edge, but if you want to change all the instances to Batou I won't revert.

<p>Ben. Very many thanks for the heads up. I've been through this before - see my comments on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Troubles_in_Tynan_943e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Troubles in Tynan">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Troubles in Tynan</a>. People seem to have lost the whole stub concept and are keener to delete than add constructively to the development of articles. I am really fed up wasting time on these useless debates instead of writing articles. Sorry for the rant.

<p>You just called me for editing the NI page - I was browsing looking for things to do in NI, as I was considering a trip there. When I read the wp entry, it had been vandalised to say that "Northern Ireland is not part of the United Kingdom", so, bravely venturing into editing a wiki for the first time, I removed the "not". Nothing contentious there I'd have thought - but on further inspection, I saw some smart@rse had changed the details on the right hand side of the page to show the capital as dublin, etc. etc. This was beyond my skills to fix, so I left it there.</p>
<p>Check your edit history properly before threatening to block people.</p>
<p>[follow up] Thanks for the apology, have a good Christmas.</p>

<p>The counties listed are not stated and the legal place that they are from it denotes the Fleadh region they are representing - i.e. if you won the Dublin Fleadh it would not show you legal county of residence such as County Fingal, County Rathdown-Dun Laor etc but the representive county Fleadh, in that case the County Dublin Fleadh - same goes for Tipperary and Derry. Those who qualify outside of Ireland represent their local CCE branch. Its like saying that the articles <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londonderry_Port_875e.html" title="Londonderry Port">Londonderry Port</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londonderry_Sentinel_69da.html" title="Londonderry Sentinel">Londonderry Sentinel</a> <a href="../../../f/o/y/Foyle_and_Londonderry_College_84b1.html" title="Foyle and Londonderry College">Foyle and Londonderry College</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londonderry_railway_station.html" title="Londonderry railway station">Londonderry railway station</a> should all be renamed to Derry as they as situated within the city, of course they shouldnt because they are not using they name in any legal sense <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeaumontproject_224c.html" title="User:Beaumontproject">Beaumontproject</a> 11:02, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Then you had best get busy, as other stadium articles I've seen don't specify the country, sometimes they don't even specify the state, just the city (although I supposed most everyone knows where New York is). <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 12:58, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm not about to get into a standalone revert war on this issue.
