<p><i>Of course, a project coordinator cannot really be anything like a dictator in the sense that he or she ultimately cannot enforce a decision, since a project fork is always possible.</i></p>
<p>I think that in principle this statement is not true, although it may, for all I know, be true very often in practice in the open source world. There is a huge cost in terms of time and effort to grow breakaway project of any sort. This can be very clearly seen in many of the political systems that are supposed to be "representative democracies". In theory, anyone who is not satisfied with the political parties on offer can start their own. In practice this is extremely difficult, if not impossible in many cases. Therefore the people who control the political parties (typically the backroom kingmakers) really do have power approaching that of dictators.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is less difficult to fork a software project than it is to create a grassroots movement in a corrupt political system, but it is difficult nonetheless.</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fork_%28software_development%29.html" title="Fork (software development)">Fork (software development)</a> has some comments on the feasibility of forking. <a href="../../../i/n/k/Inkscape.html" title="Inkscape">Inkscape</a> might be seen as a successful fork where one reason for the fork was dissatisfaction with the existing dictator's decisions (in this case, as to what patches to accept). There are numerous examples of successful forks where the dissatisfaction is with the existing dictator's choice of licensing (<a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenSSH_9781.html" title="OpenSSH">OpenSSH</a>, <a href="../../../x/2E/o/X.org.html" title="X.org">X.org</a>, possibly the fledgling <a href="../../../c/d/r/Cdrkit.html" title="Cdrkit">cdrkit</a> project). If the great majority of developers and/or redistributors of a project are in disagreement with the existing dictator, then a fork may be successful. [The cdrkit example is interesting here in that the existing dictator was providing almost all of the development work in the original project, so it's an example of where the fork is motivated by the distributors rather than the existing developers of a project.]</dd>

<p>Many of the projects listed would probably devolve without the named author. Does this make them a dictator ( implies that no one else *CAN TAKE* control ) or just passionate ( no else *WANTS* control )? Without that core developer to put up with the thankless job day in and day out while maintaining a very public face and taking flack for the 1 bad bug in 10 or 100K lines of code most people would be certified insane if they actually wanted to do that job.</p>

<dd>Hi Chealer, in my opinion it's notable that an open source luminary actually names himself using (his riff on) the BDFL acronym, thus I think it's worth mentioning in this article. Why, in your opinion, should SABDFL not be mentioned? I also note that you removed Mark Shuttleworth from the list of BDFLs, even though Shuttleworth verifiably refers to himself and is referred to as a (SA)BDFL. 195.173.23.111 13:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi 195.173.23.111. Sorry but English is not my native language and I don't understand much of your first sentence. What do you mean by "riff on"? I explained in the message you replied to why SABDFL should not be mentioned. It does not appear relevant. Thank you for the exact information about SABDFL you added to the article. I consider it exact and invite again interested people to start a Wiktionary entry using that information. I haven't seen evidence yet that Mark Shuttleworth refers to himself or is referred to as a BDFL. So for now, I am removing the information from the article and Mark Shuttleworth from the list of BDFLs. If you can provide a reference for Mark Shuttleworth being referred to as a BDFL, please do. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChealer_e61a.html" title="User:Chealer">Chealer</a> 23:30, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Chealer. A "riff" is "a clever or inventive commentary or remark". Mark Shuttleworth is a notable open-source leader. He is explicitly referencing the BDFL concept with his chosen nickname. He is not referred to as a BDFL, regardless of whether he is or isn't one. I don't think he is a BDFL. However, his chosen name notably references BDFLs, and this chosen name is notable. A notable person making a notable reference to the subject matter of this page is worth including on this page. The page does not have a requirement that it can only mention people who are taxonomically BDFLs - it can mention notable references to the concept. 195.173.23.111 13:04, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi again 195.173.23.111. First, sorry about my previous removal justification. I misguessed what your first sentence meant. Thanks to your explanation, I think I understand it now. I agree that Mark Shuttleworth is a notable person and that his nickname SABDFL is notable. However, it's not clear that SABDFL makes a <b>notable</b> reference to BDFL. If SABDFL is a "riff on the BDFL acronym", then it may be notable, but the proposed text doesn't explain how SABDFL is a riff. I would like this to be explained before readding the text.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChealer_e61a.html" title="User:Chealer">Chealer</a> 05:59, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not really sure what you are hoping for when you demand clarification of SABDFL "notably" referencing BDFL. But I would request that we can at least allow the previous text (stating what SABDFL stands for and that it's Mark Shuttleworth's personal IRC nickname) into the article.</dd>

<dd>I believe it would be original research to speculate <i>why</i> Mark Shuttleworth calls himself "sabdfl" and "Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life", or how he thinks people will interpret his nickname. As far as I know, he hasn't given an interview simply to discuss his choice of IRC nickname. But I hope we can agree that the acronym "BDFL", when it expands to "Benevolent Dictator For Life", is a very <i>specific</i> acronym. If someone says just "BDFL", they could mean anything (such as Bath and District Football League). But if someone says the phrase "benevolent dictator for life", they are unlikely to be doing it in ignorance of the phrase's use in the open source community, because the phrase/acronym was coined in the open source community, and it's unlikely that someone would independently re-invent the phrase.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further to this, Mark Shuttleworth is <i>undeniably</i> a member of the open source community, in his position as leader of the Ubuntu project. So not only is it generally unlikely that he says "benevolent dictator for life" without referencing the open source community's terminology, it's specifically likely that he - a notable open source community member - would not use the "benevolent dictator for life" phrase without intending it to be a reference to the common phrase used in the open source community.</dd>

<dd>So, I have difficulty understanding why you need Mark Shuttleworth to announce his intentions behind calling himself the "Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life" before you will permit a reference to him and his IRC nickname on this page. As he is engaged daily with the open source community, to me it is <i>inconcievable</i> that his use of the phrase "Benevolent Dictator For Life" is <i>not</i> a reference to the open source community's "Benevolent Dictator For Life" concept. To me, an open source leader calling themselves "Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life" can only possibly be a reference to the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" concept. 62.31.67.29 17:11, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Chealer, please notice several paragraphs of why your emphasised word is irrelevant. Both Shuttleworth as a person and his IRC nickname are notable, referenced and verifiable. You're asking for something above and beyond what Wikipedia requires. What do you actually have against inclusion of the single well-referenced sentence explaining SABDFL? 62.31.67.29 10:47, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. If Mark Shuttleworth or anyone's IRC nickname would be "SlashdotDude", it wouldn't be appropriate to mention that in the Slashdot article just because it's a reference from a notable property of a notable person. It's the same thing here. What I have against the inclusion of that sentence is that it brings nothing to the article and is therefore superfluous in its current form. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChealer_e61a.html" title="User:Chealer">Chealer</a> 20:40, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be mistaking <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Shuttleworth_b9fb.html" title="Mark Shuttleworth">Mark Shuttleworth</a> for some random non-notable person. If a notable person is also notable for their nickname, Wikipedia always mentions it (see <a href="../../../m/a/d/Maddog.html" title="Maddog">maddog</a>, <a href="../../../c/m/d/CmdrTaco_5054.html" title="CmdrTaco">CmdrTaco</a> or <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Levin_472a.html" title="Rob Levin">lilo</a> for example). If someone or something that is itself notable makes reference to another notable thing (such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Shuttleworth_b9fb.html" title="Mark Shuttleworth">Mark Shuttleworth</a> making reference to <a href="../../../b/d/f/BDFL_2d2a.html" title="BDFL">benevolent dictators</a>), Wikipedia includes that - in fact, whole articles and [[Category:In popular culture|entire categories]] are dedicated to saying "X references Y".

<dd>Because nobody has added it yet? Go and add it. There's no "Wikipedia" central authority, just people like you and me. If you note, there's a "Slashdot culture" section in the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a> article, which details that Slashdot members regularly talk about <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Portman_22ce.html" title="Natalie Portman">Natalie Portman</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Soviet_Russia_02dd.html" title="In Soviet Russia">In Soviet Russia</a>, Hot <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grits.html" title="Grits">Grits</a>, "can anyone imagine a <a href="../../../b/e/o/Beowulf_cluster.html" title="Beowulf cluster">Beowulf cluster</a> of these" etc.; X references Y. 62.31.67.29 09:51, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, for one, think that's one of the best features of Wikipedia, I think it makes Wikipedia more useful to the average person, and furthers Wikipedia's goal of capturing the sum of all human knowledge. I disagree that the statement adds nothing to the article - it clarifies that there is such a thing as an SABDFL, that it's not the same as a BDFL and that it's the specific nickname of Mark Shuttleworth.
<dl>
<dd>It's the SABDFL's article's role to indicate that there is such a thing as a SABDFL and what it is. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Shuttleworth_b9fb.html" title="Mark Shuttleworth">Mark Shuttleworth</a> already documents that it's his IRC nickname.--<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChealer_e61a.html" title="User:Chealer">Chealer</a> 06:17, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me understand your position. Are you saying "When Open Source leader Mark Shuttleworth calls himself a 'Self Appointed Benevolent Dictator For Life', I want proof that he knows he's referring to the known Open Source phrase 'Benevolent Dictator For Life'"? If you read <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/04/1859255" class="external text" title="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/04/1859255" rel="nofollow">this Slashdot interview</a>, Mark answers the question "Why was the choice to eliminate desktop icons made?" with "Because I'm the SABDFL -- and a Virgo? It just seemed like the Right Thing to do, in keeping with the Ubuntu philosophy of keeping it simple and making it Just Work.". The question is "how do you intepret this answer?". If you assume the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_hypothesis.html" title="Null hypothesis">null hypothesis</a> that SABDFL is not in any way a reference to the BDFL concept, then Mark's response does not make sense. Being a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo.html" title="Virgo">Virgo</a> implies fussiness and perfectionism. Being the SABDFL must imply something else. Please answer what you think Mark means by the statement "Because I'm the SABDFL", following your assumption that SABDFL is not related to the concept of BDFL or "benevolent leadership". 62.31.67.29 11:14, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're just parroting what I said. Where your parroting falls down, the difference between you and I, is that I do have justification for inclusion:
<ol>
<li>Taxonomy: SABDFL includes BDFL. SABDFL <i>is</i> a reference to BDFL and is <i>only</i> a reference to BDFL.</li>
<li>Notability: SABDFL is the notable nickname of a notable person.</li>
<li>Clarity: Wikipedia clears up confusion by referencing popular wrong notions and showing they're wrong. A statement like "Mark Shuttleworth is "sabdfl", but not a BDFL" is a useful and welcome addition to the BDFL article.</li>
<li>Compactness: SABDFL only needs one sentence to explain all about it. That's not enough to merit its own article. However, putting that one sentence in relevant articles ("Mark Shuttleworth" and "BDFL") is sufficient.</li>
<li>Cross-referencing: "SABDFL" is a term that interlinks "Mark Shuttleworth" and "BDFL". There should be a link from each article to the other.</li>
