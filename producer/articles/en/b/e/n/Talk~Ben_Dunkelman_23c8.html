<p>The writing in this is very unclear, as are the sources. The article is about Dunkelman, not the Arab-Israeli conflict, so please stick directly to his biographical details. It's also not clear why the reference to Kidron is included, or what the large block quote comes from or has to do with Dunkelman. Clarification and correct citations would be appreciated. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:14, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I should definitely have used the "inuse" tag earlier; I´ve had 2 or 3 edit-conflicts with you earlier on this page tonight, which makes things confusing.</dd>
<dd>As for the article: yes, of course the article is about Dunkelman, but the part of his life that has most interest for the world in general is, as far as I know, his role in the 1948 war. If you know of other parts of his life which merits mentioning/expanding; please feel free to do so. (His role in WWII could also be elaborated). As for correct citations, I might for easiness (it is <i>very</i> late here;-/) just insert it (hidden) in the text for now. If there is anything which is unclear to you, please point it out to me. Thank you. Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 03:13, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The in-use tag is still up, so have you finished or are you still editing? The unclear blockquote section is also still there. What does that section have to do with Dunkelman?

<dd>I just saw your edit summary about inserting hidden sources. Please don't do that. The sources must be listed after the sentence or paragraph they're supporting, either with footnotes, embedded links, or Harvard references, then a full citation should be given in the References section.

<dl>
<dd>[Edit conflict]I just inserted full citation into the text (two places) so everything I have added is now fully sourced. The blockquote section is a quote from Dunkelman, so I really don´t understand your question "What does that section have to do with Dunkelman?" However, there is still a LOT lacking in this article; eg. he had a life between 1948 and 1997 which isn´t mentioned at all(!) Please feel free to add any information you would like.

<p>I can't find any reference to this on Amazon. Can you give a full citation, please? Also, why would the blockquote section be in his book and not Dunkelman's? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:11, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Truth Whereby Nations Live</i> is a chapter in the book "Blaming the Victims" (ed.: Edward W. Said and Christopher Hitchens), which I´m sure you will find on Amazon.

<dd>Huldra, please give correct citations. It's very time-consuming to have to keep on asking questions. We don't cite book chapters. Is it a chapter, or is it an article? (Yet another question.)

<dd>Every single thing you have asked for is in the article already. You can hardly blame others if you cannot be bothered to read the whole article. As to the Dunkelman quote: to my knowledge nobody has ever doubtet its truthfulness.

<dd>You can call it whatever you like, but the article can't stay as you left it. First, please don't correct my English. This is the English Wikipedia. I appreciate your efforts to write in a language that isn't your own, which I think takes courage, but at the same time, please understand that it introduces errors that others have to correct, and it isn't fair to make us correct the same sections three or four times.</dd>
<dd>Please do not restore the disputed section until it is discussed. First, it's not clear who the source is. Is it this translator (not ghost writer), or is it Dunkelman? Second, you wrote that D's book was published in 1976 (therefore before the publication of the disputed account), but Amazon and all sources I can find say 1984 (i.e. after it), including the ISBN number you gave yourself. This confusion has to be sorted out. If this is Dunkelman's story, why is it not in Dunkelman's own biography? If it isn't, I don't see how we can use it. If it is, we can quote him directly, rather than a translator.</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that you're trying make a political point here, rather than writing the man's biography in a complete and honest way. Why is this story, of all the stories he tells, the most important one and the only one you want to include?</dd>

<p>The <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/" class="external text" title="http://catalog.loc.gov/" rel="nofollow">Library of Congress catalog</a> (an ideal place to look for such information) gives 1976 as the publication year of Dunkelman's book. A similar quotation of Dunkelman regarding Nazareth is repeated by Simcha Flapan in J. Palestine Studies Vol. 16, No. 4. (Summer, 1987), pp. 3-26 which cites an interview of Dunkelman published in <a href="../../../h/a/o/Haolam_Hazeh_8883.html" title="Haolam Hazeh">Haolam Hazeh</a> in 1980. All the essential facts of the event: the surrender document, Laskov's role, the orders for expulsion, Dunkelman's refusal, the withdrawal of the order, Dunkelman's transfer, are documented on page 419 of Morris, <i>Birth..Revisited</i> and associated endnotes. The version of Morris does not appear to have any disagreement on fact from the version of Dunkelman as reported by either Kidron or Flapan. The story of Nazareth should be on <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> in detail, but a summary belongs here since this is the issue over which Dunkelman is most known today.

<dd>Books, not chapters, are cited, and it's still not clear whether it's a chapter or an essay. I'm assuming the latter, but Huldra has so far declined to clarify. It's the "version of Dunkelman as reported by Kidron" that concerns me. Kidron is a translator, as I understand it, so is he a reputable source in this regard? What does Flapan say exactly, and why didn't Dunkelman include it in his own autobiography? I'm confused as to why Huldra, who seems to have read the sources, won't give any information about them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:37, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

The Nazareth incident is indeed the one thing Dunkelman is known for (at least outside Canada/Israel). And I have seen nobody, and I mean <i>nobody</i> denying the story.

<dd>I suspect our disagreement on the chapter issue is a misunderstanding. The book "Blaming the Victims" is an anthology of articles by different authors, each presented as a separate chapter. The contents of each article/chapter have to be attributed to the author of that article/chapter. So, to cite it properly, the article/chapter title and author has to be given, and also the title and editors of the book in which it appears have to be given. We don't disagree on that, surely? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 23:39, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Zero, thank you, I wasn´t sure, but I tried to do that. I thought that adding too much information would be better than adding too little. The way the ref. is left now: I do not know how anybody who is not very familiar with the subject will find the material. Eg. I remembered reading about Dunkelman years ago in the book "Blaming the victims", but when I started rereading the book some days ago I could not find the story at once, as there is no name reg. at the back of the book (and I could not remember Kidrons name). So, Zero; could you please change the ref. on the article page so that it is the correct one?

<dd>Kidron has a very good reputation as a translator. Other examples of his translations from Hebrew to English are Yitzhak Rabin's autobiography, Michael Bar-Zohar's official biography of Ben-Gurion, and books on history, literature, and art. In recent years, Kidron is also known as a political activist. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 23:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Zero, my confusion is this, and Huldra seems determined not to address it. (1) If Kidron is a translator whose first language is not English (which is my understanding), it's highly unlikely that Dunkelman, whose first language was English, would have chosen him as a ghostwriter. As a translator for the Hebrew edition, perhaps, but not as a ghostwriter of the English edition, unless of course it was first published in Hebrew (and that might account for the publication date discrepancy). (2) Why would a translator be regarded as a reliable source in this area? (3) Why is the material not in Dunkelman's autobiography if he told it to Kidron (who, according to Huldra, was D's ghostwriter)? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:05, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know enough about the relationship between Kidron and Dunkelman to say that "ghostwriter" is a correct description, however Dunkelman's preface (readable at Amazon) says "Finally my special thanks to Peretz Kidron for his assistance in assembling the final manuscript" so Peretz was certainly involved with the book. A translator has to have excellent fluency in both languages, so your argument there is not good. The Hebrew edition of Dunkelman's book was published in 1977 so probably it came second (but the dates are too close to be certain). An interview of Dunkelman by Kidron was published in Haolam Hazeh in 1980 and parts of it were repeated later by Kidron and also repeated by Flapan (the parts quoted by Flapan are essentially the same as what Huldra quoted from Kidron). Given that a standard academic history (Morris) agrees on all the facts, especially on Dunkelman's refusal to expel the Arabs of Nazareth in violation of the agreement he had just signed with them, I don't see how there is sufficient reason to dismiss Peretz as a source. I would also like to know why this episode does not appear in Dunkelman's book, but it should be noted that Dunkelman's book does not disagree with it. His book stops right after the surrender agreement (p269) and does not even mention the subsequent expulsion order (which Morris proves from multiple sources including Ben-Gurion's diary), so it is obvious that some decision was made to exclude that part of the story. Kidron's article probably explains it, but here is my humble guess: Dunkelman submitted his manuscript to the Israeli censors and they deleted the passage according to the normal practice of the time, just as happened with Rabin's autobiography (an episode also involving Kidron). --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 01:05, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Zero, that's very helpful. I've heard a Kidron interview and while his English is good, it's by no means perfect and I can't imagine a native English speaker employing him as a ghostwriter; also, "assistance in assembling the final manuscript" isn't suggestive of ghostwriting or translating. I didn't realize the 1980 <i>Haolam Hazeh</i> article was actually an interview with Dunkelman, in which Dunkelman himself tells the story for that article. If that's the case, I have no objection to using it, of course (though most of it should go in the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> article, not here), but Huldra gave the impression it was just an article by Kidron, which I would question as a reliable source. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:40, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, thanks. It is somewhat different from what I guessed. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 08:41, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just have another couple of questions. Zero said above that an interview of Dunkelman by Kidron was published in <i>Haolam Hazeh</i> in 1980. Is this another interview, or is this the same account by Kidron of what Dunkelman allegedly said to him? Also, did Dunkelman ever respond, do you know, to the publication of Kidron's account? However, even although I'm asking these questions, if that material was published by a reputable source (and Hitchens, Said, and their publisher count as such), we're not supposed to question it. But it would be good to know whether Kidron or anyone else ever responded, and it would probably also be a good idea to put most of it in <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, though it can be referred to here too. I do find it odd that Dunkelman would have written so badly in the pencilled note. His family was wealthy and he could have been expected to have a good basic education. On the other hand, those spelling mistakes would be strange things for Kidron to make up. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:42, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>-Ok, I have expanded the text so that it includes what Kidron said about the 'Haolam Hazeh' -article. It is not much, I´m afraid. Someone with access to the July 1980 edition of Haólam Hazeh should check.</dd>
<dd>-If nobody cryes loud about copy-right violations I might include (in <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_Newstuff_f368.html" title="User:Huldra\Newstuff">User:Huldra\Newstuff</a>) the parts of Rabin´s memoirs that were cut out by the Israeli censors? (About BenGurions orders about expulsion: quite interesting, IMO)</dd>
<dd>-To my knowledge it is not recorded if Dunkelman ever responded to Kidron (publicly, that is), but it was published years before he died, so he would have had plenty opertunity.</dd>
<dd>-As to Dunkelmans spelling there is very obvious explanation (at least if you are dyslectic (dislectik? dyslektic?) -like myself) (I´ve had an excellent basic education and an excellent University education.....and just who on earth would believe that, looking at my spelling! Lol!). Btw, there might be spelling mistakes in the "newstuff"-file, but I checked Dunkelman´s "pencilled remarks" and they are exactly as in the book.</dd>
<dd>-As for inserting some of this into the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> article: yes, definitely. Actually; that article is one of the worst I have seen on WP: about 80-90% of the article seem to be about whether or not the town excisted some 2000 years ago?! Totally absurd.

<p>I searched a newspaper archive that covers a lot of newspapers (but the coverage around 1980 is not very thick). I also searched some full-text journal archives that cover hundreds of journals. I found nothing that adds any information to this story, and in fact I found hardly anything at all. Certainly no reply from Dunkelman. I don't find this too surprising because the story is not all that newsworthy. The 1948 war produced lots of stories like this, and Dunkelman is not famous enough for his fame to make the story bigger. As for <i>Haolam Hazeh</i>, Flapan's citation is "Peretz Kidron interview with Ben Dunkelman, Haolam Hazeh, 9 January 1980", but the only thing he quotes from it is the same text as quoted in what Huldra brought us (with tiny wording changes consistent with being translated to Hebrew and back). It means that Peretz quoted it in Haolam Hazeh, but beyond that I can't say anything. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 11:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just a quick note before I have to run: Kidron mentions that it was in the <b>July 1980</b> edition of Haólam Hazeh (I rechecked the date in the book, in case I had transcribed it incorrectly. I hadn´t). That suggest there were at least two articles? <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 12:49, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no idea and it would be hard to find out (except for someone in Israel near a good library). --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 13:05, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for what Wikipedia takes, I think that <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> needs a dry recitation of events (withoput the quotation) and the quotation, being more personal to Dunkelman, belongs here. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 11:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since Huldra added the story about the Rabin memoir, I can mention that it was published in Israel as soon as it was published in the NYT (since the NYT publication meant that Israeli censorship no longer applied to it) and Rabin confirmed it. In fact he told the same story to other people as well. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 11:34, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
