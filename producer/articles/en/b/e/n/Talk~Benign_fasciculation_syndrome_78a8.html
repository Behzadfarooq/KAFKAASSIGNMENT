<p>The discussion page was pretty badly organized so I fixed things for you guys. Remember to sign your posts with four tildas. I agree with all of you about how poorly written the article is and I think that any one of you should go ahead and clean it up. I might even do it myself. As long as you have references. I think the emphasis on anxiety, even suggesting it as a cause, is absolutely ludicrous. And my fasciculations aren't even benign (I have a syrinx)! Anybody would have anxiety. Just more crap from the medical community to explain what they don't understand. They betray the very basis of science. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyborg_Ninja_1fdf.html" title="User:Cyborg Ninja">Cyborg Ninja</a> 07:53, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBenign_fasciculation_syndrome_78a8.html" title="Edit section: BFS comments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BFS comments</span></h2>
<p>I think it would be helpful if the list of conditions that may lead to BFS, or be associated with it, was expanded. Also, it might be better if the article were a little more structured into sub-categories. Generally, however, I thought the page was pretty good when I viewed it.</p>
<p>My meta-comment (which may not be very popular here) is that Wikipedia would be more valuable with a more structured moderation process, with signed "frozen" articles subject to change by a voting or committee process. If I'm a patient researching medical conditions on Wikipedia, I'd like to know whether the person(s) writing the articles had any medical training or credentials; and I'd like to know that some joker didn't just randomly change something they had written.</p>
<p>This is not meant as a commentary or criticism of this particular article; it's just that medical topics point up, perhaps more than anything else, the inherent weakness of the Wiki concept.</p>
<p>I like the comment on stress being a cause, particularly medical school. I'm a med student and seem to have noticed some fasciulations in the last year or two. Note, other sources suggest caffeine may also be a cause.</p>
<dl>
<dd>New comment--In answer to your question, above, the person who wrote the BFS description has no medical training at all but posts prolifically on various medical help sites. Some of the information he gives is good and some is totally wrong (he's told people that if their symptoms improve they can't have MS, for instance). It will not surprise you to learn that he has BFS, ADD, essential tremor and extreme health anxiety. I think his BFS post is more a projection than a definition. You won't find the information he posted in any legitimate medical text.</dd>

<p>This syndrome has nothing to do with anxiety, except that it creates anxiety in anxious people who happen to also have it. Every reference to anxiety, including globus sensation, could be stricken from the article to its improvement. -<font color="#2000C0">ikkyu2</font> (<a href="../../../i/k/k/User_talk%7EIkkyu2_7356.html" title="User talk:Ikkyu2"><font color="#00FF00">talk</font></a>) 23:34, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that this has nothing to do with anxiety. Whoever wrote this is full of crap....sounds like the author is a shrink or some kind of arrogant quack who attributes everything that he can't explain to anxiety. What a jerk.</p>
<p>Isn't it interesting that everything that can't be explained by medical science is attributed to anxiety by arrogant jerks who have never even experienced the symptom?</p>

<p>I am an emergency physician and recently was diagnosed by a neurologist with benign fasciculation syndrome or is he called it, cramp fasciculation syndrome -- CFS. I thought the article was generally well-written, however I agree with the commentaries highlighting an apparent over emphasis on anxiety in the discussion, I felt it was too much as well. I did make an edit, my first-ever, disputing the conclusion that anxiety could be used to aid in the diagnosis of this syndrome. Anyone who has a potentially life-threatening illness would also be anxious, my grandfather died of ALS, if I had ALS, I would be anxious about that too. Having been diagnosed with BFS instead, I have very little anxiety. Since I also have ADD, I would like to know where the author found references linking ADD to CFS. DF</p>

<p>Can anyone supply references to support claims in this article that imply anxiety is a causal factor in BFS? All I've found in the medical literature is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=9533790" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=9533790" rel="nofollow">Mitsikostas <i>et al</i></a>, who merely found that fasciculation potentials "were slightly correlated to the body weight and height and to the anxiety level." Finding a <i>slight</i> correlation hardly fits the numeous unreferenced claims in this article that imply anxiety is a known primary cause. Can anyone supply supporting literature references for those <i>or any</i> claims in this article? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Goddard_d907.html" title="User:Ian Goddard">Ian Goddard</a> 05:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
