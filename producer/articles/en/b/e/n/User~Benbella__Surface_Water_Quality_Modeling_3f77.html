<p><b>FOREWORD</b><br /></p>
<p>As environmental controls become more costly to implement and the penalties of judgment errors become more severe, environmental quality management requires more efficient analytical tools based on greater knowledge of the environmental phenomena to be managed. As part of this Laboratory’s research on the occurrence, movement, transformation, impact, and control of environmental contaminants, the Technology Development and Applications Branch develops management or engineering tools to help pollution control officials achieve water quality goals.</p>
<p>Basin planning requires a set of analysis procedures that can provide an assessment on the current state of the environment and a means of predicting the effectiveness of alternative pollution control strategies. This report contains a revised and updated compilation and discussion of rates, constants, and kinetics formulations that have been used to accomplish these tasks. It Is directed. toward all water quality planners who must interpret technical information from many sources and recomend the most prudent course of action that will minimize the cost of implementation of a pollutant control activity and maximize the environmental benefits to the comunity.</p>

<p>The use of mathematical models to Simulate ecological and water quality interactions in surface waters has grown dramatically over the past two decades. Simulation techniques offer an integrated and relatively sound course for evaluating wasteload abatement alternatives. Predictions of system behavior based upon mathematical simulation techniques may be misleading, however, particularly if the physical mechanisms involved are not accurately represented in the model. Furthermore, even where the model does faithfully describe mechanisms in the prototype, poor results may be obtained where insufficient data are available to estimate rate constants and coefficients.</p>
<p>Much of the work done in the water quality modeling field has been oriented toward improvement of models——toward incorporating better numerical solution techniques, toward an expanded complement of water quality constituents simulated, and toward realistic representations of modeled physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. There is, however, a need for a document that summarizes the rate constants and coefficients (e.g., nitrification rates and reaeration rates) needed in the models. This document is intended to satisfy that need.</p>
<p>The first edition of this document was published seven years ago (Zison etal., 1978). Because an extensive body of literature on rate constants and modeling formulations has emerged since that time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has sponsored an updating of the manual. In addition, a workshop was held to evaluate the manual, to review the formulations and associated coefficients and rate values, and to provide further data for the final document. As a result of the literature review and workshop, a substantially new manual has been produced.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbella__Surface_Water_Quality_Modeling_3f77.html" title="Edit section: Purpose and Use of this Manual">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Purpose and Use of this Manual</span></h3>
<p>This manual is intended for use by practitioners as a handbook——a convenient reference on modeling formulations, constants, and rates commonly used in surface water quality simulations. Guidance is provided in selecting appropriate formulations or values àf rate constants for specific applications. The manual also provides a range of coefficient values that can be used to perform sensitivity analyses. Where appropriate, measurement techniques for rate constants are also discussed.</p>
<p>It was impossible, however, to encompass all formulations or to examine all recent reports containing rates data. it is hoped, therefore, that the user will recognize the desirability of seeking additional sources where questions remain about formulations or values. Data used from within this volume should be recognized as representing a sampling from a larger set of data. It should also be noted that there are often very real limitations involved in using literature values for rates rather than observed system values. It is hoped that this document will find its main use as a guide in the search for "the correct value" rather than as the sole source of that value.</p>

<p>In preparing this manual, an attempt was made to present a comprehensive set of formulations and associated constants. In contrast to the first edition (Zison et al. ,1978) , the manual has been divided into sections containing specific topics. Following this introduction, chapters are presented that discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical processes of dispersion and temperature</li>
<li>Dissolved oxygen</li>
<li>pH and alkalinity</li>
<li>Nutrients</li>
<li>Algae</li>
<li>Zooplankton</li>
<li>Coliforms</li>
</ul>
<p>The parameters that are addressed in this manual are those that traditionally have been the focus of water quality management and the focus for control of conventional pollutants. These include temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and eutrophication, and coliform bacteria. Higher organisms (fish, benthos) are not discussed, nor are the details of higher trophic levels in ecosystem models. Also, hydrodynamic processes, although important, are not dealt with in detail.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbella__Surface_Water_Quality_Modeling_3f77.html" title="Edit section: General Observations on Model Formulations, Rate, Constants, and Coefficients">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">General Observations on Model Formulations, Rate, Constants, and Coefficients</span></h3>
<p>Each rate value or expression used in a model should not be chosen as an “afterthought”, but should be considered as an integral part of the modeling process. A substantial portion of any modeling effort should go into selecting specific approaches and formulations based upon the objectives of modeling, the kinds and amounts of data available, and the strengths and weaknesses of the approach or formulation. Once formulations have been selected, a significant effort should be made to determine satisfactory valuers for parameters. Even where the parameter is to be chosen by calibration, it is clearly important to establish whether the calibrated value is within a reasonable range or not. Recent references: on model calibration include Thomann (1983) National Council on Air and Stream Improvement (1982), and Beck (1983). Users should be aware that an acceptable model calibration does not imply that the model has predictive capability. The model may contain incorrect mechanisms, and agreement between model predictions and observations could have been obtained through an unrealistic choice of parameter values. Further, the future status of the prototype may be controlled by processes not even simulated in the model.</p>
<p>Values of many constants and coefficients are dependent upon the way they are used in modeling formulations. For example, while pollutant dispersion is an observable physical process, modeling this process is partly a mathematical construct. Therefore, constants that are used to represent the process (i.e., dispersion coefficients) cannot be chosen purely on the basis of physics since they also depend on the modeling approach. For example, to determine the dispersion coefficients in a model application to an estuary, both the time and length scales of the model must be considered. Whether the model is tidally averaged or simulates intra—tidal variations, and whether the model is 1—, 2—, or 3— dimensional, all influence the value of the appropriate dispersion coefficient for that model. Ford and Thornton (1979) discuss scale effects in ecological models, and conclude that inconsistent scales for the hydrodynamics, chemistry, and biology may produce erroneous model predictions. Since coefficient values are never known with certainty, modelers are constantly faced with the question of how accurately rate constants should be known. The relationship between uncertainty in coefficient values and model predictions can be evaluated by performing sensitivity analyses. For models with few parameters, sensitivity analyses are generally straightforward. However, for complex models, sensitivity analyses are no longer straightforward since many dynamic interactions are involved. Sensitivity analyses are discussed in detail in Thornton and Lessem (1976), Thornton (1983), and Beck (1983).</p>

<p>The purpose of this chapter is to give the reader an overview of how the major physical processes are incorporated into water quality and ecosystem simulations. Since a detailed review is beyond the scope of this report, the reader is encouraged to review the articles listed in Table 2-1 which represent several of the more complete and recent reviews of the state-of-the-art in physical process modeling.</p>
<p>Physical processes often simulated in water quality models include flow and circulation patterns, mixing and dispersion, water temperature, and the density distribution (which is a function of temperature, salinity, and suspended solids concentrations) over the water column. It is stressed that quality predictions are very dependent upon the physical processes and how well these are represented in the water quality simulations. Despite this dependence, the modeler often is forced to make a trade-off between acceptable degree of detail in water quality vs. physical process simulation due to cost or other restrictions. It is desirable from the standpoint of both the engineer and ecosystem analyst, therefore, to select the simplest model which satisfies the temporal and spatial resolution required for water quality and/or ecosystem simulation. For example, the optimum time step for dynamic simulation of a fully-mixed impoundment would be 3-6 hours for capturing diurnal fluctuations, and daily or weekly for strongly stratified impoundments which normally exhibit slowly varying conditions. In terms of spatial resolution. required, the analyst should take advantage of the possible simplifications of dominate physical characteristics (i.e., physical shape, stratified layers, mixing zones, etc.). <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbella_Surface_Water_Quality_Modeling%7EPhysical_Process_0976.html" title="User:Benbella/Surface Water Quality Modeling:Physical Process">[more]</a></p>
