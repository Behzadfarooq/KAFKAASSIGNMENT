<p>In the context, replacing "non-Christian" with "non-Muslim" doesn't really make sense and, indeed, the fact of the matter is that Muslims do not use the term "uncircumcised" to mean non-Muslims. It just isn't the issue in Islam that it is in Judaism and was in Christianity during apostolic times: yes, it's urged on Muslims as a matter of ritual cleanliness, but it isn't a rite of passage in itself (though it is strongly urged that boys be circumcised before adolescence when they are expected to begin performing ritual ablutions associated with daily prayer). One can be a Muslim without being circumcised, after all -- at least a great many pre-adolescent boys are.<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 01:56, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're right that it doesn't make much sense to include a reference to uncircumcision meaning, metaphorically, non-Christian, but only because it is extremely rare. (St Paul makes a bit of a song and a dance over "circumcision of the heart" -- of course, a term he brings from his Jewish background but that's neither here nor there in the circumstances.) My point is that it isn't used to mean non-Muslim at all. So it seems to me that either the reference to "non-Christian" should be restored (but, as you say, it's so obscure and rare as to be meaningless) or, much better, take it out altogether. The only really meaningful reference is to Judaism. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 02:18, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On the other hand, rare though the term is outside the New Testament, it is used there with some frequency in reference to non-believers. Maybe it should stay after all. I did take the liberty to edit very modestly a little further, though, to change "it" to "uncircumcised" since as the article stood it read, "As a religious term, [an uncircumcised penis] describes someone not Jewish, or considerably less commonly, a non-Christian. As used in the New Testament, it can refer to non-believers of either gender, regardless of physical circumcision. Odd that no one picked that out before, but the edit-warriors in respect of this topic don't seem vastly burdened by a sense of humour. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 02:24, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh. OK, all right. I can go with it coming out altogether, leaving only the sentence (as edited by me [supra] re: "As used in the New Testament...." You go ahead and, as it were, circumcise the paragraph&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 02:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, so we're ad idem. Though actually, I've slightly edited anyway, by way of further clarification: "As a religious term, uncircumcised' describes someone not Jewish, or, metaphorically and considerably less commonly, a non-Christian." As for "it," well, as I say -- a sense of humour is not something this crew are over-burdened with. "Snip, snip"? As far as I know, one snip is all it takes if you know what you're doing!&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 03:00, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A foolish "edit war" is going on in the article "penis" (leaving aside the apparently several-times-daily necessity to delete kids' vandalism): the same two photos that were supposely illustrative of circumcision in the "circumcision" article and which between the two of us we renamed -- they are in that article too.

<p>Benami, I just noticed you were editing the section on 'The anti-circumcision movement' in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brit_milah.html" title="Brit milah">brit milah</a>. It occurs to me that section could use a few cited sources. I'm hesitant to go off and find some myself, as since I'm not Jewish and don't know the subject matter enough to know which sources are credible and which aren't. When you have some time, could you either a) do so, or b) assess some if I do? Regards, <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 23:34, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know, it is quite ridiculous. I'd agree the wheels could use a little oil, but c'est la vie. Perhaps the ArbCom elections are taking people's attention from other issues. Dabljuh's certainly not responding to the RFC in a way that indicates good faith, or any inclination to change his ways, so I think the next step is probably a request for arbitration. It's probably sensible to leave that for a couple of weeks for the elections to be finished and for the new arbitrators to settle in. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 21:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Earlier, you explained to me that Judaism was not an actively expanding Religion (like Christianity and Islam) but I think this comment refuses that notion as it displays the support of circumcision vital and necessary to the "spread" of Judaism, if I understand correctly. Care to comment? <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Dabljuh_9749.html#Outside_view_by_IZAK" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Dabljuh">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Dabljuh#Outside_view_by_IZAK</a> (On my talk page or right there) Dabljuh 15:50, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your detailed answer. My question is, do you figure that circumcision is so vitally important to judaism, that it cannot be delayed to the individual getting 18 years or so? According to the medical data, my judgement on the issue is that the risk is simply too great. I remember somewhat reading somewhere that the bible (or torah?) says, if two of your kids die of circumcision, the third one may go uncircumcised? So even the bible acknowledges that circumcision is risky. Look, I don't think americans or jews or other people are particularly barbaric, I simply consider them ignorant of the medical issues. It only becomes barbaric when the practice is continued despite better knowledge. Dabljuh 20:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To explain with a more personal slant: I have been baptized as an infant, catholic upbringing and all that. Nowadays I consider this a violation of my personal freedom of religion. I did not consent to be baptized, I did not choose to be baptized, I was simply - spiritually - raped, to adopt this faith. Nowadays I consider myself a progressive libertarian secular humanist, and while I can see the perceived necessity to have an initiation rite of one's parent's faith, I do believe that this procedure should have been delayed until I was old enough to decide for myself. How much more worse is the anger that some jews may feel towards judaism or their parents, as they weren't just spiritually violated in their right to choose their own religion, but also physically violated. I have read Kaminzky's Kiebitz over the holidays, and he mentions a lot of self-loathing of jews towards their own people or faith. Dabljuh 20:33, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course, I see. Well, aside from the ~60 billion laws from the bible that just can't be uphold nowadays (stoning of disobedient children or unfaithful wives etc), the health of the baby could demand a delay - to the 18th or so birthday. Dabljuh 00:05, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I certainly hope you will never lose a child because of circumcision. Dabljuh 00:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I was curious as to where, other than in Mizrahi/Sefardi communities "עַלָיו הַשָּׁלוֹם" is used.

This is why I used the word <i>particularly</i>: as far as I could tell, it was not particularly common outside of the Mizrahi communities. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:19, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, my assumption was probably <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, but I had certainly not heard the phrase used in most Ashkenazi communities, where ZA"L or ZATZA"L are prefered. <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 23:48, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>is ZA"L just ז"ל and ZATZA"L זצ"ל? or are there some extra letters in there as well? Do Ashkenazim say "zal" and "zatzal"? I've heard plenty of Ashkenazim say "zikhrono livrakha" and "zekher tzadiq livrakha" (usually with the stress on the wrong syllable and strange pronuciations for כ and ר), but not "zal" or "zatzal"...but then again when I hear Ashkenazim speaking Hebrew my head is usually spinning trying to figure out what they're saying.&#160;:-p Also, it's prolly OR here, and I'm not entirely certain, but I think I've also heard Ashkenazim saying ע"ה, and plenty of times by Sfaraðim. BTW, the edit joel cites above makes the sentence in question read rather disjointedly... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 07:40, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, generally these aren't spoken as "Zal" and "Zatzal", I just think I didn't have a Hebrew keyboard at the time.

<p>Could I enlist your assistance in inserting photos in an assortment of articles having to do with the District of Assiniboia (pre-1905) and the province of Saskatchewan (post 1905)? The photos are on the University of Saskatchewan library website and are long past their copyright date. The articles...well, I can tell you and you can take me by the hand, or you can just instruct me and I can take it from there. At present, alas, I don't have the editing skills necessary to insert them in their proper places. I ask you because you have intervened in the past in respect of certain of my offerings but with a degree of common courtesy that appears, alas, often to be somewhat lacking. Or perhaps, if you aren't entirely au fait, you could refer me to someone who is. I am loathe to invite a nasty attack, as seems to be the accepted way of doning things among the experts in here!
