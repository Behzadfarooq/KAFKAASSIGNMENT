<p>Why would an objective article cite the "National Enquierer" as a source for diputing the validity of Benny Hinn's ministry?

<dd>Also, your charges against the National Enquirer are false. The tabloid that reports (as in, present-tense) "batboy" sightings, etc., is "Weekly World News". While it's true that the National Enquirer got its start running fanciful stories throughout the 50s and 60s, the launch of competitor magazines People and US in 1974 spurred the Enquirer to adopt a fact-checking policy. --<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 66.120.160.26 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.120.160.26_3937.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.120.160.26">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>In addition, Benny Hinn later apologized publicly for his 1989 prophecies, stating that he was wrong for operating out of his flesh and desire for fame rather than his Spirit and out of service to God. --<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 64.184.135.18 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.184.135.18.html" title="User talk:64.184.135.18">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.184.135.18_f55f.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.184.135.18">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with the validity or neutrality of this article. If anything, it's far too lenient. Benny Hinn is widely recognized as a false prophet and charlatan by most Christians not under the TBN umbrella. He bilks millions of dollars anually from retirees living on small fixed incomes, while at the same time enjoying an opulent lifestyle that most corporate executives would be highly envious of. His <a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hinn/general.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/exposes/hinn/general.htm" rel="nofollow">heresies</a> and <a href="http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/tbn.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/tbn.htm" rel="nofollow">false prophecies</a> are well documented across the internet. --Mark (Tue Jun 14 16:24:58 EDT 2005) --<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> Ouphe (<a href="../../../o/u/p/User_talk%7EOuphe_d07d.html" title="User talk:Ouphe">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ouphe_cf51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ouphe">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Like the actual neutrality of an article ever stopped someone from flagging it? It's a really odd coincidence that the supermajority of disputed articles are about religious leaders or religions, isn't it? It's almost like no religionist can ever accept objective facts about their belief. "Neutrality" is growing to mean "compromise," which isn't the same thing at all. --<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 66.120.160.26 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.120.160.26_3937.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.120.160.26">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>I have done some cleanup on the article.The statement that Hinn visits the grave of Kathryn Kuhlman to get her power was a lie.What Hinn said was that he visits her grave sometimes to get the 'anointing' from God.Big difference.Hinn has never said he has ANY power.I also inserted the POV warning at the top.It is a shame that a hit piece like this could be on wikipedia,and that it took a newbie to put some of it straight and add a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> tag.It looks like it's all right to attack <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> here.Go to the article <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Feinstein_0483.html" title="Diane Feinstein">Diane Feinstein</a> and try to tell all of her efforts and see how fast the POV police jump down your throat.<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltforkgunman_3509.html" title="User:Saltforkgunman">Saltforkgunman</a> 02:36, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is this BennyBlows crap?When I click on it,something comes up threatening to delete it in 2 weeks.Isn't it 2 weeks yet?I have done some more clean up on the article,namely the LIE that there is no way to verify faith healing.Benny repeatedly tells people to go to the doctor and get checked out when they get healed at his services.<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltforkgunman_3509.html" title="User:Saltforkgunman">Saltforkgunman</a> 01:47, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please know that this article is not an example of Christian-bashing. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Attempting to reduce the credibility of a well-known false profit who claims Christianity actually BENEFITS the Christian cause. By letting folks know that Benny Hinn is a money-chaser, we also help let folks know he's the EXCEPTION; he's NOT to be construed as an example of how all Christians operate.</p>
<p>Fine.Then it shouldn't take lies and half truths and distortions of Hinns' words to BENEFIT the Christian cause.<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltforkgunman_3509.html" title="User:Saltforkgunman">Saltforkgunman</a> 01:51, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Saltforkgunman: Be aware that your bias is getting in the way of common sense and logic. It is clear in the Bible that profits of God are ALWAYS correct and NEVER incorrect. Therefore, it follows that anyone who claims prophetic ability must also be correct 100% of the time with NO EXCEPTIONS. Accordingly, anyone who claims prophetic ability who is not right 100% of the time is, by definition, a false profit who is not really being inspired by God. If someone is incorrect in what they claim to be prophecy--EVEN ONE TIME, REGARDLESS OF THE EXCUSE--they are a FALSE PROFIT.</p>
<p>There really is nothing more to it. The intellectually honest MUST agree with this.</p>
<p>With this being said, Saltforkgunman, I invite you to listen to the audio of Benny Hinn himself in which he verbally speaks out his false prophecies. It's quite interesting. I'd also invite you to consider Hinn's admission of incorrectness.</p>
<p>Please be honest with yourself, Saltforkgunman; that's all I ask. --71.9.9.13 20:10, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I came here and found this article was about 95% against Benny Hinn,with some inaccuracies that jumped out at me.I corrected them and added a POV tag and stopped there,since I had no other knowledge about the other issues cited in the article.</p>
<p>Yes,if Hinn made false prophesies,then he is guilty of being in the flesh.But that doesn't mean he couldn't repent and get back in the Holy Spirit.i hope he does.<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESaltforkgunman_3509.html" title="User:Saltforkgunman">Saltforkgunman</a> 05:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible for him to repent and <i>have a good ol' holy ghost time</i> again; this is true. But it is also true that God does not turn prophetic ability on and off with the flip of a switch. There is no biblical evidence to suggest that prohpetic ability comes and goes, and there's also no evidence that suggests a person can GAIN (or regain) prophetic ability after having made false prophecies. This is one of those situations where a person either has it or they don't. And, my friend, Benny Hinn does NOT have it.</p>
<p>The best Benny Hinn can do is repent, appologize for his false prophesies, and become a non-prophesy-giving pastor or preacher. Who ever said pastors must also be prophets, anyway?--71.9.9.13 03:55, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Benny Hinn is a FALSE PROPHET like those like Charlse Russell, Joseph Smith, David Koresh, Jim Jones, Kenneth Koplan, Ellen and James White ect. Jesus they would come False Prophet.</p>
<p>Why are you hell bent on "exposing" Benny Hinn? I've been to some of his crusades and many people get healed without Benny Hinn praying for them. Considering the fact that millions of people are being saved through his ministry, I think it would be better to leave the judging to God. Whether you believe it or not, people really get healed at his crusades. Considering his popularity and the amount of funds that go through his ministry; I'm sure the IRS is capable of conducting thorough investigations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.226.163.68 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.226.163.68_4ee9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.226.163.68">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Fine, Salt. Send Benny Hinn all your money. After all, he claims that this will make you prosper. If he's telling the truth, you have nothing to fear. And please post a copy of your check with your bank info blocked out onto your talk page so that we can confirm that you did this.</p>
<p>Or, if you're not willing to do all that, at least try to point out specific examples of alleged factual errors instead of just asserting that they exist. Unlike Benny Hinn, most Wikipedians don't have magical powers, so they don't know what you're talking about unless you tell them. [[User:70.112.98.188|70.112.98.188</p>
<p>"Pastor" Benny (Is he ordained?) needs your help: he can't zip around the world in his jet airplane (which he agreed to purchase from another ministry) because either he doesn't have the money to pay for it or he'd rather you pay for it. For a "gift" of $10,000 U.S. he will inscribe your name in the front of the jet, and for only $1,000 he will inscribe your name in a small room at the back of the jet (which he calls a prayer room) but is probably the head. Alternately, for a "gift" of $45 he will send you a plastic "temple" which contains a music box. Wow. The point is, people of other faiths, and Muslims in particular, see Mr. Hinn and others of his ilk, and wonder if this is what Christianity is all about. Nosyreader 21:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"This is Your Day," 21 August: For a $1,000 "seed" directed to something called "3 Miracle Harvests," God (not Benny) will erase all your credit card debt. I assume that if you put this $1,000 seed on your credit card, it will also be erased. Pretty good deal. Nosyreader 13:54, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Police arrested Medawar in <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2005.html" title="September 2005">September 2005</a> after they found evidence that's Medawar's proposal was a scam. The show was a cover to steal money from Steeple's investors - most of them churchgoing Southern <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> residents, including the retired Homeland Security member - by selling $5.5 million in Steeple stock they owned. It was revealed that Medawar's appearance on Hinn's TV show was a ruse to get guillible potential investors to give money to his project, only a small amount of which was used for the show. A vast majority of the money contributed to the lavish lifestyle of Medawar and his associates, including Alison Heruth-Waterbury, an actress who appeared with Medawar on <i>This Is Your Day</i>, who received $40,000 per month in rent from Medawar for her new <a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills_d612.html" title="Beverly Hills">Beverly Hills</a> mansion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Improper usage of Hinn</span></h2>
<p>The false prohecy and statements made by Hinn in this article are mostly debately or questionable in their falseness. For example a Hinn supporter could argue that Holyfield had a heart condition(as originally diagonsed by professional doctors), was cured by Hinn and after he was cured of his condition, doctors believed that Holyfield was misdiagnosed because he had no heart conditions symptoms. A Hinn supporter would say of course doctors would believe he had no heart problems on the second diagnoasis because Holyfield was cured. Thus it ultimately becomes a he said she said debate between whether or not Holyfield was originally misdiagnosed. No one can prove either way, because if I say I am a healer and John and Peggy are doctors. Let say that Mike has hurts his ACL. John, a long time doctor, has put Mike under all these machines and determined that Mike has torn his ACL. Now Mike comes and vists me the village healer. I put some bamboo on his leg and do the hookey pookey and shout some mystical jargon and argot. Mike leg feels better(in his mind, we don't know if it is actually better or not) goes back to the doctor to see if that healer was any good, except this time he sees Peggy and she tells him his ACL is a ok and she concludes that he must have been misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>Did John misdiagnose Mike, or am I a true healer, no one knows, there is no defintive way to determine whether or not Mike ever had a problem with his ACL because there is always the possiblilty that you can be misdiagnosed by a doctor, but if a mystical healer were to cure you the doctors would have to conclude that you were misdiagnosed. Doctors can't say you were mystical healed, because it isn't scientific and no one would accept that.</p>

Seems these claims are part of an article by John Bloom from D Magazine, August 2003, reprinted here: <a href="http://www.trinityfi.org/press/heretic.html" class="external free" title="http://www.trinityfi.org/press/heretic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trinityfi.org/press/heretic.html</a> The accompanying illustration is by 4g², and that probably caused a misattribution.</p>

<dd>OK thanks. If their statement of faith is anything to go by, they could potentially be the kind of people who would give someone like Benny Hinn a fair hearing, which is one important thing that we need to look out for as far as references are concerned. (I would be a bit more wary if they were <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cessationism.html" title="Cessationism">cessationists</a> for instance). On the other hand, they do seem to have some particular mission to dig up as much dirt on Benny Hinn and certain other ministries as they can. The other problem is that it's a tertiary source from what appears to be a publication that is primarily satirical rather than serious in tone. I've wikified the references to that article, though I'm pretty dissatisfied as to its value as a reliable, NPOV source. Some primary or secondary sources would help -- eg a direct reference to Hinn's claims that he was a brilliant but socially isolated student and similarly to a rebuttal of this statement. Who exactly diagnosed Evander Holyfield's heart condition in the first place, and who exactly claimed that he was mis-diagnosed? That's the kind of thing we need to look for as far as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are concerned. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">Jammycakes</a> 21:35, 18 August 2006 (UTC) 16:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right in principle, but the problem was that your edit summary was vague and it didn't give a clear rationale for fairly extensive deletions to the article. Your edits did also seem a bit indiscriminate -- some of them would have led us to believe that Benny Hinn is not only perfect but doesn't have any critics either. A couple of suggestions I'd make are (1) state the reason for your edit clearly in the edit summary, wikilinking to the relevant articles on Wikipedia policy where you can, such as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. (2) Make it clear what you expect of people in that respect when they're putting the content back (as I did when removing the Medawar section - see my edit summary in the page's history). (3) State what you have done on the talk page and why, and sign your talk using four tilde (~) signs. (4) It might be more appropriate to make several edits and give a clear and distinct rationale for each one rather than changing everything in one go. (5) If this does end up in an edit war, Wikipedia has a <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> process that you can check out. (6) You would do well to create a user account and say something about your Wikipedia activity on your user page, so people know where you're coming from. If you do create an account, you can add this and other pages to your watch list and see what is happening with them. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">Jammycakes</a> 19:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My main concern is the overall tone of the "Controversies" and "Claims of prophetic ability" sections. They are too long, unencyclopedic in tone and read like soapboxing. They need to be cut back and rewritten in a more dispassionate tone, quoting (and wikifying) reliable sources. Some of the links at the bottom of the article could serve for this purpose -- perhaps they could be put into references as endnotes?

Throughout the article there are suggestions that highly reputable news organizations have conducted investigations and produced in-depth stories about Hinn, but none of the references point directly to those sources. I suspect that the editors who included statements about the major news organizations <i>never looked at those news reports</i>, but rather relied only on a synopsis given by minor, biased sources of questionable reliability.
