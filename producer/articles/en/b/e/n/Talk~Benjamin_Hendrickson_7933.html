<p>I see that some previous edits were to remove information about how Benjamin died. Listen, I have great respect for the man, and was a fan of him and of the show. But this is an encyclopedia, and we need to report facts. And one of the facts of his death, as reported by the New York Times and other media, was that he took his own life with a gunshot to the head. I understand that it's a difficult topic, but we need to have facts in the article, so please don't delete the info. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 02:27, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-see my comment on your page. There's nothing that makes your viewpoint more valid than mine. Everytime you change it, I will change it back. You are not the ultimate arbiter of fact.</p>
<p>I agree with this. if the family does not what to read about details of suicide method then they should not read this article. My bet is that they will also have to avoid reading every news article about the death, which will also report it. We should not avoid giving accurate descriptions just because someone might be upset, otherwiwse we'd have to suppress a lot of facts. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 21:57, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I completely agree. The description of the manner of Mr. Hendrickson's death in the article is not sensationalized or disrespectful. It is simply reporting facts that, as mentioned before, were reported by newspapers and by television reports. The reporting of this information is also in line with the Wikipedia Guidelines. <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELadydayelle_64f6.html" title="User:Ladydayelle">Ladydayelle</a></p>

<p>I am making further comment here because of a comment above by another user that suggested that I was considering my viewpoint more valuable than others, or that I was trying to be an "arbiter of fact".</p>
<p>I am simply restating the facts as they appear in the New York Times article that addressed his death. The NYT ran this item from the Associated Press wire. The text of the article reads:</p>
<p>''<i>HUNTINGTON, N.Y., July 7 (AP) — Benjamin Hendrickson, an Emmy Award-winning actor on the "As the World Turns" soap opera, committed suicide at his home on Long Island this week, police officials said. He was 55. Suffolk County police officers, called by concerned neighbors, said they found him dead in bed on Monday; the cause was a gunshot to the head, they said.</i></p>
<p><i>Mr. Hendrickson was a member of the first graduating class of the Juilliard School of Drama, along with Kevin Kline and Patti LuPone. He appeared on Broadway in the early 1980's in the title role of "The Elephant Man" and in the 1984 revival of "Awake and Sing!" He played Chief of Detectives Hal Munson for more than 20 years on "As the World Turns" on CBS, winning a Daytime Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in 2003. His last broadcast appearance on the show is scheduled for Wednesday.''</i></p>
<p>Just wanted to clarify that point, should anyone else have questions as to why that information is included. Thanks. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 17:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just because you have source from which you can quote does not mean you should make the judgment to include everything you read. That's parroting and it's utterly uncreative. But I suppose some people have more judgment and creativity than others. It's inevitable. 71.142.208.166 17:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There appears to be a consensus growing that the details of Ben Hendrickson's death should remain. Wikipedia is indeed based off of consensus, and as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, facts should not be avoided. Also, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, so the details should not be removed because they may be unpleasant. Does that clear things up a bit? <a href="../../../c/o/w/User%7ECowman109_5ea9.html" title="User:Cowman109"><font color="DarkGreen">Cowman109</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/w/User_talk%7ECowman109_260b.html" title="User talk:Cowman109">Talk</a></sup> 19:41, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I give in - let this person have their way. They have bypassed a block on one IP address and apparently are going to do the same every time anyone edits. They have broken many Wikipedia rules, including ones about <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppets.html" title="Sock puppets">sock puppets</a> and erasing comments from your own talk page. I really don't have the time or energy to fight this, and the mediation process is rather complicated. So, unfortunately, despite the fact that this individual has perhaps the least knowledgable understanding of Wikipedia ever, and absolutely no regards whatsoever for encyclopedic or journalistic integrity, they win. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 20:33, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just goes to show that Nick not only has a closed mind about others' opinions, but also likes to accuse them of things they haven't done. My ISP provider generates my IP address Nick --don't accuse someone of intentional behavior before you know what the hell you're talking about. 71.142.208.166 20:44, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well no matter. I've stopped the revert war on this article so tyou will simply have to talk now rather than fight.

<p>Theresa, <small>(<a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">Personal attack removed</a>)</small> you have chosen the viewpoint of the few over someone with an equally valid opinion. <small>(<a href="../../../r/p/a/WP%7ERPA_efd5.html" title="WP:RPA">Personal attack removed</a>)</small> 71.142.208.166 22:47, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, your opinion is indeed supposed to be equally valid. Your opinions, however, are much more likely to be listened to equally if you create an account; not to mention it makes it easier to contact you as you have a rotating IP. Also, going about making personal attacks gives people a negative impression of you, and thus makes your opinion appear less valid. However, there are many editors who disagree with you, and Wikipedia is based on consensus. As it stands, though, removing how Hendrickson died is censorship of material you find offensive to his family, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>. Please respect that a majority of editors disagrees with you based on policy. Your personal attacks, however, are completely unnecessary and offensive, so please stop that at once.
