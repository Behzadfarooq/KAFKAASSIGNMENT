<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Historical influences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Historical influences</span></h2>
<p>Bengali food has inherited a large number of influences, both foreign and South Asian, from both a turbulent history and strong trade links with many parts of the world. Originally inhabited by <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian_people.html" title="Dravidian people">Dravidians</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austronesian_people.html" title="Austronesian people">Austronesians</a>, and later further settled by the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryans</a> during the <a href="../../../g/u/p/Gupta.html" title="Gupta">Gupta</a> era, Bengal fell under the sway of various Muslim rulers from the early thirteenth century onwards, and was then ruled by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> for two centuries (<a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>).</p>
<p>Every layer of historical influence endures to the present day; the tribals have traditionally abided as hunter-gatherers in the dense forests of the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunderbans.html" title="Sunderbans">Sunderbans</a> while the rest of Bengal turned heavily agrarian, farming the extremely fertile <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges_delta.html" title="Ganges delta">Ganges delta</a> for rice, vegetables and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cash_crop.html" title="Cash crop">cash crops</a> such as <a href="../../../j/u/t/Jute.html" title="Jute">jute</a>. There was also significant <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisciculture.html" title="Pisciculture">pisciculture</a> in ponds and lakes, along with fishing in the many rivers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Spread of Islam">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spread of Islam</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> influence came to Bengal a few hundred years after its arrival on the western borders of India. While the religion propagated in the populace, the region remained isolated from the political and religious centres of Muslim India. This meant that people retained many of their local customs and especially food habits.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Influence of the widows">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence of the widows</span></h3>
<p>In medieval Bengal the treatment of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> widows was much more restrictive than was common elsewhere. They led very monastic lives within the household and lived under strict dietary restrictions. They were usually not allowed any interests but religion and housework, so the kitchen was an important part of their lives; traditional cuisine was deeply influenced by them. Their ingenuity and skill led to many culinary practices; simple spice combinations, the ability to prepare small quantities (since widows often ate alone) and creative use of the simplest of cooking techniques. Since widows were banned 'impassioning' or aphrodisiac condiments such as onion or garlic, most traditional Bengali vegetarian recipes don't use them; this is in stark contrast to the rest of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> where almost every dish calls for onions and garlic. This has led to a definite slant towards <a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginger.html" title="Ginger">ginger</a> in Bengali vegetarian food, and even in many common fish dishes. This treatment of widows in Bengal continued until fairly recently; the effect on the cuisine was to preserve many of the dishes and techniques of the old in purest form — well removed from the influence of <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal_empire.html" title="Mughal empire">Mughal</a> or Western methods.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: European and other outside influences">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">European and other outside influences</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">Europeans</a> came to modern Bengal soon after the Mughals, but in small numbers. The Europeans brought cooking techniques, but also new ingredients and food items. In addition, cities developed population centres of Europeans; this in turn encouraged foreign purveyors to set up locally, such as <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> bakeries and English <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sausage.html" title="Sausage">sausage</a> vendors.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Partition of Bengal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Partition of Bengal</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partition_of_India_a525.html" title="Partition of India">partition of India</a> from the British in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> separated West Bengal from the present-day Bangladesh, causing a significant change in demographics. The newly formed West Bengal was a small state in India dominated by the mega city of <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, which was already one of the largest cities in the world and about a quarter of the population of the state. Kolkata naturally came to dominate the food habits of the state. The city was India's richest city until the late seventies, attracting people from all over India and building a cosmopolitan culture that both incorporated influences from the rest of India and propagated many trends outwards. On the other side of the border, Bangladesh was isolated by the international boundary and continued to develop a distinct cuisine of its own. Today, three generations later, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladeshi.html" title="Bangladeshi">Bangladeshi</a> and Kolkata cuisines are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Bengali food today has some broad (though not so distinct) variations - Traditional, Mughal, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indian_3dd1.html" title="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_food.html" title="Chinese food">Chinese</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Traditional Bengali cuisine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Traditional Bengali cuisine</span></h3>
<p>The traditional society of Bengal has always been heavily <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agrarian.html" title="Agrarian">agrarian</a>; hunting, except by some local tribals, was uncommon. The rearing of animals was also not popular. This is reflected in the cuisine, which relies on staples like rice and đal, with little place for <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_%28food%29.html" title="Game (food)">game</a> or meat.</p>
<p>Fish is the dominant kind of meat, cultivated in ponds and fished with nets in the fresh-water rivers of the <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges_delta.html" title="Ganges delta">Ganges delta</a>. More than forty types of mostly <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freshwater.html" title="Freshwater">freshwater</a> <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a> are common, including <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carp.html" title="Carp">carp</a> varieties like <i>rui</i> (<a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohu.html" title="Rohu">rohu</a>), <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catla.html" title="Catla">katla</a></i>, <i>magur</i> (<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catfish.html" title="Catfish">catfish</a>), <i>chingŗi</i> (<a href="../../../p/r/a/Prawn.html" title="Prawn">prawn</a> or <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrimp.html" title="Shrimp">shrimp</a>), as well as <i>shuţki</i> (dried sea fish). Salt water fish (not sea fish though) <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilsa.html" title="Hilsa">Ilish</a> (<i>hilsa ilisha</i>) is very popular among Bengalis, can be called an icon of Bengali cuisine. Almost every part of the fish (except <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fin.html" title="Fin">fins</a> and innards) is eaten; the head and other parts are usually used to flavor curries. <i>Khashi</i> (referred to as <i>mutton</i> in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_English_ff92.html" title="Indian English">Indian English</a>, the meat of sterilized goats) is the most popular <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_meat.html" title="Red meat">red meat</a>.</p>
<p>Other characteristic ingredients of traditional Bengali food include <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice.html" title="Rice">rice</a>, <i>moshur <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dal.html" title="Dal">đal</a></i> (red <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lentil.html" title="Lentil">lentils</a>), <i>mug đal</i> (<a href="../../../m/u/n/Mung_bean.html" title="Mung bean">mung beans</a>), <i>shorsher tel</i> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_oil.html" title="Mustard oil">mustard oil</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_%28condiment%29.html" title="Mustard (condiment)">mustard</a> paste, <i>posto</i> (<a href="../../../p/o/p/Poppyseed.html" title="Poppyseed">poppyseed</a>) and <i>narkel</i> (ripe <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coconut.html" title="Coconut">coconut</a>). Bengal is also the land of <i>am</i> (<a href="../../../m/a/n/Mango.html" title="Mango">mangoes</a>), which are used extensively—ripe, unripe, or in pickles. <i><a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilsa.html" title="Hilsa">Ilish machh</a></i> (hilsa fish), which migrates upstream to breed is a delicacy; the varied salt content at different stages of the journey is of particular interest to the connoisseur, as is the river from which the fish comes - fish from the river <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padma.html" title="Padma">Pôdda (Padma or Lower Ganges)</a> in Bangladesh, for example, is traditionally considered the best.To some part of the community, particularly from West Bengal, Gangatic Ilish is the best.The <i><a href="../../../p/a/n/Panch_phoron.html" title="Panch phoron">pãch phoron</a></i> spice mixture is very commonly used for vegetables. A touch of <i>gôrom môshla</i> or hot spices (<i>elachi</i> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardamom.html" title="Cardamom">cardamom</a>, <i>darchini</i> <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinnamon.html" title="Cinnamon">cinnamon</a>, <i>lông</i> <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clove.html" title="Clove">clove</a>, <i>tej pata</i> <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_leaf.html" title="Bay leaf">bay leaves</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_pepper.html" title="Black pepper">peppercorn</a>) is often used to enliven food.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of Bengali food is the use of a unique cutting instrument, the <i>bothi</i>. (This instrument is also used in <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtra.html" title="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>, where it is known as <i>vili</i>). It is a long curved blade on a platform held down by foot; both hands are used to hold whatever is being cut and move it against the blade. The method gives excellent control over the cutting process, and can be used to cut anything from tiny shrimp to large pumpkins. Traditional cuisine is very demanding in the kind of cuts of vegetable used in each dish, vegetables cut in the wrong way is often frowned upon. Furthermore, since different vegetables are usually cooked together, the wrongly cut ones could remain raw or become overcooked.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> (formerly East Bengal), the culinary style developed rather independently; it was not greatly influenced by the rest of India and Southeast Asia because of the difficult geography of the <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges_delta.html" title="Ganges delta">Ganges delta</a>. Four characteristics stand out: fresh-water fish, <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef.html" title="Beef">beef</a>(only for Muslims), the extensive use of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parboiled_rice.html" title="Parboiled rice">parboiled rice</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_oil.html" title="Mustard oil">mustard oil</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dal.html" title="Dal">Đal</a> is also a staple. Spices are used sparingly, and the methods of preparation are relatively simple - steaming, frying or stewing. Floods are common in the region, so there is an extensive use of root vegetables and dried fish (<i>shuţki</i>). Milk and dairy products, so widely used in the neighboring India, are not as common here; the geography prevents large scale breeding of cows, thus making dairy an expensive indulgence. Notably, hardly any food calls for curd or ghee. However, sweets do contain milk and dairy products as well as <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jaggery.html" title="Jaggery">jaggery</a> and rice paste.</p>
<p>In western parts of Bengal, more connected with the rest of India and dominated by the megacity of <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> since the late eighteenth century, a separate culinary style emerged. The delta is thinner there, with fewer rivers and more open plains. There is significant commerce with the rest of India, leading to a flow of spices, ingredients and techniques. The food is much richer with various spices, the presentations are more elaborate and a significant feature of the cuisine is a vast array of sweets based on milk and sugar - the result of both better supply and the influence of traders from the milk belts of <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benares.html" title="Benares">Benares</a>. While fresh-water fish is still common, <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutton.html" title="Mutton">mutton</a> is more common among the Muslim population than beef and dried fish. Wheat makes its appearance alongside rice, in different types of breads such as <i>luchi</i>, <i>kochuri</i> and <i>pôroţa</i>. Though <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustard_%28condiment%29.html" title="Mustard (condiment)">mustard paste</a> is extensively used, mustard oil is abandoned in favor of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groundnut_oil.html" title="Groundnut oil">groundnut oil</a> or refined vegetable oil. There's a greater use of coconut, both in cooking and in desserts.</p>
<p>Prosperity and urbanization also led to the widespread use of professional cooks who introduced complex spice mixtures and more elaborate sauces, along with techniques such as roasting or braising. Also introduced around this time, probably as a consequence of increased urbanization, was a whole new class of snack foods. These snack foods are most often consumed with evening tea. The tea-time ritual was probably inspired by the British, but the snacks bear the stamp of the substantial <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwari.html" title="Marwari">Marwari</a> population in <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> - <i>chaţ</i>, <i>kachori</i>, <i>samosa</i>, <i>phuluri</i> and the ever-popular jhal-muri.</p>
<p><a name="Mughal_influence" id="Mughal_influence"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Mughal influence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mughal influence</span></h3>
<p>Islam arrived in Bengal probably around the mid-thirteenth century, coming into force with the penetration of the Muslim rulers from the northwest. <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dhaka.html" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> (the present-day capital of Bangladesh), in particular, expanded greatly under Mughal rule. The partition of India in 1947 resulted in a large migration of people to and from present-day Bangladesh, resulting in a much stronger divide along religious lines. Bangladesh today shows a much greater Muslim influence than West Bengal.</p>
<p>The influence on the food was top-down, and more gradual than in many other parts of India. This led to a unique cuisine where even the common man ate the dishes of the royal court, such as <i><a href="../../../b/i/r/Biryani.html" title="Biryani">biriani</a></i>, <i>korma</i> and <i>bhuna</i>. The influence was reinforced in the <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raj.html" title="Raj">Raj</a> era, when Kolkata became the place of refuge for many prominent exiled <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawab.html" title="Nawab">Nawabs</a>, especially the family of <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipu_Sultan_c2f4.html" title="Tipu Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> from <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Mysore_e5e9.html" title="Kingdom of Mysore">Mysore</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/j/Wajid_Ali_Shah_3ddf.html" title="Wajid Ali Shah">Wajid Ali Shah</a>, the ousted Nawab of Awadh. The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and <i>masalchis</i> (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth diminished, they interspersed into the local population. These highly accomplished cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of spices (most notably <i>jafran</i> <a href="../../../s/a/f/Saffron.html" title="Saffron">saffron</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mace_%28spice%29.html" title="Mace (spice)">mace</a>), the extensive use of ghee as a method of cooking, and special ways of marinating meats.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, this food has over time become the staple food of the populace. In West Bengal, however, this has remained more than the other categories, the food of professional chefs; the best examples are still available at restaurants. Specialties include <i>chap</i> (ribs slow cooked on a <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawa.html" title="Tawa">tawa</a>), <i>rezala</i> (meat in a thin yogurt and cardamom gravy) and the famous <i>kathi</i> roll (kebabs in a wrap). The local population absorbed some of the ingredients and techniques into their daily food, resulting in meat-based varieties of many traditional vegetarian dishes, but by and large the foods remained distinct.</p>
<p>The Mughal influence is most distinct in preparations involving meat especially mutton. However, even chicken and other meats became more prevalent. The influence was also seen in desserts; traditional desserts were based on rice pastes and jaggery but under the Mughal influence moved towards significantly increased use of milk, cream and sugar along with expensive spices such as cardamom and saffron.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Anglo-Indian or Raj cuisine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anglo-Indian or Raj cuisine</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indian_3dd1.html" title="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</a> food isn't purely the influence of the British; Bengal was once the home of a French colony, and also hosted populations of Portuguese, Dutch, Armenians and Syrians. These collective western influences are seen in the foods created to satisfy the tastes of the western rulers. The result is a unique cuisine, local ingredients adapted to French and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_cuisine.html" title="Italian cuisine">Italian</a> cooking techniques—characterized by creamy sauces, the restrained use of spices and new techniques such as baking. English and Jewish bakers such as Flury's and Nahoum's dominated the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confectionery.html" title="Confectionery">confectionery</a> industry which migrated from British tables to everyday Bengali ones, resulting in unique creations such as the <i>pêţis</i> (savory turnovers, from the English "pasty"). Another enduring contribution to Bengali cuisine is <i>pau ruţi</i>, or Western-style bread. Raj-era cuisine lives on especially in the variety of finger foods popularized in the 'pucca' clubs of Kolkata, such as <i>mutton chop</i>, <i>kabiraji cutlet</i> or <i>fish orly</i>.</p>
<p>The British also influenced food in a somewhat different way. Many British families in India hired local cooks, and through them discovered local foods. The foods had to be toned down or modified to suit the tastes of the 'memsahibs'. The most distinct influence is seen in the desserts, many of which were created specifically to satisfy the British - most notably the very popular sweet <i>leđikeni</i> named after the first Vicereine <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Canning_e10f.html" title="Lady Canning">Lady Canning</a>; it is a derivative of the <i>pantua</i> created for an event hosted by her.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Chinese food">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chinese food</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_of_Calcutta_dcd1.html" title="Chinese of Calcutta">Chinese of Calcutta</a> originally settled into a village called Achipur south of Kolkata in the late 18th century, later moving into the city and finally into its present home in <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tangra%2C_Calcutta_b5b6.html" title="Tangra, Calcutta">Tangra</a> at the eastern edge of Kolkata, which still houses over 100,000 ethnic Chinese<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. No other part of the Indian subcontinent has any significant Chinese population. The Chinese of Kolkata form a substantial and successful community with a distinct identity. With this identity came Chinese food, available at almost every street corner in Kolkata. They were mostly <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese_people.html" title="Cantonese people">Cantonese</a> tradesmen and sailors, bringing with them aji-no-moto and sweet corn. The cuisine is characterized as much by what is missing - mushrooms, for instance, are not found in Bengal - as by what is there, such as a far greater use of pork than any of the other cuisines. As the Chinese opened restaurants for Bengalis, they spiced up the bland Cantonese sauces with sliced chillies and hot sauces, creating unique dishes such as <i>Chilly Chicken</i> and <i>Veg Manchurian</i>.</p>
<p>Indian Chinese food was given a second boost when a large number of Tibetans migrated into Indian Territory, when <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> annexed <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>. Tibetans brought with them their own delicacies to add to this genre, such as the very popular <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momo_%28food%29.html" title="Momo (food)">momo</a> (a kind of dumpling) or <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thukpa.html" title="Thukpa">thukpa</a> (a hearty noodle soup). Tibetans and Nepali immigrants also found ready employment in kitchens as 'Chinese' cooks because of their looks, and helped power the millions of eateries that serve this unique fusion on every street in India.</p>
<p>With a long history of immigration from Cantonese-speaking areas, Bangladesh also hosts a large number of Chinese restaurants. In Dhaka, the phrase <i>Chainiz khaoa</i> (literally 'to eat Chinese food') often simply means 'to eat out (at a restaurant)', as Chinese cuisine was the first widely-available food in Dhaka eateries. As with Indian Chinese food, Chinese food in Bangladesh has evolved much from its Cantonese roots, with greater usage of chili and other spices native to Bengal.</p>
<p>The influence of this unique cuisine cannot be overstated; it's available in every town in India and Bangladesh as Chinese food. Bengali immigrants to other countries have started carrying this abroad as well; Indian Chinese, including <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halal.html" title="Halal">halal</a> Indian Chinese restaurants have appeared in many places in the United States.</p>
<p><a name="Bengali_Meals" id="Bengali_Meals"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Bengali Meals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bengali Meals</span></h2>
<p>The typical Bengali fare includes a certain sequence of food - somewhat like the courses of Western dining. Two sequences are commonly followed, one for ceremonial dinners such as a wedding and the day-to-day sequence. Both sequences have regional variations, and sometimes there are significant differences in a particular course between West Bengal and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>At home, Bengalis typically eat without the use of dining utensils; <i>kaţa</i> (forks), <i>chamoch</i> (spoons), and <i>chhuri</i> (knives) are used in the preparation of food, but will almost certainly not be used to eat one's own food, except in some urban areas. Most Bengalis eat with their right hand, mashing small portions of meat and vegetable dishes with rice and lentils into <i>lokma</i>. In rural areas, Bengalis traditionally eat on the ground with a large banana leaf serving as the plate or plates made from <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sal.html" title="Sal">sal</a> leaves sown together and dried.</p>
<p>The elaborate dining habits of the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengalis.html" title="Bengalis">Bengalis</a> were a reflection of the attention the Bengali housewife paid to the kitchen. In modern times, this is rarely followed anymore. Courses are frequently skipped or combined with everyday meals. Meals were usually served course by course to the diners by the youngest housewives, but increasing influence of nuclear families and urbanization has replaced this. It is now common to place everything on platters in the centre of the table, and each diner serves him/herself. Ceremonial occasions such as weddings used to have elaborate serving rituals, but professional catering and buffet-style dining is now common. The traditions are far from dead, though; large family occasions and the more lavish ceremonial feasts still make sure that these rituals are observed.</p>
<p><a name="Courses_in_a_daily_meal" id="Courses_in_a_daily_meal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Courses in a daily meal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Courses in a daily meal</span></h3>
<p>The foods of a daily meal are usually simpler, geared to balanced nutrition and makes extensive use of vegetables. The courses progress broadly from lighter to richer and heavier. Rice remains common throughout the meal until the <i>chaţni</i> (<a href="../../../c/h/u/Chutney.html" title="Chutney">chutney</a>) course.</p>
<p>The starting course is a bitter. The bitter changes with the season but common ones are <i>kôrolla</i> (<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitter_gourd.html" title="Bitter gourd">bitter gourd</a>) which is available nearly throughout the year, or tender <i><a href="../../../n/e/e/Neem.html" title="Neem">nim</a></i> leaves in spring. Bitters are mostly deep fried in oil, or steamed with cubed potatoes. Portions are usually very small - a spoonful or so to be had with rice - and this course is considered to be both a palate-cleanser and of great medicinal value.</p>
<p>Another bittersweet preparation usually eaten in summer, especially in West Bengal, is a soupy mixture of vegetables in a ginger-mustard sauce, called <i>shukto</i>. This usually follows the dry bitters, but sometimes replaces it, and is eaten in much bigger portions. <i>Shukto</i> is a complex dish, a fine balance of many different kinds of tastes and textures and is often a critical measure of a Bengali housewife's abilities in the kitchen. However, shukto is not popular in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>This is followed by <i>shak</i> (<a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaf_vegetables.html" title="Leaf vegetables">leafy vegetables</a>) such as <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinach.html" title="Spinach">spinach</a>, <i>palong</i> <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chard.html" title="Chard">chard</a>, <i>methi</i> <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenugreek.html" title="Fenugreek">fenugreek</a>, or <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amaranth.html" title="Amaranth">amaranth</a>. The <i>shak</i> can be steamed or cooked in oil with other vegetables such as <i>begun</i> (<a href="../../../e/g/g/Eggplant.html" title="Eggplant">eggplant</a>). Steamed <i>shak</i> is sometimes accompanied by a sharp paste of mustard and raw mango pulp called <i>Kasundi</i>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dal.html" title="Dal">đal</a> course is usually the most substantial course, especially in West Bengal. It is eaten with a generous portion of rice and a number of accompaniments. In Bangladesh, đal is usually eaten with the fish and meat courses, while in West Bengal it is eaten somewhat beforehand.</p>
<p>A common accompaniment to đal is <i>bhaja</i> (fritters). <i>Bhaja</i> literally means 'deep-fried'; most vegetables are good candidates but <i>begun</i> (aubergines), <i>kumra</i> (pumpkins), or <i>alu</i> (potatoes) are common. <i>Machh bhaja</i> (fried fish) is also common, especially <i>rui</i> (<a href="../../../r/o/h/Rohu.html" title="Rohu">rohu</a>) and <i>ilish</i> (<a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilsa.html" title="Hilsa">hilsa</a>) fishes. <i>Bhaja</i> is sometimes coated in a <i><a href="../../../b/e/s/Besan.html" title="Besan">beshon</a></i> (chickpea flour) and <i>posto</i> (<a href="../../../p/o/p/Poppyseed.html" title="Poppyseed">poppyseed</a>) batter. A close cousin of <i>bhaja</i> is <i>bôra</i> or deep-fried savoury balls usually made from <i>posto</i> (<a href="../../../p/o/p/Poppyseed.html" title="Poppyseed">poppyseed</a>) paste or coconut mince. Another variant is fried <a href="../../../p/o/i/Pointed_gourd.html" title="Pointed gourd">pointed gourd</a> as <i>potoler dorma</i> with <a href="../../../r/o/e/Roe_%28egg%29.html" title="Roe (egg)">roe</a> stuffing.</p>
<p>Another accompaniment is a vegetable preparation usually made of multiple vegetables stewed slowly together without any added water. <i>Labra</i>, <i>chorchori</i>, <i>ghonto</i>, or <i>chanchra</i> are all traditional <a href="#glossary" title="">cooking styles</a>. There also are a host of other preparations that do not come under any of these categories and are simply called <i>tôrkari</i> - the word merely means 'vegetable' in Bengali. Sometimes these preparations may have spare pieces of fish such as bits of the head or gills, or spare portions of meat. A <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Charchari.html" title="Charchari">charchari</a></i> is a vegetable dish that is cooked without stirring, just to the point of charring.</p>
<p>The next course is the fish course. Common fish delicacies include <i>machher jhol</i>, <i>tel koi</i>, <i>pabda machher jhal</i>, <i>Doi machh</i>, <i>Chingri machh</i> (<a href="../../../p/r/a/Prawn.html" title="Prawn">shrimp</a>) <i>malai curry</i>, and <i>bhapa ilish</i> (steamed hilsa).</p>
<p>Then comes the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat.html" title="Meat">meat</a> course. The divide among the Bengalis of Bangladesh and West Bengal is most evident when it comes to the meat course. Meat is readily consumed in urban parts of Bangladesh and some consider it the meal's main course. <i>Khashi</i> <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutton.html" title="Mutton">mutton</a> or goat meat is traditionally the meat of choice, especially West Bengal, but <i>murgi</i> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicken.html" title="Chicken">chicken</a> and <i>đim</i> <a href="../../../e/g/g/Egg_%28food%29.html" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a> are also commonly consumed. At the time of Partition, it was rare for caste Hindus to eat chicken or even eggs from hens, choosing rather, duck eggs if eggs were to be consumed. Although it is debatable as to whether chicken is more popular than <i>khashi</i> in West Bengal today, the proliferation of poulty farms and hatcheries makes chicken the cheaper alternative. Beef is popular in Bangladesh, but not in most parts of West Bengal.</p>
<p>Finally comes the chutney course, which is typically tangy and sweet; the chutney is usually made of <i>am</i> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mango.html" title="Mango">mangoes</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomato.html" title="Tomato">tomatoes</a>, <i>anarôsh</i> <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pineapple.html" title="Pineapple">pineapple</a>, <i>tetul</i> <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamarind.html" title="Tamarind">tamarind</a>, <i>pepe</i> <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papaya.html" title="Papaya">papaya</a>, or just a combination of <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit.html" title="Fruit">fruits</a> and dry fruits. In Bangladesh, chutney is usually eaten during the đal course and no separate course is dedicated to chutney. <i>Papoŗ</i>, a type of wafer, thin and flaky, is often made of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dal.html" title="Dal">đal</a> or potatoes or <i>shabu</i> (tapioca) and is a usual accompaniment to the chutneys.</p>

<p>Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. It is an ancient custom among <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a> to distribute sweets during festivities. The confectionery industry has flourished because of its close association with social and religious ceremonies. Competition and changing tastes have helped to create many new sweets, and today this industry has grown within the country as well as all over the world.</p>
<p>The sweets of Bengal are generally made of sweetened cottage cheese (<i>chhena</i>), <i>khoa</i> (reduced solidified milk), or flours of different <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cereal.html" title="Cereal">cereals</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulse_%28legume%29.html" title="Pulse (legume)">pulses</a>.

<p>Made from sweetened, finely ground fresh <a href="../../../p/a/n/Paneer.html" title="Paneer">chhena (cheese)</a>, shôndesh in all its variants is among the most popular Bengali sweets. The basic shôndesh has been considerably enhanced by the many famous confectioners of Bengal, and now a few hundred different varieties exist, from the simple <i>kachagolla</i> to the complicated <i>abar khabo</i>, <i>jôlbhôra</i> or <i>indrani</i>. Another variant is the <i>kôrapak</i> or hard mixture, which blends rice flour with the paneer to form a shell-like dough that last much longer.</p>

<p>Chômchôm (especially from Porabari, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tangail_District_d623.html" title="Tangail District">Tangail District</a> in Bangladesh) goes back about 150 years. The modern version of this sweet was inspired by Raja Ramgore of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballia.html" title="Ballia">Ballia</a> district in <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttar_Pradesh_a21c.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> in India. It was then further modernised by his grandson, Matilal Gore. This oval-shaped sweet is reddish brown in colour and it is of a denser texture than the rôshogolla. It can also be preserved longer.

<p>In both Bangladesh and West Bengal, the tradition of making cakes, locally known as <i>piţha</i>, still flourishes. They are usually made from rice or wheat flour mixed with sugar, jaggery, grated coconut etc. Piţhas are usually enjoyed with the sweet syrups of <i>khejurer gur</i> (<a href="../../../d/a/t/Date_palm.html" title="Date palm">date</a> tree molasses). They're usually fried or steamed; the most common forms of these cakes include <i>bhapa piţha</i> (steamed), <i>pakan piţha</i> (fried), and <i>puli piţha</i> (dumplings), among others. The other common pithas are <i>chandrapuli</i>, <i>gokul</i>, <i>pati sapta</i>, <i>chitai piţha</i>, <i>muger puli</i> and <i>dudh puli</i>.</p>
<p>Piţhas are usually a celebration of the new crop, and often associated with harvest festivals.</p>

<p>Muŗi (puffed rice) is made by heating sand in a pot, and then throwing in grains of rice. The rice can have been washed in brine to provide seasoning. The rice puffs up and is separated from the sand by a strainer. Muŗi is very popular and is used in a wide variety of secular and religious occasions, or even just munched plain.</p>
<p>A variant of muŗi is khoi, which is flattened puffed rice. Both varieties are used to make many different snack foods.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_cuisine.html" title="Edit section: Jhal-Muŗi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jhal-Muŗi</span></h4>
<p>One of the most popular and iconic snack foods of Bengal, <i>jhal</i> literally means 'hot' or 'spicy'. Jhal-muŗi is puffed rice with spices, vegetables and raw mustard oil. Depending on what is added, there are many kinds of jhal-muŗi but the most common is a <i>bhôrta</i> made of chopped onion, <i>jira</i> roasted ground cumin, <i>bitnoon</i> black salt <i>lôngka</i> / <i>morich</i> chilis (either <i>kacha</i> 'ripe' or <i>shukna</i> 'dried'), mustard oil, and <i>dhone pata</i> (fresh coriander leaves).</p>

<p>A moa is made by taking muri with <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gur.html" title="Gur">gur (jaggery)</a> as a binder and forming it into a ball. Another popular kind of moa is <i>Joynagorer</i> moa, a moa particularly made in Joynagor from a district of West Bengal which uses khoi and a sugar-milk-spices mixture as binder.</p>
