<p>Ben,</p>
<p>I just arrived back in town yesterday, to start I appreciate the support I got from you, Zoe and Alex, I love these other so called experts, writing style can always be improved and I stand behind all my Buffalo-Todaro family information, I think the thousands of Buffalo News articles are a reliable sourc. We have Buffalo crime writers like Lee Coppola that have been writing about the Buffalo Family and the Todaros for 30 years. By the way I still have everything I copied off the Buffalo Mobsite by Supercrack, which covers everything he did. His writing style is very loose and the grammer needs work, but the point is made. There's a ton of information that I never mentioned about the Todaro's because I've never set out to demean or slander anyone, actually I thaught I made Joe Todaro out to be really respectable. I go to La Nova regularly, it's in my old neighbourhood and believe me when I tell you the todaro family do alot for the community, but also trust me when I say that I didn't mention shit. I never mentioned the murders that they've been directly implicated in, not to mention every one in the Buffalo area knows that they controlled one of the largest narcotics rings in Western New York, along the East coast and up to Florida in the 1980's and early 1990's. My father went to the dice and card games in the 1970's and 80's that were held in the Grant St. and Hertal Ave. area and became friends with Jimmy Sicurella, the man accussed of being the shooter in the Cammilleri hit. As far as posting anymore articles or anything a else, let the MAFIA EXPERT handle it, I'm to busy writing a screenplay. Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi Fred, IRC may be a great place to find officials and chat them, but since when did IRC become a valid chanel for official business? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AIRC_channels&amp;diff=102061075&amp;oldid=101539033" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AIRC_channels&amp;diff=102061075&amp;oldid=101539033" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 07:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was its original purpose. The creation of the channel was the subject of extensive conversations between Jimbo and others. It was to be a place where problems which required action by administrators could be brought to by the office, discussed and acted on. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 16:25, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Ben Aveling, I meant to also leave you a post. First I would just like to say I do stand by the comments I left on Bishonen's talk page. I also think it is very respectable that you have put as much work as you have into this ordeal. I would like to just make a couple more statements for you. I never had a problem with most of Revolver's edits, it was the tactics he used against other editors that made me notice him. An example: I noticed that a banned user (Revolver, yes I had problems with him before but I had nothing to do with his ban) had come back in late December. I did a Check User for what I thought were Sock Puppets. I was then immediately harassed by the editor, 3RRs were slapped on my IP and Talk Page, and a Check User was put up for my account. OK then, all's fair, maybe I'm the vandal...except for the simple check on my User Contributions show I had not made an edit for <b>THREE MONTHS</b>! I stand by my edits. I vicariously edit very little and only what interests me. I expect other editors to stand by what they edit. I'm sure you could. But if someone has to retaliate, at all, against any other editor...you're covering up and hiding something (not to mention being childish). I think the editor in question has a history of doing things he shouldn't and then obfuscates the facts when someone points it out. Here is my question. If everything goes through and the user is allowed to edit again, what should be expected? I guess what I would like to know is will this exempt this person from all wrong doings? If somebody once again brings up an example of vandalism or trolling will the editor simply be able to say "look no problem, here is my proof" and then shows the outline you have worked on? I believe you are accepting a big responsibility by helping him “prove his innocence”. Well I believe you are a very intelligent individual and are attempting to do the right thing, and I respect you for that. I hope you realize what you are doing.

He's used a number of accounts, but never more than one at a time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ApocalypticDestroyer%27s#Socks_or_reincarnations.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ApocalypticDestroyer%27s#Socks_or_reincarnations.3F" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
<dd>Yes, there has been harassment inappropriate use of warnings amd reverting without trying to find a middle ground. (And not just by Revolver.) If he is unbanned, that doesn't give him a free pass. It doesn't mean that he has been found 'innocent' of all charges. All it means is that people are prepared to give him a chance to show that he can make a positive contribution. If he doesn't do that, he can be blocked again.</dd>
<dd>I noticed your break. To be honest, it did make me wonder why you chose that moment to return. I ended up deciding it was coincidence. If you and Certified are the same user you do an excellent job of sounding like different people.</dd>
<dd>If there are any conditions you'd like to put on Revolver, now would be a good time to mention them. And if there is anyone else who has clashed with him, I would appreciate their input also.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for your message, it's clear that you too are trying to do the best for wikipedia, even if we don't quite agree on what best is. &#160;:-) All the best to you too. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 21:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I recalled it was Ragnarok that was banned and not Revolver after I made the post. They are the same user, by admission, right? Do you think the editor would have acted any differently or would not have been banned if he was still using the Revolver account? In other words I can't understand how that is a valid agument, and I think it a bit fallacious to say he should still have priviledges just because his original account was not banned (or is this a convenient loophole?). As far as using more than one account, it just looks like he was trying to get around the original ban, but also it looked like he was using it as cover. Used one for awhile and then switched over to another. This is all from my point of view. It looks like Revolver edits quite a bit and if he tread a bit more lightly I'm sure no one would mind (including me). No I'm not CG, I don't have as much time to be productive on Wikipedia as he does. Thanks for the reply, and take care. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuckyDucky_7e9c.html" title="User:ShuckyDucky">ShuckyDucky</a> 02:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I was going to edit the <a href="../../../5/_/w/5_Whys_c848.html" title="5 Whys">5 Whys</a> article, and saw that you recently removed an external link. However, you left another external link in place. I don't understand why you removed one, but not the other. Is there a reason for that? If I was going to remove just one of those links, I probably would have chosen differently. --72.141.21.242 23:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The one I removed looked like original research, and I mistook the one I left for something more official than it actually is. Having had another look, I think I agree with you. I'll switch them over. The Bill Wilson article is worth reading while the one I originally left, isn't.

<dd>No, we only do that for discussions that have not been closed yet. Discussion may be extended if not closed. Once it's closed, even if it's overturned, the proper thing is to set up a new afd. Because the one afd would account for: first arguments closing with delete, overturned and restored, DRV, second afd.

<p>Hey what up Ben? I notice there's a lot of "interactions" between you and Guardian Tiger's new sock on his talkpage. I think it's extremely wrong to react the way <a href="../../../g/u/a/User%7EGuardian_Tiger_7cda.html" title="User:Guardian Tiger">User:Guardian Tiger</a> did when his account was blocked indef. and unblock requests were turn down twice (which caused talkpage protection). As far as I'm concerned, the optimal way to respond to a perma. ban is definitely NOT create more socks while continue to maintain the original block was unjustified. A similar case was <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoolGuy_fbb1.html" title="User:PoolGuy">User:PoolGuy</a> whose sockpuppets # over 50. It could be interpreted as a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>. The new sock talkpage also shouldn't be a discussion forum to obtain an unblock. The only channel of communication he should have is through the talkpage of User talk:Guardian Tiger or through the e-mail function. Thank you! By the way, I also notice that you accused me of being a sock of ShuckyDucky. One thing I will never do is creating socks. Hopefully, you will apologize for your wrong judgment.

<dd>Hi Certified, I believe I have already apologised to Shucky for having wondered if he and you might be connected. And unless memory fails me, that was the only time I discussed the issue online? But if I have raised it elsewhere, then of course I apologise to him for doing so. Anyway, why do you think that Apocolyptic should use Tiger's page? Surely he should use the page for his current active account? Or failing that, Revolver Ocelot X? Not that Revolver Ocelot X is blocked.

<dd>The issue here is that Apocolyptic is a new sock of Guardian after Guardian is perma. blocked, so obviously it should be perma. blocked as well (which it already has) but when considering uplifting the perma. blocked, the only channel should be User:Guardian Tiger and since the talkpage for that account is protected that means the community is telling him to shut up like Jason Gastrich, PoolGuy, Cute 1 4 U, and the list goes on. These above troublemakers all went ahead to create more socks and continue to maintain the original block was unjustified while disregarding the fact that their block was by consensus of the community. Now, why should Guardian Tiger be any different? My suggestion is for him to stop using his new sock right now (hopefully an admin would protect the talkpage) since it is clearly setting a bad example for future sockpuppeters. (when you're talkpage is protected, get a sock to start a new discussion forum) Such practice is unacceptable. His only channel is to set up an e-mail for Guardian Tiger and communicate through the e-mail function. And lastly, I found the sockpuppet accusation against me personally offensive, so I will appreciate if you apologize to me (of course he didn't take that so seriously).

<dd>I guess you'd prefer that he just stops editing wikipedia, fair enough. A lot of us feel that way about certain other people. But if I'm wrong and you have a constructive suggestion for what he should do, feel free to make it. If you want an apology, then you're going to have to be specific about what untruth I've spoken about you because I'm not aware of any. In particular, I have not, to my recall, accused you of sockpuppeting. Are you suggesting that I should apologise for even having considered the possibility?

And the banner is just a joke, and neither a funny nor an original one. I agree, you should have the right to put it on your page, except for the bot issue, but I don't see it as a right worth fighting for. So my advice is to let that go too.

<dd>Yeah, myself and Daniel Bryant sent emails to Sarah as well as the other guys on that talk page. I waited overnight Australian time to see if she was away or not, and I thought that she was away, by not replying, so I unblocked Michael because I thought there was a consensus that the removing the block might be the best way of moving on. I do not mean it to be a condoning of Michael's comments, or that I felt that Sarah to be a bad administrator or that the block was improper.

<p>Hi! I saw your comment on the misc for deletion page, and have replied.</p>
<p>I think you missed the point of the concept on first reading... which could possibly be my fault, since I've been doing a bit of the typing on that page, I suppose.</p>
<p>Throw out any idealism, elegance, or thoughts of singing kumbaya. Write down <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sworn_testimony.html" title="Sworn testimony">what works, all of what works, and nothing but what works</a>. That's my idea of what a descriptive guideline should be.&#160;:-)</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/d/WP%7EBRD_8e65.html" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a> is such a descriptive guideline. People have basically just written down what they've learned over time. You could disagree with parts of it because you know better ways to do that task, in that case {{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}}. You could grimace in distaste, because some parts aren't pretty. But in the end, it just simply <i>works</i>.</p>
<p>The idea is simple. Some pages rust and become immovable over time. For example: Front pages of wikis, certain policies, controversial topics, and pages where there is apparent <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNership</a>, or other (to some degree) pathological situations.</p>
<p>By</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting down the number of interactions by finding exactly those people who have issues with your change (and no others); and</li>
<li>Splitting the problem up into manageable sub-steps;</li>

<p>a single (well practiced) editor can manage to bring people together and solve the situation.</p>

<p>I'm just boggled. Abolished, because it's broad, and POV - you see, some people think that poverty and hunger are just, and therefore we shouldn't recoginise that some things are issues of social justice. I'm appalled. I realise that wikipedia has to run on decision making by self selected committees, but gee they get it wrong sometimes. IMHO, of course.

<p>RfC doesn't seem to work any more (and anyway, thre's no category into which schools obviously fit); I've tried to attract other eyes to this article by posting both at RfC and at the relevant WikiProject, but so far without success, so I'm reduced to pestering individual editors. Could you have a look at this, and say what you think? An editor is insisting on adding large quantities of school-yearbook-style coverage of the school's sports teams. A third pair of eyes would be helpful.

<dd>My instinctive reaction is AFD. The only potentially notable thing about the school might be the racial conflict, except that isn't discussed anywhere. The bit about the sex offender is worth a mention in his article, but not at the school. Well, it might be if there were any content, but just a note that he was there doesn't justify anything. And the sports stuff - it's hard to be sure that there isn't something notable in there, but most, probably all of it, should just be deleted. I'll purge it, but I expect to be reverted.

<p>Hi, Ben - Have you gone through the barnstar approval process before? This is my first time and I'm actually rather unclear how much support we need to get a go for a new barnstar, or even for an Other-Related Award. Any thoughts or pointers? <font face="Georgia"><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:navy">~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 04:03, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That was my first trip into that process. What I can say is don't make the mistake I did - either make it clear that your proposal covers a need that isn't already covered, or make sure that your proposed barnstar is clearly better than what already exists.

What I was trying to suggest was something more like this, as if the barnstar was holding the quill and broom. I could probably pull it together if need be, but I think you have better tools than I do. (I'm using gimp, which is good for most things, but a bit weak on rotations. At least, the version I have is, for all I know there's a new release.)

<li>The vetting of the barnstars that could be listed on the <a href="../../../b/s/_/WP%7EBS_05bb.html" title="WP:BS">WP:BS</a> page initially developed because of the chaos that was being created. Over time, the awards pages have grown to four classes of awards. Anyone can create any award (as can any wikiproject), but to get listed on the page they had to first be vetted. There are now fifteen pages of archived ideas, most of which haven't made it to the page. The flip side of the vetting was the relative freedom of listing something on the <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html" title="WP:PUA">WP:PUA</a> page - anyone can post almost anything there.</li>
