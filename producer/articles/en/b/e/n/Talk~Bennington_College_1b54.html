<p>A number of editors have been repeatedly injecting their opinions into this article. Please stop. And visit this page <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five_pillars</a>. If you would like to include information on the the symposium or other controversial topics, research the topic and list sources. And if you want to present an "alternate history", start your own web page. Remember that there are ways to objectively discuss controversy. I would love to see that. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 17:17, 17 May 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>When there are such different opinions about this institution, there will be several views of objectivity. It seems to me that the current administration has an interest in: a) denigrating the past students by calling them anarchic. It is objectively true that Bennington students were more serious and committed than their peers at "straight" schools. It is also true that Bennington was bohemian and more likely to be "self-expressive." It is certainly objectively true that the present administration is well served by presenting itself as having stepped in to save a "bad" institution. Current students should be aware of that self-interest. Don't get me wrong - I think that the representation of the school as it is now should be left to the adminstration and those who must live with it as it is. But why must the past be maligned and misrepresented in order to paint a picturee of the school as it is now? Remember, there is an official Bennington.edu site that is controlled, as is proper, by the college that exists now. If the administration and current students would keep from trying to rewrite past history, there would be no need to bring in the most objective measure of all - the rather and embarrassing performance of the college since 1992 on the US News ranking list.</p>
<p>Finally, I assume the business of "most expensive" is an importation from the administration, who thinks it is cute and an achievement. I think it is trivial now and was trivial in the sixties. I'd be happy to agree to drop it. (Hofjude)</p>
<p>I have added to the paragraph about students in the past, removed the tease about how far down the list of academic quality the college has fallen, and made a nod to continuity. Please do not erase if you were not there.<a href="../../../h/o/f/User%7EHofjude_a121.html" title="User:Hofjude">Hofjude</a> 21:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I disagree with the statement "please do not erase if you were not there." Stay objective. If the information can't be gathered by someone who has never attended the college, it shouldn't be in the article. In an entry about apples, it would be innapropriate to say "apples are the most delicious fruit". It would be better to say "apples are one of the world's most popular fruits" (and this statement would be even more valuable were it backed up with cited literature.) <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 01:08, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Being objective and withholding information based on actual knowledge are two different things, a distinction that present-day Bennington students seem incapable of making. Accordingly, because you have eviscerated the description of the alumni and past faculty, I shall restore and continue to restore the objective, independently verifiable information from US News about the College's academic ranking these days. Cheers!<a href="../../../h/o/f/User%7EHofjude_a121.html" title="User:Hofjude">Hofjude</a> 19:42, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hof, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't many people critical of the way US News and World Report ranks colleges? Besides, there are plenty of other sources (such as the book the top 351 colleges) that rank Bennington as an excellent school. There's also no need for the "bennington students seem incapable" of making. That's an assumption thats insulting. One can disagree with the administration of the school, but to make generalizations like that seems a tad inappropriate. --Jonmedeiros 22:51, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's true that the US News and World Report ranking systems are questionable. Some schools, like Reed College, will not even participate in the ranking system at all. I find it ironic that people who continually claim that Bennington used to be SO much more progressive than it is now resort to using generic mainstream rating systems to "prove" their points. Even if those rankings are useful, did they even exist back in Bennington's earlier days? No. So there is no way to try to use that information to prove anything about how the school has changed. And stop putting down current students. Those claims are utterly and completely unfounded and reveal deeply subjective motives. LNealon 19:13, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have an issue with the purported objectivity of contributors to this article. I noticed in the history that an entire section entitled "Recent News" was edited out because a professor at the college felt the information was "dubious at best.” A girl died at this school and another was seriously injured. Doesn't it bother anyone that this information was removed, and by a professor at the college no less? Yes, it was a bad thing that happened, but that doesn't give someone the right to edit out important information about the school just because they think it gives the school a bad name, or that the section may contain dubious information. We should do the responsible Wikipedia thing and require citations, references, or better wording for the section instead of removing it entirely and painting an inaccurate picture of modern-day Bennington. --Anon 1 Oct 2006</p>
<p>1. "Recent News" <i>as a category</i> is dubious. The news itself was indeed tragic and newsworthy. I was there. I knew the girls who were injured. I cried with everyone else.<br />
2. I wasn't the one who removed the text. Someone else did. Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks "Recent News" doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article.<br />
3. I don't think "Recent News" belongs in an encyclopedia article. Among the handful of other articles about liberal arts colleges I checked none of them has a "Recent News" section.<br />

<p>A couple of observations:</p>
<p>- the observation that there were "student riots" seems like an exaggeration, but that was way after my time (although I did attend a reunion that year - just didn't see any evidence of riots).</p>
<p>- there is no mention of what is now called "field work term"</p>
<p>- the school is still famous in the minds of many for sexual hedonism (for lack of a better term). I still hear people say "oh isn't that where they dance naked?" in response to mention of the college. Bennington received an A+ rating from Playboy in 1968, a fact that I mentioned in my admissions interview on November 15, 1969.</p>
<p>- the "pop culture" references seem sophomoric to me. the school is very famous.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was there during the "riots" and there weren't any. That's ridiculous. There was a peaceful sit-in.</p>
<hr />
<p>"In the 1980s, Bennington gained unexpected notoriety for being the most expensive college in the country"</p>
<p>Bennington was already the most expensive college in the country, by far, in the 60s. I've tried editting this before but someone keeps changing it. My freshman year in 1970-1 cost $5200, and that was the first time any college in the United States had charged more than $5,000 for annual tuition, room and board.</p>
<p>The references to student "riots" need to be revised as they are simply not accurate. Moreover, student protests of administration policies were not without precedent. The administration offices were occupied for a couple of weeks (or more) in the spring of 1972.</p>
<hr />
<p>I feel sad to see the "riots" bit go, since it was funny--like other posters, I was there for those (assuming we're talking about the walkout/sit-in and the AAUP thing, which I drove up to Vermont to attend), and they were hardly riots. But I rephrased that sentence somewhat; hope my changes don't offend. Iralith 20:46, 2 November 2005 (UTC) (sorry, this was my post)</p>

<p>Does anyone else think that the Pop Culture section is unwieldy and a bad idea that's going to continue to grow to enormous proportions and eat this article alive? <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe07734_e40d.html" title="User:Joe07734">Joe</a> 01:05, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>"Public Image" doesn't capture the essence of Bennington at all, I don't think. Instead that section currently focusses on some financial issues that are becoming dated.</p>
<p>I restored the references to the Shirley Jackson short stories because it's something I only know from reading this article, and something I wish I had known when I was student at the college 35 years ago.</p>
<p>-I have again removed the references to Shirley Jackson. Whether or not pop culture references are necessary or appropriate to this article, it is simply inaccurate to list these stories under the heading "Mentions of Bennington College exist in:", when there are verifiably no mentions of Bennington College in either story. The idea for "The Lottery" arose from Jackson's feelings of alienation while living in the insular community of N. Bennington, and "The Haunting of Hill House" was inspired by the very creepy Jenning mansion. Neither, however, explicitly mentions Bennington College. (<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe07734_e40d.html" title="User:Joe07734">Joe</a> assumes this is <a href="../../../e/b/e/User%7EEbenpack_4454.html" title="User:Ebenpack">Ebenpack</a>'s comment.)</p>
<p>I still think the "Pop Culture" references are trivial. References to Bennington are hardly unusual. Would an article about Harvard list miscellaneous references to the college? 129.55.27.4 14:48, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>This is embarrassing. Look at an article like Vassar's... Bennington deserves better than this.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bennington is no more expensive than most liberal arts colleges EVEN THOUGH it is closed for the winter months. Compare the academic calendar; the days of undergraduate residency are comparable to other schools. Yes, the school is closed for two months. Still, students are in class and on campus as many days as everywhere else.</p>
<hr />
<p>There should be separate lists of distinguished faculty and alumni. 129.55.27.4 17:59, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, I made the split. Please check for errors. Some of these people I've never heard of. Also, it would be nice to add dates for both Faculty and Alumni. 129.55.27.4 18:23, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I vote a weak "yes" for keeping notable alums, and a strong "yes" for getting rid of the ridiculous "pop culture" list. I think every notable alum should have a brief description. An unlinked and unexplained notable alum is meaningless. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe07734_e40d.html" title="User:Joe07734">Joe</a> 13:31, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I copied the categories "Notable Faculty" and "Notable Alumni" from the Bard College article (although it's pretty common usage in Wikipedia articles describing schools, my quick glance at Bard was a somewhat random style reference). I don't really mind the "pop culture" references as they are kind of fun, if a bit sophomoric. I think at the moment the only "notable alum" listed without a link or additional information is Mary Ruefle, who (I think) is a fairly accomplished, published poet. Anyway, the list is a work in progress. I'd like to see dates for all the people. The listing order for both categories is pretty arbitrary as well. In general, I'd like to see more information added rather than see information removed. 24.128.218.189 21:56, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I also vote "yes" for getting rid of the "pop culture" section. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 11:22, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And to whoever anonymously added my name to the list of notable alumni: I haven't graduated yet. And I'm not notable. Someday, maybe, but not yet. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 16:52, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Alumni protests? Maybe some alumni had some objections, but it seems to me that alumni reaction was mostly mixed. What exactly is meant by "protests"? Did alumni and students occupy the administation building? Did they form a picket line? 129.55.27.4 18:02, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>caption for the picture of the new houses -- these houses were not completed in 1999. They had not even been started then. The first students lived in them in the Fall 2001 semester, so they were probably completed in 2001.72.83.106.101 15:57, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>I think the "current students" section is awesome. I haven't looked at any of the links, but this is exactly the type of information that we can provide that (probably) won't be found on the official college website. 129.55.27.4 14:42, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Maybe it would be more appropriate for the official website. Is this what Wikipedia is meant for?</p>
<hr />
<p>What about adding the links to the "external links" section? If they belong anywhere, that's probably where they should be.</p>
<p>Please sign in before adding comments, by the way. It's rude not to. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 11:03, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I tend to agree that they should be moved to the external links section. Ryanjohnson 19:09, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not a big fan of it either. As much as I like the idea of free publicity for student websites (mine included!), I think it gives a misleading cross-section of BC students. It's probably something we could get on www.bennington.edu if we bothered Bob Graves and David Rees enough. I feel like there's a certain type of "internal information" that just isn't appropriate for Wikipedia, and "some current students" is included in that group. If someone really wants to get a sense of the students, they should visit campus!</p>

<p>I think that it would probably be good to expound on topics that are pertinent to current students at Bennington. I mean, I think at least a couple hundred of us "crashed" that faculty meeting when the new guy came in and tried to take away nudity (or did he accomplish it? I left before the matter was down). I don't think that the current wiki really captures the meaning of Bennington. I mean, true, it's something you have to experience to completely understand, but we could at least clue people into it. Maybe have some information about the different houses? Think about the huge differences between, say, Franklin, Kilpat, and Perkins. People need to know that there are still different groups at Bennington, because the wiki seems to make it all very one-dimensional. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllison_Stillwell_ea21.html" title="User:Allison Stillwell">Allison Stillwell</a> 01:04, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, Allison. Also, the entire "public image" section needs to be rewritten. As it is, most of the stuff about protests against Elizabeth Coleman's reforms is very dated, very specific to the 90s. It might be better to have different sections for different decades. I don't think the public thinks of Elizabeth Coleman when they think of Bennington. IP129.55.27.4 14:52, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do the students even think of Elizabeth Coleman at all? I know the first time I ever saw her was after I left Bennington, and my initial viewing was actually on Wikipedia. Prior to that, she could have come up and slapped me open-palm across the face and I wouldn't have known who she was. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllison_Stillwell_ea21.html" title="User:Allison Stillwell">Allison Stillwell</a> 01:25, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to the last two entries: Ideally, all "college" entries follow a similar format and don't stray from objective information. This is not the place for colorful accounts of our time at college. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 15:48, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Right, we certainly wouldn't want an article about Bennington College to be unconventional.</p>
<p>You gotta know when to rock out and when to tone it down. Wikipedia is definitely a place to tone it down. BC is unconventional, but I think it can speak for itself. Wikipedia's a place where we speak about interesting things in the boring and objective manner we possibly can. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxcantor_7cd1.html" title="User:Maxcantor">Max</a> 23:44, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't like the section on Bennington athletics. Unless there are citations, it should be removed. Also, the information can be worked into another section if need be (and it's true). What does everyone else think? <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 05:37, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, the athletics section is ridiculous and sarcastic in tone. Also, the bit about students as art buyers reads as underhanded and rude.</p>

<p>What do people think about getting rid of the sub-heading "public image?" Everything seems relevant to the "History" heading. Saying "public image" is confusing and seems unnecessary. Also, I'd like to start a section for buildings on campus. Name of building, date built, architect, notable features, etc. What do people think? [LNealon May 5, 2006]</p>
<p>Some kind of decade-by-decade history of the college would be very interesting. I think one of the problems Bennington has today is reconciling its "progressive" past with whatever image it is trying to project today. We see this reflected in the heavy-handed censorship of the Wikipedia article itself by current faculty and students who seem embarrassed by anything written about the school that is a little unconventional. A Bennington education used to mean something. It wasn't just another liberal arts college. JoppaFlats 17:03, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we can write about the college's history objectively, and help each other do that. The problems arise when comments about the past put down current students and faculty or imply that the college was once special and is not special anymore. Either implication isn't fair. LNealon 18:38, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bennington's Wikipedia entry doesn't need to be as "progressive" as the college itself. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">DClement</a> 18:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Because Bennington has twicehad a rupture with its past, for better or worse, it is important that this article represent both Bennington as it is and Bennington as it was. The ruptures were in 1969, when boys were admitted, and in 1992ish, when the current adminstration purged it of its faculty. Hence the need for respecting separate areas of the article. The "Bennington Girl" in fiction is important because Bennington played an important part in American culture in the 20th century as the one place that a certain kind of intellectual, artsy bohemian could get a great education. Now there are many such places. What purpose Bennington serves now is for current students and faculty to say. But it is objectively true that it was once a different place, that it was significant, and that truth must be allowed to stand. In addition, the role of an encyclopedia is to give history and background - again, the college as it is has its own Web site and marketing materials to present its current reality. (hofjude)</p>

<p>I've heard it repeated over and over again that Bob Dylan spent some time on campus and that the school owns the original copy of These Times They Are A-Changin' (do I have that right?) because he submitted it to some sort of publication. I wouldn't even know where to go about confirming something like this, but it might something worth mentioning if it's true. --Jonmedeiros 17:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe this is a canard. I was there in 1968-72, and it was never a rumor then, at a time when it would have been in the recent past. On the other hand, among those who did hang around trying to pick up girls was Tuli Kupferberg, another Village figure from the 1950s and 1960s and a founding member of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fugs_b323.html" title="The Fugs">The Fugs</a>.<a href="../../../h/o/f/User%7EHofjude_a121.html" title="User:Hofjude">Hofjude</a> 21:47, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>added this "It should be noted that there significant controversy over both US News Magazine's rankings and college ranking in general." I feel like if someone is insisting on including the US News rankings there should probably be an acknowledgement of the controversy over their rankings/college rankings. --Jonmedeiros 22:04, 29 May 2006 (UTC) (forgot to sign before)</p>
<p>Good addition. I removed the arbitrary reference to other schools. The Symposium report is available on the Bennington website for anyone to read. Could we include a link to the symposium report after the sentence "changes under the board of trustees improved the financial picture but..."? I would add it, but I don't know how to link other sites. KikiG 18:26, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that the Symposium report should be linked but also don't know how and don't have the time to figure it out right now. Someone has added a link for what I have added, good idea. --Jonmedeiros 22:46, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone - probably from the admissions office - has made the false claim that Bennington is number 14 on the USNews list of liberal arts colleges. I suppose that's one way dealing with the problems of the US News rankings, but the fact is that it is number 91 - moved up from number 99 - well done, President Coleman!

<p>Does this section really need to be here? I feel like it's characteristic of a "yeah we're small but look how often we pop up" attitude. Maybe I'm wrong though.--Jonmedeiros 00:22, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it trivializes and downplays Bennington's signifigance. Would it make more sense on the Bennington people page? KikiG 18:27, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Plus there are a whole hell of a lot of Bennington pop culture things that pop up, not always having anything to do with females. It seems a bit selective to limit it, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't understand, though I remain certain that it really doesn't belong here or anywhere. --Jonmedeiros 22:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm going to be bold and take it out. It's just silly and will only get worse. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 06:31, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So, it's gone. I actually don't think that a section on the "Bennington Girl" would neccesarily be bad, but it would have to be a relative explanation of the "Bennington Girl" as a perenial pop culture reference and include citations. An ad hoc list is not a good idea. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 06:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the measurement was just total size, but if it was perhaps it should be looked at in relation to the size of the school. Obviously Marlboro would still have a larger endowment (as it has less students). I'm not sure about the size of the other schools, though I assume they are bigger. I feel as though looking at the size of the endowment / number of students makes much more sense, as the size of schools are vastly different. --Jonmedeiros 18:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Endowment dollars per student is an important point to consider. Even so, Bennington's endowment is far behind the national median for liberal arts schools (Mills College $177 million; Wellesley's over a billion; Reed $350 million; Hampshire $26 million.) The larger Bennington's endowment, the less the college will have to rely on tuition revenue and the more need-based aid the college will be able to award. Relative to many other schools, Bennington is "young"; its only been around for 75 years. The alumni population (the most likely population to support the college philanthropically) is also small. Bennington most likely recognizes that strengthening the endowment should be an institutional priority, hence the mentioned "large fundraising campaigns." KikiG 00:36, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm removing the new "pop culture" section. See above discussion. "Igby Goes Down" probably doesn't belong here, and it certainly doesn't need it's own section. If the list is comprehensive it's out of place; if it's short it's trivial. Keep it out. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 01:05, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Question: is "Bennington College in Fiction" an appropriate section? I say yes. Why not "in film"? Because it's actually interesting to know that so many authors have fictionalized "Bennington College", and while it'a true that trivia to one person may be fascinating to another, we've already dealt with the consequences of including a pop-culture section: as long as "In Fiction" doesn't get out of hand ("on page 184 of so-and-sos book Bennington is mentioned"), it seems useful enough. Many Bennington Students have experienced the thrill of seeing their college mentioned in Harper's Magazine or a David Brooks book and resisted the urge to catalogue it on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 01:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll be the first to say that this article needs some work, but placing "citation needed" after every sentence is not the best way to fix it. <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDClement_c1af.html" title="User:DClement">Daly</a> 21:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
